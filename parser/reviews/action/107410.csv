												This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.That is what this game is about.			",249,20,13,19,28,2,20

												Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your♥♥♥♥♥depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)			",50,6,0,14,5,0,9

												My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever.We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.""SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!""he died after that.I criedand he respawned.11/10, would recommend getting.			",41,1,0,3,1,0,1

												I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D			",138,24,6,22,6,1,3

												Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.			",126,19,1,10,25,2,18

												This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time.One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.My new friend was dead.10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.			",48,10,0,7,8,0,4

That being said, i want to clairify something. People comenting about te price of my setup are both right and wrong. I have a dual 1440p setup. One monitor for arma and one for misc things. Arma is very cpu intensive, so I am running an i7 5820k @4.5Gz w/ water cooling, as well as a 980Ti and multiple SSDs in RAID 0. the 32 gigs of DDR4 overkill, but i got it on sale, so why not. This is to acheive a minimum of 60fps Ultra  (1440p) at all times, even in multiplayer. This game is beutiful, realistic, and has endless possibilities to explore, so why dont you give it a shot!

												I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

												Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield. The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.			",193,17,10,22,16,0,39

												If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.

												Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator  and  a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I start with Arma 3... 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game.  What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements.  Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else: - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you. - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening. - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning. - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success.  - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248"" - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you. - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means... - Every life counts. The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city, ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted. I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.  So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him.  Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead. My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.  They grenade him. Dead. Wish I'd have thought of that sooner.  The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere. At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire. ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!"" The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory. And I left the game after that. I cannot recommend this game enough.			",20,2,0,11,7,0,12

												Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here’s me trying it anyway.The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I’ve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.What you don’t get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you’re in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you’re sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn’t the game you’re looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign – those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don’t expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before – the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I’d certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I’m not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game about 90 hours which is more than any of my friends at the moment. Can't really compare it to any other game. Arma is just Arma, period. xDIf you haven't played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles, but no, not really.Most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out. Then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds. Repeat.Playing this game requires strategic thinking - you can't just take gun and take enemy out, no, it doesn't work that way.This game features two maps: big and huge, including towns, forests, mountains, flat fields and graaaas grass grass. Yeah, i love grass in this game - looks fantastic. xDSo... Where was i? oh, right, the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles, civilian vehicles, helicopters or planes... You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods. Repeat.Anyway, this is nice game(yet you need some great rig to run it) with limitless editor and mod support. Best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends. Team Work is necessary.Pros:+Limitless warfare simulator+Graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time+in-game editor allows you to create your own missions+Steam workshop support: download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles.+It's not CoD+It's not BF4 either+Bugs are funCons:-It's probably boring for players from other shooter games-Limitless CPU usage: your cpu will cry like a вitсh during the 100 vs. 100 battle with tanks and helis.-Graphics doesn't look beautiful 20% of the time.-Not so big default weapon arsenal(but there are mods, hey)-Multiplayer performance sucks sausage-Campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in Arma 2-Bugs are still bugs even if they're fun-AI has IQ equal to chair. Or maybe table. P.S. Did you really read it all? Lol.If you consider yourself as a ""hardcore fps shooter player and cod is for kids bla bla bla"" - try arma, waste your time, enjoy true hardcore.P.P.S. I was really bored so i wrote all this. Don't blame me, please.			",576,173,29,96,74,8,98

 Arma 3 Review  Summary Arma 3 is a tactical FPS military sandbox produced by Bohemia Intreactive. Before I go on I must say that Arma 3 is hands down my favourite game and hopefully will be yours to as it provides endless hours of fun! Pros & Cons   Pros    - Endless Hours Due To Mission Making Or Zues  - Tactical Military Experince You Won't Find In Other Games  - If The Vanilla Game Is Not Enough You Can Mod Arma 3 To Get A New Or Even A More Challenging Experience  - A More Or Less Friendly Community  - If The Hardcore Military Experience Gets Too Much There Is Multiple Gamemodes That Are A Lot More Casual  - This Game Gets Frequent Updates And Has 5 DLC's For The Game   Cons   - FPS Shutters & Drops May Occur Depending On Your PC Specs (Especially With Mods)  - Not A Lot But A Few Major Bugs (Leads To Some Pretty Hilarious Moments Sometimes) The First Steps Of Arma 3 Okay this part of the review is aimed at people who have just obtained the game and how they should take thier first steps towards this wonderful game! The first thing you should play is the Prologue and then the Campaign which provide a lot of entertainment and knowledge on the game. After this take a look at the showcases which go more in depth on specific roles such as Crewman, Pilot, Marksmen and also provide some knowlege on certain scenarios. Now your probably safe to go play Multiplayer where there is tons of gamemodes PVP and Coop, such as King Of The Hill (PVP) and Invade & Annex (Coop) which are only 2 of many gamemods in Arma 3. Some Tips For The Campaign  - The Most Important Of These Hints Is Take Your Time - When Engaged Seek Cover - Conserve Ammo - Use Gernades ...

 Gameplay = 10/10 - This is why Arma 3 is my favorite game of all times. The gameplay is unique and realistic. You can actually feel the realism when you play, especially mixed with the awesome community. Controls = 10/10 - There are a lot of different combinations of controls. Advanced stances for peeking is a great feature that I hope more games will have in the future. Mod-creators can also have their own controls added very easily. I have yet to see a game with these many control functions.AI = 4/10 - Sometimes the AI is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up and this is something the devs need to improve! Especially when you are inside forests and such, where they shoot you through bushes etc. Graphics = 8/10 - Good graphics, though watch out for FPS drops! Details = 6/10 - No furniture in buildings and other stuff, which makes the game feel empty. But the outside (which you mostly play in) has alot of rocks and bushes that can actually save your life in some severe situations. Though mission makers can add stuff in the Scenario Editor.Replayability = 9/10 -  There are a lot of things to do, from diving onto land and then sneaking around a guerilla camp, to using advanced high-tech mortars together with armored vehicles assaulting a large fortified base. If you combine these things (Combined Arms) you can have some really epic missions. Music = 9/10 - Also I love the soundtrack, it's just pure epicness. Sound = 8/10 - Since the Marksmen platform update got released, the sound got a huge upgrade. The gunfire does different echoes/sounds depending on environment and distance. The guns also sound even more realistic. Glitchfree = 5/10 - The game has alot of glitches and stuff like that, but sometimes it's just hilarious and doesn't affect gameplay that much. Luckily it's not as bad as DayZ. Community = 10/10 - AMAZING COMMUNITY, even the russians stick to their own servers. Though there are some veerry rare occasions of hackers. Also a huge amount of community-mods to use! Probably the most mature community in a game I've found. Developers = 8/10 - At the start of Arma 3 alot of people were saying it was unfinished and they only added expensive DLC (But it looks like they forgot the free platform update!!). Back in Arma 2 the DLC was very worth it and full of new stuff to play with. Recently, the developers announced their secret project which is a whole new terrain located at an Island in South America! There are a lot of new features such as Jetskis and Airplanes which I'm looking forward to! They've updated the Anti-Hacker protection A.K.A Battleye for increased protection, and since then I haven't encountered any hackers. Story = 6/10 - I don't really know about this. It's not really explained that much and you have to make up the theories yourself. No clear explanation whatsoever. Length = Long - I think the campaign is about 25 hours long...Optimization = 9/10 - There is alot of optimization, you can even switch colors of the teams.Performance = 4/10 - The frame drops, the thing everyone talks about. The problem is that it mostly depends on the server which FPS you get, not what type of PC you have. Singleplayer works fine, and so does local servers. As long as you have a good server there shouldn't be too much trouble.Not too many crashes. DLC = Medium - There are 3 DLCs at the moment, some people think it's way to expensive (13.99 € for 2 Helicopters!?), but they always put A LOT of effort into them, and a platform update also gets released for free.UPDATE: The release of Tanoa in 2016 looks like a very good DLC. Looking forward to it.---------- FINAL RESULT = 96/100 ",162,34,2,11,9,2,11

												Arma 3 base game:                        Good military simulation with a need for tactics and good comunication to achieve a objective.                      Great vehicle gamplay where people can become experts in different roles such as driving or flying.                      Overall the base game is the cover for the real experience of the modded game.Arma 3 modded game:                       Mental.CAUTION: THIS GAME MAKES 1.5K HOURS FEEL LIKE 1 AND A HALF.

												You remember playing army with your friends when you were kids? This game simulates everything that was going though your head at the time and then some. If video games were alcohol, Arma 3 would be the finest wine money could buy, but video games aren't booze, and can be further refined over time- and this one has gotten to the point where I just can't play anything else that involves shooting. Would recommend to my own mother.			",39,0,0,2,4,0,2

												With 70 hours, I can safely say this game is definetly worth the money. It caters to all types of players. Casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as Wasteland and King of the Hill. Roleplaying players have Stratis and Altis life, and tactical players can find servers with Coop and Team vs Team missions as well as tactical groups that play the game in a very realistic manner. Besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources. Feel free to do your own research, check out the Zeus game mode, as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi. tl;dr Game is awesome, very moddable, hours of gameplay.Edit: Just to update the review, now with a lot more hours and proper tactical gaming experience behind me, I can say I rediscovered arma completely. In my first mission I didn't even fire the gun and it was more fun than most of the stuff I have played before. Now, this type of ""tactical"" gameplay might not suit everyone so if you feel like it, give it a shot, if not, go back to the rest of the fun stuff.			",28,3,1,2,5,0,1

												Bohemia Interactive. Arma 3.This review is going to be fairly short, however this is one for the people who actually read reviews. So, after 3 years after this game coming out, and me putting in way more than 4000 hours (Offline hours included) I think I can make a very safe judgement of this game. This paragraph will be a base of the game, and below it will be a list for both Positives and Negatives. So do please read on.Arma 3 allows you to take a Canvas and paint anything, or if you want to focus on just playing, it's like a park, but think of it as a never ending park, there is always new rides etc. There is constantly new content coming out daily for the Arma 3, majority of it being from the Community, however BI (Bohemia Interactive) Do actually do alot of (Good .. ish) Updates themselves. Whether it's a huge graphic update or sound update which were both fairly recent, or a small bug fix / weapon change update, they do updates, they still supoort this game 100%. That point is proven by the fact that they have a ton on great (Cheap) DLC, which really delves into everything, and they also have more planned all the way up to mid 2018. Essentially, I have never had a boring day in Arma 3 because if you get bored of one thing there is always something else.Let's get onto the lists.Positives :- Graphically Stunning- Unlimited Replayability- Amazing Dedication To Updates ETC- Amazing Community Content Wise- Fairly Easy To Run- One Of The Best Games For Making New Friends- Amazing Landscapes (Literally 100's Of Maps)- Great Vanilla Content (Even Without Mods, There's A Ton Of, Weapons, Vehicles, Uniforms, ETC)- Story Line (Although It's Fairly Weak, It's Still A Ton Of Fun To Play)- 100's Of GamemodesNegatives :- Not Optimized Too Good (However Is Easy To Run- Some Of The Community Is Toxic (More The RP Side Of Arma)- Stolen Content (Arma 3 Life Servers, Are The Worst For This)- It's Fairly Difficult For New Players (However This Is Also A Good Thing)- A Big Library Of Bugs (Not To Many Are Ground Breaking, But There Are Some)- It's Addictive .... Very (I Failed School Because I Missed 3 Weeks Near Exams To Work On Mods .. My Fault lol )So there we have it, my fairly in-depth but brief Arma 3 Review.I also run an Arma 3 Realism Unit.

												So..you're here to possibly buy Arma 3..I was in that position before, I just bought it when it was 50% off.Here's a checklist for you:Do you like Call of Duty?Can you 360 no scope in CoD?Do you like 9 year olds screaming on the mic?If you answered yes to those then this game is NOT for you.Do you like CS:GO?Are you a pro AWPer in CS:GO?Well if you answered yes this game will rip you apart and you will be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniper.Do you like simulators?Do you like military games?Are you up for the challenge?Do you want an alternative to joining the military in real life?Do you have at least $30?If so, then you are ready for this challenge.--------------Pros:MASSIVE REALISTIC COMBAT servers with 100+ peopleFew 'squeakers' on micsSteam WorkshopMany players still today.Single player ModesTutorials, and all kinds of training for practice.---------------------Cons:$60 pricey, but worth more than any call of duty game.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI - It's ok, playable.Lag - This game is apparently heavily dependent on CPU in huge multiplayer games your fps can drop from over 9000 to 20 in a matter of seconds.GlitchesBugsWhen people shoot from far away it sounds like BB guns.Trolls in multiplayer - they can steal your helicopters and♥♥♥♥♥♥you buy or just be a pilot and kamikazi with you in it.Doesn't come with cookies.

												Received this game as a gift from a friend who really wanted to play Arma life with me and I obliged. Loved it at first until I started to notice the community was full of♥♥♥♥♥♥and can't get over the fact that some girls like to play the same games guys do. People harassed me calling me transgender or a 12 year old puberescent boy, all because I am a chick on a PC trying to play a military simulator. They use their degrading commentary to take me down and it's irritating, especially when I'm trying to communicate over voice where enemies are located, what the objective is and basic teamwork skills. As soon as I speak into that mic I get awkward comments like""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥are you a 'grill'?!""(girl), and someone tends to jump in and start degrading me saying things like ""she's probably a transgender or a 12 year old boy""Conclusion is.. I recommend this game. It's awesome. It's competitive. It's extremely addicting. If you like all these things in a game, this is a must have. Downside is, it's just not very female player friendly. If you're a chick into military simulator games, purchase and play this game in caution and be aware that you WILL get targeted and harassed and bullied for having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",8,1,0,0,2,0,0

But it's still some things that needs fixing. If you are into Military Simulation, PVP, Roleplay etc. this game is for you! But Arma III is a game where you can make everything possible! For Example Aftermath Rush - Battlefield in Arma III, And as i've said i have played this from December 2013 and i DO NOT regret buying arma at all!

												I thought I would put this out there during the Christmas sale.You have no better time than now to buy this game. For the price of the Apex expansion alone, you can get Arma 3, Apex expansion, and the DLC bundle. $70 worth of content for $35. From the 3 hours I have played, it is worth it.If you're considering Arma 3, definitely consider it NOW during the sale.I'll write a proper review of this game once I put in a few more hours. I've only experienced single player so far.			",265,40,12,27,14,2,32

												While the animations, graphics, lighting, and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the ARMA series, I miss the ARMA 2's setting, units, and mods.  ARMA 3's ""future-istic"" setting doesn't make sense, and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd.  While I appreciate the new vehicles such as the MRAP ""Hunter"" or the newly updated ""Ghosthawk"" (Blackhawk), or any of that sort of updated feel.  I'm not saying change is a bad thing, I'm just saying sometimes too much change isn't.A great addition to the ARMA series, was the much requested ""stances"" available to you during the game.  Whether it's leaning from standing, crouching, or even laying on your side in the prone position, it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks, windows, and walls that you're either too short or too tall for.  There are 3 standing stances, 3 crouching stances, a sitting position, and a prone position.  Every stance except for sitting, allows you to step out to the side, or lean around cover.  From the prone, you can peak a corner, or lay on your side.  This vastly improves over ARMA 2's restricted movement.  It would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls, or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well, but that's just wishful thinking.  Another thing I noticed, is the sound of the weapons.  A lot of the weapons have similar sounds, which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you're getting into.  While some of the sounds such as explosions, vehicles, and other small ambient additions are nice, I feel like I'm often confused and lost with the sounds.  Hopefully, a good soundmod will fix this later down the road.AI. . . AI. . .AI. . .   One thing the ARMA series hasn't been able to nail down, is the AI's movement, pathing, communication, and skills.  I realize that it's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this, where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective, or how, but often you'll either find your allies falling behind, running out of formation for a second, or asking ""Where are you"" after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves.  It would be nice to see AI being able to figure out things based on other AI, and not almost strictly from you.  Combat awareness.  Something I noticed in ARMA, is that no matter what situation, the AI in combat are lacking, whether an enemy soldier, or a friendly, you'll notice them not finding cover, running into the middle of a street, or from behind cover out into the open.  On one of my first ""showcase"" missions, I was instructed by my AI squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover.  ""Neat"" I thought.  He then gave me an area to suppress, as I was an automatic rifleman.  I began laying fire down from my position, my own squad leader walked next to me, and as he gave an order, ran right in front of me, bushing me back, and causing a bullet to hit him in the head, resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing.  Note, the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second, leaving me no time to react.  Their aim isn't that great either.  You could be standing across a room and they won't be able to hit you, or they'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of-guard yet, not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it.  Now, this goes both ways.  To combat them being ""too easy"", you could set the dificulty to Expert of Veteran.  The problem with this, is that the change is too extreme.  Setting your game to the highest difficulty, results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily.  You could be concealed at night in a bush, and taking you out.  That, or you'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley.  My advice?   Find some friends or a group to join, disable AI teammates for the mission, and only play with a team made up of human players, 9 times out of 10, you'll be able to accurately cover teammates, move together in a more realistic and effective way, and it will increase your expierence 10-fold.  Here's an example of the Helo AI in this game.

Another weird problem you may notice, is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer.  You may or many not have issues, and to top it off, it's really sporatic and without a known cause.  In singleplayer however, this is not the case, and the game runs a lot smoother.  and it is quite confusing, and frustrating when trying to set your settings.  Here's an example.  You go to singleplayer, and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering.  The game looks great, and you're real happy with it.  Now your friend hops on, or you want to go play on a server.  You select one with the best player/ping ratio, and join it.  You notice right away your frames are a lot worse, and you sit the tinkering with your settings again, mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game.  Not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game, but when you join back to singleplayer, the game looks worse, and you either have to deal with the settings again, or get stuck with lower graphics.  Now, changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either, so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration.   Overall: If you're a fan of the ARMA series, or any realistic shooter, I'd go for ARMA 3.  While I still play ARMA 2 more, ARMA 3 offers enough change when I get tired of the former.  Improved graphics and lighting, vehicle handling, weapon handling, and the use of different combat ""stances"", really improves over ARMA 2's static and prohibited movement.  While you won't be in the deserts of Takistan, or going through the dense city of Zargabad, the Islands of Stratis and Altis, are sure to give you the variety and fun you'd want.  While the AI isn't improved much, some of the futuristic units, and factions don't fit well, and the sounds can tend to be confusing, ARMA 3 is definitely a step in the right direction, and a giant leap towards success.

												I rarely rate a game this high, but this one is a perfect 10/10for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that isavailable to the public and priced under $10000Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic,there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc.However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspectsof a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as""Operation Flashpoint 1985"".OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and theArma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developersthat created OPF1985.With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor,mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to thoseof us who enjoy these type of games.If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in themilitary and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars.But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually trainwith for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC,then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.

Listen this game makes me wonder if their will ever be a better game than this.The fact that its a military sandbox gives you the choice to do whatever the hell you wantat no expense theres so many things you can do on one server, Wanna become a rebel on a Altis life server or be the opposite and become a police officer and be abusive or just live your life as a civi, Wanna do what arma was designed for and fight against your friends becomes that one guy thinks he can shoot better than you because hes a different race than you but then you own his *** THEN DO IT wanna fight zombies? Dont worry! We got Arma Exile and Epoch. Too lazy to install that? drop all your equipment and drop into the battle and GO IN HELPLESS. Do you want to race your friend to prove whos the better driver? Do it! I did it. Wanna take a walk whilst listening to music? ok sounds wierd but ok do it.Me and my friend have loved this game forever no matter how many fights we have no matter how many times he triggers me by driving our tank RIGHT INTO THE ENEMY TOWN AND GETTING US KILLED. we pretty much did all of those things above IN 1 SERVER JUST ONE thats right one the server we play on is Invade and annex reccomended by a youtuber and we still play it today.*Actual Review*-Pretty nice graphics-If you have a potato pc you will not survive-potato gunsounds *easily fixed by installing a soundmod I reccomend JSRS4*-Like I said hardware intensive-fun-prepare to yell at your friend-prepare to beat his ***-prepare to die-enjoy!10/10 would trigger him again ",58,6,1,2,16,0,7

												There's more to the ugly business of war than shooting people.Real war is about communication, cooperation, patience and logistics. There are very few games that show how real military organizations handle objectives, and honestly, Arma 3 is the best way of giving atleast a glimpse of how a real military operation may be broken down and solved.I've got to say though, Arma is not a simulator. Not at all. This game does absolutely give you a more realistic view of what real firefights are like, I.E ""You can't see anything and nothing makes sense"", but it is not a sim overall.Getting arma'd is a common phrase for the otherwise great VR engine (Mostly Havok actually) ruining any house of cards you try and set up. The AI isn't too great either, and normally needs a person to keep them on a leash to get the best out of them.But like most truly amazing games, the true magic is what you can do with it. Mods. It's a platform. Like an M16A4, it comes into it's own when you stick stuff on the picatinny rails. If you can think of any major military commitment in the last 100 years, you can probably recreate it in this game.Everything from WW2 dogfights, navy SEALs in 'Nam black ops, firefights in the hamlets of Serbia, cold war submarine stuff, right up to full on flag waving desert storm and street fights in fallujah. After watching a war documentary, you can probably find the exact gun and tank someone talked about in it right down to weird sub-versions, then run around doing war like stuff with them. The community for that stuff is remarkable.And you really can go from far above the clouds to the bottom of the sea seamlessly, on detailed maps that often extend many kilometres in each direction. Tanks, cars, trucks, MRAPs, IFVs, APCs, fighter jets, transport planes, submarines, boats, all fully functional and often lovingly detailed. If you like equipment, this is perfect if you're ok with modding.Same is true for infantry gear. If you like a good gun, how does a few hundred sound?Performance is infamously poor, but it's perhaps not surprising considering the sheer complexity of it all. Quality of life updates from Bohemia do come out, and it's surprising how different the game feels since release,Buying this game does give you access to an insane amount of content and games-within-games (zombie stuff too!), but for the actual game right out of the box, it's still pretty good, especially with the Apex expansion which is wonderful.Online community is especially good too, with even a few real serving military people. It's all very mature but friendly. If you're even mildly interested in the military, this is a truly great game. It's not as intimidating as it sounds.			",136,23,5,10,14,1,14

												Every once in a while there comes a game that strikes me, and makes me think if it's even possible for a game like this to exist.Just like Oblivion and Skyrim did when they came out and I was used to playing corridor based games and knowing what to expect.Or Metal Gear Solid where you can do everything you can think of, not being restrained by game mechanics.Arma is not a game in the classical term. It is a massive military sandbox. Meaning that your experience is determined by your ability and creativity. Lack of this ability can quickly turn any sandbox into a boring walking simulator ruining your fun.Every new idea can turn arma into a completely new game that you need to learn.A good example of this is Dayz. A mod that became popular and evolved into a standalone game.It has one of the the largest and most dedicated modding communities.You will soon realise that every knowledge you acquired in real life you can use in arma and vice versa.This game changed my way of thinking and made me learn topographic map navigation, celestial navigation, use of compass, bearing, pace counting, ballistics and many other things.Again, any of these skills you can quickly test in Arma and learn from your mistakes.Arma can easily replace many other games, because it feels like many games are contained inside Arma.Tank sim, helicopter flight sim, casual airplane flight sim, you will have second thoughts about buying other games once you played Arma. Or even find that Arma has ruined many other games for you.A word of warning:Be prepared to learn. Learning curve is very steep, especially if you have never played sim games, altho arma is more a game than a sim it is a sim none the less.The Controls are complex, be prepared to memorise and customise your whole keyboard.The game engine suffers from some bottlenecks that are being worked on.There is a lot of calculation going on beneath what you see, and you will not have 60 fps online.This is not battlefield/CoD. You can compare it by theme, but not by genre.If something goes wrong 90% its your fault.If you are easily frustrated again it's your fault.New player starting a new game? Change AI in difficulty options to 35or less. You can always buff them later.All in all Arma is one of the best games I have ever played. ",87,2,2,1,7,0,2

												I've owned and played every single Operation Flashpoint, Arma and all their spin off's, and this one is sheer perfection!  Pro's-Insane level of Graphical realism at all levels.  Such as terrain, textures, facial animation, destruction of enviroment...right up to bots that look all too human.  -Very forgiving game system that allows players with out of date gaming rigs to still be able to play.-The most realistic shooting system bar none!  Employ the Ace 3 Workshop mod and be the sniper.  The kit includes everything the modern military sniper has in his kit.  Such as wind direction compass, ballistic charts, and this all comes into play with true real world ballistics.  Buildings come down, certain cover doesn't provide cover.  Bullets go through multiple people.  With mods in play it gets very bloody.  -Unlimited number of workshop items, maps, scenarios, servers etc already out there and tons more coming.  -The best, most real online gaming experience.  -A full sandbox mode that is so good that I have not been playing anything else but Arma 3 for months.  Pretty much expect to see me living in this game in my spare time.  This is the best game I've ever played!!!!-Thousands of weapons, vehicles, attachments, bot types, nationalities etc.  EPIC!!!-Gigantic, fully sandboxable maps that stretch miles upon miles in all directions.  There must be 100 maps.  I have at least 60 dowloaded and that I am playing with already.-ISIS, Taliban and other scumbagery to put hot lead into.  Buckle up soldier...you have tea bagging to do!!-Here is the biggest one of all.  The mods in the workshop, that are totally free, give you every single mission and map...from all the other Arma's and Operation Flashpoints.  So if you liked the Arma Gold Edition and loved playing with the vehicles and different units, then Tada....SURPRISE, there in here too!  So own one Arma, and own them all if you have 3 and the Mods.  Just check out the mods I subscribed to and go nuts.  I am!-Stupid hillarity.  When you see the first guys reaction after you smoke the guy he is healing.  Make sure you have the Bloodlust Mod and The Head Popper Mod on.  :)  -This is a crazy one.  WWII units!!!!  Yes,  you can have ISIS taking on an SS Panzer Division if you wish.   One decision?  Which scum bag to play as?  There are several mods that bring WWII units, tanks, and aircraft to the game and WOW, does it make this a game and a half to own.  4 words, Moisin Nagant sniper rifle.  Nuff said!-There are too many positives to go on about.  The game is everything I ever wanted in a first person shooter.  10/10!!!!Cons-You down own it yet and are stuck reading this.  Go buy it you cheap bugger!  :P-Very few.-Still thinking....-Stop PRESSING ME!!!-Ok, a few things.  Load times are long.-The servers are filled with gaming Gods.  -Some mods will get you Vac banned, so turn off the ones that apply to getting you banned.  Their pretty darned obvious and it's simple enough to do with turn off all mods button.  Then just click on the few that are allowed on servers.  No biggie.  -Some mods have issues with other mods, so it's like Skyrim.  So expect a few crashes here and there as you figure out what works with what.  However with me having over 150 mods in play at once, I'd say this is beyond minor.  You are looking for gripes right?  I don't have many.  So in the end I am going to say this is the FPS you always wanted.  If you didn't know you wanted it and you are a gun nut, a blood thirsty nut, and overall fan of seeing heads coming off at the seams, then luck be a lady tonight...this is your game!!!

Arma 3 - The greatest mod platform for MilSim and Roleplaying.And I'm not even lying about the header.Features:+++ Best mod platform on ArmA series so far.+++ Community Driven DLCs and MODs.++ Good all-around game focused on infantry shooting.++ Devs update the game constantly based on feedback.- Few old ArmA bugs.Arma 3, from Bohemia Interactive developer of Armed Assault, Arma 2, Operation Flashpoint and Dayz, has arguably the best gaming experience I have on steam.Apart from default content which is being developed with the community since the alpha versions and still being guided by those who buy the game, the community itself is self sustaining, with mods, missions, scripts, addons, full conversions and whatever your imagination can bring to you.For Military Simulation.Arma 3 veteran fanbase is hardcore on Milsim, which carries on from the first armed assault game, a sort of military simulation, but a game, not fully realistic.What the community brings is exactly how much realism you want.Want to simulate injuries and pain during a firefight?Want to simulate fatigue and vehicles in a war?Want to test your strategy and communication skills?Everything is provided by the community.For Role Players.The mod community has some of the best roleplaying missions and addons I've seen so far, from petty smugglers to prestigious governors, roleplaying and surviving are definely the new possibilities that Arma 3 offers as far as fun goes, interacting with other players while excercising your creativity and your inner actor/actress is a powerful tool for all ages and minds. Ever wanted to be a cop? Would you abuse of your power?What about being a criminal and causing havoc among citizens?These are but few among the roads you can take in your path of roleplaying.Strategic Action.Zeus in Arma 3 is another feature of innovation by Bohemia Interactive.As a game master, you are able to create missions and objectives on-the-go for your fellow teammates.Guide them to victory or challenge their skills.Create training missions edit whatever feature you would like in the game world.For an immortal being, creation and destruction are but just another day in the office.

												ARMA 3 Multiplayer review 10/10So my first day on ARMA<3 3. I was born. I rolled out the spawn point. Before I even got out spawn the was a hive of activity from people running around shouting profanities in ever language you can think of. From the kid running down the road after his car that been robbed by three guys who are now flipping the kid the middle finger as the kids is chasing them down the road shouting in his high pitched voice “ GIVE ME MY CAR BACK YOU F&%$%”. Then the is that guy all geared up looking like he just came from a game off battlefield 4 who is selling his expert military killing skills to you for a one time low price “ protection to hits all under ones roof, you a fresh you should hire me I would give ya some tips” he shouts in a menacing voice at you.Don’t forget the fresh spawns running around trolling people, lying in front of their cars stopping them from driving off, to the five guys surrounding the only cop in the place shouting at the top of their voice’s “ we are protesting against the police force you are corrupt”I could hardly take it all in when a Dutch guy walks up to me and says “hi dude how are you?” I replied “im cool just looking to get $hit rolling, you know?” the Dutch guy say to me in a very mellow voice, very very mellow voice “ yar come with me brudda I got two friends we going to make some money you wan in?”Without a thought I now found myself in a car with three guys who are all not talking even when I ask them where we going. we head down the road at speed, before long we are in a field with the guys now out the car pointing guns at me all shouting at the top of the voices “get out the F$£%% car now!” intermediated and curious at the same time I get out the car. To find one of them smashing me over the head with his pistol in a rocky balboa of a swing witch sends me crashing to the floor. Now the three bandits have me on the floor and are now proceeding to hit me over and over again to keep me there, they ask me for one million dollars. I laugh at them and tell them im fresh to this hold thing I have no money. They chat around to around for a minute then they tell me that I have wasted there time and im going to have to pay… They then opened fire on me and I was killed. Spawn back in where the guy with the menacing voice runs up to me and says “don’t get in cars with strangers, that one is on the house” as he walks off in to the long dusty road of Role Play.I ended up making a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of friends on the sever, it was great Altis life. Joined a clan steam rolled through the clan and became warlords in our own rights. Zeus the clan ran the sever we had our fat fingers in all the pies. Not a lot ♥♥♥♥ed with us but if they did we would pull such a force together with ours members and our allies, no one could escape. Robbing banks, robbing players homes, robbing players, taking hostages for ransom if no pay out shot the ♥♥♥♥er and make a carpet out of him, drug dealing, drug farming, drug taking knocking off drug dealers and farmers the lot. It was like my very own Scarface.               Military Simulator GameARAM<3 Is an awesome game, brilliant combat simulation with breathtaking graphics and terrain. The standard maps are based on two real islands in the Mediterranean sea in Greece. The maps are identical to the real islands. The game developers went to that much length to map the terrain that they got arrested by the Greek authorities for spying, that’s commitment. The Incredible scale of Altis the main island is over 270 kilometers, it has 730klm of road linking 50 towns, villages, and cities. Accurate star map for navigation. The islands have five unique factions, NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA and the civilians each have their own motives and vehicles. Over 15 stances, now remember your keys you don’t want to get stuck in one of them. The moding is great on this the are tones of mods out there for you where its game type to gun grips and that AK47 you always wanted. The multiplayer and the moding community work well together. But I find the game modes and vanilla content good as well. Breaking point and arma life, wasteland chernus (cherno map for arma2 dayz mod) are but a couple of mods you should check out. The list goes on.The is so much i could say more about this game but that list goes on too. I give this the best marks i can.			",115,20,2,16,34,1,15

Product received for free
												This was my Christmas gift from my best friend on steam, And we had both hell of alot of fun at it. Made new friends while playing it, and learned alot more about Military tactics and procedures. Pros:Full real sized open world map of a real greek island.Ultra Realistic combatAlways something for every Military junkie like myself.Challenging yet well laid out singleplayer campaign.Use of any kind of vehicle available rangung from Quads to Jets.Use of any role that fits you. Fun multiplayer modes, Co-Op or PvP Active modding community. Cons: You need a beast♥♥♥♥♥PC to get the full expierience and a stable internet connection. Hard to see the enemy, but the same goes for real life. YOU WILL DIE If you are not carefull and use tactics against your enemy, If they have the upperhand on you, you won't live to tell the tale. Overall despite that you need a beast pc to play, And some friends to get the real fun out of it. It's totally still a must have for any tactical military milsim players!10/10 - ""Would play again"" ",102,6,2,6,12,2,8

												I was just cruisin down the street until I came across some russians broken on the side of the road, we couldn't unstderstand eachother and they had guns, Decided I would be nice, come to a complete stop, get in my passenger seat and say hop in... It took them a few seconds to realize my idea because we could not understand eachother at all, I taught them english for a few things on our adventures, They took me to get me a gun, we went to the bank and robbed it, we did drugs, we even killed the police cheif after holding him hostage for 30 minutes. It was a great time, I have to say my favorite part of it all was I the fact they called me charlie and spoke a language I did not understand and I would guess what they wanted me to do until I got it correct, and when I taught them things like ""Shots Fired"" they used it to explain things like ""Shots fired Police Cheif Charlie"", And that meant ""Shoot the police cheif Charlie"" I hope one day we meet again 10/10 would take a adventure on a Russian server with the Russian mafia again.

												My mates and I grouped up on a Wasteland server. We gathered around each other and tried to teach our newest member how to play. He'd press a button, ask what it did, we'd explain etc. We where almost done when I heard him say ""Hey guys what does G do?"". I was aware of a clanking sound towards my feet. Then it all clicked in one hilarious moment and I shouted ""GREEEEENAAADDEEEEEEEEE!"" and dove towards the ground. Everyone else dove in various direcions except for one who dove on the grenade explaiming ""I'VE GOT IT!"". The only survivor was me and the lad who threw it so I spend a good minute patching  everyone up. So when teaching your mates to play, don't all stand in a circle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I knew what to expect going into Arma III from previous experience with Bohemia Interactive games, yet I was still overwhelmed by the amount of features I had to wrap my head around before I could play it with even moderate proficiency. It’s a first-person shooter alright, but it’s not another “left trigger to aim down the sights, right trigger to shoot” kind of game. You’re going to have to use almost every key on your keyboard, memorize specific key combinations and what each does depending on whether you’re on foot, in a tank, a helicopter, etc.I felt comically inept fumbling through my first few hours. With so many different firing modes, stances, movement speeds, and other options, I had difficulty just walking, drawing my weapon and firing, to say nothing of using my equipment, making sense of the map, and working with my squad. I had to wonder what my AI squadmates thought of me, the clueless rookie, stumbling into the bushes before I accidently pulverized myself with a satchel charge I didn’t even mean to deploy.To make matters even more difficult, in its current state Arma III doesn’t offer a real tutorial. Its Showcases (playable scenarios showing off its many features) follow a logical progression that introduce you to increasingly complicated mechanics. However, they each do a poor job of explaining how to use them or how they may be useful later on. The only real instruction comes in the form of on-screen hints that tell you which keys do what. It’s an inefficient method to teach you how to fly a helicopter, and practically useless when it comes to explaining the tactical value of more esoteric equipment and features.In one of the more interesting Showcases you are given access to a non-lethal aerial drone and an armed ground vehicle drone which you can use to eliminate targets in a nearby town. After much experimentation, I devised a tactic of sending my aerial drone ahead to scout and tag targets, which then allowed me to coordinate mortar fire and corner enemies in the town. It was satisfying because it allowed me come up with a strategy which felt entirely my own, and one which nearly no other shooter could accommodate. On the other hand, there was a needless amount of frustration along the way that could have been avoided with clearer UI and better instruction.ArmA III: Checking Out The New Content - Gamescom 2013ArmA III: Checking Out The New Content - Gamescom 201310:10As you can imagine, Arma III’s potentially much more enjoyable when you’re playing online with real people – especially those who already know how to play and can teach us its secrets. It doesn’t have a capped player limit, so in theory a server where 100 players are facing another 100 players in a gigantic sandbox where almost everything is possible is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played. But without investing long-term in a clan or other group that will ensure a reliable team of significant size, those are hard to come by. In practice, new players are presented with a list of servers half-full of random people who aren’t communicating, and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Since Arma III doesn’t offer obvious incentives for players to cooperate or even funnel them to the same areas of its enormous maps, multiplayer’s mostly uncurated chaos. It’s amusing in its own way, but something I would rather watch in a YouTube video than it play myself.Counterintuitively, smaller matches are more fun for a new player trying to find his way in this world. In one pick up co-op game, six fellow players and I (and a group of AI bots) were tasked with a simple mission: find a way off the island. We spawned at a random spot along the coast and were given two locations, miles away, where we could find a boat or a helicopter for extraction. We ended up not even making it halfway to either destination, but I enjoyed our journey quite a lot. We heard a gunship in the distance and dashed across a field to take cover in a forest. We stumbled upon and successfully seized an enemy outpost, where we commandeered a truck. We arrogantly tried repeating the same strategy with a larger town on our way to an airfield... and were caught in the open by snipers. This is what developers mean when they talk about emergent gameplay, and it’s where Arma III shines.			",105,16,0,3,11,0,3

												For anyone looking for more of a simulation experience rather than an arcade experience this could be the game for you. The maps are generally huge, larger than any other shooter. The game occasionally eats you, you experience FPS loss more than you do lag, There are various bugs that will annoy you always. Opfor's armor is complete bs, nothing is balanced. Its the only game I play. I hope this was helpful.			",8,1,0,1,1,0,0

												This game.....This GAME.Where do I start, I love the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game, been trying to achieve MLG at BI's series for a long time now. I've played the Arma series since I was rekkin kids on A2 from 600 on Utes with my Ruski tool, holding a base right in the middle for a few hours every day. It's a beautiful and engaging experience, that leaves you on the edge of your seat, sometimes wishing you were holding your Grandma's face to squeeze tight (till she dies)... Tactical decisions are important, using the terrain and engaging with the movement structure of your enemies is a thrilling experience, adrenaline pulses as bullets and rockets fly closeby. You will never have to remember parts of maps (minute detail), as the maps on this are so big that it allows you to use your brain, instead of arena shooters which don't challenge the psyche. Graphics - The original Arma  3 engine includes DX11 integration and standardised PhysX interactions, due to a new update recently the game has come to include Volumetric Lighting (big +), Upgraded textures (more vibrant), Water Refraction and a host of other improvements (60+ bug fixes - glaring bugs such as the offsight RPG Alamut Optic). The graphics second Terrain to Item models, however new improvements in the recent update have subsided these issues, Gear is of a signicantly high polycount as well as Vehicles. ISSUES: Now I'm sure most of us have had a bad experience of Arma FPS lag. And for a long time now, BI has been using the BS excuse ""It's mods."" Although partly true,  that is actually a lie. The way Arma simulates enemies, its peer to peer network structure, animation timers and no multi-threading support are the real reasons behind the terrible frames of Arma 3.This. Needs. To. Stop.Although too late for an A3 release, A4 must leave these issues behind.Gameplay - Arma 3 can be a deeply tactical and engaging game. Many complex systems entwine with each other to create as much of a realistic experience as possible, for example:- 27 Hit boxes on overall model (from head to toe)- Multiple ammo types (ballistics, AP, EPR, special purpose ((need mods for some)) - Multiple types of vests (explosive resistant, harnesses, body armour, fba)- Multiple attachments (flashlights, scopes, silencers, laserlights)- Unique damage system that many call BS but is actually indepth af for example: Armour actually takes stress under duress, which creates a deeper and more realistic feel to armour.- Your gun can deflect bullets- Bullet penetrationDifferent types of team play are offered in Arma 3. From 2 - 80ppl, if you wish to be in a large group, there is one out there for you. Expanded group finding features such as the Squad pages and things such as Side chat to hook up with like minded people. There are several clans of varying sizes such as mine, however there are some humungous clans for the more mil sim oriented. Now here's the real thing that makes this stand out from other shooters, I think this is a big thing: anyone can be good at this game. All it takes is knowledge and sensibility when dealing with the sort of situations Arma 3 can spawn. Such as:- Attacking a base of 14 people by yourself, watching as a chopper crash lands into the base, explosions and debris everywhere! Bodies and people flying to and fro..- Singing Beyonce down your mic to someone before running out and blasting their head off- Your first RPG heli kill- Your first 9.3 heli kill- Your first 7.62 heli kill- Your first 5.56 heli kil- you get the idea!- One 7.62 to get a double kill on a moving vehicle- Lagging- Dying by rocks- Lagging- Dying by terrain glitches-LaggingEverything from Capture the Flag to Zombie mods. A favourite of mine is Sa-Matra WS, a very good mod indeed! The varying game modes and the sandbox aspect of Arma 3 really engages the community and attracts newcomers! This game can be completely different dependent on which mod you play. However many of these can easily corrupt which leaves some users unable to resolve issues. GLARING ISSUE: Horrendous desync issues have plagued Arma 3 since its inception, these have prevented any serious types of eSports leagues. This is a detrimental experience to gameplay, and you will run into it constantly you will get killed by lag constantly and if you are okay with this buy the game, if not DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER. (Wait till Arma 4) Ergonomics - UI in Arma 3 has never been a problem with Bohemia taking a down-to-earth approach to UI design, clearcut menu's, expanded Map features such as markers, topography etc. Mod support has been vastly expanded with a server browser that is noob friendly, a launcher that highlights and patches missing files and full Steam Workshop support. This is a 10/10. Finally let me just sum up the experience you will get from this game. If you're looking for sophisticated group play, come to Arma, you'll find a group of weary game travellers such as yourself, who know there♥♥♥♥♥♥and can provide you with some irreplicable entertainment. Beware of lag and FPS issues, these are the two things hold this game back from a 9/10 or 10/10. It is my favourite game but it is still very imperfect. Final Verdict: 8/10 ",46,5,0,16,1,0,2

												It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the ""follower"" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to ""find cover"" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on ""Patrol"" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.

												Arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players. The many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series, while seasoned vets will feel right at home (for better or worse).  There is a great deal to learn about playing Arma in a way that is enjoyable. The default campaign mode is passable, with all the tropes you'd expect to find in a military shooter, with a few surprises here and there. Missions vary in length and scope, ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults. However, where the real meat is in the multiplayer experience and the many mods available. Hopping on to a co-op server with 60+ players who actually want to work together as a unit is nothing short of amazing in a world of ""le epic trelling"". Being able to request evac, mortar, medical assistance, etc is wonderous on it's own, but having those assets being controlled by actual players gives you a sense of connection and being part of a team. Even if realistic military games aren't your particular style, there are plenty of other game modes available that you can download right from the server browser and enjoy. These include standouts like Altis Life (kind of like a more advanced Cops and Robbers), Wasteland (a survival mod focused on factions), and Breaking Point ( A Day-Z style mod).Mods will breath all sorts of new life into your game, adding new vehicles, uniforms, maps and much much more, giving you almost limitless scenarios and tools to use in creating custom missions. you can check out the large database of mods at : http://www.armaholic.comThat said, Arma is not without it's fair number of faults and missteps, the game is not optimized well for multiplayer, and you'll encounter many bugs along the way (most of which are hilarious as opposed to annoying). The learning curve can be fairly steep, and you'll have to be patient to get the most fun out of this title...  that said, it's well worth it, especially if you have some friends willing to do the same.

												This game has potential and the tools for an amazing experience. I've had hundreds of unforgettable events playing this game with a group of people. Even after almost 1800 hours i still find this game very exciting. But your experience is truly dependent on the creativity of the mission creator and the people you play with..If you're willing to make effort finding a good group to play this game with you will certainly have an astounding experience.However some things you need to take in factor:You will need a need a rather good computer, especially a good CPU to run this game smoothly.Having a headset, or a seperate microphone is essential for communication.It may be difficult to find the right group for you, keep searching. Arma 3 Squads[forums.bistudio.com]This is not an easy game to get into, there are complex functions you may have never seen before. It will take you hundreds hours to master this game.This game is aimed towards a more mature crowd than your average shooter.This is a very mod friendly game, and some you may find difficult, but thankly we have things like steam workshop to make stuff more simple.Lastly, i just want to mention big appreciation to Bohemia Interactive for constantly improving this game, and to the group i play with Task Force Crusader for the astounding experiences.10/10 Make ArmA not War.

												This game ruined my life...It started out as just a fun little casual relationship, y'know, just ""oh i'll go on a multiplayer server and go play for a bit"" sort of typical gamer-game relationship. I saw there were no women wondering around... I wanted to fix it, y'know, quick fix, something to do, some options for people...That was three years ago. now I can't even go to the ♥♥♥♥ing shop without wondering how I would bloody model it and put it into this godforsaken game! it has latched onto my life like a zombie baby and is sucking all of the energy clean out of me, I can't sit and have a good play session without noticing a bug in something and trying to fix it. I now instintively open max and model when I turn the PC on, and everything I model makes its way into the game somehow, I'm in a group of modders and I swear they are a cult worshipping the Arma franchise, I can't stop myself, it's literally an addiction... I need help. Okay on the more serious side... this game is ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME... if, IF you are that strange masochistic type of person who loves near simulation levels of combat realism and marching across huge maps. I'm talking PURELY from the standpoint of an Arma 'purist' if you will, not a DayZ convert, not a lifer.Okay so the biggest pro of this game by far is the modding capability and the community, as a member of the modding community I can say just how much you can customize this game and make it your own breed of wicked software. every major aspect of the game can be changed and it's one of the biggest and best points of this game I can truly sing the praises of. You can add new islands, new characters and character assets, new weapons, new vehicles, new missions, new game modes, new interface aspects, you can add true to life elements such as radio comms, and ballistics. All through addon content, trust me, if you're like me and you are a sucker for variety the storage space taken up by the mods is about 4 times as much as the actual game does. The support Bohemia Interactive have for the modding community is fantastic, by far one of the most supportive developers of modders I know, providing a variety of tools and support to help you make addons, in fact in this most recent instalment they even take direct inspiration for extensions of the game from modders themselves, from interface elements like stamina indicators and Virtual Arsenal to actual designs of assets, such as the new ENVG in the APEX expansion. The Arma modding community is bustling with friendly helpful people ready to help you get a leg up if you're struggling. and that's hosted by Bohemia interactive themselves, not a third party. The DLC BI makes is very much an extra platform for mod makers as much as it is extra content for players, and they've made it so that these core engine features in the game are available to everyone, not just owners of the DLC, making it a much more fair and universal system.Other pros:The freedom you have within the game, it's not on rails and in corridors, it's a vast open environment, open world if you wanna call it that. if you wanna go halfway across the HUGE map to hit a target at the perfect angle you are free to do so. If you wanna kill one guy with a helicopter, and there's a helicopter available, then hot damn you can do that. if you wanna nuke the damn place, download a nuke mod/script and live out your sadistic fantasies of pressing that red button. ♥♥♥♥ i've found myself, before today, just putting a truck down in the editor and going for a drive around the island to kill some time rather than people, you can do that too, y'know, be a pacifist for the day. You wanna roll in first person? doneyou wanna roll in third person? done you wanna look around with your head and not your entire body? done.you wanna play as a guy with pink face paint? mod it, and done!wanna attach a machine gun to a rabbit? with some jigging in the editor, consider it done!Zeus lets you rationalise your god complex: and that is exactly why I love zeus game mode. someone in the server is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and i'm zeus they can see to it that they'll have a nice lightning bolt of 'shut the ♥♥♥♥ up' you can place down cars, planes, entire hordes of enemy troops for four guys to fight, and laugh meniacally as you watch them squeal. With recent updates, the visuals are now so much nicer, and things run a little smoother overall. APEX itself is a pro, like seriously, just for Tanoa, just buy it already. Cons: Multiplayer sometimes isn't fantastic, since the advent of DayZ and Arma Life, 9 year olds have found another game to disgrace the presence of, not fun, not saying i dislike those platforms, just the kids who ruin the good experience for the rest of us, especially when our hard work in the modding community is used and abused without permission.The game's performance isn't fantastic, BUT, BUT hear me out here, you can do A LOT about that the sheer number of options available to you ensure that in some degree you can get a good framerate. The sheer complexity of the engine means it needs quite a lot of CPU power, so bear that in mind. I've put my PC specs down at the bottom and I get fairly okay framerates on ultra high settings, you by no means need a £1000 PC for this game. It has a few quirky bugs like the AI with Xray vision and dying if you're lying prone on a rock, i find the latter happens rarely these days. It loads like a dead snail, it's my biggest gripe with the game, is how long it takes to load I HIGHLY recommend you install it to an SSD, it's much faster. You will LITERALLY not see the light of day if you get into modding this thing, it takes away your life. When you love this game like I do, you put its faults aside and just damn play it. my PC specs:AMD FX 8320E @3.2GhzAMD Radeon R9 380 Sapphire Nitro 4gb16GB RAMFor the record: modding this game gave me my first ever step into the games industry, so if you're serious about your♥♥♥♥♥♥ come to the dark side... TL;DR Buy this game if you want a tactical sandbox shooter that gives you so much freedom to do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want its unreal, and you have a half decent system and don't mind a few quirks here and there. Mod this game if you are serious about getting mad skills and a possible first step into the games industry if you refine it enough. Also mod this you want to literally go insanehelp me...

												Arma 3 from Bohemia Interactive is the latest in its military simulation series of games, which began with the original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. With Arma 3, both the visuals and gameplay have received major improvements and redesigns that result in a game that is far more polished and entertaining than previous entries in the series. Even more so than previous games in the series, Arma 3 is primarily a massive military simulation sandbox that only grew larger with the modding community.While either in the editor or during missions, players will be traversing the Aegean islands of Stratis and Altis of Greece, the latter of which is a massive 270 km² in size. New to the series, players will be able to navigate underwater environments using either submersible vehicles or diving in wetsuits. The list of weapons and vehicles available to players is rather difficult to grasp at first as the variety from everything from tanks and airplanes to machine guns and sniper rifles is outright extensive. As the game takes place during the mid-2030s, most vehicles and items are still recognizable in addition to the inclusion of in-development warfare technology that has yet to be deployed on current battlefields.Players new the Arma series can learn the basics through showcase levels that also highlight new gameplay features and graphical improvements to the engine. In addition, players can test their firearm skills in various shooting challenges that vary in type and difficulty. When finished training, players can then browse through the multiplayer lobby for online matches or delve into the continually-growing selection of community-created scenarios through the Steam Workshop. Players can create scenarios using the in-game editor while having access to all of the game's resources from vehicles to weapons. The process of downloading scenarios through the Steam Workshop only requires one click which in turn automatically downloads the new content.The game focuses heavily on infantry combat and that is where it shines. However, is does offer up an impressive number of vehicles with which to traverse the vast distances on offer and to wreak havoc onto your enemies. Everything from civilian hatchbacks to heavily armoured tanks to transport helicopters and unmanned drones can be used and there are no cosmetic vehicles to be found. Some areas have wrecks of cars lying around which obviously are of no use to you and it can be very frustrating to find yourself in the middle of nowhere, walk into a town in search of a car and find the whole place devoid of anything useful. The vehicles are also delightfully fragile, which is not only realistic, but serves to keep the infantry focused gameplay balanced. You won't be any safer flying around in a helicopter than you are running around on the ground as heat seeking missiles traverse the distance between you and the launcher very fast, so if your reflexes aren't good enough, you're going to lose your tail rotor, which will bring you down.There are more than enough weapons to keep you interested for a long time and the ability to customize them with a plethora of accessories is a nice touch which enables you to make your gun completely your own. Realistic ballistics and damage models make the game very engaging and disbelief is effortlessly suspended as the game world immerses you in a tactical combat simulator experience unlike any other.Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, as you progress, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.The Crysis series can move over for benchmark tests as Arma 3 is without doubts one of the best looking PC games of 2013. Nearly every aspect of the game's engine has improved dramatically which is evident in the extensive visuals menu with toggles and sliders for every modern graphical setting. Arma 3 requires the latest and greatest hardware to run everything the game has to offer on maximum settings. Fortunately, the game's various graphical options allow for scaling back to a more manageable framerate.Audio enthusiasts wont be disappointed either as all of the game's sound effects contain a strong sense of realism. From gun shots whizzing through the air to the landscape being shaken by explosions, the sound effects truly immerse players in the battlefields. Performance wise, Arma 3 has been improved through recent patches but still has some problems with optimization on even the most powerful hardware. Players should research the game's recommended specifications as an upgrade or two of computer hardware might be required for playing the game with an optimal framerate.Arma 3 is the definite game of the series thus far combining everything that Bohemia Interactive has learned over the course of development. Most fans of the Arma series will be delighted by the massive sandbox and in-depth editor available for modding. Ultimately, Arma 3 is what players make out of it for themselves, either if it's messing around in the editor or joining friends online for multiplayer matches. With Arma 3, Bohemia Interactive proves yet again that it knows how to expertly craft military simulation games.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												This game is just bad! ;) But honestly this game took my life and made it worth living...  I've made so many friends playing this game that I can't even count, as well as some rivals.  <3  Arma 3 gives you a way to escape reality and have fun.  So many different things to do that I can't even begin to explain.  Just buy the game.  Best decision you will ever make if you are looking to meet people especially.  Or if you are just looking to shoot people or fly helicopters or jets or coordinate attacks. You can go into the heat of battle and save lives, or go in and take lives. This game will teach you how to use a compass too city boy and how to drive offroad, just watch out for them twig bushes they are deadly. P.S  nothing gives me more pleasure than taking a helicopter full of 15 geared men and crashing it into the ground ! LOL I love this game.  Just kiddin, best pilot NA Combat land veteran.. Also after 3k hours in game I still play and have fun everytime I play.  This game is just simply a must buy. 10/10			",52,3,2,7,4,0,10

												Wow I love it. Amazing game. What a joy to play. Already years beyond anything I have seen in either battlefield or cod. As a former marine. I love the hardcore nature of the game. I loged into a server and their were other people on team speak. useing real strategy. I am meeting friends. I love the fps system, I love all the ways you can customize your character. It's a dream to play. My only down side is sometimes on sandbox server the game is a little slow. I sat for over a hour just starting at trees not seeing anyone. But pvp fast action games, are a blast. The ai, is very smart, one of the best ai I have ever seen, ever. I am blown away by this game. I will easily sink a 1000 hours into this jewl of a game.

												While Arma 3 is a great game that I enjoy playing, I cannot support the practices of the developer and their 3rd party anticheat system by recommending this.Do not buy any Bohemia product that requires the Battleye anticheat in order to play on the vast majority of the multiplayer servers, unless you want to repeatedly buy that product every time they accuse you without evidence.If they globally ban you for a false positive, as occurred in my case, there is no recourse and no way to ever get your steam game to work properly, and on top of this it will render you unable to play 2 other products if you own arma 2 and dayz SA. Bohemia doesnt help you, and Battleye support consists of an automated message telling you that they are infallible and that your ban is legit as far as they are concerned, before they ever do any research into what occurred.For people who try to tell you things like ""Oh but you can still play single player"" I say ""Try to play single player in DAYZ""It doesn't exist. If you get a fraudulent global ban in any arma based game, you will not be able to play DayZ SA anymore. This is denying me access to a product that I purchased in an illegal and arbitrary fashion.There is no way to get support from battleye and it has been reported many times as a scam company. One of the greatest signs of this is your ability as a consumer to contact a company.There is only one email address for battleye and it only responds with an automated message telling you that you are screwed and have to send Bohemia more money to play your games again. If you even try to find other ways to contact this ""company"" you will be sorely dissapointed as they have made sure to have no other public facing email accounts and no phone number that reaches a live person available to the public.In every country I know of, this is known as blackmail and fraud.PS: if you post here with some inane ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and call me a hacker like a stupid pre-teen, expect your inane ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to vanish. I am 100% a legit player like many of the other people who have been banned by Battleye for a false positive, and I am an upstanding member of multiple gaming communities, known for my legitimacy and my constant pushing for fair and balanced play.I have thousands of screenshots of my gameplay that show this, and nobody has a single shred of evidence otherwise.Plenty of other people have been slandered about being ""hackers"" in this fashion for the same reason, by ♥♥♥♥ing nitwits who know nothing of what occurred. You can do this crap on reddit where you can hide behind the internet acting like a child, but not on my review. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros:  Engaging and challenging campaign; Almost endless replayability via user generated content or multiplayer; Relatively easy to get in to; Diverse multiplayer community; New user generated content (maps, guns, vehicles, overhaul mods, missions, etc.); All in one game (FPS, RPG, RTS, etc. modes available); Pleasing to the eye; Gives you the possibility to brag about knowing how to clear buildings, stay in formation and etc.; Training given by military personell who play this game can help you in real life (incl. paintball and airsoft);Cons:  Can be buggy at times (especially when new patches come out); Spotty AI performance (from full derp to terminator); Semi-steep learning curve for basic gameplay (attachments, maps, weapon sway etc.); Very steep learning curve for expert gameplay (formations, chain of command, team synergy, etc.); Taxing on your gaming rig (lack of good hardware can limit your tactical possibilities in-game); People will probably hate you at how good at firefights you will become (in games and real life); In general:Your creativity and acting is the only limit in this game. With an active modding community, zeus gameplay, RP-oriented clans, PvP servers, survival, orientation and other scenarios, this single game can cover quite a few of your demands for digital entertainment. Irrelevant if you are a hardcore military fan or a casual player, you can find something that tickles your fancy.			",47,2,0,11,1,0,3

If you are looking for a shooter equal to Call of Duty or Battlefield, you have definitely come to the wrong place. This game is not about kills and superior aim - it's all about tactics and coordination.First off, Arma 3 is more of a platform for multiple games than a standalone game itself. You can either play Vanilla Arma without mods, completing the campaign as a soldier or playing King of the Hill in multiplayer, or you could play as a lone survivor after the apocalypse fighting your way through by killing other players, looting places and so on and so forth in Exile, or you could play Altis Life, role-playing as a regular person in the daily life of the people on the Arma maps - and there are way more Arma 3 mods and modes that I can't even list here since there are just way too many!Furthermore, you won't really need all the extensions since there are thousands of community-created mods, maps, weapons, attachments, vehicles and more to just play around with. If you are interested in all of this, I'd definitely recommend you to give this game a try and if you don't like it you can always refund it after all.Apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes - I'm not a native speaker after all.

												I really like Arma, but as a fan I cannot fully recommend this game to others. I bought this game way back when it was in ""alpha"" stage, it's leaps and bounds better today than it was back then but one thing I cannot get over is the lack of content in the game when compared to Arma 2. When Bohemia Interactive first announced Arma 3 and said it would be a near-future setting I was giddy with joy at the possibilties of stuff in the game and degree of creative freedom it would allow the developers. But instead of that we got...-Tons of reused/retextured equipment. All 3 of the factions (AAF, CSAT, NATO) use the same grendades, AT launchers, guns, HMG/GMG, vehicle turrets you name it, even the same weapons for aircraft! Believe it or not there are 9 different fedoras in the game (the ♥♥♥♥ were you thinking BIS???). What this means is that the factions don't really have anything much that sets them apart besides the uniform.-Stunning lack of content for an Arma game, especially compared to Arma 2. It was a real disgrace that it took almost two years for the developers to put out jet aircraft for CSAT/NATO factions (when the game originally released AAF only had a jet fighter, community was scratching their heads). No idea what the deal is with this given the futuristic setting, they could've added anything almost.-Bohemia Interactives total reliance on the modding community totally shows with this game, utterly disgraceful to depend on the community to fill in big content gaps because the developers were being lazy!-DLC packs for this game are clear cash grabs and not worth the money charged for them by a long shot. $12 for a few sniper rifles, another $12 for two transport helicopters, the hell is this♥♥♥♥♥♥and why was it not in the main game?Even three years after release and with the impending release of APEX, this game doesn't feel finished to me. So much is missing from this game when you compare it to previous Arma titles. I have literally no idea what the developers have been doing these past few years with the game. When Arma 3 was announced everyone was so, so excited for it but once it came out the enthusiasm for it just dropped, the game is barebones compared to Arma 2.			",87,11,1,7,17,0,20

Rating:4 out of 5 cans of Tactical Bacon.Pros:Open world military simulator. Emulates infantry combat and tactics.Extensive community support means the game doesn't get old through the release of community based mods, scripts, addons and missions.Great mods available (Altis Life, Epoch, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Exile and more).Realistic and accurate firearms ballistics and ranging (as far as a game can attempt to emulate).Beautiful and well designed maps.Destructible buildings and map features.Huge variety of weapons and load outs especially with the addition of the Marksman DLC (highly recommended).Large number of vehicles to drive.More mature community player base. It's a game where you need to use planning, teamwork and tactics to succeed so it attracts a higher age demographic. ARMA 3 is not Call of Duty, Battlefield, CS:GO.Cons:Prone to bugs and glitching. Death by staircases, insta-exploding helicopters and being sucked into walls is sadly not that uncommon. Deducted a full point for this as it sadly detracts from the quality of the otherwise brilliant game.It is worth noting there is a steep learning curve to the game but this can be offset by utilising the in game virtual arsenal, virtual training and practice scenarios.Will eat your CPU and GPU for breakfast. You need a solid rig to run this with ultra settings. Not a problem for me personally but players do experience FPS issues.Inventory system could do with improvements.DLC content. People however do need to be aware some content requires DLC. Personally I don't have an issue with DLC as it supports the development of the games I like but I do understand DLC annoys some people.Summary:Highly recommended if you would like to experience simulated infantry combat.Not recommended if you want to kill, die and respawn constantly like in a typical FPS shooter.It's a difficult game to master but if anything learn to shoot first. Finding a group to play with that can show you the ropes helps. Learn to communicate meaningful information to your team mates (eg. CONTACT! 2 infantry, bearing 40, 200 metres, left of the house with the orange roof). Effective communication and teamwork is key to succeeding. Check out the mods available and extensive ARMA 3 online guides and wikis.			",73,2,1,5,9,0,13

ARMA 3 is one of my favorite video games to date. It's a massive military sandbox with tons of factions, weapons, and vehicles. What's not to like?Military simulation at it's finest.ARMA gameplay is so different and less homogenized than the other shooter games out there such as CS;GO, Battlefield, and other modern-day gunfighting games. It's a game for thinkers and tacticians. It's a game for people who are patient and who enjoy executing a well thought-out plan.GameplayLet's get right down to the basics; ARMA at it's core is all about combined arms gameplay, meaning that compositions of infantrymen, motorized and mechanized vehicles, helicopters, support units, and CAS are all conducted in unison to perform a common goal depending on the scenario. You can charge a factory inhabited with militants with a large column of unstoppable tanks in an organized attack, or you can complete similar objectives with a small team of 4 during a night mission.The shooting is not like your classic FPS with head-tracking and ray tracing. With the massive scale of ARMA comes realism, and bullet drop, stamina, and ammunition type all change the dynamics of your weapon. Different calibers have different 'feels' to them, and equipping the proper gear for an operation is like choosing the right cameras, lights and crew for a movie set. You need proper scopes that are for your chambered caliber, you need to learn how to zero in your sights, and how to ultimately master long-range marksmanship. The shooting reintroduces the aspect of skill-based combat.Vehicles don't feel very optimal, but they do the job and they function as they are supposed to. Vehicles for each faction feel different, and they all serve a purpose, whether it's transporting ammunition and gasoline to the front lines, or conducting artillery fire missions on far away targets. The helicopter flight modules are very realistic and fun to use especially as an experienced flyer, and doing gun runs with a stealth A-10 feels even better.The AI in the game is terrible especially when in a combined arms group. Commanding feels clunky and annoying, and your AI teammates make remarkably bad decisions and don't stick to formation under certain circumstances. That's why you need to play this game with friends. Having more players in a mission with you is quite literally a fun multiplier. Picking roles and cooperation are the best parts of the game.GraphicsAltis and Stratis look fantastic and the architecture and design make you feel like you are in a genuinely mediterranean location. The water is fresh and blue, and the trees shimmer in the sunlight as they are supposed to. The ground is home to a lot of detail, with rocks you can use as cover, seastacks obscuring different locations, and ruins with plenty to discover. The modelling is fantastic and the weapons are crisp and sound spectacular. The only issue is that this game runs surprisingly bad, utilizing only two cores of your processor (or something like that), meaning that you would have to play on medium to low settings if you have a lower-end system.MultiplayerIt's♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you're playing with friends. Zeus is a fantastic addon with on-the-fly mission creation, but I wouldn't think about playing it in public even once. Battle Royale is overhyped, island life is boring and requires too many mods. MILSIM is fantastic but as always there are good groups and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ groups out there.Overall it's a fun game and you get a lot for your money.			",67,10,1,2,8,0,7

												I am not a gamer in the traditional sence, basically owning only two games, of which I only really play one - ARMA 3 - which is to me the ultimate gaming experience bugs and all.Yes. . .inventory dissapear from your bases. . .you glitch through walls, sometimes die for no known reason and AI have ridiculous brick penetrating abilities (and containers for that matter), BUT the experience while playing ARMA is one of total immersion. I lose track of time when I connect to an exile server. This MilSim game in all it's forms offers the best military simulation when you and your mates are serious about the role playing aspect, but at the same time offers an emmense amount of fun mocking about in Exile or Wasteland. Modding for ARMA 3 is awesome and great fun, and if you like to keep it personal, create an epic mission in the Eden editor and invite your buddies for some close knit groupie battle fun.I love this game. . .and with the 64 bit exe update downloading as I write this review, I am filled with anticipation to see the difference ingame.ARMA3 = AWESOME**UPDATE**SO . . . the 64bit update is done and I have to say I am loving it. Couldn't connect to my usual Exile server but played wasteland for a while and the experience was quite improved.I play on a standard dev spec laptop and I guess if anyone would see an improvement ingame it would be me. I noticed small improvements in character movement, vehicle movement and operating ""stuff"". FPS is still pretty much bound by machine+memory+graphics performance, but where my average use to be around 23 fps on a quiet server. . .(I know SHOCKING), it now hovers around 26-28 which helpos me a lot.Will spend some more time ingame and see if the effects are accurate over time.ARMA still = AWSEOME			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ArmA 3 is certainly a great military-sandbox game. It's a hard and true-to-life experience, unless you just want to ♥♥♥♥ around in the sandbox area with either AI or human players. It still feels like a beta product, though.PROS+ Sim gameplay in very huge sandbox islands+ Story mode with a cinematic vibe and many multiplayer modes, along with scenario editor+ Zeus mode gives the game an RTS approach+ Great graphics and attention to detail+ Mods, mods, and modsCONS- AI is under-developed (especially in sandbox modes) and not very responsive. They do not flinch when shot and hardly change position during firefights. They are also bad drivers.- This game requires very good pc specs (especially CPU) to run smoothly. Kinda understandable considering the graphics and the huge environment, but it SHOULD perform better generally.- Few weapons and vehicles without owning DLCs- General bugs in the game world			",366,44,32,18,32,5,30

												I'm bound to get a metric tonne of dislikes for this, but I'll live with it. Please note that I'm only giving it a negative review because of my history with the Arma franchise (starting with Armed assault, moving through arma 2 and all its expansions and playing using ACE mod on each) and the fact that I had certain expectations when I inevitably pre-ordered this game.Now please note, I have no issue with the setting, near future is fine provided it is done correctly, and in that regard I believe Arma 3 really shines. I have yet to play a game set in the near future that is as 'believable' as Arma 3, because the majority of the weapons and vehicles already exist... and a lot of them are outdated.My issue with arma 3 is the fact that there is a shocking lack of content with the base game, there is a massive step downwards in terms of realistic fidelity, and the performance of the game is abysmal, even with someone with a computer that is massively overpowered for the game. Now, the argument could be made that no where else could I turn for a game that seamlessly integrates combined land, sea and air warfare on a massive scale, and I would believe that argument if Arma II and it's expansions didn't exist. That's the problem, this has all been done before, and to a much better standard.Why do soldiers only flinch when shot, and continue to fight back as if nothing happened? In Arma 2, if I shot the leg/arm of an AI, his movement would be impaired or his aim would be impaired, in Arma 3, nothing is simulated whatsoever. Instead, enemies take multiple hits to be downed, even with extended armour turned off!I don't understand why Bohemia decided to create 3 factions that are more or less mirror images of one another (the reused assets between mounted MG's, grenade launchers, missile launchers alike is puzzling and frankly, lazy.), I don't understand why they removed core features such as dragging/carrying wounded allies to be healed properly by a dedicated medic, as opposed to the magical 'heal all' FAKs we have in game, and I don't understand why they're still using the same tired engine as they used 20 years ago for a game that is on a much greater scale in both terrain, amount of buildings and graphical fidelity.Don't get me wrong, Arma III is a stroke of technical genius, managing to take the virtual reality engine and make it look THIS good is mind blowing, but what's the point in looking good, if the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even when installed on an SSD, there is still the stutter loading when playing online, and I've found that in cities etc. the framerates are completely unplayable when playing with a reasonable player count of 30+.So here are what I consider to be the pros, and the cons:Pros:- Beautiful looking game- Interesting concepts behind a near future setting- Movement is easily better than the previous games- Stance system (whilst part of movement, is good enough to be mentioned on it's own)- Bipods (when they work) are really damn cool- AI is much smarter than previous installments, reacting better to cover and suppression- Sound design is much better, although guns still sound a bit 'off', something I rectify quite quickly with sound mods- Inventory system is really nice and intuitive- Steam workshop support makes mods easier to use, however due to the file size limit only really supports basic mods which I couldn't care less for.- Campaign is a bit more cohesive this time around, previous campaigns felt a bit aimless- Pre recorded voice linesCons (there are a lot of them):- The game caters to more casual players (will explain with the following points)1. Ammo pool showing how many shots are left in your gun, regardless of difficulty setting is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid2. AI can tank several rounds, and fire back with perfect accuracy with nothing more than a flinch, gone are the days of crippling someone's arm to reduce their accuracy or taking out their legs to stop them from moving3. Vehicle crosshairs almost never line up with their HUD counterparts, and cannot be turned off4. Weapons have poor penetration value, I've seen the argument being made that in the future armoured vests will allow you to survive longer, which I can appreciate, but that does not stop the fact that the kinetic force of a bullet would still wound you to the point where you are ineffective. I don't mind the soldiers surviving, but at least incapacitate them for ♥♥♥♥s sake.5. Magical FAKs that heal you to the point where a dedicated medic is a luxury, not a requirement.6. (More of a server issue than the game itself) Everyone is running casual epoch, altis life etc servers. These far outnumber the traditional game servers, which I think speaks for itself really. It's a game targetting people who aren't here for an authentic military shooter. It's here for people that want to use third person, sprint everywhere and not take things seriously.- Each faction is practically identical, there is no assymetrical balance like the previous games, everyone has one assault rifle, one type of grenade, one type of MBT, one type of transport helicopter, one type of attack helicopter, ONE JET EACH (wtf?), and the exact same grenade launchers, missile launchers, UAV's, UGV's and submarines. The recycled content is ♥♥♥♥ing lazy.- The DLC's thus far have offered very little content for their price. For example BAF in arma 2 added an entire new faction to play, with vehicles and weapons respectively. Whilst I can't comment on the expansion pack, Operation arrowhead was practically a new game, and from the PR that bohemia have released, TANOA seems about the most compelling part of Apex, which will probably run like♥♥♥♥♥♥because the amount of trees etc.- I don't like Altis. Personal preference.- Game runs like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥on several rigs I've tried, including a 5960x, 24gb of ram, 2x Titan X's in SLI all running from an ssd to remove any loading stutter. It's just not possible to get this game running nicely.- Hardly any weapons/vehicles per faction. I touched on this briefly, but it was months until CSAT and NATO got jets, and they're both ground attackers only? Why? Why is there only one large transport vehicle shared between each faction? Why does each faction have the exact same UAV's, the same UGV's, submarines, grenades, chemlights, smoke grenades, ghillie suits, armour etc etc etc. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥.- Why does it take multiple bullets to drop a guy at 1m? Unless I'm using 7.62, 12.7 or intermediate cartidges, armour seems to sponge bullets for absolutely no reason.- Why can I not drag wounded allies? Or carry them?This game drives me insane because I wanted to like it so desperately. Each iteration in a series should build upon it's predecessor, and in many regards Arma III improved in many ways, but took so many steps back that I can't recommend this game to anyone.Now ACE 3 definitely makes this game a lot easier to stomach, but the base game is still unfortunately there. It's unfortunately the only way I could say you should play this game if you're used to Arma II. I'm sure I'll get a lot of arguments from people saying that mods will fix X, Y and Z, but the fact is; Arma II didn't need fixing, so why should Arma III?			",148,9,2,6,9,2,20

												The most comprehensive military sim out there, setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons, vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for.The game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original Operation Flashpoint, released over 10 years ago. However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth.Graphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place).If you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive.I wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content.Personally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it.The community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer.Buying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma is a series i've followed scince arma 2 and was aware of since its predecessor. Op FlashpointIt has a thriving community ranging from casual pve/p stuff like King of the Hill to hardcore milsim communities like shack tactical. and everything in between.A majority of my time spent in Roleplay servers or in Milsim communities. it is extremely modular and while it can be daunting for new players to learn, upon finding a solid group you will find many people who are willing to teach you quite patiently. Id reccomend anyone with an interest in a military sandbox to give arma a try.			",141,19,1,19,9,1,6

												Love this game!This is one of the best games in the OFP/Arma series, I've already built a WarMod for it for the IFA3 mod, and 2 more WarMods i will be building for it soon.The Eden editor which is the 3d editor imo is the highlight of the game, yes theres a ton of missions, campaigns, MODS, other functions, & features, scripts, codes, textures, sounds, tools, ............................ the list goes on and on, theres so many genre's of mods in this game I wonder why anyone buys other games.The greatest thing is the community is massive, the forums are always busy the Developers are always updating fixing and adding new features, functions as well as new content sometimes, I cant recall how many times this game has been updated since its Alpha release but I think theres no other game out there that has been patched and updated like Arma3 has.Sure people will have their issues and dislikes about the game, i think every game has that. Arma3 has a high learnign curve it depends but its not limited to what is listed or what it gives you, its a very diverse, in depth, open ended, sandbox, theres so much content you can play with, so many things you can do, and create that you will get more for  your money then any other game imo.I would highly suggest that you run it with a quad core, and a decent GPU, plenty of ram, for example I have a duel core, 8gb of ram, Nvidia GTx 750ti, 850watt PSU, i average 30-35fps in what i play, CPU is the biggest thing if you can afford an upgrade upgrade the cpu above all things.I been in the OFP/Arma series since it started and compared to the editor in the previous games, the editor in A3 is the best, it has so many features and functions and isnt that hard to learn how to create a simple mission, like in the previous games you can play your mission in the editor.For maps which are what you play your missions on, Arma3 comes with 2 maps, they are.....MASSIVE and has tons of details, amazing work, for more maps I highly reccomend a mod called CUP Terrains CUP stands for Community Upgrade project it adds all the maps from the arma2/OA games as well as new ones in arma3!Among other things like all the infantry weapons, tanks, vehicles, and other stuff.

												I taught my girlfriend how to autorotate a hummingbird in ArmA 3. That pretty much sums me up.I've had years of experience in PC gaming but years of AWESOME experience in ArmA. I've spent 1500+ hours in the series and 700+ in ArmA 3. ArmA 3 is one of the best games to define PC gaming at the moment. It's a game of unlimited customizability and scope. Want to attack an enemy base at night? Go ahead. Want to do that with a sniper instead of an assault rifle? Go ahead. Want to make a squad of AI's go with you? You can do that too. Don't want AI's? Then invite your friends into your game. Want to make your headgear different? Wear a smaller backpack? Equip yourself with more grenades and less ammo? You can do that, because this is ArmA.Stratis and Atlis are great templates of diverse and dynamic realistic terrain stretching miles on-end and if you somehow get bored of a 300 sq km terrain, you can go download every single map from any ArmA title and play on it instead. The game is the most moddable military game you'll see this decade.In my opinion? The only con?Optimization. This game isn't going to run smoothly...on anything. The game is awesome and has 12km render distances and more than 200 AI in some battles. That's why it lags. But, it still lags (in my opinion) too much.I run an I7 4770K and an R9 270X  and i run this game at less than 30 FPS at times. Yes, i used to have a store-bought vanilla PC that would run this at 3FPS on lowest settings at 360p but I'll be sitting here with a custom built and overclocked PC while my game runs at 23 FPS and my CPU running at 30% usage..,That's the thing though, ArmA is one of the most CPU intensive games out there yet it has no multi-core optimization and runs like a 2005 32 bit program. It will not go over 2GB of ram and never uses >~30% of my 4770k.If you are going to buy this game, make sure you have a very powerful and fast PC, especially in these sections:CPURAMHDD/SSDand you'll probably love it. Want this game but have a lower-end PC? I'm sorry, but you'll probably want ArmA 2 OA and mod it with DayZ Epoch to get the best experience out of an ArmA game. Still tho, 9/10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 3 is probably the best FPS war game ever, as one other reviewer put it COD is for boys, Arma is for men. You will get to experience both the excitement and incredible the frustration that is battle. The online community is also pretty freaking awesome with a wide range of servers and game types from cooperative missions and King of the Hill to a GTA styled server called Altis Life. This game is so much more than a game. Ok, so you say you aren't a huge fan of the online scene and you will eventually finish the Arma campaign. Well, no worries my friend, you will NEVER finish all of the user created missions available to download. The online Arma creators community is alive and rich with well executed and engaging content. And that brings me to the editor. Can't find what you want online? Make it yourself. Do you want a game where you and several friend have to deliver cakes while being attacked by demon monkies? Well go and ♥♥♥♥ing make it! You can sink hour after hour into the Arma Editor. Sound crazy? Well it is. There are many games that have been developed off the Arma Engine and the Editor gives you alot of control (not complete but you can figure lower level stuff out) to create literally whatever the hell your crazy mind can come up with. So buy it because when you buy Arma you also buy endless gaming opportunities!**EDIT**With the release of the Eden update it just keeps getting better! Everything I mentioned earlier about mission creation just got a whole lot esaier and more intuitive. Bohemia is probably the last great developer that actually appears to care about it's users. It's amzing that years after its release the team is still pushing massive updates, FOR FREE!!!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love you brilliant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!			",41,10,0,4,8,1,2

												""The best sandbox war game of the year""Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level.  With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more!  The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2).  Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE.  It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.   This game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game.  The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point.  Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions.  This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason.  The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work)  I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot.The best way to play this game is modded and with friends.  By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan... BI (Bohemia Interactive) made the game as basic as possible to allow you and it's users to change it the way they like it!Do I recommend this game?YES! This game has supplied my friends and I countless hours of playtime with new and exciting missions and firefights, and with a few basic mods it has become 400% better than before.  9.2/10			",223,54,7,23,34,4,17

												Arma 3, One of Gods best creations so far. My brother had this game which i known about but i thought that i wouldnt like it. But, in June of 2016, I decided to download it. Once it finished, i played the Virtual Arsenal right away and tested out helicopters and the first one i tried was the WY-55 Hellcat. Im so interested in the area of helicopters so i spended my morning playing with the Helicopters. Then, i learned of a game mode called Altis Life which i found a server that had 40 people a day. When me and my friend joined, we had no idea what to do and spawned in Sofia. We ran around the Radar dome and ran across the entire map to kavala. We then asked the admin about how to play and became friends with them also with a guy named Tavita in game. Later on, as the server was facing a lawsuit, right before that happened, me and my two other friends landed on the hospital roof and called the cops over for a talk. We pretended like we didnt have a map and said ""what were the directions for Athira Airport?"" The Admin and another cop named L. JEFFERS got suspicious so my friends opened fired and killed both of them but died because they called backup on Teamspeak before we even shot. I took off and the cops hit my Anti Torque, I lost control and managed to land on a road between kavala and the powerplant. I then hid in a overhang kind of thing with rocks at the powerplant near the coast. Cops found my helo and impounded it and they patrolled to my left and right with flashlights. Then the admin spawned in a Apex Jet, the CSAT version, and he was hovering over me with the spotlight on me. I dont even know how he didnt see me when the spotlight was directly on me. My friends spawned in Athira and got a SUV and drove to me with no lights on. When they were offroad and were close, the jet went right over them when they stopped. They then picked me up and we went to Rebel to get gear. Arma 3 is Truly the Best Game of all time for me and i recommend it for players who like military and RP games.

												A great simulator of my home country, Alpacastan. I appreciate the correct modelling of Alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. I also love the fact that you can recreate traditional Alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. It always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, Backwards Cap Guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the Great Cleansing of Stan.RIP, he will be missed.11 frolicks out of 10.

												I HIGHLY recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army. Not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war! Friends can get together and act like the Special Forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids! You can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as Cops and Robbers! This is by far my favorite military game of all time! Sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a SIMULATOR and by far the best one for military standards. I DO NOT recommend this game for the Call of Duty & Battlefield lovers because there is just no simple ""respawn"" or ""run and gun it"" situation this is not built for Deathmatches! It is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! There are no killstreaks/CoD type loadouts or MLG scoreboard. If anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator I only have one thing to say. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU!			",89,24,0,23,5,0,18

												If you want to play the best military simulator experience, Arma 3 is your best bet. It has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. I have played Arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. There are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as Wasteland, which is less serious than others; Life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of DarkRP in Garry's Mod; Insurgency and Domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously.Lovely game, 10/10.

												One of the best games available. The amount of things that can be done with this game is just amazing. There's a really active Modding Community for this game wich constantly creates new content, be it Star Wars Mods, Halo, Dinosaurs, Zombies, new Cars, Equipment, Island or just simple retextures - there's always something new to discover!Another good thing is that you'll never get bored! There's a lot of public servers running gamemodes like KotH, Wasteland, Altis Life or Invade and Annex -  and even more Communities you can join wich are hosting Events and big Operations. On top of that there is also the Editor where you can create own Scenarios or Gamemodes, or you can just try and do supid stuff (simply for the fun of it). In the workshop you can find a lot of good missions to try as well as a lot of new content to explore, and if that's not enouh for you then there's also armaholic!All in all this is a wonderful game wich can keep you entertained for countless hours...

												This is my favorite game of all time.Pros:+Extremely realistic (AI acts intelligently, weapon handling depends on fatigue, distance, etc)+Great community (for the most part)+Thousands of great mods (try Exile, King of the Hill 1944, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Epoch, etc., all available for free from Steam Workshop. Other mods can be downloaded from Armaholic.com)+Ability to make your own scenarios/mods+No running and gunning- tactics and planning are the only way to win+Huge learning curve keeps kids away (this is a very good thing)+Looks great, even if the framerate is on the low side. I get 30 FPS playing KOTH on an i5-2500k with 12GB RAM and a GTX 560. Not a beast of a computer, but it has no problem running this game.+Ability to play in third-person or first-person views.Cons:-Can't drag a fallen team member to safety before reviving (this is a big difference from Arma 2)-Updates can mess with mods-The vanilla game doesn't have a huge selection of uniforms/guns (this can be easily fixed though with mods, so it's no big deal; however, some servers don't support mods which makes the selection useless)-Still expensive. You need the DLC, as many servers require it.In summary, buy this game if you want a mature shooter that values tactics and punishes a lack of teamwork. This isn't a twitch shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield; it is a game that tries to be as realistic as possible and entirely succeeds, in my opinion (note: I have nothing against COD or BF). It is worth the money.100/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game features a lot more than it may seem. It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over.Everytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time.You can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about.Plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more.Im not gonna say the game's completely perfect though.The main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem;some people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers.The gameplay;Now that is one hard question to answer.The gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope.As you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game.now, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend.The community:The community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community.The Engine:this game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot.Overall:The game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a ""Walking Simulator"" but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala.In my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot.-Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.

												One of the best games I've ever played which is rare for most of the modern-day games we have as they're usually just watered down copy-pastes of each other. This, however, is a piece of art! The Arma series has never disappointed with it's realism, modding community, and overall ability to sink hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into. A bit pricy, but if you ever have the extra cash lying around or see it on sale I highly recommend picking it up. Me being someone who has low patience I can still sit down and spend whole days doing nothing but playing this game non-stop. For newbies the controls are a bit complex, but you grow with them over time. There are hundreds of mods which are easy to install and completely change the game. One minute you could be playing a military simulation, the next an action-survival zombie game, the next a deep roleplay such as Altis Life. I recommend this game to every whether you're a military enthusiast, casual roleplayer, or first-person shooter player. No matter who you are I guarentee you will love this game!			",32,1,0,6,5,0,2

												There are as many ways to play Arma 3 as there are players. Some people prefer their roleplaying to be of the silly kind (AltisLife) while others like to pretend they are the next Neidermeyer. Some milsim units go through the motions of a 'realistic' infantry unit deployment training cycle because they think that's what training is. Other units train their members how to work together as a team to be a more effective fighting force. As no one is dying for reals, technically every mission run is training as long as there are lessons learned. The problem is many units have no idea what they should be training for, and make the game not at all entertaining.As Dslyecxi explains, ""The great thing about the ArmA community is that it offers something for pretty much everyone – from hardcore milsim groups to totally casual experiences, as well as everything in between. We occupy what we would call the “serious fun” side of that scale – we’re not stuffy or rigid in how we play, we know that it’s all a game at the end of the day, and we’re all in it to have a good time. Our sessions – typically lasting eight hours or so of non-stop gaming – reflect this mentality as well, with us playing a wide variety of serious and not-so-serious missions throughout.""

												Let me tell you a story...2 men from different spectrums of the gaming-verse come together.1 likes playing CS:GO and a myriad of other FPS1 likes playing Smite and a myriad of RTSThey both have differences and refuse to play the others gamesBut, these 2 brothers UNITE on the battlefield when they are pinned down by artillery shells, and gun rounds coming from what seems everywhere where a single stone is what's keeping them from life to meeting DEATH.The Things They Carried... They carried a spectrum of things..an assortment of WWII weaponry, Halo weaponry, modern weaponry...anything they could get their hands on was in their arsonal. They arm up and get ready to fight for what seems like an eternity and to complete the objective.They they cry, they carry burdens, pain, misury, but also happiness, laughter, and joys on the battlefield,This is truly a Band of Brothers.NOTE: Seriously, this game is the perfect war sim. It ECLIPSES COD, Battlefield, Metal of Honor in everyway. While those games grant kill streaks and fast pace action, ArmA just throws you in and lets you face reality. And the community grants you with everything. What's keeping this from a 10/10 (game is probably a 9.7/9.8) is the poor optimization which i sadly could say I've glanced over since the game is soo good. I reccommend this game if you REALLY want a REAL experience.. +++			",89,1,1,8,8,0,16

												ARMA 3 is a great game if you don't like having fun, like me. You're going to be fed bitter morsels of fun only after suffering like Sisyphus. But unlike Sisyphus, you will eventually succeed and the fleeting moment of victory will be much better as a result of your misery. It's even better when the suffering is compounded by playing with friends. After multiple restarts because a BDRM annihilated you with pinpoint accuracy from 3 miles away, you'll have a great time.The main problem with this game is that it's set in 2035 and you're fighting Post-Human Space Iranians in a tank from the 70s. Thankfully, this game is supported by an excellent modding community and you can use mods to take the game back to the greatest era of human history; The Cold War. You might not get the chance to die on the atomic battlefields of the North German plains, but you can get pretty close to it thanks to this game and the dedication of the modding community. Eventually, you will reach the mod singularity where you will simply have too many mods. You will spend hours in virtual arsenal making the perfect loadout. You will think  ""Finally I create a decent depiction of an Iraqi republican guardsman circa 1991!"" but you will feel nothing.Thanks to this game I have had to confront the existential horror of consciousness, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Posted: June 23, 2014
												THE GOOD--------------------This game is actually the 4th installment of the Arma series and I've been playing since the start.  The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game.  They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes.The part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods.  The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game.  It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, ""grand theft auto"" like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more.These mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing.  Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down.  Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town.  Add some soldiers inside the town.  That's it!  If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy.  This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on.  Want to do more?  Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, ""battle busses"" (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine.  If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on reddit.com/r/armadev or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums.I hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor!  Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear.  Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game!THE BAD---------------I mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced.  This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs.  Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC.  People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware.  At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.

												Arma 3 isn't game... its a way of life.I know this now because I am one with this game. I am this game. This game is me.After 1564.2 hours invested in this game... I  have come to the conclusion that Arma 3 isn't a video game but a government research project into alternate reality simulations. This isn't a game... it is their first draft of the Matrix.I... I have done things in this alternate reality that I never thought I'd do... I learned how to fly helicopters at terrifying speeds just inches from the ground and I've dropped scores and scores of fine young soldiers into battle. I have used a supply crate as  a helicopter-borne wrecking ball. I have learned how to operate rocket launchers with extreme prejudice and impunity.In one instance, I became a heroin running gang-leader that got into an epic shoot out with the police that ended up with me flying away in a stolen helicopter high on adrenaline (and a little cocaine)... then shortly after that  I was in a high-speed police chase that ended the lives of several good police officers in fiery explosive deaths as their cars tumbled and rolled around corners as I zipped away at 300km+ in the worlds fastest Prius. I have sung Kumbaya over a barrel fire at a meth lab with my mortal enemies.I once crashed a jet straight into a single enemy soldier because God Bless America, god dangit!Most importantly  - I've learned from this game. This game has taught me a lot of stuff... like that stairs can straight up kill you. I moved to a single story house because of this and I am happy to report that no stairs have tried to kill me since! I have also stopped climbing on and around rocks because they can swallow you and you'll never get out of the rock... I have put up posters all around my neighborhood advising parents to keep their children away from stairs and rocks, lest they end up dead or swallowed whole!If I had to look back on it, I'd say my feelings are like Lois Griffin in this clip -

												After 2600 hours/3 years of gameplay i remembered to write a review about this game because i was so immersed in playing ita more detailed review below:After so many hours in playing this game i have to say that it still impresses me at how it can still surprize me with the things i keep on discovering as a gamer, a gun geek, a modder and an editor.But to fair, after so many updates and patches added to this game, it's still very disfunctional and has an early access pre alpha feeling to it as it takes you out of its immersive gameplay and graphic style by reviewing all the bugs, glitches and the constant 20- FPS to the point where you question if the developers pay more to other people to not make games like Arma 3 so that they'd control the MilSim Market.Overall if you're OK with Low FPS and bugs please i beg of you to buy this game because it is fantasticly addicting.This game will satisfy any need you have. if this game doesn't have something you will be able to mod it to meet your expectations.You can play GTA, Battlefield, Red Alert, Rust and so many games inside this game if you're willing.

												Arma 3 is a well developed game which follows in the wake of optimisational dumpster fires ""Arma 2"" and ""Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead"", which featured engaging tactical combat, in-depth gamemodes and squad/team controls, but unfortunately terrible optimisation, especially for higher end rigs, because logic. Arma 3 refused to make that mistake. While there are still optimisational issues, and a high CPU demand compared to the GPU demand, Arma 3 made drastic improvements to what lacked in previous games. The combat remains immersive, squad command easy and accessible, a surprisingly rich story line, and fairly-priced supportive DLC. The expansions add content that support the experience, but don't detract from it if they aren't present/DLC not owned. Arma 3 is definitely a step in the right direction for Bohemia Interactive, especially after their previous works.Score: 84/100			",120,6,0,13,11,0,19

												Arma 3 is one of those games where you feel aslthough you yourself have been transferred onto the battlefield. The gameplay, especially when paired with a friend is to die for and the extensive DlC's and community content mean that you will be able to squeeze all your moneys worth out of this game. Where it's demanding on your hardware it makes up for this with it's at times almost photorealistic graphics. One spot that could use work in my opinion is the weapon handling, clunky and hard to manage at times the gunplay dosen't always feel as realistic as other games I have played. All in all though I am absolutely in Awe of this game as I was with its predecessors. Very good game that I would definately recommend.			",38,0,0,1,2,0,0

Very AddictiveI would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military sandbox shooter. This game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat. Before I get any farther into this review, I would like to point out that this game is nothing like COD or Battlefield. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be fast paced, but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some. I'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay, rather than go in-depth with mods.Overall Gameplay 9/10This game is often called a walking simulator, however this game is so much more than that. Once you play long enough, you just look at walking as another method of travel. You start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives/other players.  Do you want to risk driving to a location, only to get blown up by AT (anti-tank) or would you rather take the longer, but mostly safer method of walking. Once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk. That being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure. This is perhaps one of favorite things about this game. Want to stealthily insert from the sea SEAL style? Would you rather set up on a hill 1.5km away and pick off the enemy? Or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path. The decision is ultimately yours.  You may find that a lot of this isn't in the vanilla game, but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more.Combat 8/10:Combat is great, but it has its problems (some very frustrating problems at that). PvP combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics. However... The AI is ridiculous. It has gotten better overtime, but the AI is completely unpredictable. Sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off, or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off, only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim. Don't let that ruin your experience though. Some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the AI doing something completely hilarious (EX: taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason).Mechanics 9/10: falls 2 feet to the ground, dies... To be fair combat mechanics in Arma 3 are much better IMO than that of previous Arma titles. Bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done. It can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the .50 cal Lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles. Bullet spread/drop seems realistic enough. If your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you'll be mostly dissappointed, but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little. There are lots of options for movement and stances (they can actually benefit you greatly in combat). I HIGHLY recommend staying away from rocks. I have no idea why, but rocks can instakill/trap you if your not careful. Not all rocks are like this, mostly just large ones... stay away... Visuals 9/10:When first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking. For the full experience I would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume. The immersion is very enjoyable. If you can't run the game on ultra dont feel left out. It still looks great, and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online (being able to see through foilage/fog). There's probably a lot I could add to this review, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods. There are too many good ones to list.I may sound a little biased because I love this game so much, but if the above that I described sounds remotely like something your interested in then I highly recommend it.

												Arma 3 is a tactical military shooter, it has an unique spot in having the biggest maps with most players combined. Imagine yourself 120+ players in 2 or 3 teams fighting it out incl vehicle warfare... Tanks planes helis even boats included in that list, described at the shop description arma really sends you to war. The bad side is that this comes at a cost of at least a good pc to even being able to play it to full potential. And even then you limited by what the servers can pull off, eventually you will enjoy the game a lot more in smaller groups.But arma 3 is not all about war, with steam work shop full of content or not to say the least about ""armaholic""...  Arma 3 has so many possibilities that you won't run out of content to play quickly. With arma life which pretends to be a GTA with real players as cops medics and military. Included with gangs and your own choice to be the bad or the good guy and fight it out in the wild wild west. Or mods based on the older arma 2 mod DAYZ still to this day better than the standalone... But also with more known game styles like KOTH which is more a team death match with a level and money systeem.What the best side and also directly the worst side of arma 3 is that everyone can hire a server. Games can never really die in this way, look at how many still play arma 2 daily... When a game dies mostly seen in EA games shutting down their servers, arma on the other hand will never really close down. Aslong everyone can hire a server whenever they feel like it... Great community can grown upon this but also people can abuse it, with scripts with saved slots as example. Pay the server owner €10.- a month and you can always play (join the server because only vips(donator) can join the last 20/30 slots). While every server has to pay hes server rent, servers with scripts like this or those that show xx amount of players always on the server is a big issue. (mostly combined to too double the effect ofc...) It is funny because i've been admins on several servers, have seen how it has been run from several different points of view. And none of these server owners have ever used or felt forced to use any of these scandals so yes i'm surprised... While most just hire the server as a kind of donation to the game or those who get real donations from community members help the game thrive.Arma 3 also has a great single player game the voice overs are sometimes weak to say the least but it goes... I won't really call it a story, although a story is being told, just see it like a training course for the multiplayer. ;) Arma 3 also gives you a very strong but still simple 3D game editor whereby making missions is as ease that everyone can do it. Or also known zeus which makes you being able to play as a game master, you can make missions or sent waves while you friends are playing. It gives you an eagles eye of view of the battlefield and gives you the tools to spawn and do almost anything you can Imagine. Arma 3 is one of those uncut gems and well worth every penny you put into it.			",206,23,9,26,33,3,46

Admin abuse.... Honestly this was my first experience of ""Online"" play.Also you'll notice the water marks. I was spawned in with gear that I shouldn't of been able to wear. So I'm punished by being spammed with Water marks of icons that fit the mod in order to buy that DLC. I wouldn't of cared if it didn't effect the entire game.Edit: Admin being a prick.

												31/01/2016 - EDIT N°2This game has even made me build military knowledge and confidence in myself.I been playing I&A (Invade and Annex) recently, not ANY Invade & Annex, been playing on the 77th JSOC server that operaters differently to all others, regardless of whether you're in the clan or not.People were often without a team or without a squad, I never really had trust in myself and I just decided to take the initiative in something for once in my life. With over 900 hours of ArmA and no belief in myself, I just drove those soldiers who trusted me into hell, unarmed, unexpected and unaware. Surprisingly, I was sucessful. All I did was just, care about them as people and not just military assets; I told them to respect and be friendly to each other, to cooperate. Over and over. I watched over them as if they were my sons, making sure they had all they needed, making them check to be better safe than sorry, over and over. And I did this with everyone I came across. I went from leading just 4 men to even leading up to 20 people. All I told them to do was just to be respectful, to work as a team, not to only think individually but as a group, collective; think of what you may need and what your friends or teammates may also need. Everyone told me I couldn't lead, and that I could even lead less as a medic and I wanted to prove them all wrong, and so I did. Carried all my supplies, plus ammo and AT munitions for our units. Sometimes I'd fail, and I'd never know whether it was our mission, our team, or my leading - but I kept going on. Today I just lead a very small team of just 8 men into what I never thought I would've ran into. It was like any other day I logged in; got a squad formed up as I always do, my sweet ""Echo 1-1"" led by myself, Corsacfox. I told them what I told everyone and we set sail. Our Mohawk pilot had to de-route as the LZ wasn't the best and I had to re-build my entire plan out of scratch. I debriefed everyone, made a perimeter on disembark and we just took down the enemy communications (radio tower). After that, a second target went on but we suddenly got ambushed from all directions; our team was struggling to survive and I got up to the point I asked command for help. Command sent Foxtrot to help us; but Foxtrot didn't do as told and nearly betrayed us, going on their own. I fought aside my men who all had trust and belief in me; they simply didn't give a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about Foxtrot.We fought and fought, moved and moved as we all worked together - it wasn't just me being the leader, it was everyone working together and me making the final order to follow, and even that could be readjusted to better ideas proposed by my units. Foxtrot even nearly killed us with artillery as they wanted to take the risk, their leader died and ditched them; and so they fell one by one. My squad stood together, those who carried ammo for the ATs saved the day as we took down many enemy armored vehicles; and command/base was a disaster. I just kept going and going, and we ran out of missiles. A friendly CAS that I requested gave us support; and after a VERY LONG fight; we finally succeeded; we took down the artillery, recovered the HQ and took back the territory. We were all happy, celebrating; our Exfiltration point was designated as a mass evac. Our first half of the squad got in a Mohawk and flew away back to base with Delta, that hadn't helped us either and were mostly dead. The second helicopter came, a blachawk; and as we were returning to base a CAS took us down; we had to parachute in an emergency and we were dropped off in the middle of the desert, about 5km away from Base. I made a risk run through complete wasteland to get to the helicopter and retrieve all the supplies and my backpack back; and I helped the few that were left of my team back up. We ran until there were 2km away from base, and a helicopter found us - it finally took us to base, safely. The enemy really wanted to take down Echo. We had a really nice story, some funny jokes you'd find in the military, and one of the best experiences I've ever had in any game. We were all complete strangers to each other, and yet everyone worked so well together, regardless of their differences and roles. I returned to base with an experience that brought me so much happiness and so much of a different perspective of life, taking the initiative and being confident feeling that I can not even explain. It's the best when people work together, and even if it is through a game, it can help you out a lot. I am very glad of what I did, and I learned many things from previous Squad Leaders when I was one of their soldiers, and so did I with my personal experiences as one. It taught me many things for the game, and many things for my life outside of the ArmA universe.I very much thanks everyone who has ever been or will be part of my squad in future experiences, and I salute everyone who formed part of ""Echo 1-1"".19/10/2015 - EDIT N°1ArmA III, after having played for almost 2 years now; I must admit that my view on it hasn't changed. Bohemia Interactive may not have the best past ever - but I believe this game is simply a masterpiece. It's development still continues as of the day of today; and it really does deliver all that it promises. It's given me many hours of entertainment, and going. Endless matches and experiences that made me entertained, scared, emotioned, and that made me laugh a lot. There's lots of modding, there's lots of gamemodes and missions - maybe the game was meant for military simulation, but it really has no boundaries. All you need is being able to run it, and maybe some friend(s), it won't dissapoint.--------------------------------------------Original reviewArmA IIIArmA III is like chess. Out of all the table games, ArmA is the most sofisticated and ""Fancy"" war game there is. I've had over 2,000 hours of Battlefield, and of Call of Duty. Few hours in Insurgency and many other games. But ArmA, I've never heard of ArmA III until one of my friends told me about it, in ArmA, the systems are extremely advanced, the system is so realistic that it gets up to a point in which it turns plain annoying. You break your leg, you can't breath, you fall, you trip, you die, you drown, everything happens in this game. Theres everything that a war game needs to have. This is not even a war game, it's a war simulator which makes it even better. The campaign is hours of fun and entertainment, and if you dare, you can even learn how to code in ArmA and make your own missions, making missions to be rated, for your own fun, to screw around. You can do anything you could imagine in few hours, and those few hours will grant you limitless fun, hours and hours of gameplay. Hours and hours of designing and meeting new people. Hours and hours of COOP, PVP, TDM, AVA, and everything that a war simulator needs. Cars, tanks, planes, boats, submarines, civilian cars, trucks, convoys, war helicopter, transport, ambulances. Huge maps, huge buildings, huge cities, beautiful physics and beautiful enviroments. The map is huge and it would probably take you hours to go across it, both Stratis and Altis. I haven't played this game for a ""really"" long time, but, with the very few hours I played, I can pretty much say that it's way better than anything else I've ever tried. Bohemia Interactive might not be the best company out there, but still, they made this one beautiful game that no other company have, or ever will, do better. You'll need a team, you'll need to cooperate, and think about what cards to play while being in the front of the battle, you'll need to set up your equipment and gear, and know, know how to use it, and how to react to all possible situations. This game has no boundaries, and I have great expectations for it, I am waiting for it to grow even more, and for it, to be even, more enjoyable. This game, this game is unique.This is the best game I've ever played.			",107,18,4,9,4,0,8

												Here's a story just to tell you what kind of game this is. Lemme start by telling you this game is definitely more of a template than it is a full game solely based on its modding capability alone. So I have a Vietnam Mod for this game, adds new maps, units, weapons, etc. Our platoon lands in the jungles at LZ Fiona, a clearing in the jungle in the hills. We spread out and head into the jungles. A shot rings out and the LT. takes one in the chest. V.C. Ambush. I hit the ground and ready my M16A1 I have no clue where the rounds are coming from but they're coming.  As I'm lying in the brush three figures run by, but they don't look friendly. Startled I swerve quickly back into their direction and let loose a full auto barrage from my 20 round magazine, I see blood flying out of the figures and then they drop. I got three of them. I look back ahead of me and start letting out one-round bursts trying to suppress the enemies on the opposite hillside. Ammo's getting low and the bullets keep coming. I climb through the muck and grunge of the jungle floor to a nearby friendly, he's hit but no time to mourn now. I pilfer through his gear and find what I needed, sweet sweet ammo, ~30 bullets left. I reload, and the hell begins anew.			",100,13,2,17,5,0,9

												Sad, What was once a great simulation has turned into a big middle finger to loyal followers. DLCs that should have been released with the original game because let's face it, Even on release, it was still a beta. I have followed Bohemia since operation flashpoint and I loved their games and their attention to realism.....Arma 3 could have been so much but releasing half dlcs instead of the old good hardy dlcs you use to get with Arma 2 and still not fixing glitches, I can no longer support this game. Heck, even all the arma clans that switched to arma 3 is suffering membership loss due to the unplayability of this game on multiplayer and that's where this game really shined at one point. It's a sad day.			",134,51,1,33,23,0,16

												Arma 3 is a classic example of what happens when a company simple creates a game that is too ambitious for their own good. A ""military simulator"" of combined arms gameplay, the scale of the game, the world, and the things inside of it is massive. And while normally that massive scale would be a good thing, it's become clear to me over my many hours playing it that Bohemia Interactive has simply bitten off more than they can chew. To be fair, I have only played the Wasteland gametype, and I have no interest in other types. All my experiences are based on that.This game has the worst desync, hit detection, and general instability and clunkiness I have ever seen. Many times I have aimed directly at stationary targets right in front of my face and got nothing for the bullet. Players consistently zip and zap an teleport hither and thither as the server struggles to keep up with everything happening, and the frames per second are quite low even on a very competent PC like mine. Large down time is interspersed by periods of being one-hit-killed, or from players simply living through the bullets you send his way. The inconsistency of infantry combat is incredibly evident from the first minutes you engage in it. In a game that strives for military realism when applicable, I cannot fathom why the most important parts of a game such as infantry combat are the worst parts of this game. The only reason, I think, that a game like Arma 3 has a player base is because there is not any competition in terms of the military simulation sandbox game. If any other game had such a horrid execution of infantry combat, it would be inexcusable. Controls are not heavy...but clunky and unresponsive. Player menus in the game are the worst I have ever seen in a game, and you will often fumble through lists of commands and struggle to perform simple tasks like opening doors or simply checking the inventory of a corpse. I've had fun with Arma 3. I really have. I still will play it, but it's only possible to play this game and have fun when things work. And with Arma 3, that simply is not a reliable amount of time. Kill trading happens very often, and the unreliability of infantry combat reduces the only working strategy to ""stay far far far away and snipe at other players."" I've only played this much because of friends that also play it, but more and more my sessions simply end in me staring at my screen with a gaping mouth, dumbstruck that somebody soaked up a dozen bullets and somehow one shotted me from the grave.The DLC weapons are all high caliber killing machines, rendering the base level of weaponry basically useless. Enemies are bullet sponges for any caliber below 7.62, so thinking you can play this game with an assault rifle with 5.56 rounds or 6.5 caliber rounds is only a pipe dream. Fights are dominated by ridiculously high caliber weapons, like 9.3 or .50 caliber rifles, which betrays the realism that this game, I think, strives for. Other players can certainly soak up five, six rifle bullets at times and still stay up. The delay between hitting players and watching them go down can be LITERALLY a second or more, meaning you will shoot precious bullets at enemies that are ""down"". With games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Counter Strike...Arma 3's only excuse for such pitiful execution of what should be the core pillars of gameplay is that it is so massive. More isn't always better, and I think Arma 3 proves that. TL;DR Arma 3 has its moments of genuine enjoyability, but the inability to execute simple and regular commands and the horrid infantry experience ruins most of the time spent in-game.

												This is a review for the Single Player Experience.As I have a busy life, I don’t enjoy the MP side of this game. Most of the adoration you hear about this game is solely the MP community. Most of the cool video’s you see on YouTube are made by and for the MP guys. And they can only get those shots with real people, as the AI is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥PROS:Beautiful graphics.Value.Moding community.  Be Careful. A lot of the mods will degrade your game to the point of it being unplayable and it will take a full uninstall/reinstall to get working right again.CONS:BUGS/GLITCHES/CRASHES NIGHTLY!!! STILL AFTER 3 YEARS!In the editor, never merge SP missions.  They will never work.In the Eden editor, if you click Play/SP with Briefing, and then in the briefing you click on Cancel, that mission will never, EVER work right again. You will have to start from scratch.AI. Legendarily Horrible. I can only assume it is on purpose. There is no way this AI could be real. It has to be some perverted experiment.Mission Planning. Doesn’t exist. You will have to find a MOD. See above. You will have to learn, I can’t believe I am writing this, you have to learn a script in order to make your own missions. Something they forgot to tell you on website/box/adverts/videos. JOKE!Command and Control. Joke.Communications. Joke.Game Value. Low.Simulation Value. Non-Existent.Technology: It is supposed to be the year 2035! JOKE. The tech in this game is more like 1955.Conclusion:The only redeeming qualities of this game are; Potential. Someday, this game might be good. And it is the only game of its kind. But they spend all of their (BIS) limited talent on area’s we don’t care about. FIX the AI. Make this game playable for SP. Basics. Do some research!DON’T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REALISTIC MILITARY SIMULATION! This isn’t it! You will literally spend 50% of your time scripting. 45% fighting the game AI/GUI, and 5% fighting the enemy.Good Luck!			",11,0,0,0,1,0,1

												This is the best Golf simulator out there. You really can feel the swing in ur whole upper body as you go on killing people with your towed zamak beneath ur transport bird on wasteland sa-matra. And the crowd (victims) goes wild in the global chat 1/2 times you manage to score. This keeps you going for hours and hours. The occasional aa missile hitting you in the side makes for an even more interesting golf course as you will need to ""get out of the rough"" and repair/re fuel the heli to get back on the fairway12/10 will golf again			",115,15,3,15,6,1,19

												Pros:- Most wide maps of any shooting game that I have played.- Mods really make arma- Modding community is really good- Powerful map editor and scripting languageCons:- Really badly implemented multi-threading resulting in horrible performance- Inconsistent and buggy scripting language with many flaws.- Netcode is still not very stable- Game and mods require approximately 100GB hard disk space- Modding community is scattered, so compability is a issue- Arma with many mods is generally hugely instable that there is saying ""arma happened"" when you crash or die for unknown reason- Game is only 32-bit so it will use your PAGEFILE AS RAM EXTENSION !- Game can only use 25% of CPU or GPU, because the mainthread is full of bottlenecs crippeling the performanceThis game makes me feel very controversial as I love the game and the concept of the game, but the game engine is based on technology from 19th century, thus making the game unplayable.

												Game requires several gigabytes of modding to be playable. Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently. The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a ""realism"" mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either. You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car.The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less.Many of the ""futuristic"" weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar.It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point.Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes.Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance ""coincidently"" where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking?Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game. The Iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumble-bees.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After spending 1000 hours with this title I am returning from the battlefield with a hefty review, so listen up soldier, it's time to debrief! Haha, just kidding. Arma 3 is made by Bohemia Interactors, the same developers that made Operation Flashpoint 1, 2 and Operation Flashpoint 3: Dragon Rising and all its notorious DLC packs. alkjdfljgaoirjgfsgh Arma 3 has had a rocky development cycle since development began in 1999 (Yeah, take that, Duke Nukem!). The biggest bump on this titles rocky road to going gold was when 3 of the members of the development team were caught by Greek military personel on the island of Lemnos, where they claimed that they were ""just documenting the environment for a video game"". It turned out these guys weren't the saints they tried to make themselves out to be after Greek secret police found explosives and make-shift pipe bombs in their hotel room that they had been staying in for 6 weeks. Tensions rose between Greece and the Czech Republic, and weeks after the mysterious release of the terrorists the Czech Republic was in favor of every single EU stimulus package to Greece, a nowadays declared failed state and international bombing range.After causing international ruckus, Bohemia developers seemed to enjoy the time in the spotlight, so keeping a low profile was out of the window. Their next direction for their game environment was blatantly framing the Greek inspired island as the most idiotic place on earth. For legal reasons they had to change the name of the island, which they did, from Lemnos to Altis (which just happens to be old greek for ""Goat ♥♥♥♥ers""). The alleged mistreatment of the Bohemian Rhapsody developers also caused them to remove all furniture on the island, and they placed signs in most towns saying that cilivians threw their belongings into the ocean to build a giant sea-base nation because of the Greek politicians incompetence. Destroyed Greek military vehicles are spread all over the island, together with mass graves, and I sometimes wonder if Altis would have had its current post apocalyptic atmosphere if the developer incident had never happened.Arma 3 had a well received launch, and was declared ""Best Arma game of 2013"" by GameSpot. Bohemimi Contractors made an absolute killing on the title, and is now ranked the 13th most valuable company on the planet. It's inclusion of a mod makers tool kit as well as a film editor has provided the community with the tools to create endless amounts of content themselves, and, unfortunately, porn. The Arma film maker is notorious for being abused by people importing of female game characters and posing them in lewd and untasteful situations.Looking forward Bohemo Mamani is looking for more Greece inspired environments for their next title. The developers just acquired a fully funcitonal T-90 tank, which they continously pose in front of on twitter with Bohemian flags, automatic rifles and wishes to visit Greece.This game has multiplayer support up to 32 people, which is twice as many as the Xbox One version. Get the PC version. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Downloaded Arma, and then opened it. Proceeded to do a horrible tutorial, but after that, it was just beautiful. Opened an RPG server, and ran 2 miles to get to an atm, and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman. Bought a car, spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it. After I finally managed to glitch into it, I underestimated it's ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall.

												This part was written when I had an FX 6300 OCed at 4 Ghz, 8GB ram and an HD 6870:For my current config, look way down below.-------------------------------------------Operation Flashpoint was good, I bought it three times.Arma was acceptable, I bought it and its addons.Arma 2 was excellent, I bought it twice and I also received it as a gift over Steam.but frankly, arma 3 is completely disappointing:In 2015-16, Arma series becomes a pay to win with Marksman DLC and APEX addon.In 2035, rocket launchers are utter ♥♥♥♥♥ and the art of guidance systems has been completely lost.In 2035, IFVs are going slower than tanks and flips magically for no reasons.In 2035, your occular implants shows you full screen advertisings for having been a passenger in an helicopter that no one cares about, added in a DLC.In 2035, Weapon zeroing is made en masse over advertised values for ammo (ie: if your ammo is made to leave the muzzle at 800ms and actually leaves it at 920(as for the Katiba). then you will definitely not hit your target beyond 500 meters because it will overshoot it.In 2035, AA rockets are tracking the target as soon as they leave the launcher, good luck if the target is going downward because your rocket will go downward too.In 2035, Westland Lynx are equiped with rockets, not guided missiles.In 2035, the Fennek is an MRAP, but on the plus side, the retractable periscope is funny to use.(Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 9 FPS. (Obsolete)In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 20 FPS, but the players will teleport all the time, shoot before you see ! Also in 2035, every soldier is the fattest America, Greece, or Iran has to offer and can run for 2 meters provided you are not carrying anything heavy, like a weapon.In 2035, players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all, even your teammates, because they will join the strongest teams.In 2035, AA radars are the most useless stuff ever created, only usefull for single targets, and on the ground, what happened to the Operation Flashpoint scanner ?In 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater, too bad there is nothing to do there.and finally: in 2035, you can forget about usefull vehicles, here MRAPS do not have AT launchers, and AA tanks have a ridiculously short range, bad accuracy, useless radar, and only 4 rockets which MAY allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures.In short: the future SUCKS. for the record I had 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time I wrote this (now 1200-ish). This number is still bound to increment, but I can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine, and the future.Edit: I will be nice for once: The ballistic system is a nice addition to Arma. sorry I ran out of nice things to say.Yet another edit: If modding the game was not such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and if Bohemia did not RELY on modders to make their game for them, I would probably recommend it. Of course that means modding it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(unless you are creating everything from scratch, which means you can make everything and as such should not bother with this engine)  and that I do not recommend it.A word for JPS2004308 who commented this rant:How does that apply to what I said ?Also I would very much like to point out to everyone here that you copied / pasted your comment to all negative reviews of arma 3.With an I-5 6600K OCed 4.4Ghz, 16GB ram, SSD drive and an noisy RX 480:--------------------------------------------------------------At last ! This game runs smoothly (it is way less of a torture to play, jumped from 9 to 70 FPS and my view distance is 7.5km instead of 3km(1km with 19 FPS).-------------------------------THE APEX RANT:I have to point out if BI wanted *me* to buy the APEX add-on, they should have never dropped those utterly crappy DLCs on the market first. I am sure the new map will be gorgeous and fun to play.As I said I did not buy it and now the main menu changed, with almost every sub section containing an APEX related link that will *invite you* to buy it.Now if you launch the editor, you will be able to place *APEX UNITS* that you cannot use, which obvioulsy clutters your UI, Same thing about ZEUS.And if you look closely, APEX equipment, even when it is just a retexture of a piece of gear you already have access to (jungle camo version of X weapon), you will not be able to use it, a chasm between APEX and non-APEX in multiplayer, if you want your enemies not to be able to use your weapon, just get APEX. Oh and far worse: two pieces of gear are way tougher than the A3 equipment. If you want to be invincible in multiplayer: Take the Viper helmet (Special purpose helmet of the CSAT) and the Special purpose uniform. those two are way more effective than the former CSAT uniform, to crown it all take a GA Carrier GL Rig, and enjoy your walking tank which is something like 30% more resilient than the former possible walking tank (Defender Helmet + GA carrier rig + CSAT fatigues).So yes, they are turning the game into a Pay to Win and this since Marksman DLC.-----------------------------------------------------------------To be honest if you want to really enjoy A3, go find the ACE3 mod first. For some very strange reason they are the ones who, in my opinion, bohemia should hire. Yes,  you can stick with ACE2 and arma2 if you are intelligent, but ACE3 corrects a lot of the ""future sucks"" I wrote above, it seems though they have decided to not take in account the date of 2035 and stuck with what they know to be currently true. While it seems retrograde, it turns out to be way more futuristic than what bohemia did: At least Titan rockets can make top attacks now. And for those of you who like to be even more of a danger to your teammates, there is a dead man's switch, and the ability to strap explosives on your vehicle (or the enemy's).Also insert here some nice comment about the RHS mod, but to be honest I expected no less from those guys. Go download it instead of buying APEX, it is free and it is good.-----------------------The ""Did you find this review helpful"" rant:Okay so people around find reviews ""not helpful"", for some reasons there are more ""unhelpful reviews"" not recommending this game than there are recommending it (basically I am pretty sure that if I pressed the ""recommend"" button people would find this review more helpful). THINK A BIT you pieces of trash fanboys, what you are doing (Saying ""no"") makes negative reviews having more weight than positive ones, the only problem with that being steam forcing people to show only negative reviews to see them. A not helpful review could be some random comment or inside joke as there are many around. An helpful review points out what is wrong or what could be improved.

												i want to love it so so much, but the fact remains that i get over 120 FPS on single player and only 25-35  FPS for multiplayer.i know it's not my fault because my computer is a sexy devil. i know some of it depends on the server. that is a fact yes...but another fact would be ""unless your running your own server or playing on a server VERY close to your location, you can't achieve 60 Constant or better, FPS.   and i just can't deal with that in 2015. im sure alot of others feel the same way as i do and thats why i cannot recommend ARMA:3 to anybody wanting to server hop around.i would say this game is stricly for single player OR playing a private server with a few of your friends whom live close to you.   ^ i will clearify that this is only MY case, so if the above doesnt apply to you , don't rage at me instantly,  be happy. because you play servers that you connect to very well. and for that im straight up jelious,  if i had one wish it would be to have this game, but with as good as frame rates as arma 2 or even dayz standalone. it literally hurts my feelings that this game is such a letdown.thus all said,    if you LOVE arma:3 as much as i do, play some COOP with your friends or play singleplayer. you still get amazing FPS if you have a good computer.however i do not think this game is worth $60, perhaps wait for a massive steam sale.this is my reveiw and i most certainly not recommend ARMA:3 without love for singleplayer/small private servers.

												It's difficult to compare Arma to another game since it's so unique. The gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and doesn't play like a traditional FPS. Console gamers will have no issues with this game's controls even as their first shooter on a PC.Arma has a slight learning curve, it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover. Arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls. But they aren't vital for successful gameplay. Arma is only as complex as you want it to be. Even though it is a simulation game, it feels much more natural to play than other simulations.Singleplayer - The story is actually pretty good, some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging OP:Flashpoint feel to it which I'm a fan of. It's divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters, each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle. There's also a Bootcamp mini-campaign which will help new players a lot.Multiplayer and Community - Arma is a great game to play alone, it's even better together. There's lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into. Lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the Co-Op scenario Invade and Annex, as well as the PvP scenarios such as KoTH and Wasteland. But the best experience is playing with an organized group. There are casual co-op groups, PvP clans as well as hardcore roleplaying ""milsim units"". You can feel around for what's right for you.Editor - Arma has always had a very powerful Mission Editor tool and has open support for custom scripts. This alone is all we needed to make missions. Then BI gave us Zeus - an in-game editor, look up some videos - this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself. Now BI has also promised a 3D Mission Editor to cover even finer details.Mods - The game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just as-is. But really it's whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content. The community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and BI has always been highly supportive of community content (even to the point of cash giveaways from the Make Arma Not War competition). If you can think of something cool to add to Arma, it's probably already got a download link.Criticism - Although the game engine gets some flak for being ""unoptimized"" (BI has been improving on the game's performance significantly) when you think about it, how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay? You can be infantry (even fight underwater with certain assault rifles), skydive/HALO jump, pilot a transport chopper, fly a jet, drive a tank, use artillery, anything. Not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap. What other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics? Yea, thought so.DLC - Arma 3's DLC is optional, and you can just get modded content which are not affected. Even if you don't buy the DLCs you'll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who has/doesn't have DLC. Just wanted to clear up the myths of Arma 3's DLC.I've been playing since the Alpha/Beta with 1,000+ online hrs and I'm still not bored. Arma 3 and Arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and BI listens and improves from community feedback. Arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now. It's been almost 2 years since the Alpha was released, and expect Arma 3 to be active for at least another 3-5 years, probably more. Think about it, why buy a bunch of other games when Arma can be all of them for one price? Definitely the most well-spent money I've ever spent on a game for the enjoyment I've gotten so far and will continue to have. No doubt about it. I'm glad I could support such an awesome studio, keep up the great work BI.			",21,0,0,2,3,0,6

												Played many different FPS over the years. This is by far the best one. Keep in mind if you are used to Battlefield or other FPS this may take a little time to get used to and get the hang of but be patient its well worth it. I bought Arma 3 for the helicopters and ended up liking the FPS aspect just as much as the flying. Also Be sure to try all the differnt game types before you stick to one thing. I played Sector Control for months before trying something else like Sandbox or wasteland servers which i enjoyed even more so.			",59,2,3,2,4,0,5

												I have spent 3 years playing this game, since the Alpha release. I have over 1500 hours on it.ArmA 3 teaches you a lot of things, but the most important one is that... Anything over 10 FPS is considered playable. No matter how good GPU you have, Unless you have an Intel I7 SomethingX you will be darn lucky if you reach 60 FPS on MULTIPLAYER. Be aware that Singleplayer performance has a big, big difference from the Multiplayer one.But still, aside that. I can't describe the amount of fun I had/having with this game. Especially tactical operations with 40+ people is just plain perfection.If you are into military, war games I heavily suggest you to get ArmA 3. You will not be disappointed.			",114,7,2,26,28,0,54

												Arma III is a good game with a good concept of what it is trying to do. They have started to roll out the campaign, finally after a few months after realese. What helped Arma II was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game, as this seems to be the direction that Arma III is going and that for one thing is excellent. This could spur some very interesting gameplay and I am hoping it would catch on with groups such as ShacTac or LSG just like in Arma II. Graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor, implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game. Now for the downfall. Not everyone has this but many people do. The game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise CPU and GPU properly. (http://i.imgur.com/pkwvj34h.jpg http://i.imgur.com/RQog0QF.jpg) These two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful. Playing the game at 10-25 FPS is not possible. You are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance. The BiS developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem, moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining. This feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers.When it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly. A similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is ""too hard and we are not willing"" (SOURCE:http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722019263834/ ). Really I do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them. They are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising.FinallyPROS:Excellent Multi-Roll Military SimBeautiful Graphics IMOWay Smoother than Arma II ex. shooting,aimingAltis and Stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplayImproved physics with bullets and vehiclesThe ragdolls!CONS:Severe performance issues and utilisationThe sound assets could be better (That is nothing mods cannot sort)Game feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles/weaponsThe campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incompleteThanks for reading!**EditSo, I upgraded my PC and have been playing a feck ton of Arma recently. The sad thing is though my FPS never stays above 60fps and I still sometimes even drop below 30fps with such a good PC. It is really, really depressing that this game is so awfully optimised. When I jumping in the editor and Get 60+fps I see what the game could be. They have also now finished the campaign and on the plus side JSRS studios are developing a new version of JSRS. That is going to be a must have mod in Arma III for me.I am still going to leave this unrecommended on the fact that it does not even seem to have changed despite spending alot of money on a new PC and even buying a watercooler for the CPU so I could overclock it, just to find out that I still get bad FPS. I am playing the game yes. I am also enjoying the game but underlying all of that is still disappointment. I guess if you like Arma II and you think your PC would be up to it, go for it. Otherwise don't bother.Again, thanks for reading!			",97,12,2,7,10,1,15

												Dear Bohemia,Instead of releasing more islands and single player garbage no one cares about, how about you guys do something about the game's atrociously bad framerate?  This game is very heavily CPU dependent (doesn't really tax your graphics card at all) and yet I still get lousy framerates with an overclocked i7.Oh, and while you're at it?  Maybe you shouldn't have the game reset everyone's controls every other week when you make some stupid change to your grossly overcomplicated control scheme.  Some of us are left handed and don't want to spend an hour going one by one through the 15 different control settings menus to put everything back the way we liked it.Just a thought.You ♥♥♥♥ing buffoons.

												The Bohemia Interactive, well-known for the VBS series for the armies, have released the arma 3 as of september 13, 2013. It is a very renowned and creditable game because they showed their efforts to embody a variety of things in the game : constellations, military realities, and so on. We can easily find out about why it deserves to be popular.We can create the mission by ourselves. This huge merit makes us to deal with enemies in a environment that continuously changes. Plus, we can play the game in various game missions, not a fixed ones.Not only that, the addon system is a bonus factor that helps us to enjoy the arma 3 in customized circumstances. You can imitate whatever you want using the addon system.I want to say that you have to buy this game if you are reluctant to buy it. Given that arma series is a civilian eddition of VBS series, it is clear that this game is a perfact fit for you. I didn't mention lots of realities of arma 3 though.			",67,2,0,4,1,1,3

												Flew a ghosthawk over enemy territory and took AA fire. Chopper heavily damaged and engines dies, we begin to plummet to the ground. Theres no hope, I begin to look back on my life, the whole seven minutes in pilot training. I brace for impact, closing my eyes and clenching my cheeks. I hear the rotor break and whir, the fire crackling and SMASH. I wince at the thought that i would have to restart, but i squint my eye to peek at the screen. No death screen, no menu. Just a simple ghosthawk DANGLING FROM A POWERLINE. My squad and I jump the 8ft down out of the chopper. All of them seriously injured, but not a single one dead. I dont know why the powerlines have hitboxes, and i will never know the dev that did that, they will forever be my guardian angel, but i do know one thing. This game is insane.10/10 would crash land into powerline again.			",17,1,1,2,5,0,1

												By far the most realistic military simulation game that's out today. If you're a serious military enthusiast this is your game. It also has the most impressive modding community I've ever seen for a game. This is a true PC exclusive. Arma 3 is more than a military game. If you are someone who is very creative and has a vision of an exciting scenario in your mind, this game will give you the tools to make that vision come to life.It does require a VERY powerful CPU to be clocked very high for it to run smoothly. It's rough around the edges, but at the end of the day it gives you so much freedom that many games fail to deliver.9/10			",73,0,2,0,3,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now i'm hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! Arma was a Military Simulator aimed for those who like the genre,  90% of public servers today are RPG. For me Altis Life is the plague of ArmA... There needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. To get that real 'Arma' experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... No way to get the real Arma experience on public servers. (Sorry for my poor English)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been a dedicated Arma fan for years, so my opinion may be a little biased.I NEVER get bored of this game. If i get bored of the content, there is literally a never ending supply of custom fan made content to indulge in. The learning curve is a little bigger than your normal shooter. This is not a shooter however. It is a sim. That being said, give it a chance before you dismiss it as ""Too hard to learn.""The community is healthy for the most part. I have yet to find a griefer that wasn't dealt with swiftly.This is the game engine that Dayz should have been written on. It is a ton smoother than Arma 2. There are a few bugs here and there, but the dev team covering Arma 3 is on top of their game. You can bet every patch will fix SOMETHING that needed fixed, and not just introduce new content. A++++++++++++++ Game. Yes I am a fanboy, get over it.BUY THIS GAME! Apex/Marksmen is worth the extra money also, so don't skip out on it or you will have buyers remorse like the cheapos that are complaining and leaving negative reviews.

												All I can say after playing nearly 1400 hours is that the community on this game sucks.Single player is beautiful and there are a wealth of things to do with mods, but expect to deal with ridiculous ban-happy admins in almost every multiplayer server, on the god aweful bohemia interactive forums, and on armaholic. Don't plan on playing any roleplaying servers without constantly dealing with people who dont roleplay or admins that abuse their powers. The best bet is to find a group of good people to play with, which is next to impossible. The game itself, while beautiful and expansive, is not well optimized at all. It barely uses my four core cpu, and I get just the same FPS with my hd7850 as those who run the game on a gtx 980ti.Also, I should note that you might as well buy the dlc unless you want to be bombarded with stupid dlc advertisements the entire time you play. Oh, and the dlc is stupid because there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of mods out there that add even better weapons and vehicles (assuming you don't get IP banned from armaholic for no reason).Note to self and others: Don't play in any public servers after or during a sale...the number of children and tkers is extremely high.UPDATE: as of september 2016, they've removed all official servers on altis, and made them only available for Tanoa!

												For players who have never played arma and go into this game with no expectations, it's okay. The game works for that. But, for people with expectations for this game, (for example, arma 2 fans) it is completely unacceptable. The game completely dwarfs all previous arma games in many aspects. The graphics and engine are much better. It has a great core, with great potential. But that, sadly, is all it has. The game itself has to have been rushed. On the official release day, it was in the state of an alpha game, and still feels like a beta for most people. The game had an actual alpha and beta on steam, but from the player's point of view, not much changed between alpha and release day except for a few new assets and the main map being released. It never should have left the alpha, and the problem is that bohemia doesn't seem to have admitted to even themselves that their game came out unfinished. From release day, they have been treating it like a final product, with only a few small polishes and fixes needed. This is beyond the exact opposite of how it actually is. On release day, it was laughably broken. It had the most bugs I have ever seen in a game, and felt like a joke. Now, after 1.5 years, many obvious bugs have been ironed out. I can say that the very surface game experience is acceptable. The problem today is that while they fixed some of the basic gameplay issues, about 40% of the features feel unfinished, but that is coming from someone with 1000 hours of experience. As I said, the surface experience is acceptable, but if you REALLY start playing, you will notice inexcusable holes in the experience. Along with all of this, the game is set in 2035, so none of the objects in the game are real, and at best partially resemble real things. The NATO and AAF factions are okay, but the CSAT faction, the only opfor faction available, looks terrible. The CSAT people literally look like aliens, and I get depressed every time I see one of them. What was bohemia thinking? Why would you put space aliens in a military simulator, especially ARMA? Atleast put terrorists, or north koreans, or normal russians, but space aliens? This is very controversial, especially for a military simulator, in particular arma. Currently, the helicopters DLC costs 15$. The game shipped with only a few helicopters, so it was good to hear that they were addressing this. It was sad to hear they were charging 15$ for something that should have been included with the game, but I could live with that. What really set me off is that for 15$ you get only TWO helicopters. Yes, 2 helicopters that you should already have for 15 dollars. With the arma 2 OA expansion, we literally got more assets than arma 3 will probably ever have for 20 dollars. Now we pay 15 dollars for 2 helicopters. Currently, from what I can see, Arma 3 is doomed. They are going to continue charging money for each baby step towards a finished game, and with that, only make a few baby steps, and then run off with the money. The only DLC remaining will be a DLC called marksmen which adds 7 weapons, all of which I've played with, and most of which look like laser guns, almost as bad as the CSAT faction. Bohemia also has a interesting DLC model which makes the DLC more like updates with certain assets you can't play with unless you buy the DLC. This will mean marksmen comes with an upgraded weapon system and 3 vests all of which everyone gets, but ingame the core DLC items are unusable without paying. There may also be an expansion way after the marksmen dlc comes out, but nothing has been confirmed about it.TLDR: Arma 3 is a dissapointment for real arma fans because holes in the general experience, not enough stuff and weird art style not appropriate for military simulators.

												This is a review and story about my time in Altas Life, one of the many gamemodes that Arma 3 has to offer.For anyone who doesn't know Altis Life is a real life simulation mode in Arma 3 with civilians, cops, rebels, gangs, and more.Now let's begin.>Be me>Playing Terraria because of the new update.>Get skype called by my friends, asking me to help them join them in mining and selling uranium illegaly.>Sounds fun as ♥♥♥♥.>Close Terraria and open Arma 3>Join the Altis Life server we usualy play on>Spawn in Zaros>I have full rebel gear from the last time that I was on>Had to sneak around to avoid cops but it was night time so it was pretty easy>Go to a car dealership and buy a offroad and speed off to the uranium mine >When I get there, my two friends are there storing uranium into what appears to be a semi and a van.>The also loaded my truck up as well.>We stock up on repair kits and drive off to the uranium refinery.>Refine all the uranium and then head off to where we need to sell it.>We finally get there>My friend is in the building selling all the uranium.>We ended up with a total of 1.5million dollars that we needed to take to an ATM asap.>The at the topleft corner of my screen i see a message saying ""YOU ARE SURROUNDED, DROP YOUR WEAPONS AND GET DOWN ON THE GROUND OR WE WILL SHOOT"">Battlemode engaged>Look to see who we were dealing with>It's the largest gang in the server with 11 players on with full military grade gear and two military helicopter>All we have at the time was 3 people with bulletproof gear but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ civilian weapons.>A firefight ensues and we end up taken out four of their guys but we all end up dying.>mfw that whole thing start from finish took about 2 hours of time>mfw we lost a potential of 1.5 million dollars.>mfw It was all worth it because Arma 3 is fun as ♥♥♥♥.Seriously, if you want to have a great time with friends(Arma 3 is a game that I would recommend to have atleast 3 people with.) Buy Arma 3 when it goes on sale. But make sure to buy the DLC because most servers use it and you can't join unless you have it.10/10 seriously one of the best games I have every played (if you're poor you can just get arma 2 and operation arrowhead and get a taste of the arma series before you spend $30 during a sale for a game you may not end up liking.)

												ArmA 3 was highly anticipated by me when it was first announced and I pounced on the beta as soon as it was released. Now that its on general release I'm totally wrapped by it. I've already played around 250 hours and just can't get enough of it. There's 114 pages of custom made missions available for free via Steam and the Armaholic web site,( singleplayer, coop and multiplayer missions):http://www.armaholic.com/ Most that I've played have been excellent. The in game editor enables you to create missions fairly easily with little experience. The whole package is well worth full price. There's more big updates coming soon adding to the campaign mode..The only downside I've found is the lack of an armoury. All previous ArmA games have included an armoury, where you are able to try out all weapons and vehicles, plus play as any character in game (including animals) as well as   play different scenarios,  which  are  never the same due to the massive   open world aspect of these ArmA maps.The game has amazing graphics, an open world stretching for many kilometers in all directions and smooth gameplay; all of which make ArmA a pleasure to play. IMO far better than any other shooter around (incluing Battlefield 4,Call of Duty & Op Flashpoint) . (though I love the  Battlefied and  Operation  Flashpoint games as well)edit -  April 13th 2015:  The game has come a long way since I wrote  my original  review while the game was in beta, though  due to a massive back log of unplayed games that I own, I've not had much opportunity to play the game recently.  That said, the developers have added a lot more  to the  game since I last   played it, such as the single player campaign, plus of course there are many more  missions  and modifications  added since I mentioned it previously; in fact far more than i'll probably ever be able to get through.edit Nov 2016:Okay,  I've still got a massive backlog of unplayed games, (even bigger than  last April when I   intended to update this last. That said, I have found some time to play  quite a lot recently and am  very impressed with everything  the  devs have accomplished with this game. The Armoury is still missing, but I believe someone has created   a mod (which I've not had time to check yet), that I'm hoping will add the armoury  mode  that we had in the original ArmA and  ArmA II.  I've played  a few hours of the single player missions that have been added to the game and was very impressed. You can play them either   as a lone wolf or with friends if you wish, both of which i enjoy, though I've not managed to persuade   many to play for  a long time.  I found them challenging enought to feel a sense of achievement once I'd completed   or nearly completed the missions. I died a lot initially, but once I got the lay of the land it was easy to  figure out  where to  stay in cover and hit your targets, almost with impunity. Still, most of the time I did find   the  scenarios  challenging and very enjoyable. There's  loads of different   envoronments to work through which makes for interesting   play.  I've still to play more  multiplayer. Been avoiding it  for now as I don't feel up to the standard  most of the  clans that run this game  are at. If I could find  a group of average players i'd be really happy.  I will hopfully  rewrite this review   and consolidate what i'd said  once I've spent some time playing the multiplayer game and experienced more of the scenarios that the community have posted via the Steam workshop.  There are so many of them now,  unless you're a total addict I doubt you'd ever be able to play them all  (much like the community made maps for Left 4 Dead 2) and the mods for games like Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV and V.

												Arma 3 ""would"" be a great game. Speaking from the viewpoint of a prior infantryman in the United States Army, this game really has the ability to nail that realistic feeling. Unfortunately it flaws flat due to it's poor performance. Arma 2 had some of the same issues on a smaller scale. Single player is fine most of the time, but the game runs terribly on multiplayer servers despite the strength of your rig. Here's to hoping that Arma 4 will finally get a rebuilt engine.

												Epic!This game is just AMAZING! Played while it was free in weekend, and i stiil want more! Can't wait until next sale!Ended whole first act, I thought this game will be like second part ""Arma 2"" so i wasn't expecting much changes, except graphics. What I've got was Epic, military missions in a native of Battlefield, epically made system of walking, crouching, sneaking, peaking, even AIMING was great. While I was walking down the valley with my gun directed towards the village, I felt like a real soldier on a field. Even when my soldier was exhausted and he was breathing so hard and my gun was moving like a freak I've had so much fun, in previous part of game it was made so badly, gun was jumping from pixel to pixel, now it's  smooth and lovely. In those few years Bohemia made a freaking epic battlefield simulator, you can customise your character, add loadout, customize guns, change helmets, backpacks, even shades! It wasn't in prevous part, and it's great experience, you finally have full control over your character. But it's not game for everyone, it's a simulator, so it's hard to get controls at the first time playing. + You can do briefing in many many hours, and fight overall will be like 5 minutes or shorter. Altough, it's fantastic game, and surely it will be on my desk. Bohemia Interactive knows how to make comeback, I hope that we'll see more epic, more fantastic game (Arma 4 of course). I also hope it will be on summer sale!+ Real sandbox+ Perfect physics+ Fights with high momentum+ Many gamemodes in multiplayer+ Epic singleplayer (and multiplayer scenarios)- Not for everyone- Hard for beginners- Doesn't forgive mistakes9+/10			",52,3,1,0,3,0,2

												Arma 3. a completely unique and fun game, giving  a huge variety of scenarios, gut wrenching gameplay, with a huge sence of realizm blows COD, Halo, and Battlefield out of the water. I kiss COD, Halo, and Battlefield goodbye. this is Arma. having no same exact mapped mission. with no same exact scenario, with two Gigantic islands, and alot to explore, from controls, to different ways to approach things, everything is so much more realistic to any other first person shooter, for ground gameplay to taking to the skies in an A-10 or Huey attack helo. has so much more to offer. adding underwater combat, volumetric simulation, and Authentic FLIR imaging. gives a experience worth living for, takes the player right into battle at the comfort and warmth of you'r home.the community is gigantic giving huge amounts of content the community creates for a quick subscribe and free download. giving multiplayer a boost to a stunning 100 player scenarios. goodbye 64 player servers. and yes. the Arma 3 community has quite a bit to offer.OPS on ground are stunning. having that adreniline rush of bullets whizzing past you or the curiosity to find where you're getting shot at from. Arma 3 supports a simulated person. not a gun with a hitbox, having 15 different ways to get out of sight. and to return the fire. the ways to call support and the ways to provide it are incredible. there are also many species of wildlife you can run into such as, goats, snakes, bunnies, dragonflies, and butterflies, Arma 3 completely excels on ground ops.OPS in air arent DCS world realistic, but are still realistic to its point. thanks to volumetric clouds, volumetric fog, and randomized weather chages gives Air OPS a huge advantage and disadvantage in different situations, different vehicles to take flight in means different ways to support squad and teammates in the battlefield. the wildlife here is birds. but flying is fun, yet can be very dangerous, wear you're seatbelts!OPS in water such as in boats or even diving are both very fun, might as well veetoh COD:GHOSTS fish A.I. a huge veriety of killable wildlife such as eels, fish, seaturtles, and sharks. also with the many different passenger and assult boats. having that ability to choose what kind of vehicle you want can give you the upper hand.OPS in armor such as tanks, imidiately makes you feel like a badass, rolling through with an M1-Abrahms platformed tank, makes you feel the most powerful thing on the battlefeild, then you have things like a pickup truck with a 50. BMG HMG that seemed good but you got blown up. alot of things have the upper and lower hand, as said many times depending on the situation, but before i let you go, try not to hit the bunnies, what did they do to you...?Arma 3 has definately alot to look forward to in the up coming years, i hope this review was helpful, and at the same time confirms you to join the Arma 3 community. im not saying too much of everything, so you the reader has to play the game to find out morebut remember.MAKE ARMA NOT WAR!!!

												Do not get me wrong, this... game? is amazing. I hesitate to call it a game, but it really depends on your playstyle. You can go on Roleplay servers, or you can PVP. The usual hardcore users of this product however usually use it as a base for massive coop operations, including vehicle platoons, artillery support (manned and operated in a realistic manner by players) and infantry squads. You want to realistically call in a fire mission for the artillery? This is your game. You want to call in close air support for a strike on a sniper/tank/building? This is your game. You want to indulge yourself in close quarter combat with your squad? This is your game. You want to hunt down IEDs and the insurgents who placed them? This is your game.  Ok now, these massive coop operations are made possible and realistic by the modding community. This is a fact, the base game is (to the best of my knowledge) not ever used when it comes to any serious servers or communities. The modding community supplies the realistic radio communications, the real word weapons, the medical simulation, better sounds, better graphics in some cases, better AI (!!!) and all kinds of maps, so YOUR platoon can deploy anywhere from Alaska to Zimbabwe. AND it brought you bipods (seriously Bohemia, how did it take you so long to implement freakin bipods in the game...)....This modding community made the game more realistic and created the fanbase it has today. Arguably the most attention Arma got in years came from the Zombie mod (not a fan btw, but still).  And now Bohemia comes along and wants to charge you for DLC. Alright you might say, what is the DLC? The DLC includes things as long range capable rifles and tools to be more accurate. It also includes things like new helicopters and slingloading vehicles/objects. These are argueably some of the main features for the marksmen and helicopter DLC respectivly. Now, these features where added by the modding community YEARS ago. In arma 2 already. For absolutely free. They still exist in Arma 3 too. I do not see the need for the publisher to charge this amount of money for features the community pretty much figured out on its own. I would rather donate that money to a beatiful website called ARMAHOLICS and to certain mod developers on there. And arma 3 is a triple A game with a triple A price. As others pointed out already: People who preordered, played in the alpha etc. paid MORE money than people who waited for the steamsales to kick in. I can get the whole game cheaper and including DLCs than the chaps who where loyal to bohemia and this franchise in the first place.... what the ♥♥♥♥ .... seriosuly. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, even from a marketing perspective. Here is my advice: If you are looking for the real arma experience (large-scale coop, usually vs. AI with differing amounts of military realism) buy the base game. Then find a appropriate server or group to play with. They will teach you how to mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game and you will never need the lame DLCs.			",50,1,0,8,8,1,10

The graphics are nice. Arma 3 crashes sometimes i have no clue what the issue is with that but nevertheless the game is a +1 and you should definitely buy it no matter what holds you back! 8 / 10 Due Bugs/Glitches.

												Before I purchased ArmA 3 I played ArmA 2 and ArmA 2 OA and before that ArmA cold war assault, I did'nt really want to switch to ArmA 3 becuase I heard a lot of bad things about it, but that was when it was in alpha and a little bit after it was out of alpha. I finally caved in and bought it, which I don't regret, sure its ArmA so there is a few glitches and a wierd physics engine, but ArmA is prabably the best military infantry simulator I have played. Now my really only problem with ArmA 3 is that the vanilla game only has futuristic weapons, (like everything thats a prototype or still in development know is in ArmA), but just having a few mods can correct that like RHS, ALIVE, and allinarma. So I do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes milsims, or just likes the ArmA series in general.			",81,11,4,6,12,2,6

												ARMA 3 Well what can you say, it's arma, best arma ever created. I could almost say it's the best war ""simulator"" game ever created. It's just perfect. Graphics in this game are just mind-blowing, on almost every setting, but ultra... just wow (just kidding I cant run this on ultra). All the gamemodes that you can play in this are just really great. Of course there are flight simulators and tank simulators that can be more realistic, but a game that combines all of them and offers really good war simulation and a lot of more, this is just amazing. If you want to experience better simulation of war, you have to go to military.This game runs really smooth for me, I have NVIDIA GTX 660 and I can play on high graphics, so that can give you some information that how good computer you need. And last but not least with a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to thoseof us who enjoy these type of games.My rating for this game 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots, but then Bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it. You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development.That might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round!Take a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear!Another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that ""look futuristic."" The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game.When you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty. The encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold.Another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing.All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.

												Let me start by saying that I have had fun with this game, as you can see by my playtime. But that playtime has been plagued by bugs, glitches, low FPS, and a constant feeling of ""Why didn't they...?"" in the back of my mind. I never got into ArmA 2 because of its FPS problems, netcode, clunky and unintuitive controls, and just bad game design. ArmA 3 has fixed NONE of these problems. - First off, the performance. The Real Virtuality engine is an engine from the ♥♥♥♥ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Server performance still affects client performance. This is a joke. If the server gets overloaded, you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s. This is why performance is so inconsistent.- The player controller is the same one from ArmA 2. This♥♥♥♥♥♥controller cannot play more than two animations at once, on the legs and the torso. Full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this. Again, this is a joke. Animations are also very stiff and crappy looking.- Same old bugs and glitches from ArmA 2 that were never fixed. You can lean into walls and see through them, much worse if you're using 3rd person. Grass pops in right in front of your eyes. Objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you. Vehicle physics are almost non-existent and you will explode from the smallest crash. VOIP is incredibly laggy and sounds like it's coming out of a 90s phone. - Game is supposed to use DX11 when in reality it still uses mostly DX9, one example is shadows. ArmA 3 still uses ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stencil shadows instead of soft shadows, even on max settings. Aside from that, visually the game is nothing special. It has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it's quite ugly. Low res textures are a problem.- The game is billed as a ""military sandbox"" by Bohemia and a ""military simulation"" by PC Gamer but ♥♥♥♥ing NOBODY plays it as one. 99% of servers are gamemodes like Wasteland, Epoch, and Altis Life; gamemodes more suited to Grand Theft Auto than a game with as much potential as ArmA 3. Worse still Bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless End Game gamemode that nobody plays. I was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it's supposed to be, and I played a lot on that server, but the FPS was so bad (~25) that I eventually stopped playing. - Stemming from the issue above, tactical PvP just isn't a thing. There is some tactical PvE which I have enjoyed playing, but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those Terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a .45, you're out of luck. - 3rd person. Everyone uses it, or rather abuses it. It's impossible to get the drop on someone in CQC because he's looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person. ""Don't play it"", you might say. That's impossible, because I have never seen a public server with it disabled. ""Don't use it"", you might say. Again impossible, because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when I come around the corner unless I use 3rd person to look over the wall too. - Updates are a farce. Game's been out for 2 years and only NOW we're getting bipods, really? The DLC is another joke, 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns, wow Bohemia what a ♥♥♥♥ing deal. - ""Never half♥♥♥♥♥two things. Whole♥♥♥♥♥one thing."" - Ron Swanson. Driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isn't a flat surface. Plane mechanics are pick-up-and-play. Guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesn't happen. The only saving grace is the combined arms aspect, but alone they're terrible to play. I'm going to stop here because I could go on all day about how♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all. I never write long reviews, but how much I love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me. This game is NOT worth 50 euro, maybe 20 at best. The only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game. The only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it.			",114,22,11,29,34,1,25

												Hmmmm... Not entirely sure how to start this review. This the first ARMA game I have played. While the game even now is buggy and glitchy, its still an extremely solid ""soldier"" exprience. I love the atmosphere generated through this game and large scale battles which ensue are always a joy. Also the amount of content under the steam workshop will keep you going for hours and hours. As far as ""realistic"" shooters go, ARMA 3 is probably one of the best well if you can put the issues with the game aside.Final Score: 85/100			",227,11,6,18,16,2,32

												Arma is a series that has always had my intense fascination.  I cut my teeth on the early Tom Clancy games, Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon, so I was no stranger to the concept of a hard infantry sim.  I've followed Arma since its inception as Operation Flashpoint, and I have grown to love the series like no other.  There are portions of Arma 3 that are more boring than watching grass grow, as you sit in vehicles or tromp around on foot for endless minutes.  The real meat of the game though, lies in what can turn into thirty seconds to five minutes of pure chaos.  Firefights don't have the corridor of meat puppets that games like CoD or other mainstream shooters have to offer.  There are no meticulously rendered setpieces.  Instead, everything outside of radio chatter might as well be freeform.  You draw attention from a chopper while infiltrating a base, they radio out to a mechanized squad that sends an infantry fighting vehicle armed with a 40mm machinegun.  The ground churns around you and your own team as fire and shrapnel turn a stealth mission into a desperate fight for survival.  These are things that happen in this utterly unforgiving, but satisfying game.This isn't a series for the squeamish, and this surely isn't a series where you expect instant health regeneration while you duck down out of the way from canned enemy fire.  You will learn to fear the sound of a faint crack in the distance or the recognizable drone of a gunship approaching.  Enemy man, 100m, bearing 045Ready to fire			",666,104,24,81,50,3,91

												They keep releasing 15 dollar DLC while many bugs exist from Arma 2 plus more.  I cannot reccomend a game that the developers don't want to optimize or bugfix.The developers need to focus on the many optimization issues in multiplayer servers(vanilla multiplayer servers have issues). The game is basically, it runs at 30 FPS on  GTX 970 with and I7 processor in basically any vanilla multiplayer server. You phase through walls and your character gets stuck on EVERYTHING. I have 980 hours on ArmA 2 (was a moderator on a server).  The game does some improvements over Arma 2, one being the weapon mechanics have been improved a bit. I would only recomend this game on a large sale.			",115,2,0,9,10,0,16

												If you are an Arma fan, this game will change all that. When you spen 60$ and your computer can't run it, It will be because your computer is crappy.When you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other Arma games, you will be called spoiled.When there is nothing to do offline, no point or story it's because it's still in the works even though it's a full release.When you can't eek out better than 10FPS no matter what your specs, it's because you didn't tweak enough.When you can't find a server to play on it's because you don't know the right clan.When you do get on a server and it lags, greifs and glitches, it's because you play on crappy servers.When you don't think it's realistic, it's not a sim. When you cant have any shoot'em up fun like BF it's because it is a sim.When all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not Arma3, it's not fair to compare.When you voice any of the above views here or the BI Forums you are a liar.http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?163875-I-am-a-player-of-BI-games-from-OFP-CWC-Heres-what-I-think ",27,0,0,2,5,0,15

												Arma 3 is a lot of fun. I say this as someone who enjoys the following elements in games that I devote a lot of time to: Extensive, detailed cooperative play, and realism/immersion. If you're going to Arma looking to play the next Counterstrike or whatever, you're going to walk away disappointed.Arma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter, and yes, there is Wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox, and Arma 2 had DayZ (Which let's face it, is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies), but to get the most out of an Arma game, you need to approach it for its strengths - the simulation aspect. You can play solo as a member of a squad (Depending on the mission - finding good missions can be a little tricky), or command AI using some non-traditional, but with some practice, easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game.In multiplayer, COOP is king in my opinion, but you can have large scale team-vs-team PVP which is a lot of fun as well. I admin a server that runs a large-scale coop mission 24/7 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the AI is smart enough in Arma games to allow for emergent gameplay - they'll flank, they'll fall back, they'll improvise, and it's different every time and you have to think. The engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter, but Arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other Bohemia games have been. Being different isn't a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though.If you're used to other games or approach it like a shooter, you might be annoyed with it, but if you give it time and learn it (and I can't stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it), it's hard to put down. Some of the best gaming experiences I've had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.Treat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved, not like a CounterStrike-Of-Dutyfield alike.Also steam sale so why the hell not?

												I remember playing this game after getting a taste of Arma 2 and i was so disappointed. I joined a Invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack AI. I was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. They told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of Arma team play. I joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. If you like millitary tactics and teamplay, Arma is right up your alley. It is not like any of the big fps's out there, you don't feel like a action movie super soldier. You feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. If you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. Nr. one advice.I watch this every time I wonder why i play arma and I just want more:

												Poorly optimizedRuns below 30FPS even on when set to normal/low settings. AMD 8350, 16gb DDR3 RAM, Samsung SSD, EVGA 960GT video card. Not the most hardcore rig, but able to run AAA games on high and in many cases ""ultra"" settings. Arma 3? 25FPS is the norm. Tiny sections like the VR training can go up to 60fps but do the prologue training scenario it dips hard, even on lower settings. Depends where you are, some areas make it way worse. The end of the prologue at night really dropped it hard. Never had any game lag my PC this bad. And again, I know it's not a hardcore rig. But I never set a game to medium-low settings and have it drop down to single-digit framerate. Not much more than Arma 2All in all this is just an iteration ahead of Arma 2. Most of what you want gameplay-wise can be had in Arma 2. The improvements are all miniscule. The interface is a tiny bit more straight-forward. Controls are still crap all around, especially for driving. Many many other games do driving with keyboard and mouse better. Anyhow Arma 2 suffers from odd controls too.Also wtf with people taking 1 whole second to register a shot. The prologue firefight and in VR training both you shoot someone, the bullet contacts, count it 1 second 1 mississippi.....and then the guy drops. This goes for leggers, arm shots, chest shots, and head shots. He is standing there, bullet hits....still standing there....and then his neck curves and he drops to the ground. It's like playing against someone in the Arctic over the internet. And that is singleplayer. SummaryI ended up getting my refund approved just a few minutes ago. I was going to leave it at that, I get my $48 back for the Apex Edition on sale and walk away. But no. Arma 3 left a sour taste in my mouth. I read many complaints about optimization and they are true. I ignored them to my detriment. This game is a steaming pile of unoptimized sh-t and won't run even on an above-decent rig that can play anything else just fine. Not only does Arma 3 run slow it looks like a crappy 10 year old game when you do get it to reach 30fps. Avoid until it's $10. Anything more is the devs being greedy.			",244,13,4,18,33,0,65

You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!!  The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from ""years ago"". Those games being ""Choplifter"", Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, ""Good Luck guys"", and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, ""Black Hawk Down"" for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, ""Battlezone2"", that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world.     Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community. More friends more fun..... WIN WIN!               And the Mods! End of Story..... See you in the battle soldiers! Be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around, ""Make Arma Not War"" is going to add so much and I have high hopes for the future of Arma 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Old Review*This game is fun if you can run it. I cannot because I have an AMD cpu. I couldn't get a refund becuase i spent time trying to troubleshoot and now have 13 hrs when I only played around 2. My fps was constantly 30 or less even though according to the recommended specs I should be able to run it decently. I will change this if the Devs actually decide to fix the AMD problems because I am not going to pay 200+ dollars for a CPU. The way it is going it doesn't look like this will be fixed. I will try to run it again and again to see if they fix it. I am really hoping they do.*New Review*So recently i had to upgrade my computer and got a good deal on an intel cpu. Now that I am actually able to play the game I would recommend it to peopel with an INTEL CPU. I still do not recommend the game on this review because those of you that may have AMD cpus will most likely not be able to run this. The work arounds I have seen to make AMD cpus run well are confusing and don't work half of the time. My final thought is to pick this up only if you can run it as it is a very fun game. If you can't run thi sjust buy Insurgency or some other tactical shooter.			",155,12,2,9,13,0,10

												BESTEST GAME EVER SINCE BATTLEFIELD2!yes, I said it =)If you played BF2 and you loved it, but hated all its successors... Arma3 is the deal. This game is what should`ve followed BF2, it`s pure, awesome, tough and unforgiving warfare. It`s NOT made for easy (or rather noobish) play, you can`t run for a mile and expect to be able to shoot straight the instance you stop running; you can`t either fly your AttackHelicopter slamming into trees and buildings along the way and expect to be alive... ArmA does not do that, you die, you get hurt, in any case, you do stupid stuff... you will pay for it.It`s a Mil-Sim, not an Arcade-Shooter like all the other ""tripleA"" titles out there: you want a challenge? - get ArmA3!you want realistic movement? - get ArmA3!you want realistic weaponshandling? - get ArmA3!you want honest (!) and hard working developers? - get ArmA3!you want a game with HUNDREDS (or more) mods to chose from as you like? - get ArmA3!you want your own skill to be the baseline on how your play has influence on the battle/game? - get ArmA3!By all the good stuff mentioned, it`s only fair to tell about bad/unfortunate things Arma3 offers:This game needs a good CPU, not an ok one, a good CPU... and a fair amount of tweaking to get it run somewhat smoothly.And for MultiPlayer: Client`s performance is dependant on Server`s performance, you can have a beast computer, but if the server you play on sucks, your fps will suck aswell.You`ll have to learn this game before you can be really good at it...and then when you`re good, Arma3 is deeply satisfying.Just for personal comparison: I now have more hours of Arma3 playtime (1500h+), than ALL hours of ALL Battlefields I`ve played over the years combined! Thats the message, yes =)AND IT DOESNT GET BORING YET!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: 9/10 rating.Why not 10? Multiplayer FPS and stability problems. Why nothing less? Read below.ARMA 3 is one of my all-time favourite games. Yes, I don't have thousands of hours in it... but after getting back into King of the Hill (currently level 54 on it with 300+ hours in that mission/mod alone), I plan to change that. First game of mine to break 1000 hours... here I come!Singleplayer runs beautifully though note that, even on regular difficulty, the AI can, and will, shred you unless you play to the absolute best of your ability... but even then...Multiplayer, while not being the best in terms of stability and/or framerate (whether that be the fault of the servers or game's code), excels in other ways that games like Battlefield don't. Easily my favourite gamemode/mod/mission is King of the Hill -- 3 teams all fight it out in a ~500m radius circle. What makes it better than just 'run in and kill' like the Battlefield series? Vulnerable progression. You start out with a TRG 5.56mm; it's okay but you're going to lose most gunfights without the element of surprise. You want that next gun, scope, launcher or vehicle? Work for it. You earn money from vehicle destroys, kills, revives, healing teammates and sitting in the AO (the circle).There are other great modes such as Wasteland which is similar to King of the Hill but, instead, everyone's spread far out across (typically) Stratis. You can group up with people or go lone wolf. Kill people, loot them, get money, buy things, kill more people. The thing that I dislike about Wasteland in comparison... is the lack of progression. It's just a sandbox pick-up and play gamemode/mission.What I'd like to see happen with ARMA 3:- improved multiplayer performance and stability- free, non-DLC weapons and vehicles ported from ARMA 2 (and Chernarus too)- more than just 2 sniper rifles in Marksman DLC -- so many people are disappointed with the lack of content coming from these DLCs- something valuable and proper in the expansion of Late 2015			",222,11,8,4,11,0,18

												After playing many hours on ArmA III, from a realistic perspective and a fun one; it is a great experience for anyone who loves military simulators[en.wikipedia.org]. The game is divded into several categories if you will: Infantry, Airborne, Waterborne, Artillery, Armoured, Mechanized and HQ - it covers all of the basics (plus advanced) on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself. Personally, I prefer being behind a console managing UAVs/UGVs! The successor of ArmA II has certainly taken on the role of ""NEXTGEN"" and demolished competition such as America's Army and DCS World.The RV4 Engine[arma3.com] is used for DayZ Standalone and ArmA 3 thus far. Though DayZ developers have recently announced the change of their [heavily] modified engine, it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of ArmA III to life. The detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most. In the majority of games I have experienced during my past, graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as Call of Duty, (some) Battlefield games and even ArmA II. The level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of ArmA III is insanely good.Pros:» Detailed, well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors: CSAT, NATO, FIA, Guerillas and even civilians.» Realistic sound effects for particular weapons, majority of them being rifles and pistols.» Ability to perform one of many roles: armour, infantry, etcetera.» Well established storyline for the campaign: even split into acts for more development time.» Realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the IFV-6c Panther - when moving over rough terrain, there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world. Excellent detail!» Generally great game to play.» ...Many, many more.Cons:» Ladders are extremely buggy. Climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder.» Artificial Intelligence needs a rework. Their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting. Earlier today I told my men to hold fire yet they continued, even when disengaged.» No built-in immersive radios. External mods required: Task Force Arrowhead Radio, ACRE, etcetera.» Although one of the factions are based on NATO, it is all American equipment and characters - voice acting is American for example.» Editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications.» Animations in general could do with a bit of a rework.Overall, I would rate the game about 8/10 simply based on my hours within ArmA III. I played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since. It was great to be a part of that development process and I am glad I bought the game early. Really excellent game! I love it!

												Finally purchased Arma3 while it was reasonably priced and worth the real value of the game(s). The main problem is the game engine is POORLY optimized and HORRIBLE engine code. It's likely the engine for Arma3 had been rushed, it’s very clear the advances of mainstream computing were completely ignored. It’s like the developers were hiding under a rock.Even with a high end system, which is mostly used for rendering purposes within Professional applications [5960X, 128GB memory, 512 SSD, 4Titan], this game has trouble. I can run more demanding applications which ARE optimized without a hicup. Still Haswell-E are superior to Devil's Canyon and Skylake processors.With everything on ULTRA settings the game tends to jitter and textures do not fully load. So with some optimizations within the startup parameters the game ends up being quite pleasent. My tweaks:-window -high -nopause -skipintro -nosplash -useallavailablecores -cpucount=16 -maxmem=24576 -malloc=systemFor others, if you would like to use the above parameters the following tips for each parameter:1. The first five parameters are optionalALLOWS WINDOW MODE-window PLACES APPLICATION IN HIGH PRIORITY-highSETS THE GAME API TO ACTIVELY REFRESH IN THE BACKGROUND. It is especially useful for those using Athena or multiple displays. **** if this is not used, the game will seem frozen when it loses focus, meaning if you alt-tab to another application.-nopauseSKIPS STARTUP INTRODUCTION SCENES / MOVIES-skipintroSKIPS SPLASH SCREEN WHILE LOADING THE GAME, but not the addons splash-nosplash2. The last parameters tell the application to ignore the default ARMA engine settings set by BI developers.USES ALL CORES, BI has the application set as AUTO... but AUTO does not work and continues to use ONE core. BI DEVS have known of this issue since ARMA first released and for over a decade has not been resolved.-useallavailablecoresNEARLY THE SAME AS ABOVE, but informing the application HOW many cores your processor has. [red]**REMOVE THE ** AND TEXT WHEN ENTERING YOUR SETTINGS** [/red]-cpucount= **PHYSCIAL CORES+VIRTUAL CORES**ALLOWS THE APPLICATION TO USE A MAX DESIRED AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL MEMORY, though it doesn't literally use that, it's a reserve and the applicaiton may only see 1GB of memory rather than, in my case, 128GB of memory and NOT allocate memory correctly. [red]**REMOVE THE ** AND TEXT WHEN ENTERING YOUR SETTINGS**[/red]-maxmem= **ENTER at least 60-80% of your system memory**CUSTOM MEMORY ALLOCATOR *I prefer and suggest to others to use the SYSTEM string. There are others, but TBB4 and SYSTEM are the most mainstream and updated code. The reason this was added in the first place by BI develoeprs... is because ARMA is incapable of managing memory!!! LOL! Certainly tells you something about BI development.-malloc=systemThe main reason I would NOT recommend this game is because you have to search for the optimizations yourself. BI, developer, does NOT actively provide you the information upon installing the game and forces you THE PAYING CUSTOMER to use Bohemia Interactive developers brain-cell-lacking-mind DEFAULT applicaiton settings. I can name several high end simulation online games on the market that provide such options prior to launching the game. It's a simple GUI requesting CPU, GPU info and preferences. In any sense, if these developers had any, these options (among others) would be presented PRE- launching the application, that means every single application tweak that is KNOWN and UNKNOWN with a thorough explaination to each setting and string. Developers expect customers to purchase faulty and buggy software at exuberant prices yet they cannot fathom HOW to develop an application or provide functional and necessary settings for their customers. Though, not that alone, customers have to spend hours to adjust the game and search for the information. It’s a game… not a research paper for a doctoral thesis! If this is the case then Bohemia Interactive among other developers can start paying their customers for setting up the application on their system.In conclusion, these developers need to get their heads out of the sand!

												Much better than Call of Duty and Battlefield. This game does a very great job in immersing you into the environment. Your team A.I. can get killed leaving you the only one left in the squad. The bullets snap and whiz around you. There are many choices of vehicles to choose from all with different roles and abilities. Kinda wish there were more guns that's just my opinion but the fewer choices bring simplicity in the game. The underwater subs and scuba suits are also very awesome, totally wished they had sharks that would bring some thrills. Also the graphics over all are sexy all over, pleasing your eyes with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic glee.			",309,27,5,20,30,1,38

												ArmA III, the fourth game in the ArmA series, if we include the original Operation Flashpoint as well. Many mainstream 'FPS gamers' complain about ArmA's style, because it's unique? That's exactly why I love this game. You really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game. But once you have control over the game, you'll find tons of enjoyable content. You'll find yourself playing around with the editor, campaign with great storyline, 2 beautiful islands to explore, customizable gear, multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay. What else do you want? Yeah it might have some bugs and lag. But, if you look back at ArmA 2, not many complained about it though ArmA 3 is highly improved from the previous title. ArmA is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come. You'll always find ways to emerge into ArmA's gameplay. It's ultimately up to you to be creative. Because of Bohemia Interactive's hard work on unique warfare gameplay, and immersive experience, I'd give it 9/10 :)			",28,2,1,5,4,0,1

												Having played a decent amount of single and multiplayer i have to say that so far this game is simply amazing while I don't have the best graphics card around I still meet the requirements that I can still easily get in to a game and enjoy myself completely.This is the game that COD and BF players avoid because they can't get kill streaks or do a bum rush to a vehicle to make life easier which to me is not a really decent representation of what warfare is. When was the last time you saw a battle in the news or heard from a person that was won because some guy chucked a knife over a few buildings? ",210,48,4,29,39,1,59

When you think they reached the best anyone can do, you notice the Beta or Alpha in the name, that tells you that isn't even the best they can do. From Arma II and pretty much all the expansion packs, to Arma III.

												Cannot and will not stop playing. Logged over 850 hours and still going strong. The game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking Bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form Arma 2 or Ones that are completely new come onto the scene. With all the current DLC and the Marksman DLC on its way plus the winners of Make Arma Not War announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. Whether its life you're into, base building on Wasteland/Epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on King Of The Hill, If zombies is your thing try Breaking Point (These being the most popular) , If you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong. But i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). There are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your Arma experience. It may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.			",95,6,1,11,4,1,7

												I've owned this game for a long time. Been a fan of all arma games for a long time. But this game can not be reccomended to anybody because it's obviously not finished. These DLCs they keep releasing are all things that should be given to the community, us alpha users (If I may, I'm sure I can speak for a lot of us, if not most) feel robbed when we see that we have to pay for something that should've been added before full release. Not only do the modders create the community and the missions, but even simple crap like bipods! Even COD has bipods guys. What kind of a joke is a Karts DLC anyways? In a ""war simulator""? LOL even to this day, this game is not finished, and will never have as many vehicles as Arma 2 unless you buy tons of DLCs. DO NOT buy this game unless you have the money and are prepared to be dissapointed. It is still a fun game, but this company is money hungry and will keep making DLCs to charge for. It really seems like there should be a class action law suit going on here though..			",84,4,8,10,7,0,1

												I definitly recommend this game. Why? No matter what kind of game you want to play, you find it in ArmA3. If you want an authentic tactical expierence, download some mods like ACE/ACRE and join a realism unit. More intrested in survival? Then hop on a wasteland or dayz server. Team Deathmatch? Then battleroyale is for you. Even if you like roleplay (altis life) or sector control (king of the hill) you will find what you are looking for.Graphics: 17/20, the game looks great overral, with beautiful landscapes, lightning and weather.Sound: 7/10, nothing too fancy here, but nothing bad either. If you want great sounds, then just download a mod.Storyline: 10/15, way better campaign than ArmA2, but let's be honest, there are better campaigns around. Don't play this game if you intend to only play it singleplayer, then you will be dissapointed.Gameplay: 28/30, absolutly great. The diversity of guns and vehicles in the main game is already great, and there are tons of mods around to get more weapons and vehicles. The scenario editor allows you to create simple and fun scenarios in a matter of seconds, and more advanced scenarios if you have the scripting expierence. Optimization: 12/15, lot's of people complain about this, which is something I don't understand. You don't need the best PC in the world to run this game on high settings, and you can adjust every setting in the game, allowing you to get the best perfomerance possible. For me, it runs fine on very high-ultra settings on a i3-3240 3.4GhZ duo core and a GTX 750ti with 40fps in multiplayer.Controls: 6/10, there is a great amount of controls to learn, which means there is quite a big learning curve for them. Aside from that, the default interaction menu is pretty horrible and glitchy, but then again, there are mods to fix this.Overal: 80/100. Just buy this game, I have enjoyed over 400 hunderd hours in this game, and still counting.			",85,24,0,22,31,1,34

												Arma 3 is a ""marmite"" game. Either you love it or someone you know who loves it continuously jams it down your ♥♥♥♥ing throat until you give in and also love it or grow to despise it even more than you did before. For me i love this game, and so do most of my friends luckily or else you could be certain there would be a lot of throat jamming coming from me... wait no thats not what i meant! i meant oh nevermind forget it...

												I can not recommend buying this game no matter how much i like it.Deep down theres an amazing milsim to be found here, but its plagued with decade old bugs and issuesArma 3 uses the Real Virtuality 4 engine, which is a modern version of the same engine that ran the original Operation Flashpoint.The way the engine handles AI, physics simulation and your hardware resources are just abyssmal.Constant desyncs, constant loss of your performance the longer you play, no matter what your hardware, you will end up with a choppy game experience.Its a shame really.

												Great game, but why are the DLC's so expensive for almost no content? Compared to Arma 2, where a 20 dollar DLC was a whole new campaign, and the helicopter one for A3 is what... 2 helicopters, 1 mission, 4 training modules?  what is this♥♥♥♥♥♥bohemia? I thought you were better than this.  Until you fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC prices, I can't justly reccomend this game to anyone, especially when you pay $60 for a game that has a $20 paywall for crappy amounts of content.			",193,31,5,22,31,2,31

												I've noticed a lot of improvement graphically and mechanically in the Arma 3. However, the campaign is very boring and dull, which is really to be expected for a war simulator like Arma. When playing scenarios I've been trapped from house to house. One time I was cornered in a tiny house because there were 10 guys surrounding the compound. I somehow managed to kill like 5 of them before being shot. I quickly ran out and I was lucky to take cover. Most times in Arma, you can't do that. Which is interesting. Also, one time I got into an suv and I was supposed to kill this one guy in this crowd, so I crashed my car into the crowd and needless to say a bunch of people died. However, I was quickly killed because it's not like gta. The bullets go right through the car and shot me. There are glitches and it can be really boring at times. But experiences like these make it worth wild to buy. I encourage you to experiment with this game. 9.5/10			",31,0,0,5,1,0,7

												I've had this game since the first day of Alpha, and I can confidentally say that nothing comes close to Arma 3 in potential except maybe Arma 2 and minecraft. It's a fantastic sandbox military simulator where you can do anything you could imagine, no matter how dumb. It's a game where content is developed by the community, for the community. There are no set game modes or official servers, there aren' even any official game modes you can even download on their website. It's a completely player created game. Feel like invading either the islands of Altis and Stratis one minute and then role-playing as a drug dealer the next? Sure, why not. It's completely possible in Arma 3.Pros:• Almost limitless potential.• Close to an unlimited number of gamemodes created by the community.• Hundreds of community made campaigns and mods both avaliable on the workshop and on Armaholic (the go-to place for Arma mods).• Massive maps with none of those dumb loading screens every other game with maps on these scales seem to have. (Stratis is ~15-20km2, Altis is 270km2).• Large maps load very well and are very stable.• The ability to have infantry, armor, naval, and air battles at the exact same time on a much larger scale than you could imagine in another game such as Battlefield.• A wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and clothing.Cons:• Vehicles tend to explode a bit easier than they should.• Possibility of desync occuring on servers if they are overloaded.• Hit markers and boxes can be a bit buggy and glitchy.• Possibility of some pretty big lag. (Adding too many items/vehicles/AI/players to the game's already massive maps).As you can see, the pros easily outweight the cons. This game is fantastic. Even if you don't want to pay the full price for it, it goes on sale often enough and I promise, you won't regret it.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been with the serie since the first Arma and played countless of hours with A1, A2 absolutely loving the experience. My main interest in Arma games was always the mil sim part (not interested in any rpg/zombie modes) and so far A2 OA is the best for that. Sadly Bohemia got creative and put the A3 in the near future, with more futuristic forces what pretty much killed the ""realistic mil sim"" part for me.But still A3 is a great game. It's unbelievably moddable so I was able to get my modern military fix quickly with user created units.So, the good:-upgraded graphics engine-gigantic map-bipods! Yea, after few years they put bipods in game!-shooting from vehicles - same as with bipods - finally!-new more smooth and natural animations-game is super moddable-as usual great mission editor (I pretty much spent all my time creating my own missions).-driving is way more enjoyable than in any prev ArmasNow the bad:-no female soldiers/civilians -(if COD could we can too)-insane gun swaying and bobbing, gets infuriating-stamina - your soldier will fall on his face after running for 10 seconds-compare to A2 not that many various units-still no tank/apc interiors-lots of people reporting insane lag/fps issues MP and SP.Its a great game, and you can pretty much mod it to whatever you want - rpg/zombies/survival (blah...booring)/ military ops/racing- peek your fix.Still, if you are looking only for realistic military sim - get Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and put the ACE mod into it - it will be insanely good and sadly better experience than A3.Great game, sadly not the best in the Arma franchise.

												I'd rate this game 10/10. I am not a big fan of fast paced run and gun FPS games. But this game seemed different and always interested me, but it was so expensive for a game I wasn't sure I'd love. After an amazing sale at christmas, I decided to take the chance on it. Knowing what I know now, I'd have no qualms paying full price.  Pros1.Single player missions are actually pretty good and a great way to learn how to play before you join real people. I    thought the Apex missions were flat out amazing. I didn't want to stop playing.2.Plenty of multiplayer servers with all game types to play.3.Being able to host free private games for friends is great(Getting your router setup takes a few minutes, but it is easily found on youtube)4.So many mods to customize the game5.If you have the power to run it, Ultra settings are pretty nice looking6.The battlefield effects are pretty amazing. Cons1.A little pricey for the whole package(but worth it imho)2.There isn't info in the game explaining how to setup for hosting games, you have to use Youtube or forums(once you find the right info, it is fairly simple)3.No in game friends system, which seems odd for a multiplyer team game			",25,2,3,1,12,0,2

												The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands. With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.			",11,0,1,0,1,0,0

Once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tl;dr up front: Yes, without question, you should own this title.After 400+ hours of gaming, I feel as if I should share my opinions about Arma 3. In many ways it is the most versatile game out there: it's a tactical shooter, military simuilator, role-playing game and fps all rolled into one. The online multiplayer has no equal. You can do anything you want.Get this game,			",48,1,0,1,1,0,4

												I tried to enjoy this game, but I could not. I have several aspects I'd like to point out to make clear why I don't recommend buying this game:1 - A totally unoptimized engine The graphics in this game are great, no doubt about that. But the engine and the FPS I am getting definetely are not. My PC has up-to-date-components which do meet the recommend requirements, except for my graphics card. It is a GTX 760, recommended one is a GTX 680 though. I accept that I cant get the best amount of FPS with this card in a a game like Arma 3 - but only 27 FPS Max in a multiplayer match with ~ 10 people online and the graphics settings at low, view distance set to 1000 and with shadows deactivated? This is not a fault of my 760, it is because the engine of this game is totally unoptimized. 2 - An AI which is dumb as f***I expect, that the AI in a game that is based so heavily on teamwork is atleast ACCEPTABLE. But this is not the case in Arma 3, no! The AI of the comrades you will lead during several singleplayer missions is so bad, that I would need to look for a word to describe it. They resist to follow your orders instantly, for example when you tell them to enter a car. They will walk around like a headless chicken before finally remembering that there is a car they should enter. And if you're unlucky, they won't enter the car at all. This is just one exmaple, but there are many cases where the AI would have to be improved. Maybe in Arma 4, which I certainly won't buy if they keep their attitude towards the game and the players like in Arma 3.3 - Terrible mission designThere are several missions which do just have terrible design. For example a mission where you have to make your way through a destroyed town with tons of enemies, vehicles (which I couldn't use for some reason) and barely any supplies. But this is not the only case. There are several other missions with a bad design, where you maybe have to walk for several minutes, or run to keep up with your mate and then encounter an enemy squad but you can't hit any of them because your level of fatigue is too high so that your hands shake and can't aim as you would need too. Sure, it might be realistic, but here it is just GAMEBREAKING. Luckily there is a way to skip a mission: Hold down Shift and - on your numpad and then type ""endmission"" (you can release Shift and - while typing). And I am thankful for this option because I was stuck forever with this one particular mission, but let's move on.4 - (Small) Things that could have been betterThere are some small things aside from the big ones that coould have been better if the developers would have taken more time to improve the game. For example the body armor in the singleplayer. Depending on what pieces of armor you're wearing, you get an armor rating (which you can't see anywhere), and the amount of shots you can tolerate before dying depends on that rating. Sometimes I would just die from one shot (and no, it wasn't the .408 CT or the 99x108mm (.50) that hit me) and wonder why I died although I was wearing armor (note that I am talking of the singleplayer) and the enemy did take like 4 shots to kill! Seems like my armor rating was not high enough. But how should I know? See, the problem is that you can't know, because nowhere is written how good that armor is. It would've been nice if they would have given every piece of armor a value, like ""0"" for no protection, ""40""-""70"" for decent protection and ""100"" for high protection.They should have also provided checkpoints for campaign levels. Well, you can save manually, bu if you forgot to and die, well you will be kinda annoyed when you have to do the whole mission again and let me tell you that the missions are not short ones. But  there are also  good things about the game. The graphics are beautiful and if you have a high amount of FPS I'm sure that the multiplayer provides alot of fun. Thee are also so many vehicles from tanks to submarines, artillery,  jets, choppers, attack boats...  There is also an option to make time passing by faster. Press the key to the left of ""Backspace"" to increase time's speed, and the button left to this one to decrease time's speed. Especially useful when you have to  walk forever again.And another aspect I like are the realistic ballistics of the guns depending on their ammunition type. ""But CaVe_DoVah, you wrote that u don't like it when u die from one shot. Seems like u have no idea and are not trustworthy!"" No, wait. I wrote that I did not like the system with the armor rating. But the ballistics should stay like they are, because what would a military simulator be without realistic ballistics?I think that everyone should decide on their own whether they buy this game or not. I just tried to help you (and hope I succeeded) with this choice by writing about the negative aspects, since there are enough reviews already which cover the good ones enough. I personally regret to have bought this game, mostly because of the FPS I am getting although I am close to the recomended requirements, but hey, that's just my opinion.			",30,1,0,3,0,0,0

												I've never played any ARMA before ARMA 3. I really didn't know what to expect. I was somewhat, bewildered, you could say. This game is a pretty difficult one to learn. Even as i'm still learning the game, there is a never a moment I regret buying this title. 100% worth it, good quality, good community(modding community as well), and excellent gameplay.

												I picked this game up when it first came out and have spent tons of time playing it since then.  As with all the previous Arma series it has its problems (most of which I believe, should have been fixed before being sold to the public), but even with its faults it is still the closest thing to a real infantry simulator that a non-military person can purchase.With mods the game gets even better and more playable, and less 'sci-fi' like.  Also, I've never played any of the single player stuff that comes with the game, I only do multiplayer with my group and I really enjoy it.Things to watch out for;  you need a fast processor for this game - DO NOT buy it if your CPU isn't over 3.5 M.  All of the Arma games are CPU intensive and this one is the worst for it.Don't expect it to be easy - this isn't Call of Duty or some other 'fps' that has the AI standing around waiting for you.  They'll hide, shoot at distance and even chase you around.  Use real-world tactics, if you're with friends, and see how well they work (they do), think 'stay alert' and you'll survive longer.There's loads of stuff I could say about this game, but really I play it for about 20 hours or so a week and really enjoy it.

												This game offers a lot. And I mean A LOT. You can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. Or you could roleplay and buy an ATM from all the drug money you earned in Altis Life. Or have races with friends in Karts. This game is an Army Simulator, but it's great for modding which let's you do more things.Now, this game isn't something like COD or Battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. If you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. Although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. Please don't think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. It takes skill.Altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. There is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. There is also Stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than Altis. You need a good PC to run this game. I usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it.Overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you can't get bored of it. I give it a 9.5/10			",65,8,3,3,8,0,1

												So i played it for a little bit... Arma is by far  my favorite game, This is because of what arma can offer with all the mods that can completly change the game. No other game i know you can be on a tactical mission with 60 other real people clearing towns and fighting to complete an objective then when you get to that objective..... ♥♥♥♥ing zombies come and eat your whole squad and no one survives.Arma is and i think always will be my favorite game because even though i have over 1000 hours i know that at least 500 of them have been below 30 fps and i also know that arma is so good i dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥that it is less than 30 frames because when your pinned down for literally 3 hours in a gunfight 30 fps is not your main problem.

												Probably the closest thing that us, the general population, has towards a realistic military simulator/game.I suggest that you do not buy this if you are expecting a linear fast paced action game like CoD or Battlefield, this is much more in-depth then that. This is not simply, running around 360 no scoping people. Squad Managment and effective communication is necessary. There is also something that you can't experience in the said titles above, which is long-range combat. (An example of this is preforming an assault on a base/camp with armor, artillery and other assests from varying distances from your own base.However, this is still a game and should be taken lightly from time to time. I suggest learning how to do tricks in the littlebird (MH9-Hummingbird) and exploiting the terrible physics. This game has multiple different gamemodes and tasks that could be simulated. So you'll never have the same experience twice.Pros:-Very Realistic.-Great Graphics (If you can run them).-Interactive Environment.-Realisitc Vehicals (Most of the time).------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-Physics (You will hear ""Arma Physics"" referred to multiple times).-Muliplayer Optimization.-Very steep learning curve but you will appreciate it over time. (More of a learn as you play)-Occasional Crashing.-Controls will more than likely conflict your normal keyboard setup, I suggest using the Arma 2 setup. Overall10/10Even if you don't think this is for you, trust me, the teamwork involved in this game is beyond amazing, the amount of co-op I've played counts for 95% of my game time. I've met tons of new people from this and they're like family to me.			",91,27,3,8,20,1,7

												Early into the game, I noticed a few problems. The graphics are a little dated, but hold up overall. The big problem I see, is with the constant fadeout to FMV. This seems to occur so frequently throughout the Prologue, I began wondering what the point of the game actually was. I get it, that this was a tutorial phase; However, I could do with less fadeaway's and more actual gameplay. With the Con's out of the way, I like the realistic feel to the game, from the weaponry and equipment, to the military jargon, it has an air of authenticity, which makes these types of games appealing to many. Arma 3, may have it's flaws, but overall it isn't a bad game. If I were in charge, I would have modernized the graphics a bit, and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment, the movement of the weeds, grass and tree's in the wind, and other little things to enhance the immersion experience. Still a recommendable game for those interested in Army Warfare Sims.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Eggbeast's Unsung Vietnam mod (and a bit of Tanoa), is the ONLY reason I have put so many hours into this game. Altis and Stratis are terrible maps, the vehicles just don't seem right, it took over a year and a half to get the game to a satisfactory level. If it weren't for user content (and Arma fandom) this could have flopped.Recommended only because theres any Army of people out there working to enhance the game experience, via missions and mods. They're doing this for free and BIS is making sales from it. I know of at least 15 people that have bought the Apex DLC just to play the Vietnam mod.Playtime before Unsung; 130 hours.

												I gave this a shot over the free weekend and here's what I learned: 1. You need an incredibly modern and powerful gaming PC to run attractive graphics with this. My system is 5 years old,  570 GTX can barely run this at the lowest graphics settings possible, and that's barely getting 30 fps.  2. The amount of key mapping you need to do to make this even somewhat manageable as a ""game"" is insane. Basically, you need one of those 7 or 9 button gaming Mice, because you won't have enough sensible keyboard key locations to cover all of the crap. 3. For a game where voice communication is extremely necessary, the voice comm functionality in this game is quite limited, but that's not really an issue because everyone is going to be using TS3 anyway... 4. Good luck finding a decent server to play on. Most of them are run by fascist bronys. Others are run by incompetent admins and you can count on getting spawnkilled by your own team over and over until you leave and find a different server.  No, I'm not kidding.  5. The game isn't worth 60 dollars.  The rest of the game (that's right, you don't actually get the whole game for 60 dollars, you need all of the DLC too because the only good weapons are locked)  is going to run you even more.  So it's over $100 game that isn't worth playing unless you have a $2,500 computer and a $120 mouse. 6. It seems like, if you met all of the requirements above,  the game *could* be enjoyable.  Just know what you are really getting yourself into...  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ]; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.Hitler actively sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.

												Where do I begin?At the obvious point that A3 supports less active objects in a game than A2?(Protip: Rocket is the main developer and inventor of DayZ. This is his post on Reddit from way back in 2012)http://i.imgur.com/snbxf8i.pngOr that the game at it's point when it released should have been Alpha?http://dev.arma3.com/sitrep-00035Or all the bug fixes they do after the ""full game"" released that should have been fixed in Beta?http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?149636-Development-Branch-Changelog/page14Or how you can't put glasses in crates but you can put them on the ground?http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=2301Or the part where they falsly advertised 8 factions that never got put into the game?http://www.battlefield.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1355413881_731_FT0_arma3natointernational.jpgJust because Medal of Honor Warfighter released:http://www.offdutygamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-banner.jpgOr that thing about almost all vehicles having Israel as country of origin, for both Allied forces and Opposing forces.http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?163264-Reality-CheckHow about the one jet for only the independent faction when they advertised F35s and MV-22s?http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/06/b2cfcc91-43879.jpghttp://h5.abload.de/img/290412_223952534318151sjul.jpgOr the obvious fact that you need a monster machine to run this game at decent fps?

			Views: 625,806		

			Components list: http://lpc.pcgamer.com For your entertainment and delight, we cranked up every video setting in Arma 3. Captured on our very own Large Pixel Collider.		

What you get when you pay for this unfinished product are:* The largest island in Arma Universe so far. Largest, not most optimized so expect fps drops.* A gear customization system that exceeds that of previous games.* Weapon Addons. Mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D zoom optics that looks plastic.* Scuba diving. Wow, such invention, great detail.* Mods for everything. Mods, mods, mods, mods. Can't find your vehicle? Add it with a mod. Can't find the mod? Create the mod.* A totally split up community of players with an unknown ratio of butthurt fans in denial and realists that has been betrayed by their favorite studio.* Refunds? Nope.While waiting for Arma 3 to be released as a full product, you can also wait for BIS's other projects:* DayZ 2* Take on Mars* VBS* Arma TacticsAnd to top it all off, when I made a thread to complain about all these promised things that they never put in the game on their official forum, they edited it heavily and left me looking like a fool:http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?167844-Thanks-to-Bohemia-Interactive-StudioOriginal post:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28058839/BIS%20Forum%20Thread.txtThey obviously know that they lack content but they aren't really good at damage control.

												I hope that one day ArmA will use more than 30% of PC resources and actually play well.The optimisation is horrid, the game won't use more than like a third of your resources, leading to horrible stuttering gameplay, can't utilise a good view distance etc.I have an i5 6600k overclocked, and a GTX 1070 overclocked with 16GB RAM, a very capable and pretty well high end computer in terms of performance, and average in terms of it's what most people will buy..With all the optimising and tuning down of some settings and a very minimal view distance, I still only average 40FPS with stuttering, sometimes a little higher, sometimes dropping down to FPS in the 20's inside planes.Can't help but feel I'd be getting close to 90+ FPS with settings turned up if the game would take full advantage of the system and use all of the resources..It's performance is simply just not the best it can be, and I hope they take the opportunity to revamp the engine for ArmA 4, or implement a revamped, better performing engine into the game we have.That's the bad, and unfortunately I have to put ""Don't recomment this game"" for anyone to take note of this, the performance is the only bad thing about this game.In terms of fun, it's the best thing in my library. Online server and mod support is amazing, best of any game I've played. Insert the mod into the game's root folder and load it up through the launcher, how amazing and simple is that? No game breaking tinkering involved, plug 'n' play pretty much.Gameplay minus performance is hectic, CoD and Battlefield ain't got nothing on ArmA. For the first time realism is fun, they pretty much nailed it. AI can be a little silly, but good for our time, and expected from un-scripted AI's in today's games.DLC (At least, Apex) was a little pricey, don't get me wrong, Apex is good, but not nearly original game's price good.Great game, my main and only beef with it is the performance, and that's why it gets the red thumb. When they fix performance I'll edit my review.			",24,2,0,7,6,0,3

You will be sure to never run out of content to play.-Regular Updates-Zeus mode.-Not like COD/BF.Cons:-Could be optimised a little better.-Requires a good gaming pc for it to work on high settings.-Very CPU intensive.

★★★★★★★★★★10/10Most incredible military simulation game I have ever played. Amazing graphics, true realism, believable ballistics on weapons, open world sandbox, large extensive battlefields and maps.A bit futuristic in terms of technology of the equipment (classic example is the numerous drone UAV models and types), which might not suit players who do not like modern weaponry and tactics.Other than that the game includes all, or most of the requested features for the previous versions and as a result presents a general advancement in the series (congratulations to the developers).I am satisfied with this game and I enjoy playing it, both multiplayer and single-player. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -""This is Lieutenant Cole, reporting target area has been secu--""""Woah, get down!""""This is two-five, we've got several technicals in the streets, taking heavy fire - requesting permission to withdraw to the mansion - out! --""""Zero-niner here, sit tight two-five, we have dispatched a helicopter squad for support, they're on their way to assist - ETA 17 minutes - I say again, sit tight, help is on its way - over.""""Zero-niner, we cannot hold this navpoint anymore - we need to pull back from this position, if we keep this up we're going to have too many damn wounded to move!

I might be biased, but this is worth the money 100%.The DLC, the community made mods and scenarios, the game itself, it’s all at the top of the pile when it comes to being a game spanning the entire military simulator genre. I have 700 hours in the game and I  KNOW  that it’s only the tip of the iceberg. The quality of some of the mods released for this game (all free, by the way) are worth the price of the game alone. Then comes the DLC from Bohemia, Free to access to all players, only difference by paying is almost entirely cosmetic bonuses. This is a great game, single player or multiplayer, it’s all good. If you like being immersed into an incredibly large and diverse world where split-second decisions matter, you will LOVE this title. Be warned though, if you are used to fast pace action shooters, this is not one of them.			",347,75,2,27,57,2,30

												If you love to simulate and experience LARGE scale combat (of any type) then you should own this right NOW...The ability to create literally any scenario that your mind can imagine using the mission editor, which is like Photoshop but for creating vile horrific wars instead of pretty pictures :-)Don't try to compare ARMA to any other FPS!This isn't just a game, it is a lesson...It will teach you how to understand ballistics and engage targets at long range using scopes correctly.You will learn how to read a topographical map & compass properly.It will make you understand the importance of team work.BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY you will get to experience shooting the living fu@k out of all your friends :-)With TrackIR (head tracking) this really is the ultimate MILSIMI've been waiting for a game like this ever since I used to play Blitz on my Commodore VIC-20 lolJust gets better and betterEVERYONE NEEDS THIS...

												There is a Soviet joke from early 80s that goes like this:Moscow, summer morning, Sheremetyevo airport.A representative of some very successful Japanese tech corporation heads back to his homeland after an official visit to USSR during which he observed the technological feats of Soviet people. Of course, a huge delegation of Party leaders and reporters is present, just like during any other event of this sort. So, as he walks to his plane, he becomes surrounded by reporters and they ask him, ""What have you liked the most about Soviet Union?"".— You have great children, they're so playful, happy and optimistic about their future.— Awesome! - reporters reply - and have you liked anything else?— You have great children.— Yeah, we love our children too, but what about our cars and TVs and fridges and roads and other things?— You have great children - the representative replies - but everything you make with your hands is terribly bad.So, Arma series has a really great community. An amazing one, really. I'm thoroughly convinced that no other game has a similar one. But everything made by Bohemia Interactive...Well, it's not exactly terribly bad (and at times it's quite good actually) but Arma, in a way, carries the spirit of Soviet Union's industry: a single manufacturer that gets most of its revenue from excellent military products also produces various civilian goods. These goods, however, while being suitable for their purpose, have a mediocre quality, especially compared to the products of Western companies. But it's the only manufacturer in the country and the Iron Curtain is still in place so you don't really have a choice but to recommend these products to your family and friends.You really like that Mercedes-Benz W123? Well, too bad, here's a ticket for UAZ-496, comrade.You're #47,254,875 in the queue. ",32,6,1,4,7,0,7

												ARMA 3 makes me feel like i'm actually a soldier, carrying out objectives and operations like a soldier too instead of this hyper-active nonsensual chaos that is Call of Duty and Battlefield.If you're a fan of ARMA or just hardcore games in general i seriously recommend this.Bohemia once again succeeds at delivering, improved AI and voice acting, stunning graphics and whole new arsenal of semi-futuristic guns, gadgets and vehicles that are sure to impress.Step into a world where one shot is all that is needed, where teamwork truly is important...

												One of the best military games available.Its sandbox style and modding/customizations allow it to become almost anything you want.Co-operative military simulator, role-playing game, survival horror, you name it.It offers so many possibilities it has an endless replay value.What this game is to me is a military simulator, it has a numerous amount of upgrades from the previous Arma 2/Op. Arrowhead, most importantly the infantry handling and animations that now offer much more flexibility and greater control over your character.Vehicles none the less have been upgraded, the new PhysX 4 engine gives vehicles a much more realistic feeling.Lights and scenario rendering have been not only upgraded, but made even LIGHTER for your pc to run, as opposed to the incredibly heavy Arma 2 engine that would put an incredible amount of stress even to the most high-end gaming rigs.The downside however is that as of now the game doesn't offer much sandbox content as in vehicles and weapons but the developers have already announced future free DLCs that would address this and add some other cool features.In conclusion i think this game offers infinite possibilities to those who can take advantage of them but it still needs some time to grow and reach its full potential, what we'll have then will be a game that is going to put to shame all the other commercial FPSs.

												Arma is a great game in a few ways and a terrible game in a lot of ways. If you're looking for something realistic this is it, well kind of. It's very deep and goes a long way to try and be realistic. In most ways it succeeds. In a few though it doesn't, the biggest example of this being the inclusion of 3rd person. 3rd person ruins it for me because players can peak around corners and over ledges with no penalty or chance of being seen while doing so. There's a ton of content, a large community (most of which are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but that's usual and shouldn't matter in a review imo), and a lot of thought still goes into this game. The bulk of your experience will be online multiplayer most likely. Possibly just messing around in the 3d editor though. The controls are vast and take a lot of getting used to. The movement is clunky as hell, the environments are ugly as hell (the jungle looks nice in trailers but there's only like 4 different tree assets that just repeat all over the place so after a few minutes you've seen it all) and that's extra $$$$. If you're going to get this because of FrankyPC's vids - don't. Those are scripted and this game is 80% running / driving and then some really clunky fights. I still recommend this game with those downfalls because it's still a ton of fun if you give it time to grow on you.			",52,2,1,5,9,2,2

												ARMA 3 definitely brought a lot of improvements from the previous installment of the series, the visual element is the best example, if you have a good enough computer, you can admire the beautiful scenery of Altis & Stratis.The map is even bigger than before, the single player campaign is interesting enough, it keep me entertained although it was difficult until i learned the controls and the stamina conditioning.The cons are still the same for me, too many controls to learn and master as i believe that the game would benefit from way simpler controls and the confusing + somewhat buggy squad of bots that you must control on the single player mode.I know this doesnt bother the multiplayer aspect, but it did bother on the campaign as they didnt obey certains which all more difficult.But i most certainly recommend ARMA 3 because its a great military simulation for those interested in such and it also can be whatever you want, just download the mod that suits you best.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have around 500 hours in Arma 3 at the time of writing this review.Arma 3 is both epic, and hugley frustrating for me.EPIC - as a military sim, it is outstanding. We heavily mod the game to our 'light' milsim requirements and frankly im blown away with how good things can be.FRUSTRATING - I have to have a few good friends do all the work preparing our missions, sorting our mod packs. I simply can't do it technically. Lucky I have some great friends, but it's alot of work for them (but it keeps them off the streets eh.........)The more standard mod's wasteland, exile, king of the hill etc are real fun if thats your thing.Be prepared to be immersed and have a blast with Arma 3!

												The most accessible game in the series, this is Bohemia Interactive's magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of Operation Flashpoint (now ARMA: CWC) and it's incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities  for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim.I have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, it's never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. One of the greatest titles I've had the pleasure of owning on the PC for many years.			",384,76,9,39,37,1,48

												ArmA2 has much more content and is far more realistic (only medic can heal and it takes a while, weapons acting as real life counterparts, in ArmA3 everything is 'balanced' and you can self-heal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button). ArmA2 has also more vehicles, more weapons, more everything... really, there is nothing to go for ArmA3 except a bit better graphic, but this is hardly anything important, especially because ArmA2 looks not much worse. Moreover it's been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible AI bugs. You don't have to take my word for it, watch a video:

This game isn't for someone who doesn't want to feel their heart beating quicker than they have ever felt it, but it is for the adrenaline junkie.Mods/Workshop items for this game greatly improve it, and without a shadow of a doubt, i would reccomend this game to ANYBODY who loves tactical/realistic shooters.

												Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield. The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ARMA 3 is a game in a class of its own and defines the genre of tactical military simulations. One of the greatest benefits is the modability and vast amount of user created content, that can be implemented in this very open sandbox. The first part of the campaign ""Survive"" showed that Bohemia Interactive made their game also interesting for singleplayer, but the true strength of ARMA 3 is for sure the multiplayer.Don't get me wrong - this game needs a certain level of dedication to get the maximum out of it, casual players probably won't get happy. If you want a unique mod- and mission-setting you cannot just create a game and simply ""hop in"". Hosting a MP-server with mods, creating MP-missions that work flawless with mods - all of this stuff can be quite complex and hard to be learned by one person alone. But if you decide to join a group or community that suites your style of play (action-, hardcore-simulation-, roleplay-orientated or somewhere in between) then you might get a most interesting and challenging game experience.

												So, I am changing this review after serious serious SERIOUS play time. To be honest, the full game doesn't offer much content, it does offer much better mechanics though, its very in-depth and can be fun for a long time. But after a while all the cool stuff fades away, and it begins to turn into a boring war sim. I love ArmA. It is my most played series aside from PAYDAY. But I feel like I can't love it anymore, in my opinion I give this game a 7 out of 10. Because the time I had with it was great. The unbiased opinion of this is a 9 out of 10. Because of how everything works together, the only problems is how bad the online is, you drop frames due to CONNECTION ISSUES. Thx bohemia, volvo pls fix. I say its worth 30 dollars			",320,20,5,16,28,2,24

												After building on their signature game engine Bohemia has truly put forward a simulation gem with Arma 3 that no other game franchise has even come close to matching.  This is where you hit the dirt, and find that bullets aren't all warning shots, and that the blood on your face can't be waited out, but that bullets will kill you, and that you'll have to wipe that blood off yourself.While it still isn't the most stable engine a game has run on, it's the most advanced one I know of, with all the trimmings of environment that effect the battle and without all the crashes of Battlefield 4.  Bohemia has brought the Arma series to it's highest point ever, and it's playability has been increased 200%.  I can't reccomend this game to everyone, but there's one great lesson learned in my time with Arma;I've ended missions in other games seemingly covered in blood, wearing a bandana and sporting no shirt but instead a big sculpted chest and a BFG in each hand... And yet, I'd rather I could just make it home with a mission well done and all of my team safe and sound...This is what Arma is...It's fighting a real fight, where you have to pace yourself and hold your breath, where a bullet in the face can kill a man regardless of whether he's controlled by a player or an AI.  It's using your map, intel and wits to determine the best angle of attack on an enemy position, and sighing in relief when you find out later that you picked a good entry point.It's being truly tense, when you lie hiding in the bushes, hoping the MRAP with a GMG turret didn't spot you when it's lights passed over you, and hoping that you can get everyone home safe at the end of the day.Hundreds of hours into this game, I have yet to be bored even on the most patiently conducted sniper missions.  There's a satisfying reward in every mission in this game, and maybe that's because you really have to work to make it out alive.  Seriously, put on your boots because as far as a game goes, this is as close as it gets.  This is Arma, and there is nothing else like it.~Valtros			",44,3,0,5,6,1,5

												Before you decide to downvote this review because its a negative recommendation, Please read. There are positive things about this game if you take your time to read this and/or the comments Ive posted below.Bohemia have gone down hill, even if their game has enhanced somewhat, its not worth anywhere near the price they sell it at and the fact that you have to pay for small updates they call DLC's is disgusting, I completley regret buying this game, we've payed a bunch of greedy frauds.The modding community could do better and their downloads are free. This is both disrespectfull to the average player and the modding community. Its like a ""Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself"" outlook on the whole consumer market of ARMA titles.Whilst I used to be a follower of ARMA titles, I refuse to accept the fact that bohemia are too ignorant to pay some kind of respect to the community, its beginging to look like a move EA would pull. -Youve brought our game for a overly-expensive amount of money and now that we release content that should have been present in the ALPHA version is now being released late so we can rip you off even more then we did before.This has completley ruined the positive vibes that I once had for Bohemia. Disgracefull.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the definitive military experience, sure it might be rough around the edges and maybe it can be a bit unforgiving at times, but no other military shooter out there comes even close to what ARMA 3 offers, unlimited replayability, thousands of campaigns and scenarios, mods, coop, vehicles, exploration, and above all a sense of total inmersion.With the upcoming free dlc, and a huge community behind it, Bohemia interactive have again struck gold, having played their games since Operation Flashpoint, it has been an awesome surprise to see how far they have taken the genre forward, although, be advised, Call of Warfare fans will be in for a shock as nothing they have learnt there will have much use in here!The graphics are amazing, the movement and controls are the best in the series, but be advised, you will have to take time to learn the ins and outs of the game, as it is sometimes unforgiving of even the slightest mistakes, eventually you get the hang of it and this game really shines!Must buy!Get your gun soldier and hit the dirt!

												At first I was very skeptical about Arma III. Playing Arma II was not such a pleasant experience, and I was very happy that I haven't wasted my money on this when the Day Z mod came out, So I bought Arma III expecting something as bad as the previous Arma. But I was surprised. The graphics, movement, squad management, driving and many other features were massively improved. I`m not even talking about shooting. Recoil and gun damage is so realistic. But the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since Arma II. Now you can easily see whats on the ground, or in the vehicle, or simply add attachments for your gun ( which  are awesome! ). There`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag. The only things that needs fixing are glitches and AI. Glitches should be fixed in future patches, but the AI need some work done. The AI could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time. Sometimes AI just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting, or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots. I think Bohemia Interactive should really focus on this problem, because its not so serious as it is irritating, All in all, if you want some new experience of shooting game that requests some planing, patience and cooperation instead of ""being your own little Rambo"", you definitely should check out Arma III.

												This is a great millitary simulator and takes a special type of player to play. It has a great modding community and most content from the previous games can be used in this one if you own them. Try the demo of Arma II because this is very similar except for the updated engine. DO NOT expect this to be Call of Duty, they are not comparable. It is a millitary simulator that requires teamwork and leadership to become successful at. I believe this is the best millitary simulator on the market to date.			",97,5,1,7,8,0,13

												Just don't buy this game, horrible ui, horrible optimization, lack of post processing, commanding troops is a huge pain they dont think for themselves you have to micro manage everything if you can even get them to follow your commands at all. Once they are under attack they refuse to move quickly, usually the down fall of my squad. They get shot at then just lay down and i scream at them to get for cover and they will go, just reaaaaally slowly making there way there, standing up then laying down again. Its riddle with bugs. Please don't support bohemia, they dont even care to fix there♥♥♥♥♥♥ They have been using the same engine for a decade, literally, Even with a beast of a computer arma will not utilize i properly ending. Good luck getting on a servre cause they are way laggier then just single player.

( when many users are playing at once ).11: Gun sway and stamina effects / Gunshot wound blur effect / Running effect is a Hinderance to gameplay rather than giving into immersion.12: Walking up rocks is worse than arma 2 / It can get you killed.13: Almost all gamemodes are unsatisfactory with lag being the biggest culprit. Game is a Frustrating mess.[ Company Promised to give a new physics system that would allow objects to react according to real life environment. Bohemia Interactive and its specific representatives made a video showing off how they added new physics to the game and how they will be improving the physics engine ].

												WIth the latest awful patch, it is usually impossible to connect in hosted MP. 1/3 of missions that we actually get playing soon drop to 1 FPS, requiring a restart. The devs ignore these issues.Other issues:Spyware!Endless bugsNew bugs every patchTerrible performanceThe developers don't care about the gameConstantly drops to 1 FPS (devs refuse to address this)Latest patch randomly kicks/prevents joining servers (devs refuse to address this)Broken AIBroken features100% reliant on 3rd party mods for bugfixes, playability and contentArma 2 offers more for lessI have over 2000 hours in Arma 3 alone, more in the other entries in the series. I have been modding and making missions since the early 2000s. I am the guy who introduced dynamic missions and campaigns to the series. That said, Arma 3 is not worth your money.Arma 3 is basically a patch of OFP, a game that came out in 2001. The graphics are better, there are new scripting commands and the inventory system is better, but those are the only real improvements. In recent patches BIS finally implemented weapon resting (something modders had in Arma 2 years ago), but it is clumsy and poorly-implemented. The modded solutions are vastly superior.Every patch for Arma 3 is a disaster. What is broken this time? What features have stopped working? What mods are broken now? Will my performance get worse again?The latest patch has broken MP. My coop group can not join missions now, despite our modset being identical. Sometimes after trying to join over and over it will let players in. Then when we restart the mission it won't let people join. Last time we played it took over an hour of disabling mods and endless retries before we could play a single mission. It seems the devs are cracking down on mods.Even the bugs are broken. Often bugs happen randomly and in a non-reproducable way. Sometimes the AI driver won't follow movement orders, sometimes he will. There is no pattern.A big problem is that control of your AI squadmates is much worse than previous games. In OFP your could use tactical view to position your guys, tell them to hold fire and they would do it. This made it possible to set up ambushes. In Arma 3 this is impossible. Your AI will often not move to where you click on the map. A very common occurence is to order your squad to a position 100 meters behind you and they will instead move 100 meters in front.Friendly AI struggle to engage enemy targets. Countless times I have seen my troops blankly staring down their sights at an enemy for several seconds, finally getting shot instead. In contrast, the enemy can still do a first-shot head-shot over iron sights from 200 meters away, something people complained about in 2001.AI squadmates are little more than extra lives in coop. At least the needless respawn delay has finally been removed.Another bug is when your squad takes fire, they will enter combat mode and you can't get them out of it. They become unresponsive to commands and are out of your control. This makes it impossible to break contact or dash to a new position. In other words, when you take fire, you lose control of your squad. This can be fixed with mods, but not in vanilla. Again, modders save the day because the devs don't care.If you are a group commander in a vehicle but switch to gunner and then exit the vehicle, the vehicle driver will run over you. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It is things like this that make me think the devs never even play their game.That said, enemy AI is improved over OFP. However, the AI still requires mods do basic things like enter buildings, take cover, call for support, crew weapons etc.AI are even less capable of driving than previous games. I made a mission where the enemy starts in a village and spreads out from there, seizing the map town by town. However, I noticed that a few minutes after spawning, the enemy technical groups slowed down greatly. When I used a camera view to debug, I saw that most of the AI had crashed their vehicles so badly (whilst safe and driving down empty roads), that they had wrecked the vehicles in their group and were now on foot.Let that sink in. The AI can not drive down roads for a few kilometers without wrecking their vehicles, even when not in combat.The implementation of PhysX is terrible and often slows the game to a crawl or crashes it. About one in three coop games requires a restart because a vehicle gets stuck on a building and the FPS hits 4. You will also see hilarious glitches like tanks suddenly flying into the air for no reason.The worst thing about Arma 3 is that the developers just don't care. They ignore major bugs, but then implement rubbish that nobody wants. So now there is Workshop integration (who cares?), but you still can't control your troops in combat.Despite existing in earlier games, there are no females in Arma 3. So what do the devs give us? Go karts! It is absurd.The action menu was terrible when OFP was released in 2001, and Bohemia has made no efforts to improve it. For those not familiar with it, you have to use the middle mouse button to control essential actions. Say you want to climb a ladder, you might accidentally set off your satchel charges instead. Or a single mis-click and you turn off your helicopter's engine. There are several mods which show how this could be done better, but again, the devs don't care.A great point is the modding community. There are tons of fantastic mods that add units, islands, functions and fix Bohemia's shoddy work.People will tell you that Arma 3 is some super-realistic military simulation. It has realistic elements, but it also has magic medkits that instantly heal you. The tanks are STILL using a hitpoint system and can be killed with any weapon as long as you hit it enough times. Also, tanks still do stupid things like get into combat, inexplicably expose their rear armor to the enemy and then use their coax to engage an MRAP whilst ignoring some AFV that is shooting them.The artillery system is a joke. Some of the special round types (eg. guided shells) don't work at all.The naval aspect is a gimmick with zero value in the game. There are no true naval assets, the aquatic elements serve absolutely no purpose and are useless in game.In those rare cases when it all comes together, nothing breaks and you are fighting the enemy instead of the game engine, Arma 3 can offer an amazing experience like no other game. But you will need to spend dozens of hours researching and installing mods and learning how to avoid the bugs. Arma 3 is broken and unfinished, you will have to invest a lot of time to make it work for you. Vanilla offers a boring, unpolished, unfinished experience. Every patch will require more hours of troubleshooting before you can play smoothly again.If you really want to see what Arma has to offer, just get Arma 2 and its addons. It is much cheaper, has about 500% of the content of Arma 3, is more stable and has far more mods. In fact one of the major modding projects for Arma 3 is to import Arma 2 content. Arma 2 has far more islands and factions. You will not have to deal with all of the bugs Arma 3 introduces.Some fanboys will attack this review. But I have been contributing to OFP/Arma community for over a decade. I am sick of waiting for Bohemia to take their game seriously and fix the bugs. It seems all they care about now is Life game modes.I could go on and on. One final bug: the one where you suddenly start flapping your arms and floating in the air like a bird.Bottom line: Arma 3 is definitely not worth the money. Arma 2 can provide more than Arma 3 at a much lower cost and with less bugs. Even if you get Arma 3 for free, you will have to invest a lot of time and effort into it to make it playable. Even then, sometimes it will simply not let you join a server.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oh you want to log off. lets show him the dlc's he doesnt want for 10 seconds before he can quit the game.Yes, I'm salty, and yes I like this game, but seriously, some modder needs to create an ad-block for this game.

												If Call of Duty is a Hollywood ""military porn"" movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up.Arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential ""flashpoint"" of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led ""CSAT"" forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween.There is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood ""realism"" that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation.How proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate ""Operation Flashpoint"" of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma).Whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series.The multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up ""hardcore"" simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better.This game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.

												ArmA III... Another timeless source of entertainment from Bohemia Interactive. Although it improves upon its predecessor - ArmA II / Operation Arrowehad - in many ways, there is definately room for improvement. While the game is more intensive on your hardware, especially CPU and GPU, for obvious reasons, the game does appear to be lacking a bit of optimisation. Saying that, it's not bad at all, and is perfectly playable. Players on a lower end PC may experience serious lag issues when playing large missions, especially during multiplayer.ArmA 3 is a tactical shooter. Call of Duty or Battlefield fanboys go home. It is one of the most authentic combat simulators available to the public. It is not perfect, however. For what ArmA 3 lacks in realism and authenticity, it makes up for with a better physics engine, improved  bullet ballistics, better graphics, ragdoll physics and an even bigger map. ArmA 3, like most of its Bohemia Interactive siblings, and many other games on the market, is a dish best served multiplayer. It's a very squad-based, team-work orientated warfare experience. You CAN go lone wolf rambo; there is nothing stopping you. However, you should be prepared to die very quickly and you may negatively impact both you and your teammates with your actions. In multiplayer, make sure you have all sectors covered and that you've got your teammates backs. Every squadmember is a vital asset, and if you screw up your whole team will pay the price. It's not about the points, it's about the mission. You cease to be a player; from the moment you join a server your mentality should be that you are a cog in the war machine. Be the best you can be; weigh your options, play tactically and, if you're lucky, you might 'Survive', 'Adapt' and 'Win'.The AI is somewhat disappointing, can be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you can run right past them and they will not notice you. Other times, they will detect and headshot you from 500m away, first shot, in the middle of the night and fog all around. This seems to have improved since the Alpha release of the game, however. The AI is often fairly consistent in its behaviour. They are not to be treated as the weak AI you might storm through in other games. While they often are incapable of matching the abilities of a skillful player, the AI an often deadly foe. Respect the AI, and try to put yourself in their shoes. While you may cry 'bull****!' when an AI kills you, were you the AI shooting at the player that is yourself, I am sure it not seem so ridiculous and their shots so impossibly accurate anymore. Stick to cover, stay calm and don't do anything stupid. Use your teammates to help you (or try... public servers can get messy). If you want to enjoy ArmA 3 to the fullest, I would definately suggest seeking out and joining a 'Realism Unit'. Realism units are player groups which emulate the battlefields of today (and even some which are chronologically seperate from today). There, you will hopefully find organised, structured, tactical and authentic gameplay. If, like most people, that is what brought you to the ArmA series, a Realism Unit is where you belong.One thing ArmA has always had is a vast modding community, and fans are constantly producing and releasing more content. A modification I am particularly looking forward to is the Advanced Combat Environment (more commonly known as ACE2, the sequal to ACE for the original ArmA: Armed Assault game) mod for ArmA 3. In ArmA 2, which utilised a more realistic feeling, simulator-ish, yet more restrictive engine, I had a lot of fun with ACE. It adds lots of functionality and added realism, and helps to expand the world of Arma. The 'Authentic Gameplay Modification' (AGM) and Comabt Space Enhancement (CSE) were two realism mods which expanded the gameplay significantly, which have since been discontinued. Their teams have merged, along with some of the developers from ACE2, to develop the recently announced ACE3. As of your reading this, ACE3 is probably already released and one of the most widely used mods in the ArmA III modding scene.Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the ArmA series, and one that gives it such longevity and popularity, would be the powerful mission editor tools. On the Steam Workshop, and several other online websites, you can find both Singleplayer and Multiplayer community-made missions with varying difficulties and talent. The ALiVE mod for ArmA 3 allows mission makers to easily build large-scale, dynamic, evolving missions utilising procedural generation, helping to flesh out the ArmA experience.I am excited to see what ArmA IV will bring to the table, if Bohemia Interactive decide to create a fourth installment in the series. They probably will, and I do think the first thing they will need to work on if they want to have a snowball's chance in hell of selling an ArmA 4, would be the AI. It isn't bad, but it is far from good and needs some massive improvement.			",58,1,0,4,15,0,31

												This game's review has had a long time coming from me honestly.The single most played game within my Steam collection is undoubtly Arma 3. It is one of the few games I play that I continue to come back to over and over again.I won't go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews; stuff like the mechanics, graphics, etc. What I will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community.Arma is a game that scales with your imagination. While not necessarily easy, users can create whatever mod they want for this game. Just recently I saw a video for a T-Rex mod.T-Rex aside, many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not (most likely for legal purposes/trademarks). Missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in Arma 3.With one of the largest maps, realistic ballistics, and a sometimes brutally hard AI, the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire.Games can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons, armored vehicles, and airsupport.My only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community. When I first purchased Arma 2, I didn't play it for a year after my initial play through because I didn't quite 'get' the game. My brother also was not a fan of Arma 3 at first.This is a game you need to Google and learn about. The rewards are definitely worth the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright is this a good game or not.Well if you ask me its kind of hard the controls are wierd (exept walking shhoting and spriting)and they are hard to remeber.But this game offers alot and by alot i really mean alot.Good looking graphix and textures intense heartbeating combat looting military wastelands mode custom mods that i dont know how to install Windows 8 Skin :(.CO-OP and campaing are pretty good but i wish some of my other friends would ow this game but it costs a lot and its no worth of that amount of money like 25,50 euros are good price in my opinion But then it offers alot of game modes.I think this is a good game,But you should just buy it from a tf2 outpost dealer.But i got this cheaper caus of the alpha release. But overall 4/5			",84,4,0,7,4,2,0

												Arma 3, where do I start? I guess I'll start with my first ever experience with the game.I've always watched allot of Arma 3 Life videos and those where my main reason I bought the game, but after I bought it I found out that I was too young to be whitelisted on an Arma 3 Life server so I started playing allot of Wasteland together with my friend who had also bought Arma 3, it was so much fun that I had 80 hours in the first 5 days and over 200 hours in the first month! After playing some Wasteland together we decided to play some Altis Life, I've got so much to tell you about Altis Life and I've met so many awesome people who I still play with today, at first I was just playing with me and my friend and we were just walking/driving around doing some copper buying rooks like every hobo. When we were on our way to buy a rook we came across a fellow hobo who had crashed his car, he was really nice and we decided to make a gang with the 3 of us, this is the beginning of the gang Original Hobos, we quickly started growing and started making more money with bigger trucks and did more illegal stuff like selling drugs, we had quite a big gang setup with quite some people but then Altis Life started boring, I quit for a while but not too long ago I came back, met loads of new people, Joined HATO (Highway Agency), NHS (Medics) and APC (Police) I really enjoy playing as APC and its loads of fun aswell as playing as a medic, I would say about 350 hours I've played are in Altis Life, I'm currently running around with an MXM with DMS and fully geared and 3 million in the bank, I earn about 1 million per day in the APC.This game is so much fun and I would reccomend this to anyone. This isn't just a millitary shooter, It's everything. Mod change the whole way the game works and make it a completely new game. Exile is also a very good mod, It's a bit like Rust but with loot that you can pick up from the ground, and there is allot of loot on the ground if you just walk around a city for about 15 mins you'll be fully geared and ready to take on other players and sell some loot for more poptabs to buy more stuff at the traders.There's just so much to say about this game that I can't be bothered to write it all down.I'd reccomend this game to ANYONE this game fits any gamer. Don't like playing King Of The Hill? Try out a different gamemode.One final thing I am going to talk about is Zeus.Zeus allows you to create your own missions while other players play it, it's a real-time mission editor while the players are already playing the mission, it's kinda hard to explain but try it out yourself.Oh almost forgot, if you buy this game then I really reccomend buying the Apex bundle, Apex is a BIG expansion with a new map lots of new vehicles and it's a must have.Feel free to add me on steam and if you need some help on Altis Life (grandtheftarma.com) send me a message I will get you hooked up with some money, a truck and some tips.

												This game started rough in the alpha, but since then I've come to consider this as the greatest shooter of all time. I could gush about it for hours, but I'll keep it to pros and cons.Pros:-Easily the most realistic shooter ever made-Beautiful graphics-Great dev who embraces the community and mods-Least asinine DLC scheme I've seen-Regular updates that greatly improve the game-Mods. If you dream it, there's a mod for it-Best soundscape of any game I've played-Nails the feel of shooting and moving with firearms better than any other game-Almost all flaws from previous games have been improved-Large mutliplayer community-Difficulty, interface, every control, visuals, and AI are fully configurable to your taste. AI too accurate? You can change that-Gigantic maps that 400 hours later I still haven't even covered half of-Unique moments and battles that can't take place in other scripted shooters-Mission editor allowing for literally any kind of gameplay-There's not enough time in a life to explore all official and user missions and modsCons:-Extremely hardware demanding. Get yourself a good processor  --Core i5 4690k @ 4 ghz / GTX 970 OC'd gets 40 FPS on average, but regularly dips to 20  --You'll also want an SSD. Standard hard drives will give you occasional 1-2 second freezes-You will run into bugs, mostly with how missions play out-Commanding friendly AI is extremely clunky. Improvements have been made but total overhaul is needed. C2 Command mod mostly alleviates this-AI is difficult to implement when creating missions-Mission scripting is difficult and confusing. There is a full wiki and forum dedicated to it but they don't help much-While the devs are wonderful, the community is elitist and less than helpfulPick this game up. Seriously. It's worth every single penny.			",67,4,6,2,8,0,1

												This game is nothing but amazing!10/10Pro's : 1.Graphics2.Gameplay3.Endless PossibilitiesThe graphics in this game are down right amazing as long as you are playing on something higher than low the graphics will not look like someone♥♥♥♥♥♥on your computer monitor! The Gameplay is downright amazing there are so many things you can do with this game it's insane, From flying in a helicopter and protecting your fellow teamates to putting your boots on the ground to help out your teamates and eliminate enemies together. As far as realism goes this game is doing amazing. Then comes the endless possibilities! With all these hours in this game I have had some time to mess around with the game whether it be adding mods to the game or going against AI with my friends on multiple servers that offer the fun and tactical gameplay! I enjoyed Wasteland, Altis Life, Arma 3 Life etc. But what really made me enjoy the game was the servers that had there own little touch to the game that made the game feel different, That's why I had so much fun adding mods to the game and enjoyed things like Arma 3 Life when it was popular and stuff around those areas where fun to me and I'm sure they can be fun to you! This game is a whole lot a fun and worth the buy 100% but with such an amazing game there of course has to be some cons to it because no game is ever perfect. Cons: Minor glitches in the game like being able to see through walls to flying sky high into outer space are only a few of the minor glitches that can be found in this game, None of the glitches are enough to make you rethink buying the game or enough to make you uninstall it and never want to play it again but for the rare amount of times that it happens it can get really annoying. Another problem that this game has is the lag that it creates because of how good the graphics are, Although I don't get the massive amount of lag that some people get I do hear people complaining about how the lag kills there computer and there is just no point in playing the game. Although the lag is annoying at times as long as you have a good computer the game won't kill you as much the game can be run on a decent computer hell I used to run it on an old computer I got from Best Buy years ago! The game in general is not the problem for your lag it is the servers and the fact that so much stuff is happening at the same time that it causes you to lag and if the server doesn't restart frequently then you might want to find a new server. It's all a matter of finding a server that you enjoy and you feel as if you can play on it even if it does lag you a little, I have yet to meet someone that doesn't have a super computer that doesn't have minor lag in the game and that is the only problem with the game if you don't have a decent computer you might as well not even bother wasting your money and your time. After reading that I hope you understand how fun this game can be as long as you are sure than your computer can handle such a heavy game! If you do get the game I hope you enjoy it and get as much hours as I did into the game or maybe even more. The realism is waiting for you!			",135,34,4,2,8,3,2

												Great game, bad optimization so if you have a low spec pc this game may run slow and have low fps. The gameplay is great, the vehicles and aircraft are great fun and are easy to drive / handle. But there is not many guns and vechicles within this game. The guns handle well and realistic, they also look great and the game has nice animation. The new stances are amazing and really allow you to take cover not matter what the object is you are taking cover behind. Over all fun game, lots of gamemodes online to play, single player is ok, but do not recommend getting this game for single player. There is also some mods online which change the game quite a bit. I do recommend getting this game.			",89,2,10,15,23,1,13

												I highly recommend getting this game, it has so much content and I have so far met so many friends by playing it! The Atlis Life game mode is my favorite and it takes you on a real life experience of surviving on an island with cops, rebels and civilians. You will have to do many things such as drug runs to get money, rob people, raid cities, etc. the new apex dlc just adds to how fun this game is, please get it to see if you like it and if not just return it :)			",39,4,0,7,3,0,2

												If Call of Duty is a Hollywood ""military porn"" movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up.Arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential ""flashpoint"" of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led ""CSAT"" forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween.There is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood ""realism"" that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation.How proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate ""Operation Flashpoint"" of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma).Whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series.The multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up ""hardcore"" simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better.This game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.

												ArmA III... Another timeless source of entertainment from Bohemia Interactive. Although it improves upon its predecessor - ArmA II / Operation Arrowehad - in many ways, there is definately room for improvement. While the game is more intensive on your hardware, especially CPU and GPU, for obvious reasons, the game does appear to be lacking a bit of optimisation. Saying that, it's not bad at all, and is perfectly playable. Players on a lower end PC may experience serious lag issues when playing large missions, especially during multiplayer.ArmA 3 is a tactical shooter. Call of Duty or Battlefield fanboys go home. It is one of the most authentic combat simulators available to the public. It is not perfect, however. For what ArmA 3 lacks in realism and authenticity, it makes up for with a better physics engine, improved  bullet ballistics, better graphics, ragdoll physics and an even bigger map. ArmA 3, like most of its Bohemia Interactive siblings, and many other games on the market, is a dish best served multiplayer. It's a very squad-based, team-work orientated warfare experience. You CAN go lone wolf rambo; there is nothing stopping you. However, you should be prepared to die very quickly and you may negatively impact both you and your teammates with your actions. In multiplayer, make sure you have all sectors covered and that you've got your teammates backs. Every squadmember is a vital asset, and if you screw up your whole team will pay the price. It's not about the points, it's about the mission. You cease to be a player; from the moment you join a server your mentality should be that you are a cog in the war machine. Be the best you can be; weigh your options, play tactically and, if you're lucky, you might 'Survive', 'Adapt' and 'Win'.The AI is somewhat disappointing, can be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you can run right past them and they will not notice you. Other times, they will detect and headshot you from 500m away, first shot, in the middle of the night and fog all around. This seems to have improved since the Alpha release of the game, however. The AI is often fairly consistent in its behaviour. They are not to be treated as the weak AI you might storm through in other games. While they often are incapable of matching the abilities of a skillful player, the AI an often deadly foe. Respect the AI, and try to put yourself in their shoes. While you may cry 'bull****!' when an AI kills you, were you the AI shooting at the player that is yourself, I am sure it not seem so ridiculous and their shots so impossibly accurate anymore. Stick to cover, stay calm and don't do anything stupid. Use your teammates to help you (or try... public servers can get messy). If you want to enjoy ArmA 3 to the fullest, I would definately suggest seeking out and joining a 'Realism Unit'. Realism units are player groups which emulate the battlefields of today (and even some which are chronologically seperate from today). There, you will hopefully find organised, structured, tactical and authentic gameplay. If, like most people, that is what brought you to the ArmA series, a Realism Unit is where you belong.One thing ArmA has always had is a vast modding community, and fans are constantly producing and releasing more content. A modification I am particularly looking forward to is the Advanced Combat Environment (more commonly known as ACE2, the sequal to ACE for the original ArmA: Armed Assault game) mod for ArmA 3. In ArmA 2, which utilised a more realistic feeling, simulator-ish, yet more restrictive engine, I had a lot of fun with ACE. It adds lots of functionality and added realism, and helps to expand the world of Arma. The 'Authentic Gameplay Modification' (AGM) and Comabt Space Enhancement (CSE) were two realism mods which expanded the gameplay significantly, which have since been discontinued. Their teams have merged, along with some of the developers from ACE2, to develop the recently announced ACE3. As of your reading this, ACE3 is probably already released and one of the most widely used mods in the ArmA III modding scene.Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the ArmA series, and one that gives it such longevity and popularity, would be the powerful mission editor tools. On the Steam Workshop, and several other online websites, you can find both Singleplayer and Multiplayer community-made missions with varying difficulties and talent. The ALiVE mod for ArmA 3 allows mission makers to easily build large-scale, dynamic, evolving missions utilising procedural generation, helping to flesh out the ArmA experience.I am excited to see what ArmA IV will bring to the table, if Bohemia Interactive decide to create a fourth installment in the series. They probably will, and I do think the first thing they will need to work on if they want to have a snowball's chance in hell of selling an ArmA 4, would be the AI. It isn't bad, but it is far from good and needs some massive improvement.			",58,1,0,4,15,0,31

												Complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with.-	I didn’t like it in the beginning I found it rigid and complex, mainly because I was comparing it to the other FPS games in the market+ Very good gameplay+ Fancy graphics and physics are good+ huge community contribution -  You will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning I recommend it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to play a heavy realistic and enyoing game, then i clearly recommend you to play this! The gameplay itself has it's own spirit that makes the Arma franchise unique.The in-game controls may be a little but confusing but you get used to it.Clearly recommended to play this with friends, and the gamemodes are awesome.There is ""Altis Life"" Wich is a roleplaying gamemode, Wasteland wich is like DayZ with no zombies innit.And ofcourse there is tons of mods in the internet so i suggest you give Arma 3 a try. :)			",178,18,3,22,20,3,16

												Simply can't live up to Arma 2's legacy. I mean yeah, it has some major improvements over Arma 2, but it sure can't live it down.Game lacks content.However, so long as you can run the game well in Multiplayer (Quad core 3.2GHz+ CPU & GTX 560+) it's still worth the buy (Organized PvP is very promising, COOP missions are very interesting, and RPGs are fun as well).At least there's mods. Seriously, it fills the void.Don't buy this game unless you have a computer that can handle it.EDIT:Constant updates improved the game and made even vanilla gameplay a genuinely enjoyable experience, let alone the helicopter an marksman DLC.Mods are better than ever. ACE 3 finally came out in an early state, but hopefully realism will flourish in Arma again. RPGs are improving a ton in mods with Arma 3 Life and other mods, as well as survival types with new content. RHS bring back US and Russian Forces in A3 quality and new maps continue to bring interest.Still requires a good build to enjoy the game. Although it's been much improved, still needs optimization.You'll also want a good sound mod and Blastcore particle effects mod... its amazing.			",29,0,0,1,3,0,7

												Ok, well im not entirely sure what to put here. But in my experience of the game its a bit like pancakes. So here is the recipe for successINGREDIENTS1 large egg or 1 egg and one yolk ½ pint/280ml milk 4oz/110g plain flour (4 heaped dessertspoons) 1 tbsp melted butterMETHODBy hand: sift the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle. Break in the egg (and yolk, if using) and add a pinch of salt and a splash of the milk. Whisk the egg, gradually incorporating the flour, to make a smooth cream. Whisk in the rest of the milk and the melted butter.With a blender: put all the ingredients in a blender jug with a pinch of salt. Whizz until smooth. It should be no thicker than single cream.Brush a hot pan with vegetable oil before adding a ladleful of batter and swilling thinly around pan, tipping the pan so the mixture spreads evenly. It will begin to cook immediately: pour any excess back into the bowl.When the pancake is browned on the bottom and the very edges are beginning to lift away, give the pan a shake to make sure the pancake is loose. If it is sticking anywhere, use a spatula to loosen it. When it moves freely, then you are ready to toss it - or, if you're less confident, use a spatula to turn it over. The other side will only need a few seconds. Slide out of the pan, and try one of these delicious toppings			",77,4,2,3,7,1,7

If you like shooting games but you are looking for realism and you don't want to play Call of Duty or Battlefield this game is the way to go. It's 10 times better than COD and BF anyway! Are you creative? Hope on the editor and create something for the community or your friends! Maybe you know how to script and code stuff? Then make something awesome for the community! The community is very awesome aswell! This game worths the money trust me reader!			",35,4,1,2,3,0,4

												This game is nothing but amazing!10/10Pro's : 1.Graphics2.Gameplay3.Endless PossibilitiesThe graphics in this game are down right amazing as long as you are playing on something higher than low the graphics will not look like someone♥♥♥♥♥♥on your computer monitor! The Gameplay is downright amazing there are so many things you can do with this game it's insane, From flying in a helicopter and protecting your fellow teamates to putting your boots on the ground to help out your teamates and eliminate enemies together. As far as realism goes this game is doing amazing. Then comes the endless possibilities! With all these hours in this game I have had some time to mess around with the game whether it be adding mods to the game or going against AI with my friends on multiple servers that offer the fun and tactical gameplay! I enjoyed Wasteland, Altis Life, Arma 3 Life etc. But what really made me enjoy the game was the servers that had there own little touch to the game that made the game feel different, That's why I had so much fun adding mods to the game and enjoyed things like Arma 3 Life when it was popular and stuff around those areas where fun to me and I'm sure they can be fun to you! This game is a whole lot a fun and worth the buy 100% but with such an amazing game there of course has to be some cons to it because no game is ever perfect. Cons: Minor glitches in the game like being able to see through walls to flying sky high into outer space are only a few of the minor glitches that can be found in this game, None of the glitches are enough to make you rethink buying the game or enough to make you uninstall it and never want to play it again but for the rare amount of times that it happens it can get really annoying. Another problem that this game has is the lag that it creates because of how good the graphics are, Although I don't get the massive amount of lag that some people get I do hear people complaining about how the lag kills there computer and there is just no point in playing the game. Although the lag is annoying at times as long as you have a good computer the game won't kill you as much the game can be run on a decent computer hell I used to run it on an old computer I got from Best Buy years ago! The game in general is not the problem for your lag it is the servers and the fact that so much stuff is happening at the same time that it causes you to lag and if the server doesn't restart frequently then you might want to find a new server. It's all a matter of finding a server that you enjoy and you feel as if you can play on it even if it does lag you a little, I have yet to meet someone that doesn't have a super computer that doesn't have minor lag in the game and that is the only problem with the game if you don't have a decent computer you might as well not even bother wasting your money and your time. After reading that I hope you understand how fun this game can be as long as you are sure than your computer can handle such a heavy game! If you do get the game I hope you enjoy it and get as much hours as I did into the game or maybe even more. The realism is waiting for you!			",135,34,4,2,8,3,2

												REALISM? REALLY?(this review pertains to the campaign) -Enemies you hit jump three feet in the air (pop! just to let you know you hit them) wtf? -A running simulator often enough, but you are winded after running for 20-30 seconds. Really? Am I a soldier in this game or a lazy♥♥♥♥♥gamer? Don't remind me I am the latter please.-An interface so clunky (and barely explained in the prologue) you will find yourself googling how tos again and again. You really will feel like a lazy♥♥♥♥♥gamer who ended up in a military situation, well done. -Gunfire sounds seem to come from the spot where the bullets landed, NOT where they were fired from. -Passing enemy helicopters never seem to see you/call in a squad to engage you.-AI squadmates run off without you to engage the enemy despite having no ammo, while you are trying to loot bodies for anything useful.-AI squadmates often get tired if you haven't killed an enemy and grenade his♥♥♥♥♥from quite a distance. Which is nice, but after it happens a few times you realize you aren't learning anything.-The impromptu basecamp in the campaign mentioned it had an armory. Nice! Except command for some reason placed the armory outside of camp, on a table, like some peddler, and not inside the base where such assets would be actually safe. I guess that was my problem, I expected realism. To boot, the game has been around since June 25, 2013, and yet the campaign they developed goes from boring to running simulator to incredibly difficult, and is over very quickly. It stands to reason I suppose, since from release they game has felt more like a massive modding toolset than a game released for playing. At least the old operation flashpoint shooters (though buggy, largely unmoddable and hard as hell) had a semblance of a campaign, and the ability to issue orders to your squadmates. Here you are along for the ride, frustrating in most cases, laughable for the rest.			",97,6,1,11,4,1,20

												Arma 3 takes me back to the days of deltaforce (long time ago), it being a thoroughly enjoyable tactical military shooter, albeit with its own special glitches and graphics fails.The interface may seem somewhat clunky at first but you soon overcome that, and although the game has many controls they quickly become familiar and are relatively intuitive.The scales and graphics on Arma are pretty impressive, although as in many games, the graphics are less impressive up close, less the textures and more the number and complexity of objects, however, with a game of this size if each house was packed with objects, you can bet the frames are going to take a massive hit, what bohemia have done is find a reasonable balance with this.Generally the environment looks great, there are some questionable physics interactions which can make for some strange happenings, although that is part of the charm with Arma.If you want a military sim, that generally plays pretty well with a decent amount of guns and vehicles to mess about in then this is well worth it. Whilst not quite as slick as some games built on newer game engines, Arma does hold up pretty well. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 3 is one of the most versatile mil-sim games out there. The support from the developers alone puts this game at the top of any mil-sim list. The vanilla AI are pretty over-powered for what they do. They can get non-stop headshots from 600m away. But a couple AI mods and they react much more realistically.Coming from Arma2, this is game a huge improvement. The addition of PhysX adds a lot to gameplay.Overall, I'm very impressed with the game. Add the developer modding support, and this game is the top of my list.			",240,40,9,32,59,4,53

Posted: June 8, 2014
												A very nice game, the atmosphere (I´m not talking about mods, I´m talking about the vanilla game) is almost the same as in ArmA 2.At first the game feels dull, almost boring. You´re bored as to why nothing happens and everything seems so slow, but once you get fired upon, or get targeted by enemy artillery fire and see several squadmates around you bite the dust as you barely survived an artillery shell that injured your legs to a point where you can´t run anymore - the game becomes extremely intense.Your squad has been hit by artillery and you are among one of the few who kind of survived that attack, but your legs are injured and the next medic is 1 kilometer away from the AO. So you try to stay alive and slowly walk or crawl back to the military outpost in hopes of getting back to the EVAC zone in time (before the transport chopper flys off or the enemy decides to run a couple of bullets through the rest of your body).So you hump back towards the military outpost that you and your team used to advance from, because you know you´re going to survive once you get there as there are many teammates and the EVAC zone is also back there. As you slowly make your way through the open field trying to stay as low as you can, crawling behind bushes - you suddenly hear shots from the distance and know that the enemies are advancing towards the EVAC zone and therefore towards you...You try to make your way as fast as possible, when you read your teamchat talking about the EVAC chopper that is already on it´s way and almost there and you´re still 650 meters away. And as if that wasn´t enough of an issue, the enemies have spotted and are now starting to fire at you as well.And as you keep crawling towards the EVAC zone and notice more and more shots hitting the ground very close to you, you know that you´re probably not going to make it. And suddenly you hear a sniper firing from the EVAC zone down towards your position. He shoots one enemy rifleman after another and suddenly the teamchat indicates that the EVAC area is clear and that the pilot is going to wait for you... you stand up and try to not make your teammates wait too long for you while feeling happy about having survived such a counterattack without having to click on Respawn.This actually happened to me once.10/10 would buy again			",120,16,2,18,9,1,16

												     Been playing since the beginning of the Alpha, and this game has stayed so unique.  This game is a genre on it's own, nothing else out there like it.  The community surrounding this game makes it all that much better, and the modding community is so big.  This game is heavily moddable, which gives the community the tools they need to create anything, there is no limits.  This is also one of the more hardcore FPS games out there, it's easy to get used to, but hard to get good at, and you can't do anything without a good team.  All this game requires is patience, and the ability to work with other people.  In order for me to fully explain how awesome this game is, I'd be sitting here all day typing this review out.10/10, will never quit playing. ",50,5,0,10,8,0,18

												Easily my favourite game right now. While there is less content than ARMA 2 right now, BIS is continually adding more. This game is definitely not for your typical CoD kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience. The biggest thing for me is that this is a community game. BIS has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy. Speaking of mods, THEY ARE AWESOME! Anything from radio mods, to sound mods, to vehicle and weapon additions, and even entire new maps and game mods (there's even a mech warrior mod).The immersion in this game is great and I would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community. Doing this, you'll gain access to the real ARMA experience and not Atlis Life/Wastelands. Community events are great and there's basically one out there that would suit any player.Lastly, this game supports multiple control inputs which is a HUGE plus for me. For example I have essentially 5 control inputs: keyboard, mouse, Track IR, joystick/hotas, and steering wheel/pedals. They all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations. For example, the pedals are tri-purpose. I use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but I additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying.			",176,22,0,9,10,2,12

												I would ONLY reccomend this game to folks willing to invest hours upon hours of time in this in-depth military sim. Not the typical Battlefield player, and most certiantly not to any CoD fanboy. ARMA 3 has, in my personal opinion, created yet another masterpiece of a MILSIM. Just another ARMA, except updated. New scenarios, EXCELLENT variety of workshop content that will to keep your ARMA binge going from late hours of the night, to early hours of the morning. A solid campaign, though I have yet to try the new DLC due to the colorful selection of mods and workshop selection. Improved mechanics since ARMA 2, better AI, and a new way to edit missions (EDEN, much more user friendly especially for those new to the series). Bohemia Interactive has really delievered with ARMA 3. Yes, it can come across as clanky if you're not used to the game. But if you give it a chance, it will grow on you and will more than likely thoroughly enjoy this game. By far, one of my favorite games ever created to date. If you're looking for a realistic warfare experience, and don't own ARMA 3 (or any ARMA for that matter), un♥♥♥♥ yourself and spare the $40!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ive had this game sitting in my library forever, i tired playing the campaign awhile back and just couldnt get into it. Well today i tried out a co op server. About 8 hours later i realized I was extremely hungry and it was nearly 3 in the morning. After 1 session of playing i had plenty of super fun moments from my very first mission where our helicopter got shot down almost instantly upon entering the AO leaving me as the lone survivor all the way up to my last mission where we had an insane firefight with overwhleming odds. What really wraps the game together though is the sound...One second you're moving towards an objective and suddenly bullets cracking overhead becomes the only thing you hear. What makes this even more tense is you might not know where you're being shot from and even once you do find the bad guys, you have to fight through the recoil of your weapon and your fatigue in hopes you can land a nice shot on them. You are not Superman in this game, you can't mow down bad guys like Call of Duty and youcan die faster than you can blink if you're not careful. Really fun game if you want to get as close to combat as you can without actually being there.			",128,9,0,14,5,0,12

												This game is certainly a buy, hands down. With absolutely stunningly beautiful graphics and incredible realism (save the desync we all know and have grown to love as a feature), this game tops the charts on my list of favorite games. I started playing this game when it came out and have since then stopped playing as much as I used to but will probrably be getting back into it soon enough. With half a thousand or so hours in the game, I'm certain more is to follow. The screenshots viewable above speak for it's graphics and while buggy at times it was -made- as a simulator, so while the campaigne is a bit slow at times it is certainly all that I wanted from it and more.

Been a player since the first Operation Flashpoint and loved its mission editor and the ability to mod and end up with all manner of scenerios and missions from the campaign that comes to the game to entire vietnam mods for the old ARMA, to playing UN peacekeer to being a civilian just trying to survive.So much great stuff, its not a run and gun like COD its an open sandbox so crack open that creativity and have as much fun making as you can playing.

												For those that don't know if they  should buy the game or not:This is not Call of Duty or Battlefield.... this is a military simulator! You have acess not only to over 30 weapons but also alot of vehicles, tanks, APC's, IFV's, choppers, jets, boats, anything that real warfare uses.And the vanilla game is not that interesting, thats why we have the workshop that improves your experience on Arma 3! And you can also create your own cenarios with the editor with an interface easy to understand.This video will show you guys why Arma 3 is diferent from all the other military games!

Amazing editor and modding community, so you can literally do anything you want. Atmospheric sound effects. Simulation of everything, from realistic day/night cycle, to ballistics. Immersion. Srsly, It's like you are there. Great multiplayer, which has lots of game modes for your taste. Zeus, so you can create and change missions on the fly for other players. You are literally God for others. Take that, Peter Molyneux! Memorable experiences, You'll want to share with friends. More stuff I forgot to mension.Great game! C: ",163,27,4,13,32,3,30

												10/10 - Insane, real life survivalI'm not good at this game, but I really love it. It's as close to real survival as you can get. Multiplayer will get the heart pumping. It's a dog eat dog kinda place though. Other players will murder you, steal from you, tie you up and call you names. Be ready to get betrayed. BRING YOUR OWN FRIENDS! So many mods and online servers. There is something for everyone in this game. As a bonus the Single player is really fun too!This game is truely worth the price. $50-60. Buy it.

												I have played it a while and to now i think it's a good game. It was funny in the beggining with Altis life, and now to A3L. To rate it i would give it a 8/10. ps. dont compare this with gta 5 at all.Good stuff:- Nice guns- Good graphics- Good sniping experience- Good planes- Military Tactics- Tactical MovementDown Sides:- Can be laggy for a bad computer- 3rd Person can be abused and it's annoying- Stairs kill you- Glitching into objects and then explode :P- Bushes is filled with spike strips and explosivesOther than that its not more down sides about it.

												...a wonderful game, to loose yourself in it for hours. It has a kinda big learning curve, but its acctually worth going threw it. I enjoy myself in the Multiplayer a lot and love the challange of battleing other gamers while doing Missions. Addons such as the TFR, JSRS or the Nato-Speznas weapons make it to a real nice Warfare simulation. It requires a good CPU and GPU, but all in all its a nice game to play and i am happy i purchased it ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												gather around children, for I have a story to tell.Day one: I finaly bought arma 3, friends tell me to join them on altis life, I agree, first few days we run around scuba diving for meth at teh bottom of the ocean in old ships, we make some bank. we decide to use this money to arm our selves and continue diving for meth. one office trys to be a brave sole and aproches us, we tell him to ♥♥♥♥ off before the 6 of us pull out our 6.5mm assult rifles and mow him down with no hesitation. we take his road spikes and throw them onto the road to ♥♥♥♥ with passing traffic. we contine diving for meth and other valuables.Day three: diving bussness is going great but as all rich ♥♥♥♥s, enough is never enough, we come up with an amazing plan to airlift meth and other drugs from point A to point B, we make more bank than we thought we would, so we gear up for the long run, we get military grade combat armour, grenades, sniper rifles, LMGs, and even a RPG. we decide we need drug running slaves, we wait until night fall to move into the town to kidnap some drug runners, while extracting an officer called for backup, within 3 minuets the entire police force is in the town, we take cover in a building and wait, we tell the kids that if they scream or call for help we'd blow them away in a heart beat, they keep quiet. somehow the police find us, they call out for their buddies within minuets the building is surronded by all the police and at this point they had the swat and one of their helies arive. we know were ♥♥♥♥ed but we tell them that if they entered the hostages would die. we begin negotiations to let us out free. they agree, while leaving the building they open fired on us with tazers. the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥lied to us! within seconds they have us handcuffed and stripped of all weapons and armour. they load us into their swat heli and begin to fly us away. I soon realized that I could jump out of the heli... so I did upon doing this the heli poilet noticed and began to circle around to recover me, little did he know I was bleeding out on the ground, dieing. as I look up to the sky for one last look befor going into the light I see the heli crashing into telephone wires and exploding into a ball of fire, all my friends were dead, and all the swat officers that lied to us were too. I did good, I took one final breath befor going into the light.10 seconds later me and all the other prisoners on the heli were banned 11/10 would jump out of a heli and get banned			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on so many levels.1. The AI hasnt improved since Operation Flashpoint In 2001 (Still a Better Game than this)2. You are berated with pop up ads on your screen which dont go away untill you buy the overpriced DLC that they advertise.3. Your vehicles stop working when you do so much as tap a rock with one.4. Most servers are cancer that will kick you for doing anything against their unlisted and crappy listed ones. (Ala DarkRP)5. Overpriced DLC (Seriously? $15 for 3 Helicopters?)6. Too much focus on graphics and other gimmicksNever buying another Arma game until Bohemia gets their **** together.Go buy the much cheaper and much better Operation Flashpoint Instead.

												Inferior in every way to ARMA 2: Combined Ops.-Insanely Overpriced DLC-20 years, still no AI or Netcode improvement?-Absolutetly Tiny collection of vehicles and weapons compared to the last game-Altis and Stratis don't have the atmosphere of Chernaurus-Game essentially bullies you into buying DLC+Animations are much smoother+Firefights do feel more aliveI can't, in good faith, recommend this game over Arma 2:CO, especially that the servers have migrated to steam. What my main gripe is the DLC - $15 for 7 guns? Another $15 for 2 helicopters? $35 for an Island that is very similiar to already community made maps? Not worth near as much as they are charging. Also, the community is probably the most toxic I've seen - and I've played 300 hours of Rust.EDIT: There is also a catastrophically game-breaking bug that forces the FPS down to 5, and makes everything go lowpoly and low res. To top it off, it always seems to happen in the most critical of moments.As much as I hate this business model, I love the game. But as Bohemia wishes to stay on this path, this review will stay negative.			",61,7,2,3,4,1,6

												One of the best / my current favorite game. The amount of mods/online modes available is ridiculous. If you're into the realism & being strategic/tactical then this game is definitely for you. It's not your average run & gun FPS like COD & BF, so be warned.It takes a while to get the hang of the game mechanics & learn how to use everything properly because it IS a simulator.

												Simply put, no other game compares to Arma 3. The best combat simulator on the market, nothing comes close to delivering what Arma does. TL;DR PROS/CONS at the bottom!Literally, no other game is as much of a sandbox as Arma 3. With oodles of content already baked into the game, there's thousands of hours literally to explore just of the vanilla content! Then, pile on the massive and hugely supportive mod community.. And you have the recipe for a game that keeps on giving. Once you find an appropriate multiplayer circle that suits you and you feel at home, and are experiencing content YOU want to see in your gaming experience, you will get lost in the hours spent. The community of Arma is one of the most diverse and enduring in all of gaming, and is a special spot in PC gaming as a whole. There's loads of singleplayer content in there too, the campaign is fully voice acted and is a great showcase of what the engine can do.All the awesome to be spoken of, it does have it's few shortcomings, like most titles. The first one would be the tremendous real world PC requirements, yes you will need a higher end machine to have a truly enjoyable time in this title, to get any decent FPS. This game is a CPU hog, expect your CPU to turn into your room heater during long sessions. It is prone to many very annoying (and sometimes gamebreaking) bugs, that will break your experience if you let it get to you. Finding your community niche can be hard if you don't know what to search for.All the cons being said though... They all have ways you can get around them as a personal player. The problems relating to your computer, have an intel i5 or equivelent and a 2GB GPU, and you're in a pretty good start zone for getting acceptable FPS for an okay experience. Think exponentially for a better experience in the CPU, Arma 3 MAY benefit from more VRAM in the future, but for now is limited to 2GB VRAM, hard-coded into the engine. The game is still 32-bit, so does not use more then 3GB of RAM anywho, though faster RAM will always result in better load times.As for the bugs and glitches you (can) encounter with this game... Very rarely does it crash, only under the most intense conditions should you ever see this come close to happening, the worst case scenario I have personally experienced was just extremely poor FPS under insane conditions, that equated to my game essentially locking up. But... That's not really the issues you'll be concerned about. There are several nuances to several systems within the game that like to just bug. The network is very easy to desync, and this causes all kinds of zany bugs. As an experienced player, I learn to troubleshoot these issues quickly as a part of the experience, and to be sure to always laugh at it. Remember, it's a game. Again, these issues are not specifically game breaking, but can be experience breaking.I really do love this game. I look forward to the DirectX12 update coming with the new Tanoa terrain map. Hopefully we get a smoother ride with DirectX12, but for now this is an endearing experience if you are willing to engage yourself as a player. The gaming experiences you have in this sandbox are unrivaled, no other gaming experience will compare. If you have a love for true gaming, this game belongs in your library in my opinion. This is Game Of The Century for me, despite it's shortcomings, the experience is unlike any other.TL;DR PROS/CONS LIST:Basically.. It's like a girlfriend. You're going to love it, you're going to hate it at times, but you know there's a reason you put up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Because there's nothing else like it that compares.PROS:-Amazing endless sandbox experience that is customizable to your liking.-Beautiful graphics and entertaining physics really brings together an immersive experience.-Best combat simulator on the market hands down, experience unlike any other.-Endearing and loving community really makes the game feel complete.CONS:-Experience breaking and sometimes game breaking bugs can be annoying if you don't know how to deal with it.-Requires a higher end PC to run acceptably, I really can't reccomend this game for low end PC users.-Sometimes some of the community can be little nutsacks.

												It's ARMA with a facelift. Honestly, I wish there was more to the game. I know it's alpha and more will be added -- but it's the stuff I've already seen which are bothersome. Physics engine still totally broken, still using that god-awful proprietary SQF scripting language which makes me want to kill myself (I know there's supposed to be some Java integration in the future, but that's not exactly a step up, and it most likely won't replace the SQF but will rather become an addition to it). There is some really cool stuff though. The helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of (new) stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire. It's worth buying for the price for sure, but I'm a little sad they haven't improved the core more, nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release.			",174,17,3,5,11,2,26

												Could be awesome, but the Devs lack the ability to polish the game to a enjoyable state.We hosted some Coop Events but the AI even with Zeus support is too horrible.  Buggy and after a while ingame they dont react to orders, even custom scripts cant fix it. They move like complete Morons, and once u figured out that they stop firing at a certain distance and just look at u, they become target pratice at best.Wouldnt bother me if PvP works. Deathmatch modes without Mods do, the Rest starts lagging horribly after u go above 40 players(i5-4690k). Pepole warp around, cant enter vehicles unless they reconnect, random disconnects. Gunplay is awful, in cbq u both die due to the bad netcode.Animations are from the 2000s, when u hit someone they start waving their weapon around , close to statics ur Soldier randomly goes from prone to standing up. Everything is clunky and unfinished, giving u an uneasy feel while playing.The Scripting Wiki is outdated and some Commands dont work as described, or only sometimes, changing weather and stuff just stops working until u restart the server.Waste of Money and Time.

												Great game if you intend to play it with friends online.♥♥♥♥♥♥poor if you're planning on playing it singleplayer. If you are I'd wait until they fix all the bugs (especially the AI). The AI in this game is the worst I've ever seen. In anything. Just a couple of minutes ago an AI soldier in my squad ran out 1 meter in front of me while I was still shooting (I'd been lying in the grass fiering at the same location for a good while) and was cut down by my bullets. Mission failed. And that was the third or fourth time that happened. And the opposing AI is not better. It's as if the developers realized their AI sucked so they just gave it wallhack and aim bot. Literally. You can be in a forest somewhere, covered by rocks and bushed, fiering at an enemy 100 meters away. The second you shoot, all his friends will immediatly turn and start shooting at you, most likely hitting you straight in the face in their 3rd or 4th shot. Not running for cover or even going prone, just standing like a poor imitation of schwartzenegger and shooting from the hip. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t AI if I ever saw one.EDIT: Yeah, don't play it multiplayer either.. Glitches where you get stuck in doors, your character just rise up from prone at the worst possible occations and when you get shot through walls because your feet or backpack was no-clipping through it so they could see you through the other side. And this happens all the time. Such an awesome game in theory. Such increadibly terrible execution.			",69,5,1,7,7,2,15

												Welcome to the future, where 30 years from now current weapons and equipment such as the MATV,Fennik,IWI Tavor and Negev,Cheytac .408,M14 EBR,Merkava battle tank and littlebird will still be in use with different names and no real world upcoming technologies such as power armor,airburst launchers, VTOL aircraft, and infantry HUD will have any presence on the battlefield what so ever. Also weapons cancelled years ago such as the Commanche helicopter will be readopted generations later and renamed to avoid copyright issues.Enjoy a convulted control set up where in the heat of battle you will enter the steam control panel,trying to set a machinegun to auto fire will reset to semi when entering a truck or changing weapons or enjoy running over a chicken wire fence with a multi-ton truck will disable it to a halt.Also enjoy advertisements in game to buy over priced DLC if you move near some of the helicopters that cost 16 USD when the devs got drunk and thought they were devs programing pay content for World of Tanks or Warthunder.Don't buy unless you want to play the userbase made game modes suxh as Wasteland,King of the Hill, or Breaking point, the only thing worth playing with this software.

												Incredible and immersive experience for fans of proper war games. The attention to detail is outstanding, the weapons, player gear and vehicles are completely authentic, right down to the tiniest details. The audio is amazing, the sound of bullets peppering your surroundings while you're in the fetal position praying that your cover is sufficient, explosions that sound as badass as they look, the sound of your weaponary, it's all done amazingly well. The gameplay forces you to play more or less how you would in a real life situation, using military tactics and teamwork to advance your position, you'll get ♥♥♥♥in' used as a mop if you're thinking about getting those 'sick kill streaks' you get in those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console shooters. On a technological scale, Arma 3 is by far the most advanced and impressive game I've ever played, nothing comes remotely close. Right now, the game has optimization issues although they seem to be ironing that out, you'll need a powerful rig to experience this game in all it's glory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			",49,3,1,0,4,1,2

												This game is completely not worth buying to me. But well, I can't just say ""No"" to this game. Let's have a litte summary.+Pluses:Cool campaign, I liked itEasy-to-use editorMaaaaany addons for this crazy game!The multiplayer COOP servers are cool, when you fight against other playersThe gamemodes are insaneHuge, Altis mapYou can find very interesting arma 3 groups (Tactical ones, either non-realistic, arcade groups)-Minuses:Bad optimizationCompletely unrealistic sway system (Me, alongside with ex. GROM solder can prove it)Long loadtimesI had to read about arma's tweaking like 30 minutes before I got itMost of the servers are Epoch or Breaking Point reserved, either locked.I don't like the idea of futuristic vehicles and helicopters. I excepted Arma 3 to be continuation of Arma 2 with better engine.The most disappointing point: Lack of bullet chamber, just... No words to itThe bolt sniper rifles lack in reloading animationsThe pistol's animations are ♥♥♥♥ed up (Just inserting the mag, no sign of pushing the lever either pulling it back to chamber the bullet)The bots are difficult to hit, they're often OP, even after tweaking (They survive headshot, they don't pass out, they don't fall down when hit to chest, like soldier'd do IRL). Even after scored headshot, the bot is able to 360* noscope you through wall. Setting up specific mods helped.The game doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥, it may crash random times if you won't do proper things to prevent it. Before I prevented it from crashing, I've reinstalled my system on 64 BIT, been updating the drivers instantly. Although the solution was simple (Using CCleaner and cleaning the computer from inside aswell), I didn't have the same issues with other games.I don't like the way that buildings break down. It's no good for me, it should be more realistic.I've spent 600 hours in this game to instantly believe that it'll get better. The only thing that makes me play the game is that I've found tactical team and I play with these dudes.			",27,1,1,0,0,0,0

												I would argue the whole DLC thing as it seems more pay to play. Most of the zeus servers spawn items you actually cant use. I mean thanks for letting everyone play together regardless of owning the DLC, but the game gets real sour when you cant drive to an objective. Then a popup displays in the center of the screen when you are in a firefight (also a permanent one on the side). Dont get me wrong, great game. But the DLC should be additional content, right now it ruins a lot of zeus and king of the hil game modes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really hate to say this, but you should wait to get this game until BIS gets it finished, assuming that happens. The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam.So, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad.The interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things.To be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it.  I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer.For me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for!Am I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that.I fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there.So, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game. Oh yes I know...mods mods mods....ya *hangs head*			",79,1,5,3,1,0,4

												Got the game recently (having never played an Arma game) and although i had heard that the controls were difficult i was willing to spend the time learning them, what got me is that as soon as you enter the multiplayer, you hit walls upon walls of text that the game doesn't tell you anything about.I understand most of it is user-created content but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly confusing joining a server and being told little to nothing about what is going on, you just know its either ""Altis Life"" or ""King Of The Hill"" etc. It kinda makes you think they could've done with a few tutorial servers with different game modes so new players aren't extremely confused from the off.Well the first time i went in to a multiplayer game (in a server about 2/3rds full) the chat channels were completely dead, all i heard was what presumably was a fellow noob  constantly saying ""Hello"" (There was someone else talking occasionally but the sound quality was so grainy i couldnt make out anything he was saying) . I figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what I'd heard ""everyone uses ts on Arma"" but nowhere in game did it say where the name/address of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat. Similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well. The game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an ARMA game before, how to play the online, and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either.Judging from some of the reviews. the campaign isn't very good either but at least its playable, I'll probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day, if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer, i won't get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game! Overall probably a good game for those new to the Arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes, what addons and mods you will need for the game, what ts servers you need to be in, what the controls are, then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game. But if you don't have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides, tutorials, and server info, then you will probably find the game very frustrating. Not at all noob friendly.

												So I played this game when it was free for 3 days and I only played it for a little while. First of all the game was not very well optimized and I found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. I thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. I would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (Recommend an $1000 PC Minimum) But if you play free games like me and don't have an extreme PC build I don't really recommend the game that much.			",50,6,0,1,7,0,1

												To be on point:Before purchasing Arma 3 I read about it on forums and on Steam reviews.Indeed, many said that at the moment Arma 3 is just not finished and it is not worth buying and playing as it is.I really liked the game idea and thought that it can't be that bad, so I purchased it.Boy I was in for a big surprise.And I am not talking only about the poor optimization of the game. The whole game feels weird, laggy and just plain wrong.The controls are a mess. For example, to fly with a joystick you have to set all the actions manually. At least in my case.Graphics wise, I might get older but the whole image seems to be blurry and out of sync.Maybe the biggest grief is with super human AI enemies.Somehow they can see you even in the darkest and deepest forest, while there is NO way you can see them, yet alone shoot them.I am sory to say, I regret the purchase and would not advise anyone to try the game in the current state.I would say in a year or so maybe, but not now. In case you want to help out the developer and support the game, by all means, purchase the game now. Play it later :)Do not get me wrong, the idea is super, the complexity is there, visual apeal is there, but it needs a lot of polish to be playable.I would like to state, for the record, that I couldn't get myself to play it for more than one hour.Maybe if I would have spent more time (I guess a lot more) in the game, I would have liked it more.Just for reference:I7 2600k @ 4.4 ghznVidia GTX 580 1.5 GB RAM16 GB RAM @ 1600 Mhz CAS 8Samsung Evo SSD= 40-50 FPS in SPThis is just my personal opinion and experience of the game.Take it with a grain of salt.Over and out.

												Oh ArmA. ArmA, ArmA, ArmA. The abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive, and less fun, and all it took was one title. One title full of empty promises, and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for DayZ 2. Let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series, and the company that I used to respect above every other.The quick and dirty, would I recommend ArmA 3? Not by a mile. Sub-30 price tag, sure, you'll get your monies worth. But even for all the modders trying to save it, this is not a complete game. You should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of COMMUNITY created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product. If some of that money went to those modders, then I'd say support THEM, not BI. But it doesn't. Imagine buying a car, but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately. Sure the car runs, but just how useable is it?A quick glance at my steam page would reveal that I highly praised BI's adventurous approach to ArmA 2, and OA. I loved ArmA with a blazing passion, even though it's considered the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the series. OFP shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil-sims. Sure, since OFP, the series has had its caveats and nuances, but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided. So where did ArmA 3 go wrong? What could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games (+ 2 Expansions & DLC)? Well, lets start with the company and work our way up. You see, riding on the heels of the massive success that DayZ was thanks to word of mouth and LPs, BI somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most AAA companies do (Incomplete Games for Full Price, DLC strategies), could be done to their small communities. And you know what? They were right. We all bought into it. BI slowly came to realize that they could do less work, and still make more money, because their communities could turn nowhere else. What amazes me most about DayZ, besides the fact that it is still in Alpha after almost 2 years, and that it's lead creator left, is that all it really did was show what ArmA 2 was already capable of. Massive, persistent worlds with Mil-Sim themes. Just, with zombies.But, this is not a review of DayZ, this a review of ArmA 3. Any ArmA community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at ArmA 3's feet. Disguising as the enemy? Gone. The Railgun tank, one of the coolest features at E3, and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about? Poof. All the underwater showcases, hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay? Nope. Planes? We got 3. Funny thing is, all you Deluxe Edition owners should open up that Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manual it comes with sometime, and view all the planes we should have had. The reskinned C-130 and F-35? Fugetta about it. That's right, we couldn't even get recycled content.Now, let me be fair, ArmA 3's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries. And OFP/ArmA has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content. But Vanilla, the games were usually very playable, and very enjoyable. This is where ArmA 3 comes up the shortest. While the engine is great, and getting better with each patch, not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content, but the underlying issues since OFP are still there. 2013/2014, we still have an action menu. BI, please. Not to mention that AI has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements, rather than better.You know, some people actually say ArmA 2 people were spoiled because we had OFP and ArmA 1's content all rolled into one. I find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games. Who get paid for it. In closing I will say this. ArmA 3, as a game, is complete and total BS. ArmA 3, as a platform, for people to show their skills in modeling, texturing, and coding, fantastic. If you want ArmA 3, do it to support people who make great content. Just don't expect a full fledged game, for the full fledged price.			",187,8,9,14,13,1,21

												Arma 3 is a must-have game for those looking to have a realistic and immersive experience. However, this is not provided by the game itself, but by the communities that make this game bring out it's full potential. If you arent looking for a group just yet, there are always a large amount of public servers to start out in that can help you get a feel for the game. There are gamemodes such as wasteland, king of the hill, zues, and deathmatch, all available through the server browser. Bohemia also has official servers that run coop missions that are always available to connect to. Again, arma 3 can be played in a lot of different ways. You can stick go playing casually, or you can bring out its full potential by joining a community that runs a custom modpack. (Ad)Phantactical, for example, focuses on casual realism and fun. PhanTactical is a community that has come together to play ArmA in a semi-serious environment for over two years. By using a tailored suite of mods that enrich and enhance game play with new features, units, and terrains (ACE, TFAR, Op. Trebuchet, CUP Terrains/Weapons/Vehicles, Etc), An administration team that is open and flexible to always make sure the group and events are running as smoothly as possible.If you really want to have fun in this game - you should sign up @ www(dot)phantactical(dot)com.  We have two sessions per week, every operation is a new experience.Here are the requirements to join PhanTactical:Own ArmA 3Have a Microphone (No exceptions to this rule.)Have a mindset ready for tactical and community based adventures18+ (No exceptions to this rule.)(ad)Some of my best moments in arma came from being in a group. The amount of realism and immersion delivered by working together with a large amount of other players is extremely satisfying and rewarding. A fair warning, arma 3 isn't for everyone. The game is barely playable because of it's outdated engine, it has a insane amount of useless key bindings and has a totally different playstyle and approach than any other game on the market. If you are here for a casual, laid back fps, find another game. Arma is unforgiving, and is nowhere near the standards of a typical modern shooter. However, its a great experience to play, even if you do get your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed in.			",174,12,1,4,9,1,4

												If you like games with crappy controls, bad gameplay, and no incentive to do anything then this is the game for you. I played for a few hours and 50% of my time was spent walking around the woods getting blown up by random mines that I could not find or avoid. It seemed like any direction I walked in I would just explode. And when i managed to get past that AI that were out of my guns range just took potshots at me till i died. And to top it all off the game mechanics are only briefly explained, and not very well.I will never play this game again. I play games to relax and have fun, not to die 50 times just to walk to an objective. Bottom line is if you want to play a fun entertaining game this is not for you, but if your really into playing for 5 hours to just to walk to meet up with people by all means this game will be in your top 10.

												The dissapointment is strong with this one... The game has some ""cool"" features but is more frustrating than having explosive ♥♥♥♥♥how at your dates broken toilet. You get to use then new stances with ONLY the basics guns. Trying to do a half-kneel with an RPG or binocular to minimize detection, forget about it. Great uniforms (like in ARMA 2), combat gear (not much to choose between), and guns (worst sounds of the year award goes to...) The sight are also great, i especially love the extremely dirty reddots, that makes it seem like this ""soldier"" has never heard of cleaning his bloody equipment. Trying to be sneaky? FORGET IT! EVERY footstep sound like a rhino trying to dance, he SMASHES his heels in the ground every damn time.The engine and pshysics in this game are TERRIBLE! Basically, they took features we loved about ARMA 2, and replaced it with some very buggy, unrealistic, not working, pieces of of bad jokes! Their marketing campaing is ALOT like EA! You have to buy things that is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing crucial for the gameplay - that cost ALOT of money, and still does not make the game work either! Having the courage to admit that your game is SO unfinished that EA would not even realease it, and releasing the final things neede for it to be an actual ""Military realism shooter"" for free, could make up for the buggy game. But instead you crave money for everything, even though the game is pretty expensive to start off with.ARMA 2 -> great game, but with awful pshysics and engine.ARMA 3 -> Like a car without wheels and windshield. PLUS you are still stuck with the awful physics and engine!   So, if you end up buying this game you will end up needing to buy ALL the DLC's! Because they wil CONSTANTLY remind you that you ""... ARE MISSING THE FOLLOWING DLCS""  ",9,0,0,0,1,0,0

												ArmA III, the best present for any 7 year-old boy who used to make a mess in the living room playing Army Men..What kept me hooked to the ArmA Series is straight of the bat.. Bohemia's powerfull mission editor. The story mission is excellent couldn't complain, not as many bug as ArmA II campaign, so a huge plus from meand the only thing that i do not like the futureistic feel of it all but i think mods will definitely help me suit my need for a present day military scenarios like RHS, ADF and BAF etc. Speaking about mods i also couldn't find any game that could cope with a sh!tload ammount of mods - always a plus on my book, my ArmA III folder currently weigh 62.4 GB on my HDD (about 5x more than the original file size) i can rant about the mission editor for hours and hours but to make it short and simple..A very good successor to its predecessors, been playing the ArmA series for atleast a decade now , and sure will play for many more years to comeThank you Bohemia Interactive Studios, for making the most entertaining game of all time			",32,1,3,0,6,0,5

												I decided not to review this game until I had enough time in both the multiplayer and singleplayer to feel confident. My personal opinion: Arma 3 is the fourth Arma game I have played and is my third favourite. That may seem like a bad opinion, but considering the quality of the previous games in the series it actually isn't. Performance: Playing on an incredibly poor machine both in GPU and CPU, I am no stranger to low framerates and freezing. That said, Arma 3 has an incredible range of optimization. Many reviewers have complain about not getting their 60FPS on Ultra setting while playing on a server with 120 other players fighting 250 AI on the game's larger map, Altis. Even on my machine I get 20-40FPS during large-scale battles on both maps and 40-50 on large multiplayer servers. Considering what the game does, it does it very well.Content: The content in this Arma game is a little light in the land-vehicle department, but this is the first Arma game to get frequent updates constanly improving and adding content.Overall: 80/100Unbias view: Arma 3 is the least complete Arma game thus far, and updates do not excuse this considering the price-point.Overall: 74/100Therefore, I would recommend this game to any fan of military games, but watch some reviews and game-play first, as it is quite expensive.

Arma 3:1200 Hours of my Life spent playing Arma 3.270 kilometers squared of playable ground just on Altis.About 25 Weapons Plus 50 or so attachments.Over 50 VehiclesAll of that accounted for, and I still find some of the most beautiful places I have ever seen while playing Arma 3. Nevermind the fact that the modding capability means that you could play this game until 2035 when it is set and you still won't ever be bored of it.So do I recommend Arma 3? The answer is simple: 'This is War, and you have to experience it!'			",119,4,1,5,1,0,4

												Arma III is definitely, without a doubt, a great game. I have played Arma III mostly with mods such as: Wasteland, Altis Life, and Breaking Point (my favorite). I have also played the Campaign which is also good. There are no other games on Steam that are similar to Arma III (except for the other Arma games ofcourse). Arma III's multiplayer experience is exceptional. The best aspect of Arma III multiplayer , for me, would be the PVP. And that's why I play muliplayer most of the time. My favorite mod for Arma III would be Breaking Point. Breaking Point is very similar to Arma II's DayZ Mod which I have played quite a lot before. If you ever get around to playing Arma III, you should definitely try Breaking Point. Another great multiplayer mode would also be Wasteland. Wasteland doesn't require you to download any seperate files from the internet so it's quick and easy to start playing on. Arma III is full of action, excitement, and adrenaline rushing moments. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah!!			",18,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Alright now, Been seeing alot of whining about the game is not optimized and that♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU have to consider, this is no Lightweight game, this game will run havoc on your CPU if you don't have a strong CPU, this is a Simulator game top tier of its class, you cannot expect to run on full Ultra 60 FPS with loads of mods and scripts in certain missions, This is an extremely demanding game, It's very hard to optimize this kind of games, This is not Battlefield Hardlines in a Sandbox styled gameplay, This game is running on one of the worlds most demaning CPU, GPU and RAM engine's. And a 3-4 year old AMD CPU ain't gonna get you really far in this game, There alot of point's and factors here and there. This is just simply a demanding game ashell, Well enough about that.This game is extremely fun and good to play, You have lots of mods and tools you can use and play in this game. This game is definently an improvment since Arma 2 (And Arma 2 Is EVEN WORSE Optimized). I really can't tell and I really won't or care to tell much about the game in all aspects but  I can give a short brief idea of the game. This is a Military Simulation game kinda, It is an open world driven game, this game also has a Mission Editor ready for use, you can make missions and campaigns and whatever (aslong as you know how ;D ) Game is fairly fun and there alot of servers with different tons of game modes like Altis Life, Domination, Capture The Island, King of the Hill, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and so on. the game includes 3 Campaign Episodes that are quite interesting to play. Bohemia Interactive does a great job supporting the game and updating it. oh by the way. there exists a Zeus Player, Well there are some missions that includes Zeus, Zeus is a entity that a player can be. the Zeus function in the sense that you can make missions in real time while everyone is playing on the server, The Zeus can choose either to help or oppose the other players, by spawning in enemies or smite them with lighting strikes and so on. You can also use the Zeus in the Editor. All in all this game is definently worth the money, IF your PC can run it properly. K thx bye!			",147,20,0,19,41,0,30

												This game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war. There are several different types of game play you can do. Like all miltiplayers, this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with. The community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation. The graphics can look really great if your machine can run it. It is both a first person and a third person shooter, helis, jets, to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use. Each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them. I would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time, realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times. Many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue. Personally I'm not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 8/10 in my book.

												Initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. This was back in alpha. it sucked♥♥♥♥♥ and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! Completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being ""Zeus"" it has made gaming to a whole new level. Since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named STDelta. Its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. Would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. Live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur.~Hash			",100,5,0,10,4,0,5

												Don't...even...bother... not picking up this game! This game has changed my life completely. I'm now sober (6 months! I know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and I'm also off Heroin. Last year was a difficult year for me, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way I rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. Ever since I picked up Arma 3 6 months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop. I thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when I needed it the most.			",28,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game grew on me. One of my favorite YouTubers plays this somewhat often so I was  decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it. We've played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the Battle Royale mod, (which is a BLAST when you finally get into a reliable server).As others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. It's unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal. Sometimes things get slow, but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting.I'm looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers, which is a LOT.			",160,46,4,9,28,1,12

You dont need the DLC's to have fun in the game or experience anything more. just the base game is fun as it is. The amount of gamemodes and mods w/ addons just shows how much fun you are able to have in this game. the graphics are astonishing and the controls are amazing as well. finally what I have to say is that, if you are wanting a good FPS game with many other things to do whilst playing it then this game is for you. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a special game. This game is the most realistic warfare game on the market right now, if you like realism this is a must buy.Taking a single bullet can kill you. From my expirence I really enjoyed this game didn't play it enough yet.But for example here is what you do in one life:First you either walk a lot or use a chopper to get to the LZ ,once you arrive you will walk slowly either with your team or an ally going alone is risky. Be as silente of possible. Once you got the enemy in sight shoot to kill only. then displace never stay dig up. This is a realism warfare. 89/100If you are looking for a game that demand patience and you take gaming seriously this is for you. If you are looking for a fast game that requires no aim, no strategie or no realism I suggest COD.			",106,12,0,15,16,3,26

												V good this game is very good becuase i think it's 100% gagster and it's very good. You can play many games on the game and it's very good becuase of this. I would add this game stands out for not being too arcade and this attributes to it's very goodness and some of my friends play they say it's very good I would recommend this to those looking for a very good game and a very good time especially if you have a very good group of friends to play some good organised very good games. There's many good roles to play some more good than others and some are the most good. Thank.			",43,1,1,4,8,0,9

												It's a very good game. It's had manny issues with performance, requieres a processor with a really good single core performance, but it's a damn good title.It recently had a performance update, FPS went from unacceptable low with an i7 4790k and a gtx 970 to more than playable within one single patch. It's a shame the patch wasn't released earlier, as I've had a negative review for almost two years. Finaly the game runs at least somewhat decent.It's a slower paced shooter, with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a damn good game. The community is generally friendly, helpful towards newer players and more mature than in other games, but you will still meet idiots and jerks every now and then.I've played it for almost 1000 hours and I still havn't grown sick of it, ther'es just so much content and mods available. It's a game well worth buying, as long as you know what you buy you won't be dissapointed.			",99,9,0,7,12,0,7

 Review: Arma 3This is an Honest ReviewPROS➦ Super Detailed.➦ Realistic Military strategies. ➦ Singleplayer AND Multiplayer.➦ So many weapons and vehicles.➦ You will never run out of things to do. If you so desired, you could dress up as a civilian and go to the beach with your friends.➦ Vehicles and air vehicles handle OK.CONS➦ The engine is very poorly optimized. Getting a good FPS is tough in this game.➦ Most servers aren't the best.➦ Can be very confusing for new players, as there are many keys you need to know.➦ The community isn't the greatest.➦ The players can take the game very seriously. If you mess up or fool around, you could get banned.MY RATING: 7.5/10DO I RECOMMEND IT: Yes!			",72,4,1,6,9,0,3

If you like games like AA3 and Red Orchestra etc. chances are you will absolutley love Arma.All in all give it a try if its on a Steam Sale or if once of your friends already got it.

												Alright now, Been seeing alot of whining about the game is not optimized and that♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU have to consider, this is no Lightweight game, this game will run havoc on your CPU if you don't have a strong CPU, this is a Simulator game top tier of its class, you cannot expect to run on full Ultra 60 FPS with loads of mods and scripts in certain missions, This is an extremely demanding game, It's very hard to optimize this kind of games, This is not Battlefield Hardlines in a Sandbox styled gameplay, This game is running on one of the worlds most demaning CPU, GPU and RAM engine's. And a 3-4 year old AMD CPU ain't gonna get you really far in this game, There alot of point's and factors here and there. This is just simply a demanding game ashell, Well enough about that.This game is extremely fun and good to play, You have lots of mods and tools you can use and play in this game. This game is definently an improvment since Arma 2 (And Arma 2 Is EVEN WORSE Optimized). I really can't tell and I really won't or care to tell much about the game in all aspects but  I can give a short brief idea of the game. This is a Military Simulation game kinda, It is an open world driven game, this game also has a Mission Editor ready for use, you can make missions and campaigns and whatever (aslong as you know how ;D ) Game is fairly fun and there alot of servers with different tons of game modes like Altis Life, Domination, Capture The Island, King of the Hill, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and so on. the game includes 3 Campaign Episodes that are quite interesting to play. Bohemia Interactive does a great job supporting the game and updating it. oh by the way. there exists a Zeus Player, Well there are some missions that includes Zeus, Zeus is a entity that a player can be. the Zeus function in the sense that you can make missions in real time while everyone is playing on the server, The Zeus can choose either to help or oppose the other players, by spawning in enemies or smite them with lighting strikes and so on. You can also use the Zeus in the Editor. All in all this game is definently worth the money, IF your PC can run it properly. K thx bye!			",147,20,0,19,41,0,30

Nevermind the fact that the modding capability means that you could play this game until 2035 when it is set and you still won't ever be bored of it.So do I recommend Arma 3?

												Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.Bean Bag Buccaneers.10/10 goty			",250,12,2,17,15,0,24

												One of the most punishing, grueling, and rewading experiences I've had in gaming, ever. You aren't rewarded with XP and meaningless points per say, this is the only game I've played that has and continues to reward me with knowledge. (Garage bookshelves need not apply) I've learned more about the military, teamwork, combat, and aviation than any game that I've played before. Compass bearings, map grids, team leadership, these are things that were completely alien to me before I got invested into this game. If game communities like CSGO, Battlefield, and League of Legends are on the far end of the toxic spectrum, ARMA 3 would be on the opposite. I've never met a more devoted, compassionate community that doesn't help others because they need to, but because they want to. That's something genuinely special. To forego this game in favor of the cut and dry, annual release arcade shooters filled with whining manchildren and screeching tweens that still seem popular to this day, is a huge disservice to yourself.

												Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank			",160,23,0,7,11,1,15

												As you can see from this review, I have almost 500 hours in the game, so if you're looking for someone who knows it, trust me. Arma 3 is a Military Simulator, which means that you aren't getting the constant grinding, free-for-all match ups you find in FPS games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It also doesn't get much more realistic than this. But in terms of the actual game, there are a plethora of things to do. There are Altis Life RPG servers, which allow you to play the way you want, within certain constraints of course. There are wasteland servers as well, which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in. Also, if you get a group of people, you can run some pretty awesome missions, not to mention have a blast with the Zeus mode, which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically.Yes, there are bugs. Driving full force with a truck into a tank probably wouldn't cause it to blow up, for example. Rocks, walls, and even chicken-wire fences can disable plenty of vehicles, and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow. But the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on, such as dropping a truck from a helicopter, only to have it disappear the next instant, or fling back up and blow you out of the sky. Regardless of these, the actual content of Arma 3 is massive, and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense. The $59.99 price tag on this game shouldn't stop you from buying it, because it is worth every penny. If you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time, you can find a ton of videos on YouTube that may help you in your decision to buy it. Lastly, I mentioned before that this is not a Call of Duty or Battlefield game. They are all there own, and you may think that this game is too slow-paced if you are looking for that run-and-gun format of a game. But whileplaying this game, you find yourself in many different situations. Whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact, laser-designating a target for air-support to pulverize, or peaking around and pieing corners in a CQB scenario, you will find thousands of these unique situations, which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of FPS's and MILSIM's alike.

												Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic ""You suck at shooting!"" Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream ""WAIT!""... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said ""no need. we have both lost something."" He put the gun down. ""We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said ""Thank you.."" at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.Then i respawned			",82,5,0,8,8,1,1

												With the right mods and people, this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare]Arma's best feature is the dedicated modding community, you can find a mod for just about anything for Arma. the game simulates fatigue, breathing and pain effect, as well as weapon weight, meaning that there won't be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range. There is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. I love pretty much everything about Arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. The game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my Nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. And finally, Arma's controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. It can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster. Overall- 9.5/10  definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy Teamwork and tactical combat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Review: Arma 3This is an Honest ReviewPROS➦ Super Detailed.➦ Realistic Military strategies. ➦ Singleplayer AND Multiplayer.➦ So many weapons and vehicles.➦ You will never run out of things to do. If you so desired, you could dress up as a civilian and go to the beach with your friends.➦ Vehicles and air vehicles handle OK.CONS➦ The engine is very poorly optimized. Getting a good FPS is tough in this game.➦ Most servers aren't the best.➦ Can be very confusing for new players, as there are many keys you need to know.➦ The community isn't the greatest.➦ The players can take the game very seriously. If you mess up or fool around, you could get banned.MY RATING: 7.5/10DO I RECOMMEND IT: Yes!			",72,4,1,6,9,0,3

												ArmA III, the best present for any 7 year-old boy who used to make a mess in the living room playing Army Men..What kept me hooked to the ArmA Series is straight of the bat.. Bohemia's powerfull mission editor. The story mission is excellent couldn't complain, not as many bug as ArmA II campaign, so a huge plus from meand the only thing that i do not like the futureistic feel of it all but i think mods will definitely help me suit my need for a present day military scenarios like RHS, ADF and BAF etc. Speaking about mods i also couldn't find any game that could cope with a sh!tload ammount of mods - always a plus on my book, my ArmA III folder currently weigh 62.4 GB on my HDD (about 5x more than the original file size) i can rant about the mission editor for hours and hours but to make it short and simple..A very good successor to its predecessors, been playing the ArmA series for atleast a decade now , and sure will play for many more years to comeThank you Bohemia Interactive Studios, for making the most entertaining game of all time			",32,1,3,0,6,0,5

												It's a very good game. It's had manny issues with performance, requieres a processor with a really good single core performance, but it's a damn good title.It recently had a performance update, FPS went from unacceptable low with an i7 4790k and a gtx 970 to more than playable within one single patch. It's a shame the patch wasn't released earlier, as I've had a negative review for almost two years. Finaly the game runs at least somewhat decent.It's a slower paced shooter, with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a damn good game. The community is generally friendly, helpful towards newer players and more mature than in other games, but you will still meet idiots and jerks every now and then.I've played it for almost 1000 hours and I still havn't grown sick of it, ther'es just so much content and mods available. It's a game well worth buying, as long as you know what you buy you won't be dissapointed.			",99,9,0,7,12,0,7

												One Word for this Game:G-R-E-A-THow many hours does a normal EA title entertain you for like 60-70 Bucks? 5-8 hours, maybe 10-12 hours?ArmA3 is easily crushing those titles because of re-playability, nearly endless options of customization, building your own szenarios, scripts, addons, islands. You can even find gametypes and mods, that change the way to play ArmA3. They modify it to be played apart from the original way to play it. (Those mods and missions are Boiling Point, Wasteland, Altis Life RPG)Some might hit their heads now to a table, as this isn´t the way ArmA is meant to be played. But it shows whats possible with the game and the engine at all =).This is, what gamers want. A long term motivation (Look at my game hours :D) and a huge sandbox to be entertained for years.(Sure there are bugs and features, the communitiy is mostly right to complain about) But the steps BIS did to fulfill the wishes of the community, involved changing parts of the team also. Since like 6-7 month the developing and bugfixing gets faster.ArmA 3 in a nutshell:-A tactic Shooter with simulation elements.-You have to actually think before making a move.-You can have great battles, both coop and team-vs-team.-The Mod support for this game is really great. As above: User created content like islands, content addons, mods, missions, campaigns, replacements.-Even a normal battle between a fireteam gets you harder than it would on every other game here around.If you search for a game where you are entertained for years, a semi-realistic warfare, combined arms gameplay, an open world sandbox game? Then look no further. Trash the other  games and get in soldier!			",64,4,1,10,6,0,7

												Great game, really well done even!The best mil sim there is i believe, and really because of the player base. While the game is great, the player base has really developed Arma into the golden egg that it is. There are still some major problems with it though. Bohemia still has some major bugs to work out with the development of the games because issues like glitching through a floor, railing or anything is really not acceptable. Also, things like AI seeing and shooting a player at ridiculous distance THROUGH bushes, trees, etc, sometimes makes it really difficult. Im not pro, but i definitely have some skill and there are some major issues with it. This also kinda helps the mediocre at best campaign......Speaking of the campaign, i mean just that. It isnt a great campaign. Its okay at best, and many times you will die because there wasnt something explained or something impossible to avoid with out pre knowledge (running behind the lead going through a forest and he steps on a mine killiing both of you). The ability of this game, and how far it can still grow is par none. The game feels great, mechanics are great. A few downfalls that if Bohemia properly used used resources better they could fix.I hope Bohemia and the player base are able to keep building this together to make it even better still.

												This game grew on me. One of my favorite YouTubers plays this somewhat often so I was  decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it. We've played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the Battle Royale mod, (which is a BLAST when you finally get into a reliable server).As others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. It's unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal. Sometimes things get slow, but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting.I'm looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers, which is a LOT.			",160,46,4,9,28,1,12

												I've had this game since early alpha, and all I can say is that it is a very good game. the amount of details and ways to play makes it very injoyable. You dont need the DLC's to have fun in the game or experience anything more. just the base game is fun as it is. The amount of gamemodes and mods w/ addons just shows how much fun you are able to have in this game. the graphics are astonishing and the controls are amazing as well. finally what I have to say is that, if you are wanting a good FPS game with many other things to do whilst playing it then this game is for you. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma III is an infantry simulation more hardcore than than COD Black Ops or BF3.  I'm looking forward to playing in more team-oriented groups, rather than a bunch of lone wolves.  Dslyecxi's Tactical Techniques and Procedures guide is well written, team oriented, and aimed at the best player experience, rather than obsessive fidelity to actual ops.  Also check out his Youtube channel for game videos of large scale missions.			",331,69,4,35,75,0,115

												INITIAL REVIEW AFTER 1.5 HOURS OF PLAYTrue story. Went through boot camp. Went on first mission. Sent to figure out what happened to convoy. Find evidence convoy was ambushed. Get ambushed myself. Get shot. Shoot back. Kill bad guys. Find good guy who is hurt. Pick up medkit to help him. Click left mouse button by mistake, rather than space bar. Kill good guy. Mission ends because friendly fire is not tolerated.This game is all I hoped it would be so far. Super realistic. Great details. All good so far. Much to learn just from the prologue.

												Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ARMA 3 is very different from ARMA 2, It is not a game for people that want fast action gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the small things, this game requires patience and tactical skill, There are experiences in ARMA 3 that you will not experience in Battlefield, or Call Of Duty, for example the tactical aspect of ARMA 3, if your lucky enough to be part of a tactical community then you can get the full benefits of playing ARMA 3, not like wasteland or altis life. ARMA 3 has burst up from the old ARMA's from the help of Dayz, i'm not saying Dayz game arma all the populatrity but it defintly gave them the boost they needed. I remeber when i first joined a tactical server, i was a noob, i had no clue what these call signs ment, or any command chain. But i was rushed to a heli and placed into bravo squad, i was told to stick next to the medkit, when i look back i think i chose the marksman load out, i was not very useful to the group in till we revived a lot of heavy fire, once are squad lead went down, it was just me and the medic, as the medic couldn't go down i had to rush out into the feild, dragging theese random people back to cover, now i did not know any of theese people, but in the moment it felt like i did, i felt like i was part of the team. Once i dragged half of my bleeding team out, i was assigned a special job, i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective, when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it, but never the less i manage to place down the charge, as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac, i looked around and saw the tower blow, it came crashing down into the hill. At the moment i relised this is what ARMA 3 is ment to be like. 9.5/10 -Lewis			",117,14,0,6,9,0,9

												With the right mods and people, this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare]Arma's best feature is the dedicated modding community, you can find a mod for just about anything for Arma. the game simulates fatigue, breathing and pain effect, as well as weapon weight, meaning that there won't be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range. There is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. I love pretty much everything about Arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. The game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my Nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. And finally, Arma's controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. It can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster. Overall- 9.5/10  definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy Teamwork and tactical combat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had to add some more things to this review, as I started to appreciate it even more after some time spent in the game, both playing and creating content.I tend to get rambly, so this is going to be a TL;DR version for you if you don't like reading textwalls: It's just awesome. Very immersive and deep, rewarding, satisfying, milsim experience.1st episode of campaign took me 4 hours of gameplay on its own. Both multiplayer and singleplayer are great, along with the community-made content available via workshop.Looks beautiful on graphics cranked up to ultra. I was even able to set my sampling to 150% while lowering antialiasing to 2x without any performance loss after the recent updates and I have to say - the graphics are phenomenal.Second and third episodes of campaign were good as well, added up towards a complete story which gave me some backup on game's plot and situation on Altis in 2035.Zeus is very exciting, but it takes some practice and experience to provide players with fun time.Fatigue & weapon inertia updates added a lot of depth to shooting.Now there is rotorLib to come along with shooting from vehicles, and that's going to change helo flying entirely.See what I'm doing here? I'm proving you the devs constantly make this game better, it evolves on your eyes, and every day you play it you find something new about it, for example - recently I found out the angular size of the moon is actually correct, the night sky mapping is accurate and you can navigate using the northern star, and measure the distance using your compass and mils on it, like in real life.Enough of this rambling.I have to say it's breathtakingly good. The possibilities it offers, the dev team which continues to add deepness to it...Some people don't like the recent updates, but for me these updates just build up more realism and add to overall greatness. And the team takes feedback into account, having really good policies both on DLCs and on new content put into the game.Things you can do modding it are pretty crazy. I'll give you an example for better understanding:- The game itself, in vanilla version, features pretty complex ballistic mechanics. It also features exhaust pipe particle effect of hot air. What has one to do with another you might ask?Well, a mod author took the first one, added much more deepness to create accurate ballistic simulation, and even used the particle effect I've mentioned earlier to simulate bullet trace effect in high-power optics...Yup, you can do anything you want with this game.

I live ArmA, I love ArmA. Nothing on the market comes close.Mods and the comunity really bring this game to life and are its reason for being. I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a hardcore, insane, serious, zany experience. You can literally do anything you can set your mind to.

												Okay. Arma 3, it's a good game.. It brings some fun content, i bought the deluxe edition, which was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mistake. some of the weapons exist in real life, however they are sadly not named after their real life counterparts, which is understandable because Bohemia Interactive would have too pay for license, but still..Tank gameplay is fine, ai like always can be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but hey, it's AI..Jets is adequate, it's not a flight sim, it has the basic flight characteristics so that it works, but calling it a 100% flight sim would be incorrect. and Joystick is almost a must for the jets.Helo's, they are modelled alot better, and i like 'em. and unlike the jets they can be fine without a joystick and pedals, however you would of course be better with it. Online play? well, we all know the history of Arma to be horribly optimised, which i agree to in some extent, but it's also a massive game, and putting that in a multiplayer enviorment where not only you, but other players and several scripts are all rendered in. Very very few can play this game on 100% graphics settings when on a multiplayer server. most put it down to medium or low. Over-all it's a good game, with mods it gets even better. if you like FPS that have a bit larger realism to it, get this. or Insurgency, but insurgency doesn't have tanks and helo's now does it? :)			",28,4,0,4,6,0,10

												Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic ""You suck at shooting!"" Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream ""WAIT!""... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said ""no need. we have both lost something."" He put the gun down. ""We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said ""Thank you.."" at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.Then i respawned			",82,5,0,8,8,1,1

												I love the Arma Series to death, I have logged well over 1000 hours on Arma 2, but it does have some drawbacks and bugs that can get very annoying.Pros: Combined Operations Warfare (Tanks/Air/Infantry)Great community with lots of servers. (RPG Life/Sector Control/Domination)Amazing mods made by the communityIn-Game Mission EditorHuge mapsGreat gun mechanicsFiring from helicoptersSling loading cargo with helicoptersA good amount of weapons and vehicles to choose fromThe developers update a lotCons:Vehicles randomly blow up sometimesPhysics can be very dodgyThe Engine is pretty old (13 Years I think?)Very poorly optomized, I usually run at about 18 FPS and I can run most games on high settings.If you don't have at least a high-mid range gaming computer don't bother trying to run this.All in all, for everything thats broken with this game, it makes up for it with amazing gameplay especially if you join a group. I play with a realism infantry unit that does operations every week and even though I lag I still have an amazing time. Never have I fealt as immersed in a game as I do when I play ARMA.

												I have always been a fan of military simulation. The base game which offers co-op mode is already challenging as the AI sometimes can be very skilful. The amount of times you die is insane; in a chopper on the way to mission, fire fight with the AI and stepping on landmines etc.ARMA 3 community is generally helpful and what keeps us playing is the game's ability to install add-ons and mods. They really can bring your alter-ego to life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ArmA 3 delievers the greatest expirience to date, and it even allows you to:-Fight a futuristic force of ants-Single handedly fight terrorism in your underwear-Fight an overwhelming force of quickly populating bunnies-Watch a guy do a backflip from a headshotAnd last but not least, customize your gun and character to take on any threat to the wonderful US nation with your squad, which may involve:-Watching your friend get mowed down in front of you-Watching your friend get blown up from an APC-Be able to do tactical drive by's-And much, much more!

												You need to try it to get a feel if you would like Arma, its not like Battlefield or Call Of Duty. I did buy the game before I even had a PC that could run it and that was a bit of a gamble. I do enjoy the game.I have played both Call Of Duty and Battlefield and this is quite diffrent to both of them. While it is more realistic than both of Call Of Duty and Battlefield there are community based mods that take this further and make the game feel much more realistic (such as ACE).Since Arma 3 is such a large game (as a community) its best that someone buys the game and trys it out. I made a list of Pros and Cons just so you can get an idea of how the game feels.Pros:Wide range of gamemodes and community made contentGreat community backing itDLC is not ""forced"" appon players (such as Helicopter DLC, players can use the helicopters as long as they are not in the ""crew roles""). The main thing being the DLC is not made in a way that you are forced to buy it so you can have a great experience.The modding community does provide a massive range of content that can be used from maps, to new vehciles, buildins and guns for players to use.Single player and offline game play runs very well.Aircraft are easy to fly but they need you to master them. You can learn to fly your self in the editor with helicopters but if you want to get a hand on using them for combat, do the tutorials and then join a mill-sim unit and build your skills from there.Cons: (this is mainly performance related stuff)I recomend installing the main game on an SSD to prevent frame drops, mods and other content should be fine on a HDD but if the mod is causing the game to slow down put it on the SSD with Arma 3. I used to have Arma 3 on a HDD and running around 20  frames per second in multiplayer (this is in kavala on altis when playing KOTH), after using Arma 3 on an SSD I was getting about 60-70 frames per second in multiplayer (in kavala on altis playing KOTH). (Since you proberly don't own the game when looking at this review, kavala is a large town/city on a map called altis, altis is a large island and is based on a real world place called ""Limnos"" near ""Greece"").Random memory leaks causing massive frame drops and making the game unplayable for 10-20 minites unless you restart. This can be a problem if your playing gamemodes that are persistant and save data such as KOTH, flying aircraft or you are in some form of combat since you will most likly die.The frame rate will drop quite randomly when playing multiplayer (single player its fine its quite consistant)Server sometimes don't always give error messages on missing dependencys (while this won't affect your every day player, if you host servers this can be really hard in helping diagnose problems. I resently have a problem where I was missing a software dependency and the server would crash without an error message. I have not been able to replicate this since the latest update so I think its been fixed).			",42,3,2,0,13,0,2

												Okay. Arma 3, it's a good game.. It brings some fun content, i bought the deluxe edition, which was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mistake. some of the weapons exist in real life, however they are sadly not named after their real life counterparts, which is understandable because Bohemia Interactive would have too pay for license, but still..Tank gameplay is fine, ai like always can be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but hey, it's AI..Jets is adequate, it's not a flight sim, it has the basic flight characteristics so that it works, but calling it a 100% flight sim would be incorrect. and Joystick is almost a must for the jets.Helo's, they are modelled alot better, and i like 'em. and unlike the jets they can be fine without a joystick and pedals, however you would of course be better with it. Online play? well, we all know the history of Arma to be horribly optimised, which i agree to in some extent, but it's also a massive game, and putting that in a multiplayer enviorment where not only you, but other players and several scripts are all rendered in. Very very few can play this game on 100% graphics settings when on a multiplayer server. most put it down to medium or low. Over-all it's a good game, with mods it gets even better. if you like FPS that have a bit larger realism to it, get this. or Insurgency, but insurgency doesn't have tanks and helo's now does it? :)			",28,4,0,4,6,0,10

												You need to try it to get a feel if you would like Arma, its not like Battlefield or Call Of Duty. I did buy the game before I even had a PC that could run it and that was a bit of a gamble. I do enjoy the game.I have played both Call Of Duty and Battlefield and this is quite diffrent to both of them. While it is more realistic than both of Call Of Duty and Battlefield there are community based mods that take this further and make the game feel much more realistic (such as ACE).Since Arma 3 is such a large game (as a community) its best that someone buys the game and trys it out. I made a list of Pros and Cons just so you can get an idea of how the game feels.Pros:Wide range of gamemodes and community made contentGreat community backing itDLC is not ""forced"" appon players (such as Helicopter DLC, players can use the helicopters as long as they are not in the ""crew roles""). The main thing being the DLC is not made in a way that you are forced to buy it so you can have a great experience.The modding community does provide a massive range of content that can be used from maps, to new vehciles, buildins and guns for players to use.Single player and offline game play runs very well.Aircraft are easy to fly but they need you to master them. You can learn to fly your self in the editor with helicopters but if you want to get a hand on using them for combat, do the tutorials and then join a mill-sim unit and build your skills from there.Cons: (this is mainly performance related stuff)I recomend installing the main game on an SSD to prevent frame drops, mods and other content should be fine on a HDD but if the mod is causing the game to slow down put it on the SSD with Arma 3. I used to have Arma 3 on a HDD and running around 20  frames per second in multiplayer (this is in kavala on altis when playing KOTH), after using Arma 3 on an SSD I was getting about 60-70 frames per second in multiplayer (in kavala on altis playing KOTH).

												An amazing game! 6.5/10As I started from the Alpha of ArmA 3, I noticed as the game progressed I lost my ability to not only run the game once it hit beta but also blue screened three times. I've had multiple problems and even managed to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues. Now as Beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner I decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old ArmA 2 A.C.E. and waited till the games full release. As I was pumped for the full release I noticed that nothing had changed from the beta. Same maps, same vehicles, same sounds, same weapons, and same factions. The lack of things for the Sea was a huge disappointment because the ArmA 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted. The lack of Air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place. Although it says its a ArmA game I dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts. Yes, a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing ArmA 2. I dont feel the immersion of ArmA:Gold Edition and  ArmA 2 in ArmA 3. but, it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles, amazing hud system, stance system, amazing animations, ability for both customization over weaponary/uniform and a bunch of downloadable mods/maps that can keep you playing for hours just like ArmA 2.I'm just disappointed that they didn't take their time on this game. Why couldn't they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ACE mod or even some of the other cool things like I44, VTE, and etc.Although all the bad things I have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around. I just hope this game becomes better in the future so I can start enjoying it again.			",123,7,1,16,5,1,20

												As you can see from this review, I have almost 500 hours in the game, so if you're looking for someone who knows it, trust me. Arma 3 is a Military Simulator, which means that you aren't getting the constant grinding, free-for-all match ups you find in FPS games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It also doesn't get much more realistic than this. But in terms of the actual game, there are a plethora of things to do. There are Altis Life RPG servers, which allow you to play the way you want, within certain constraints of course. There are wasteland servers as well, which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in. Also, if you get a group of people, you can run some pretty awesome missions, not to mention have a blast with the Zeus mode, which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically.Yes, there are bugs. Driving full force with a truck into a tank probably wouldn't cause it to blow up, for example. Rocks, walls, and even chicken-wire fences can disable plenty of vehicles, and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow. But the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on, such as dropping a truck from a helicopter, only to have it disappear the next instant, or fling back up and blow you out of the sky. Regardless of these, the actual content of Arma 3 is massive, and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense. The $59.99 price tag on this game shouldn't stop you from buying it, because it is worth every penny. If you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time, you can find a ton of videos on YouTube that may help you in your decision to buy it. Lastly, I mentioned before that this is not a Call of Duty or Battlefield game. They are all there own, and you may think that this game is too slow-paced if you are looking for that run-and-gun format of a game. But whileplaying this game, you find yourself in many different situations. Whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact, laser-designating a target for air-support to pulverize, or peaking around and pieing corners in a CQB scenario, you will find thousands of these unique situations, which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of FPS's and MILSIM's alike.

												Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank			",160,23,0,7,11,1,15

												Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic ""You suck at shooting!"" Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream ""WAIT!""... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said ""no need. we have both lost something."" He put the gun down. ""We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said ""Thank you.."" at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.Then i respawned			",82,5,0,8,8,1,1

												One of the most punishing, grueling, and rewading experiences I've had in gaming, ever. You aren't rewarded with XP and meaningless points per say, this is the only game I've played that has and continues to reward me with knowledge. (Garage bookshelves need not apply) I've learned more about the military, teamwork, combat, and aviation than any game that I've played before. Compass bearings, map grids, team leadership, these are things that were completely alien to me before I got invested into this game. If game communities like CSGO, Battlefield, and League of Legends are on the far end of the toxic spectrum, ARMA 3 would be on the opposite. I've never met a more devoted, compassionate community that doesn't help others because they need to, but because they want to. That's something genuinely special. To forego this game in favor of the cut and dry, annual release arcade shooters filled with whining manchildren and screeching tweens that still seem popular to this day, is a huge disservice to yourself.

Arma 3Twelve Thirteen Fourteen Fifteen hundred hours. I'll be damned. I have to say, you must wonder what it is about this game that keeps me coming back. I've always loved this series, and I think it's about time that I give this title a good, hard look. Shall we?GraphicsWhile Arma 3 isn't exactly on the bleeding-edge in terms of visuals, it is nonetheless a quite good looking game; what it lacks in small details it makes up for with an extremely good color palette and very realistic setting. Many games attempt to imitate real life, but Arma 3 is one of the only ones I believe has succeeded, and quite a few times a screenshot in-game will closely resemble a real picture of a Greek island. Furthermore, the game features a very impressive scope, with the main terrain clocking in at 270 km(sq) in size, and the smallest being 20 km(sq). So, for its size, its graphics are more than sufficient, and Arma 3 definitely immerses you in its world.

AudioArma 3 features decent enough sound design, and while it's not as impressive as the abilities of the Frostbite engine I don't doubt that it is fairly realistic. If that's not your cup of tea, there are always mods that overhaul the sound design to be considerably more realistic. The environmental sounds are also quite nice, and they help a great deal with immersion. The music is not spectacular, but it follows a specific theme, and fits Arma 3 well enough. I don't have any complaints here.PerformanceHere's the one everyone disagrees on. Arma definitely isn't the best performing game, but it isn't the worst, either. If you're considering this game, you need to keep something in mind: Arma 3 requires a more powerful CPU than many other games, but conversely doesn't require as powerful of a GPU. I would also recommend 8 GB of RAM, to play it safe. With my current system, I manage a fairly consistent 50-60 FPS in singleplayer, and similar in multiplayer depending on the server and gamemode.GameplayArma 3 is a slower paced, tactical combined-arms game. It features an in-depth infantry combat system (though grenade-throwing is lackluster) and a good arsenal of weapons, uniforms, helmets, vests, backpacks, and more. The inventory system allows for a great deal of customization, and opens the door for a large variety of gamemodes outside of military simulation. Ballistics are simulated well, and AI is surprisingly adaptive to whatever situation it is thrown into - save for inside of buildings, where it stumbles hard. Vehicles are also a major focus; many feature great interiors, but armored vehicles (IFVs, APCs, tanks) are disappointing in this regard with a plain, undetailed interior. It is definitely not a vehicle simulator, so you won't find a great flight model for aircraft, but helicopters have a respectable enough flight model. Another aspect you're sure to encounter sooner or later is commanding your subordinates. With players, of course, they're usually smart enough to take care of themselves, but the AI requires some major babysitting, which quickly becomes an uninteresting chore. With that said, the command system is still quite powerful, and the range of orders you can give out is virtually unmatched. Indeed, its gameplay is one of the two biggest reasons I keep coming back; there's nothing quite like it if you're looking for long-range light infantry engagements with combined-arms support.SingleplayerI was pleasantly surprised by the singleplayer options offered by Arma 3. The Bootcamp campaign and VR training offers new players a good opportunity to familiarize themselves with Arma 3's controls and mechanics; showcase scenarios allow players to control vehicles and use gear in a safer environment than multiplayer. The campaign is a mixed bag, however. The first two-thirds of the campaign are fairly good, with semi-open world environments and varied missions. These are all presented better than Arma campaigns have been in the past, as well. However, the last third leaves much to be desired. It felt rushed and was much shorter, and less open. Despite this, it was still a decent enough singleplayer experience. What's more, scenarios can be created in the mission editor for either single- or multiplayer, greatly extending the length of Arma 3's singleplayer lifespan.

MultiplayerIf you are familiar with the Arma series, you already know how many options are present in multiplayer. I was disappointed by the lack of gamemodes provided officially, but this was not a complete surprise. Many of the gamemodes that have been created now by the community are of great quality, and each offer hundreds of hours of gameplay. Plus, co-op missions can be created either in the editor or with the official Zeus ""dungeon master"" framework and gamemode, which is where many of my hours in-game came from. Numerous groups exist to make Arma 3 their very own, with modpacks many gigabytes in size and unique environments to be found in each, from military simulation to casual gatherings. This is where most of Arma 3's gameplay will come from, and I believe it is a fantastic part of PC gaming. Just remember that if you're ever looking for something more serious than public servers, the best thing to do is to check out a group that plays regularly.[units.arma3.com]Community ContentArma was built around support for community content, featuring an incredibly powerful in-game 3D mission editor, scripting support both in the editor and out, and development tools for creating new content. One of the gamemodes is even designed as a canvas for players to create custom missions on the fly. Arma 3 is still played without modifications, but a large percentage of servers either allow or require modifications, showing how much the community has taken advantage of this so far. It truly allows for some fantastic things, and I absolutely have to mention it here, as it is one of my favorite things about the series.

VerdictArma 3 is probably one of my favorite military games, period. It is one of the longest lasting, and I still haven't gotten bored of it even after one thousand three hundred hours. It definitely isn't for everyone given its slower paced, tactical gameplay, but it is a great platform for a wide variety of experiences thanks to its support for the community; one which I cannot help but recommend.I recommend Arma 3.

												Seriously worth the money, but be prepared to use virtually every key your keyboard was made with, and you will be faced with a rather steep learning curve. It's one of those games that, no matter how long you play, you will always be able to continue learning new things. Getting used to the ballistic characteristics of each and every weapon can take a while, and flying a heli could almost be considered an art. Then there's jets, tanks and even VTOL.It's a shame the DLC is priced so heavily (I'm looking at you, APEX), yet despite this, I still remain a fan of the Tanoa map at the very least.The best part of this game? The modding community! Seriously, there is such an overwhelming amount of mods available that replayability is virtually endless.Massive thumbs up/10			",24,5,0,8,11,0,4

												The latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general. Arma 3 Features two new maps called Stratis (which can be compared to Utes of Arma 2) and Altis, which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in East to West length. The Arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization, which is still evident in the latest insatllment, yet the optimization has been FAR improved in this version of Bohemia Interactive's spotlight franchise. The graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on Ultra settings (that is, if you can run it). This game is still prone to glitches, bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning. Some of the bugs are eveident in player movent, which has been vastly improved upon the last installment, allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting. The movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than Arma 2. Some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed. The vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics (however the physics are not on the par of games like Forza 5) with realistic vehicle speeds. The vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times. The weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous Arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects. Arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability, adding a more in depth (no pun intended) maritime experience. This allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well. Some of the things I want to see in Arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy (for example, if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car). Another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you character's weapons allowing for military simmulation dirve-bys. My final verdict of Arma 3 is a very solid 8.5 out of 10. Arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability, yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back Bohemia Interactive's flagship series back once more. If these glitches were to be fixed Arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the Call of Duty franchise or Battlefield franchise as well. Buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience, you can have a blast on this game.			",46,0,0,2,3,0,1

												A realistic Military Simulator, this game is worth a buy. With the ability to create your own missions with the amazing editor and to play others with the in-built workshop support, you can have endless hours of enjoyment with this game. It's quite realistic, but still lacks many features of military warfare that could be put into the game. The graphics ain't so good on my computer but that's because my computer is 8 years old and I will be upgrading soon so I will be able to see this game at it's full potential.This was my first game in the Arma series, followed by Arma 2 (We don't speak of Cold War Assualt). From my experience with Arma 2 this game doen't differ enormously, bar graphics of course. However, it does have some features that are not present in Arma 2, and I frequently notice these features missing when playing Arma 2.If you are new to the Arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on Arma 2.This is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life. Worth a buy in my opinion.8/10P.S. I haven't played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesn't run so well on my computer and I can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops.			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

												With over 3,100 hours, I think I am more than qualified to tell you about the game. So, what is ArmA 3? ArmA 3 is a tactical fps/third person shooter simulator. Quite a mouthful huh? ArmA 3, I would have to say is by far the best game I have ever played, and until ArmA 4 comes out, the best game I will ever play. Bohemia has truelly one upped most, if not all, shooting games out there to date. And with the mature, professional community that plays ArmA 3, it is not hard to find excellent modifications to the game. Some of the best community game mods I can recommend to you right now are Altis Life and ArmA 3 Life. However, should you find yourself more interested in the tactical side of ArmA, there are units out there that replicate real world military units, that provide tactical gameplay, as well as assisting you to better yourself in the field of ArmA 3. But before you go do anything, be sure to play the campaign, as that will help you learn ArmAs mechanics, and assist you in your career of ArmA. While I myself am still looking for a role play server. There are plenty of MilSim units out there though. 173rd Airborne Brigade, 15th MEU. Currently I am apart of the 173rd and can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it. Recruiting Now. TeamSpeak IP: ts3.173rd.usWebsite Link: http://beta.173rd.us/index.php? ",52,2,0,4,3,1,2

However, it does have some features that are not present in Arma 2, and I frequently notice these features missing when playing Arma 2.If you are new to the Arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on Arma 2.This is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life. Worth a buy in my opinion.8/10P.S. I haven't played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesn't run so well on my computer and I can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops.			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

Great expectations - By Bohemia Interactive. I've been waiting for a demo but this weekend I got the chance to try the game for free. And needless to say, I'm disappointed. ----edit----Needed to add this.The ongoing debate on the forums are mostly about three things.1: Someone who say this game isn't fun or lack content.Replied with: Play with mods!2: Someone who say this game runs poorly on high end systems.Replied with: Tweak your computer!3: The AI is kind of stupid.Replied with: Use missions which script the AI!What I can't understand is why these people accept this and buy the game at full price.When they, by replying as they do, admit and agree the game isn't finished or optimised!Arma 3 Forums*Troubleshooting & bugs	29,45%
Multiplayer & Mods	23,22%
General Discussions	19,71%
Social network & Clans	14,07%
Mission & script edit.	7,75%
Trash bin		5,81%*14-10-27 (YMD)----end edit----Sure everything looks pretty, the humorous dialogues from Arma 2 have been redone and look the soldiers ""ragdoll to the ground"" when shot! GASP! I didn't like the future take of this with ""UH-99^2 Black Shoe"" or whatever they were called. That wouldn't have mattered if!The AI could make use of buildings The AI could drive vehicles down a road without swirling off or get stuck in buildings or colliding with each other as they've been doing since Arma 2 The AI could fly aircraft instead of ploughing them into the ground as they've been doing since Arma 2 The AI could fly helicopters in a flight path instead of ""ducking"" about(increase height when reaching a WP and get shot down by AA) as they've been doing since Arma 2 The AI couldn't see through foliage(grass, bushes etc) as they've been doing since Arma 2 The AI could... etc etc... as they've been doing since Arma 2 Sure, all these things can be scripted to work as expected, but seriously? This game is purely for multiplayer with mods which completely change the game to actually work. I admire the modders who carry on with making the mods to make this game floating, you are the ones who should get paid, not Bohemia! The current state and price of this game is not accepted! What bohemia should have done was to release the graphic engine, script engine and a few vehicles for the modders to use as reference. Then after a while released DLC with more content... Better luck with Arma 4 With a new graphics engine to match. Concentrate on soldier combat Release DLC when new features are working, like AI can fly helicopters and so on.----edit---Oh and don't forget to down vote this review because I think a game should have value and be worth buying!It'll be on sale in a few years, I'll get back then. In the meantime I'll play Arma 2 because with that I have no expectations!----end edit----			",37,16,3,12,13,1,21

Down they fell, our M249 PIP was knocking them down like it was nothing.Their reinforcements arived, driving blue cars with blinding lights.

Typical lifespan for a game like this is 10yrs + (People still make mods for OFP) so you can easily get your moneys worth.Enjoy!			",41,1,1,5,11,0,10

												This game shows a life of a soldier. It invites a new enviornmental gameplay for players that play COD or BF. ArmA 3 is a military simulator game is fatigue is a thing, carrying too much gear can lack you falling behind your squad. Jumping isn't a thing in ArmA 3 making it better because you can't really jump with mass of gear your carrying on you. The gun sounds are beautiful and blasts my ears on my astro a40s just lovely. The whole campaign was immersive and intense.I highly recommend this game to people who like amazing beautiful geographic graphics, people who know to use strategy and are paitent.

Futuristic setting is not for me but the gameplay mechanics are way better than Arma2,the new gear menu makes picking up stuff much less of a chore as compared to the old and clunky gear System in A2.As with almost all of the ARMA series,optimization issues are present , however i believe that it will eventually be better optimized.9/10			",64,0,0,3,7,0,16

												ArmA 3 continues the ArmA series, of which I owned every game in the past. The graphics got a boost, along with a new, rather large, map. Even after finishing the game, the steam workshop content will allow you to continue playing, with entire new gamemodes, campaigns, islands, ... . Almost all OFP / ArmA / ArmA 2 maps are available as an addon.ArmA 3 is the first game in the series to get DLC. You get the mechanics of every DLC for free, leaving only the actual items to buy. The DLC are nice-to-have options, but are in no way required to play the game. With over 400h of playtime, it's still a true favorite!			",43,17,1,1,22,1,20

Just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! But, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. But, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. Most people only play Altis Life, the role playing section of the game, which I'd rather just play GTA online. If this is on sale, buy it. Wouldn't shell out the full $60 on it though. If you love tactical games such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, this is your game.  All in all 8/10.			",70,5,0,11,1,0,0

												  This game is by far one of the best games that I have ever played. I payed 60.00 for it and have not regretted it since! I love this game to death but I play the mods like Battle Royal and Altis. I recommend this game because it brings you to a new state of gaming. Not only are you able to enjoy 1v1 combat or 2v2 combat u can have wars with eachother if you get the right set of people. I have enjoyed this game more than any other just because I caan basically do whatever I want to do and either evade police to get away with it or be kind and help whoever comes along!   If you're loooking for a solid multiplayer game this is the one that will capture your attention more than any other. Not only will you devore 300 hours of gameplay you will begin to shape your personality of gaming to become a Rebel, Cop, or Savior. Love live the X-Generation!			",31,6,0,5,5,0,6

												Arma 3 is probably the best shooter I've ever played.  If you're a COD player, or an active Battlefield player, like I was, this is going to be a huge step for you.  It's a hard game to play, yes, but Bohemia does a great job in giving a comprehensive training course in the virtual reality.  After you get out of virtual reality, enter the world of Altis and Stratis, two Mediterranean islands, most likely off the coast of Greece.  The map size is incredible.  Larger than Skyrim, Fallout 4, and probably The Witcher III put together.  Try running from side to side... just try.  The two islands feature millions and millions of placed objects.  The game ($60 on steam) is totally worth every penny, ESPECIALLY with user-created mods.  Dive into the mods, this game basically becomes invaluable.  Arma 3 truly is an incredible feet of gaming.On the maps - They're huge!  You'll need a vehicle to get around definitely.  Their size is only rivalled by their beauty, if you're playing on ultra high settings it's almost like real life, or at least as close as a game can get.  The country side is not thrown aside in terms of details, actually, it's focused on.  You'll find things such as harbors, wind turbine fields, solar farms, small villages, forests, and rolling plains.   All of these areas are included with immense wildlife, you'll never find yourself alone.  The cities are also well built and great for close quarter combat.  Make sure you download the All in Arma Terrain Pack - this comes with ALL the maps from Arma 2 revamped up to Arma 3 quality.  On the gameplay - It's immenseful.  It's set about 20 yeras in the future.  You'll lose track of time, you'll probably lose your eyesight from getting to close to your PC screen.  Battles are realisticly timed because of the combat system.  You WILL die if you are hit in the head or upper torso, you'll break your legs if you're shot there.  No more rushing into battle or leading to charge, you stick with your team, you'll need them desperately.  You always will have a group of soldiers to command and place, use them to your advantage.  Think of downloading Blastcore, JSRS, and the Enhanced Movement mods, they will decrease your performance slightly, but it's worth the even more realistic feeling.  The battles are HARD.  The United States has been fighting unmathched and outdated opposing forces ever since the end of World War 2.  In this game you are fighting the AAF, a well modernized domestic defense force.  You will also be coming in contact with CSAT, which is basically an army of the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian forces coming together and is very powerful - NATO struggles.  On the weapons - They're almost real to the touch.  The amount of detail that went into these weapons is incredible.  The mechanics are also great.  You'll have to practice recoil management, as well as being able to zero an optic or use the mil-dot system to account for bullet drop.  If you want to make sharpshooting even for difficult/realistic, download the Arma Enhanced Combat mod, now you'll not only have to account for drop, but for wind, and even the rotation of the Earth.  Size matters!  You'll have greater success in hitting a target with a 5.56 and slightly less with the MX's 6.5mm.  Once you get into 7.62 small arms, you'll find a sufficient decrease in accuracy, but better stopping power.  Bullet penetration is a thing, and you will be shot inside a building from the outside if you're not being smart.  Let's also not leave out the insane amount of accessories you cant attach to your weapons, especially if you download some mods.  For example, CUP weapons pack, HLC, RH, etc.  There are great mods out there as always.  On the vehicles - I don't know where to start.  On the ground, you'll usually find yourself rolling in the 2030's MRAP called the Hunter, or a modernized M2A3 Bradley fighting vehicle.  You'll find yourself reinforced by Slammers, the main battle tanks of the future which are vamped up M1 Abrams.  Or even supported by 155mm Howitzers that can even fire laser guided shells.  Go as far as to even be in a Nissan pickup with a .50 cal in the bed.  In the air, you can find yourself in a stealth A-10C, an RAH-66 Commanche, an armed Huey, stealth Blackhawk (the Nighthawk), and Little Bird, fixed-wing UAVs, and even a quadcopter.  Use air support to your advantage!  Even in the sea you'll find yourself in an attack boat or a submersible.  And always, vehicle mods abounds.  REMEMBER - you are fighting modernized military defense forces, they will have everything you have, including hell storms of AA.  Arma 3 is a fantastic game that once you've got the hang of you'll fall in love with.  The community is huge and you'll always find yourself exploring new scenarios and options.  The developers care!  You'll receive weekly or biweekly updates or news items.  Yes, there are bugs.  There are bugs with every game.  With a game this scale, how can you blame them?  They're working on it.  Most of all, explore multiplayer and do scenarios with a group of friends, or maybe 100 friends.  The opportunities are endless, enjoy!			",43,7,0,5,6,1,3

Brief ReviewArma 3 from Bohemia Interactive is the latest in its military simulation series of games, which began with the original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. While shipping with a small amount of actual content, that is not what Arma 3 or the Arma franchise is all about. The huge influx of Steam Workshop content, multiplayer and editor make this a full package for the most serious of combat simulator nutsPros and ConsProsNew vehicle physics are greatButterfly shadowsMassive world to explore with lots of potential for long-range engagements (270 km²)Extremely detailed, lush visual presentationHyper-realistic combat will satisfy even the most die-hard sim enthusiastsHuge variety in terms of gameplay scenariosConsControls feel clunkyVery steep learning curveYou will need a new PC (Most likely)An EndingArma as a franchise is class leading at what it does - Military simulation refined and mastered			",20,5,6,1,8,0,5

												ArmA 3 is one of the best things that ever happened to me and my friends. I've given it a place in my heart and it has given me a place in it's heart. If you want to be a serious army soldier, ArmA 3 has it for you. If you want to play like a retard, arma 3 surely has it for you.The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing, the modding community suits every need. And I think that's what makes Bohemia Interactive a very good producer. They understand they can't make the perfect game that suits everyone's needs, so that's why they make modding so easy.Would very much recommend this game, community's nice, gameplay is nice, virtually the game is amazing if your pc can handle it. Loads of hours went into this game, and I loved every single second of it and if I were to stand in your shoes, wondering if I would buy this game after reading this, you friggin' should.

												This game really is one of the best games I have ever played. Excellent modability and a wonderful community.It started on a small Zeus Community server; there I met someone called Ravenbb, they had their own small group: Coop World Wide (CWW) After playing a few missions, a friend request was sent. This request would eventually lead to the greatest decision I could have made. Joining up in CWW, after a year of just waiting, I finally decided to join. It truly is an amazing group, filled with wonderful and funny people! They've offered a great time, with Ravenbb recreating the entire original Flashpoint campaign. The group itself is just one of many amazing groups you can find. From MilSim, to casual and some inbetween. For me, CWW has created the most fun experience ever in a video game. And even though I have only been a member for 5 months. Many many more fun times are ahead. Ranges of missions that other games jsut can't ever reach. The variety and versitality of all the roles used, from Fighter Pilots, to Tank crews, Helicopter Pilots and even just the normal soldier. Modders have also created some of the most amazing mods out there, it keeps the game fresh and enjoyable. You find a good group like I have, and you will find many many many hours of your life stolen away by great communities.			",91,5,0,8,11,0,20

												The best game i have ever purchased for sure.  Plus, it was so good, i played my first 500 hours on a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer at like 20 fps and still had enough fun to keep going.  Totally worth the buy and ten times over, and if you get it on sale you should be arrested for stealing!  Amazing mods and addons that you can play, just to list a few:-Breaking Point Mod (Arma 3 Dayz and better than Dayz)-Arma 3 Epoch-Arma 3 Overpoch-Arma 3 WastelandAnd literally hundreds more that are worth playing.  Basically, just buy the game and you'll see for yourself, its that good.			",31,3,0,1,3,0,4

												This game has improved graphics, AI, and voices over Arma 2. However, it features made-up weapons with really bad sound effects. Multiplayer servers are generally suckish, but occasionally you will find a good one. The real fun lies in the editor and missions by yourself and with friends, the customization offers limitless replayability with the right mods.			",18,5,0,2,8,0,12

												ARMA 3 is a tactical based military simulator with many features. You can play alone or in a team, it's entirely up to you.There are many server's that allow various gamemodes - even custom gamemodes and modservers. The choice of many helo's and vehicles of any kind make ARMA 3 immersive and realistic. One of my favourite gamemodes is a roleplay based mode, called Altis Life. There are two main islands in ARMA 3: Altis and Stratis. The goal of Altis Life is making money and interacting with other players. You can also play as a cop or a medic and much more, depending on your taste.			",20,1,0,0,5,0,4

												Still early days for me yet as I am still learning, but what I have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness... VAST LANDSCAPE -  the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers...The GRAPHICS - are absolutely spectacularTHE SOUND - is amazing, really is an immersive experienceREALISM - The most realistic military game I have ever played... if you are a Call of Duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... You cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... Battlefield players that feel that Battlefield just doesn't have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as I am an ex-battlefielder and I love this game...THE BAD - Extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect...9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.

												Arma 3 is a very well built Mil-Sim.  You usually find your breath taken where ever you go, whether it's the ocean or a mountain, a very beautiful game, but like everything else in this world, behind the beautiful side is a scary side, coming at you with jets, tanks, armed boats and infantry platoon!This game offers an immersive campaign and a fun multiplayer.  The modded community of this game is very active, with constant stream of mods flooding the workshop!  Some mods are very popular, like Epoch which adds in a survival theme to the game and allows from building structures.This game can be very fun if played with a group of friends, everyone with their own role, working together to complete a mission.  Highly recommended!			",87,4,0,5,10,0,2

												Heyyo, hmm... this game runs like♥♥♥♥♥ Heck, even setting my settings on low? I still get really bad framerate dips below 60fps with not a lot of stuff on the screen... I suspect it could be partly due to AMD drivers but reading on forums? NVIDIA users also have bad dips too. It's driving me crazy! Setting the terrain to standard quality and overall view range to 2000 helps... but if there's say 20 units on the screen? My framerate sticks around 35fps which is brutal when Battlefield 4 can handle a lot more players and do it while looking a lot better. I suspect part of it might be because the game only runs in 32bit yet it tries to gobble up RAM as well...I only really bothered with the campaign due to my perfromance woes and it is pretty fun and very challenging and frustrating when the AI decides to randomly hit you with the first bullet or just stares at you blankly as you put them down... same goes for squad mates who randomly stop moving... sigh.I definitely can't recommend this game at the full retail price. I got it on sale and I beat the first campaign section... but I've lost the motivation to finish it unlike ArmA and the older Operation Flashpoint series due to the performance issues.

I tried this guide tbh too 


Optimization and Improving FPS 
A Guide for Arma 3
By: >Freak On A Leash.exe

			A Guide for optimizing ArmA 3.		


and that kind-of helped... still doesn't fix framerate when infantrymen are on the screen.I also tried Radeon Pro to force AMD Overdrive to always use highest clocks (my MSI R9 390 Gaming 8G is OC'ed to 1120MHz core, 1550MHz memory and +50 power delivery) and that made barely any difference... maybe 5% better average framerate but still terrible drops with infantrymen on the screen...I tried the ""GPU_MaxFramesAhead="" and ""GPU_DetectedFramesAhead="" tweaks in the ""Arma3.cfg"" and that made zero differences too which I suspect acts much like VSYNC.... some games you can fix with tweaking or mods like Dark Souls...... apparently with ArmA 3? It's hit-or-miss if you can fix it, which is INSANE when the asking price is $60 when not on sale... I guess I kinda got my $30 out of it with the 10 hours I got out of the campaign so I paid roughly $3 an hour to play the game... I guess that's still ok but damn I wish this game just didn't run like fecal matter...			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

Most impressed, this is truly a game that is what you make of it, the available mods are fantastic, wasteland burns huge ammounts of time. The editor, once you figure it out is also a fine piece of kit. Buy this game,you won't regret it. Provided of course you have the attention span to get into it properly.

												This game Is very fun and awesome. The graphics are insanely good, The attachment and clothing system is very cool, And this game is just plain out awesome. I'd recommend it to those who are fans of ARMA II or Military Simulators. Overall rating of this game for me is a 10/10.			",136,13,5,8,11,0,12

												After playing shooters for a while, I have never experienced anything like ARMA. The whole series offers intense gameplay, and I surely could not be the only one to say, after a gun fight, you will be shaking with adrenaline and excitement. If you've played DayZ (Which has the same engine, practically the same game but with zombies) Then you'd know this experience pretty well. I recommend this to anyone!			",194,30,11,12,14,1,4

												Fantastic game. The single player content, showcases and training are good. The real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though. Admittedly, it can be a bit confusing at first if you're a new player, as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server. There doesn't tend to be a whole lot of ""vanilla"" servers out there. However, the mods are fantastic and worth the effort, especially if you play them with a group of people.My favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the ""Insurgency"" mod (military vs terrorists). There's a mod called Task Force Radio, which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use. Each faction has their own encrypted radio, various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio (long range and short range). As the military, we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village. A squad was unfortunately KIA, and for the next two hours, the military was getting picked off constantly. I even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo, let my team know that where I was and I had good sights on the village, and not 2 minutes later I got sniped even though I was hardly exposed and never took a shot. Later, it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won.10/10			",316,43,4,33,45,0,44

Then 5 minutes later they were back at it....The Most realistic and complex FPS tactical strategy game ive played REAL military vehicles Very Realistic enviroment HOWEVER The AI ARE GODS so if you cant get use to their 1000m kills with Assault rifles sorry this is not the game for you... the OP AI IS one thing because you can not forget all of the beuatiful bugs that come along that will ANNOY THE LIVING HELL OUT OF YOU like the fact that after server restarts your vehicle MIGHT HAVE BLOWN UP .....HOWEVER This is still a wonderful game very fun and addicting 8-10 They need to keep fixing bugs and problems along with them...

												ArmA 3 is a game with many pros and some cons. The perfomance, the SP and the vanilla content are defintly questionable, but on the other side this insane moding community will give you the tools you need to modify the game to the experience you want. And this is what make A3 to the best game I ever played. No other game gives you that freedom of choice. If you are a new or unexperienced player, don't get scared off by the complexity and clumsiness of ArmA. The solution is to join one of the countless communitys, to learn the rules of the game and enjoy it with othes.

The only two things that are bad is how that there is no internet host(no router set up required), like what gmod had added this year, So I have use hamachi to host my server. The other bad thing is the price of the DLC, it's too expensive.			",60,4,5,1,17,0,1

												The main reason why I bought Arma3 was for the Wasteland mod. I played Arma 2 pretty heavily and I can say for sure that Arma3/Wasteland is far superior than DayZ in every respect except for survival/foraging. I played quite a bit of Arma2 Dayz and I feel that the mod is extremely overrated compared to the other MP experiences Arma has to offer.This review may be more helpful to those who are thinking about the decision to move to Arma3 from Arma2.Arma 3 improves upon Arma 2 in many ways. First it reduces the amount of clutter on the keyboard. Now there isn't (what feels like) fifty keys dedicated to command/radio and now there is more of a streamlined feel to the game. That being said, it's extremely necessary to play with voice, as calling out targets/orders is something that is required in this game, unless you are a lone wolf or you are in a rather large group where the need for such things is lessened.Also, a major update in graphics, which I must say are stunning compared to A2. This doesn't make Arma, but it helps you stay immersed. Needless to say, Arma will always be unoptimized, so please, learn simple optimization tricks before giving up after seeing you have <30 frames. It's worth it.The amount of customizations in this game is extremely helpful/useful. Be warned though, it may take some time before you get the hang of it as Arma, being buggy, has a tendency to make things hard. Plus there's the fact that sometimes a player can get their hands on a fantastic sniper rifle, minus the scope (I'm pointing at you wasteland). So be warned of these situations before you find yourself in one that isn't to your liking.After all of this I would suggest that people with lower end computers don't buy this game or be prepared to run it on low settings. But the low settings are nothing to be mad about, as they are still pretty damn good, and graphics are not something that you come to Arma for in the first place.Now for those who haven't experienced the Military Sim feels (you know what I'm talking about)... Arma. Delivers.When played right, it delivers a deep comradery that cannot be gotten from most other games on the market. When you achieve something with your friends, who you sometimes have to place 100% trust in, it can be awe inspiring and can lead to many ecstatic shouts over the radio for doing something seemingly insignificant if seen through eyes of a standard FPS player.Now about gameplay; Arma requires an extreme amount of patience. Normally you have one or two rounds of fire to get things right or you will be sent to the death screen. Bullets hurt. Really bad. Normally getting hit with one is life threatening if it's normal caliber, but any more than that and you could be facing a bit of a journey back. This normally means 10-20 minutes to regroup and find another battle worth fighting. But don't worry, many of my fondest memories of Arma are from moments that are just random and unexpected, and they don't even require the slightest trace of enemy presence.( http://i.imgur.com/GgapTFX.jpg ) <- From Arma2TL;DRArma 3 is a much improved upon Arma 2, nothing extremely new here but there's still quite a bit more which makes it worth getting if your computer can handle the game and you can handle the buggyness/playstyle of Arma. It is one of my favorite games and is the leader of its genre, and rightfully so.For those wondering approximately 300 hours of game time logged on Arma2.			",91,5,1,6,4,0,4

												Carrying on from the genre-defining MilSim that was Arma 2, Arma 3 is a rock solid sequel that lives up to the expectations in place for the Arma series, even managing to go a bit beyond in certain aspects. As a great fan of Arma 2, I love Arma 3 and the improvements BI have managed to implement into the game. As well as showing off near-future battlefield tech in the game to help accurately represent the game's time period, BI have also managed to develop great maps, interesting gamemodes (Wasteland) for online play, and still manage to maintain and improve upon the fun level of realism that made Arma 2 so popular with MilSim players. The modding scene is also very active, with mods such as ACE and ACRE out there for added realism and more 'serious' MilSim players which allows the game to be expanded upon a lot. Be warned however, the game isn't shy on performance and requires a decent rig to run properly even on mid-range settings. My only major whine about the game itself is the developer's choice to release the campaign in a series of 'episodes', drip-feeding us content and missions. But as each episode is released, this negative becomes less and less of a factor. I'm giving Arma 3 a 9/10, and deffinitely recommend this game.			",88,6,3,6,17,2,16

												They fixed fatigue and a worth while DLC is on the way. Who died and took over?-----------------------------------[Fatigue Update]This has ruined the game. I'm not even exagerating. Unless you only use vehicles 24/7 this update will have ruined the game for you, making you aim like a drunkard after jogging about all of 10m and forcing you to walk at a snails pace after a whole 20m. That's some ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful realism, isn't it guys.-----------------------------------If I had to compare Arma 3 to another game, I'd say its the grandchild of Battlefield and Skyrim. With massive-scale combat, maps that dwarf any other shooter without question, and a variety of user-made game modes along with the vanilla series of Zeus game modes there is no shortage of content. In the recently added Zeus modes you can even turn this first-person shooter into an RTS game.The game mechanics are mostly solid however some minor things such as falling damage, parachute mechanics, and cars/trucks turning to useless wrecks after a realtively minor bump into anything leave plenty of room for improvement. Bugs are also still a signifigant issue, even to the point of causing some destroyed buildings to randomly shoot someone into the air and have them fall to their death. And in general, the engine feels stiff.Much like Skyrim—issues asside, if you find the right game mode for you, almost anyone should be able to find some enjoyment out of Arma 3. Whether you're some hardcore-roleplaying type, want to fight for survival all over an island, or simply want to vie for control over a city; there is plenty to do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spending enough time in this game to fully appreciate the good and the bad, I have decided to put some words down.  I love this game more than any other game that comes to mind.Where do I start?  I'll start with the hard stuff.You will stuggle with this game.  You will have moments where you hate the way it's coded.  You will die to stupid things, like stairs or rocks.  You will hate the fatigue system and the weapon sway. You will get annoyed at the reskins for outfits.Eventually, you will mod it.This is not a simple run and gun game.  You will not find yourself 'no scoping' after sprinting for 2 kliks.  Arma 3 is a simulator first and a game second.  The groundwork is solid for the most part.  The modding community is devoted.  The game modes are varied.  There is something that almost everyone will find appealing inside this package.Halo jumping dressed like the UK Special Forces? Check.  Thank a modder.Driving a hatchback that's colored like the American flag? Check. Thank a modder.Want to build a mission around the Tet Offensive? Check. Thank a modder.Am I biased? Yes. Do I have a huge amount of respect for modders? Yes.Arma 3 is a cpu intensive game.  You will have to tweek the hell out of it to make it just right.  You aren't going to get 60 fps on poorly coded MP servers. Please don't think it's your hardware, it's not.  Well, probably not.But this game really shines in the graphic department once she's setup just right.  I'm constantly trying to squeeze as much performance as possible, but I'm not going to go over everything I've done, it would take too long.  If you google it, you will find it.Playing the game by yourself is hindering your fun to an extent I can't even explain.  Ok, since you asked so nicely, I'll try.Playing to campaign alone left me yearning for more.  I really disliked the interface when assigning targets, or handing out orders to the AI squadmates I had been shackled with.  It doesn't feel very fluid, nor does it give me the feeling of teamwork.  The AI, at times, can go 'full retard' and just stand there while being mowed down by the enemy forces.  You may order them to get into the truck you're sitting in, only to find one of them has the great idea to run right into the AO and alert everyone to your presence.  Ok, I guess stealth is off the table.  At least I have superior numbers?  Ha, they won't get out of the truck and that rpg is headed this way.  I'll just reload my save then.Now, replay that with real people that communicate and know how to play.  Completely different outcome.  I'm not typing that hypothetical situation out again, just trust me.Now, onto the really fun part.  That part that makes my genitals tingle.  The Mods.OMG Becky, look at those mods.  They're so big!No, they aren't all large downloads.  Even some of the smallest mods can change the game to a large extent.Take AGM for example.  It has different frag throwing options. A medical system that includes epi's, blood bags, adrenaline and the ability to drag people to safety.  No longer can you see how many rounds are left in your mag, you can only 'see' the weight.  It has weapon resting, fast roping, cook offs, vehicle repair options and a bunch of other things I can't think off.What about vehicles?  I really like the hummvees from Arma 2.  There are a few different options for mods for that.Do you hate that you stop moving when you switch weapons?  There's a mod for that.Tactical glasses have no use in the game? There's a mod that gives you a hud when wearing the glasses in first person.I hate the stock sounds. JSRS3 baby!Want a Canadian mohawk?  Reskin mod.Tired of playing Altis or Stratis?  Bornholm, Tilos, Chernobyl, Chernarus, Utes, Panthera. Just to name a few of the many user made maps available with a few clicks.Be warned.Mods don't always work 'right out of the box™'.  If you don't have patience, you're just going to have a bad time.  Sometimes mods don't work well with each other, or give you graphical errors, or aren't compatible with user made missons.  In short, when they work, oh baby do they. When they don't, you deal with it or stop using them.Look, I'm biased.  I really am.  I love the milsim aspect of this game.  I love the squad play.  I love the vehicles and the guns. I love the guys I play with.They say that the best things in life are the things you have to work for.  That's what Arma 3 is.You have to work for it.  But it really shines in the long run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite many warnings from the community, bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine, again. Thus resulting in 90 FPS in single player, down to 10 - 15 in multiplayer, servers can't even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server, resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game. Instead of fixing the AI, glitches and trying to optimize the game, bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above. What's that? You want single player? Oh well you'll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those SP episodes, why yes they are free, as they should be, as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha.Oh and the only thing people play in this ""realistic army sim"" is a god damn RPG average civi game type  where you role play YOUR ACTUAL BORING LIFE.

												Mechanically, Arma 3 is outstanding, with controls that are smooth while still portraying the weight of a human body. Weapons feel great and firefights remain intense both against AI and other humas. Atlis is an impressive map with each square kilometer offering interesting options for firefights. The first two episodes of the campaign are good, and there are some great mods and modes already showing up like Breaking Point and the Universal War Sandbox. It also happens to be the best looking open world game around in terms of sheer realism. I'm genuinely excited to see how this game develops in the coming years.			",172,23,5,11,6,0,21

												I played this game back when it was the free game for the weekend. I never purchased it afterwards, and you'll probably figure out why from both my review and those of others. So, as anyone could reasonably expect, I was pretty excited for this game to be free for the weekend, as I've had my eye on it for almost a year! As an avid ARMA II fan, I had always been a little dissapointed with the lack of more modern military tech in an otherwise great game. I thought ARMA 3 would whisk all my problems away and carry me into ARMA heaven. It didn't quite work out like that though...So upon launch the first thing that struck me as odd was the lack of info. Sure, the menus are much more appealing to the eye, but the tutorials were some weird lovechild of a campaign and a quest-system. It was very strange, so much so that I neglected to finish the first one. ""Oh well,"" I thought. ""I've played enough ARMA II to figure out how to handle myself.""And for the most part I was right. I jumped into the campaign and it was fun! So why the negative review? Well, the campaign was fun for a little bit, but after that 'new game smell' wore off, it wasn't much to brag about. I moved on, and played some tank match which I can't remember too many details about, other than a few key things. First off, everything was insanely grey. Now I understand the use of dynamic lighting and warzone fog and stuff like that, but this was just rediculous. So, as I was cruising around with my platoon of Slammers, we encountered some enemies! Great! Let's see how this works! So to sum that up, there's unique and dynamic damaged/dead unit models depending on their style of demise, the radio chatter no longer sounds like a panicking android but a much cleaner soldier, and vehicle control is no longer a reinactment of the mountain scene in Tokyo Drift.But, what I couldn't get over was the lack of diversity. Oh look, Slammers. Hey, more slammers. Oh, a Wolverine (I think). And OMG another slammer. What I'm getting at is that, unlike its predicessor, ARMA 3 has no vast, game-changing DLCs (other than Karts, but that isn't even military.) So what you end up with is this massive tropical island turned warzone, and you get the same handful of units over and over, which might not matter for AIs, but for myself I prefer a diverse choice in my vehicles and other wartime equipment. Sure, it's modable, but so was ARMA II, and I already know the cool mods for that, which totally redefine the feel of the game.So, over all:+Better lighting and physics+Better voices and immersion+Diverse factions+Newer tech to toy around with-Low diversity of units-Poor tutorials for those who want to start at the top-Modernized EVERYTHING, even when unnecessary (e.g. Hummingbirds. It's such a pointles change, just give me my Little Bird!!)-Virtually no DLCs that expand the battle experience, and the ones that exist aren't worth the cost for the amount of units recieved-Essentially a more stabil version of a modded ARMA II clientOverall, I would just reccomend saving the money for other stuff, there's plenty of games on steam, but none of them, not even ARMA 3, can match the charm and pure flexibility of ARMA II.

												This game is huge. It has endless possibilities. It COULD provide lots of fun but what happens in the end, is the absolutely poorly optimized engine which completely fails to deliver smooth experience. I own a 980GTX + i7 and 16gig of ram and no matter what settings I set up, I always get 20-30 fps, and in intense firefights it slows to a miserable 10-15. The game was launched back in 2013 and it really hurts to see Bohemia fail to deliver a smooth experience for everyone. Its a joke, really. Almost two years and we still have these problems. Shame.

												I originally bought Arma when it first came onto steam. However back then I only played 1-2 hours of it, and left it in my library to rot. It was not only until a week or two ago when I started to play it fully. I tried out most gamemodes, and I must say, it is a great game. Below is (a long) first match.I jumped into a King of the Hill match, and it was hectic. People were shouting over coms, team and proximity chat, strategitcal locations and manuevers. The objective was 3 Km away so everyone at the base was finding transport anyway they could. I found this small helicopter almost full taking off, I hopped in and we flew away.The pilot, attempting to avoid fire and a long flight, flew over the deep ocean. Now we weren't that far from shore, but far enought that it would be an insanely long swim. I was sitting in the middle of the helicopter looking at the pilot, as he looked back and told me it would only be a couple minutes, and that we would have to parachute. As he looked back at me, I could see through the windshield a missle coming right towards us. There was an enemy hidden on the shore with a rocket launcher. We were hit and falling at a rapid rate. The launcher hit our back tail, and we were plummiting towards the ocean. Fumbling with my keys to try to jump out, the helicopter hit the water, and sank extremely fast. I was lucky enough to eject myself, and swim towards the surface. As I swam I saw several bodies of the other passengers. I was the only survivor. Hurt from the crash, I was unable to swim fast, and I was stuck in the middle of the ocean. The waves were big so I had to fight staying on the surface. I was about to give up hope and drown myself, as I knew I wouldn't make the swim. All of sudden I hear a helicopter! Some pilot saw the crash and saw me swimming! He lowered himself and I hopped in. Boy was I glad, I thanked him a ton, and we started to fly off as I saw the bodies of my comrades float to the surface. I was able to capture a picture of the rescue below. (I play on three monitors so excuse the extremely wide screenshot)


Water Rescue 
A Screenshot of Arma 3
By: Nick Gurr




Sadly this rescue would end soon as the same rocket launcher shot us down for good. I spawned back at base and rode out on an ATV with some random teammate on the back. The drive was long, 3 Km, and towards the end, a helicopter lowered down and shot rockets at us. It had come from nowhere. As it hit us with one rocket, a friendly jet shot it down. Hurt from the rocket, my teammate and I escaped into the bushes. We were still 500 meters from the objective. Moving at an extremely slow rate because of the injuries, we ran into battle. Sadly we were both easily picked off. My 30 minutes thus far has been a failure to go into actual battle, and I wanted to actually fight for once. I rode on a helicopter and we parachuted down, all 12 of us. People shot up as us as I saw a few friends fall, I flew into a tree and hid in some bushes. An enemy tank and some infantry walked right past me as I lay in the bushes. Once they left, I ran into a broken down house with half of it missing. I look out a window and see a dozen enemy troops parachuting down.. into the backyard. None of them saw me but I knew once I started firing, I was to be outnumbered. Desperate for some firefight, I opened fire. 1..2...3...4... they all fell as I shot them down. More men had landed but they were confused where I was firing from. I had killed 4 men at this point and killed a 5th as I looked to my left to see a sniper in the bushes. Him and I stared at each other for a few seconds, as I saw him aim down his sights, and headshot me.Seriously 9/10 great game. Only reason not a 10 is because of some bugs and poor optimization on some servers. This game isn't for a casual person looking for some quick action, you should know what you're doing or else people will yell at you.Too much water -IGN			",179,27,2,12,17,1,10

												Campaign is awful. I understand that only giving you one user save per mission makes you rely on being smart about how you approach certain objectives, but when your ally AI are dumber than rocks, it makes things really difficult, and almost impossible in some instances. I understand they might not be programmed to know how to clear a room, or use bounding to move up, but it would be nice if when I order them to move 100m front to cover they would do that as opposed to moving backwards 300m and laying in the prone. Also, when you are assaulting an objective 200m in front of you, and you give them specific targets to shoot, they instead choose to engage the two guys on the opposite mountain 500m away. Lets also not forget what I'm assuming is a bug where even after clearing an area, they refuse to move in anything other than a low crawl (makes it difficult when your next objective is 500m away) I wanted a game where the idea wasn't you have to do everything by yourself, but obviously thats not the case. In addition to crappy AI, there are other bugs that make the game absolutely miserable. When attacking a lookout tower you can shoot the guy in the head a couple times, toss 3 grenades into it, and yet if you get within 10m of it, an enemy laying in the prone up there will phase his gun through the floor and kill you before you even try to move into it and clear it. If those bugs were fixed, it would actually be an enjoyable game, but having to restart from the last checkpoint where you have to walk 15 min to the next area only to get killed by a glitch gets really old really fast.

												A fantastic game with great multiplayer and the best mission editor I've ever played with. This game almost does ARMA 2 justice, it includes some great graphics options (Picture-in-picture, post-processing effects, draw-distance) which allows it to run on some pretty low-end computers (I'm running it on near max with a 6670! (All on high/Ultra with a view-distance of 3.5km))The campaign is a vast improvement over ARMA 2's campaign including proper voice acting, realistic plot and some nice comedy hidden around the map.I'd rate this game 8/10> Great campaign> Fantastic editor< Quite buggy (None which are game breaking)> Fantastic modding community< Lack of units/ a lot of reused assets			",153,34,10,10,21,2,38

												I tried to get into this game, I really did but with no friends to play with it is terrible. Singleplayer lacks content, you have to join a group if you want to play this seriously but even than you mostly play against AI. The animations are just afwul sometimes, if you hit someone he just spasses out. The AI are really inconsistent sometimes they headshot you from a mile away and sometimes they just run into your bullets and commanding a squad is poorly designed. The game looks stunning though and arma 3 life or battle royale can be fun but just not worth the price. It feels like they made a tool for modders because there is just not enough base content.

												There is a notion of this game i can't figure out. This game is an all around mess and an all around success in all aspects. Many call it a finished product and a BLAST to play and some call it an unplayable mess which involves complete ""hyper realistic fails"". So who is right? Well, this game appeals to both an arcade style audience willing to get action and combat at extreme levels and also to the hardened clan fighting veteran focused on mods which improve gameplay and add features to the game to improve and keep game experiences fresh. In this game however, having played it for solid hours on end, these moments which I had did not come naturally. For a game to acheive its scale and realism to levels as in ARMA 3 is by no means accepted to all in this generation. Not trying to put my old man cap on here but to play games like DayZ and ARMA you can't expect double kills and planes and cars to appear at the spawn. The PMC's of advanced warfare didn't appear in the army for just being strong and chosen. To play ARMA, it is the same as DayZ (although not as boring) and all ""running simulators"". And I don't mean to scare you by saying to have to run to Pygros from Kavala with broken legs. What I mean is the same principle that you DON'T start as a badass, and if that is your playstyle just don't play it or convince yourself that you can take the heat. Stories have to be made with extreme disiplinary acts in this game. And how do you get those? Well here are the steps. 1. THIS GAME TAKES SOME ♥♥♥♥ING BALLS TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. This can always be avoided (LOL not really) some way or another through the vast expanse of gamemodes like wasteland, and joining a realsim unit is all acceptable for even the hardest MLG sniper to learn what this game is about. But  this part cannot be let go. In parts where the game is about serious progression, you CAN'T be the one crying for someone to give you a chance because you are being a little ♥♥♥♥♥ cat. To be the general, you gotta go through West Point first. 2. THIS GAME WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING KNEES AND WILL ALWAYS ♥♥♥♥ WITH YOU. So, how do not let this happen? Well you really ♥♥♥♥ING can't. It all happens in a matter where if you are in the right place at the right time which perfectly demonstrates how this game IS SUPPOSED TO BE. This is why you need to be with a team of people who know what they are doing and know exactly WHAT THE HELL is going on, or be daring and be alone, being a target, and dying. Just like in an animal world. So treat it like that. Hunt or be hunted, kill or be killed, the strong only survive. Because this is no FPS that you have ever seen and before buying this, you have to know what is coming for your soul.Oh, but I have decided to roast your♥♥♥♥♥again by saying that this game is amazing fun. ""Oh, but you said it took a long time and was boring."" 3. SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME. Because if you don't you will die. This game, has changed my perspective on what it is. Well, what is this game? What does it offer? What are you in for? To be honest, this game is really a test of mentality. This game is really to see what you do in dire situations of disaster, catastrophe,  military occupation, and survival. This can tie in to thinking of this game as an animal world like I said before. To live, you have to be familiar with your surroundings, familiar with the weapons, and all around just knowing WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ YOU ARE DOING. Because this game is never merciful and is always working against you as said in my other steps above. So how can you alter this? You can't. You can't change the future. You can't CHANGE your actions in this game.Because it defeats the whole purpose.			",131,10,0,10,17,1,17

												The game is ambitious, but horribly broken.  Even the simplest things like skipping cut scenes, a functional tutorial, or an intuitive UI are neglected.

												Mixed feelings for Multiplayer. #1 - Game is fun and the gametype elements are pretty cool. You have one big city with surrounding area and a designated landing zone. Three teams fly and drive their troops close to the LZ and try and take 4-5 tower areas within the LZ. Makes for a lot of fun building to building fighting but likewise can choose to sit and wait or snipe outside of the LZ. It's one of a few game modes (King of the Hill).#2 - The gaming engine for multiplayer is super buggy. EXPECT to have between 15-30 frames AT BEST. If you have an i5/i7, you'll do better. If you have an AMD prepare for the hurt. It does NOT matter about your video card or ram(I have a GTX 980  and 32GB of RAM and get around 15-25 frames). The game is CPU intensive. Actually this isn't the proper wording. It's a serious flaw that the game is CPU intensive rather than GPU intensive.Everyone will say ""well upgrade your CPU"". Ok Ok, I could but a guy I play with (no joke) has a dual i7, 3 titan video cards and 128MB of ram and he still sometimes drops below 20 and never over 35ish on average. Sometimes it's ok to play othertimes it's just too damn stupid. Server syncs are sometimes really choppy. It's actually really sad that for $59.99 (about the most expensive a PC game gets these days) that it has these types of issues. Then once in game about 1/2 the guns, scopes, vehicles and others they want you to pay more for. I find myself many times having to sit back and not play the way I want to but rather the way I know I can shoot and kill people because of FPS issues. Most I can say is that they did not build this game with the intention of having huge multiplayer battles. If the gameplay type wasn't superb no one would put up with this serious flaw. No joke. 15-20 frames the average person will have ....nearly unacceptable for the price paid if solely intend on multiplayer. 10/10 if it was built for large world multiplayer in mind. Unfortunatly, it's not so I'll rate it a 6.5/10 ",22,0,0,0,4,0,1

												I mean I could write a good review if I didn't experience MORE game crashes, screen freezes, and random FPS drops than back in good 'ol Arma 3 Alpha state.Lets also not forget the overpriced DLC called Apex, which I won't buy, anyone that does buy it is crazy af IMO, you can buy HQ actually OPTIMIZED and STABLE running games like GTA V, or ♥♥♥♥ it, I could even buy Battlefield 3, 4 AND HARDLINE for the price of APEX.(I'm fine with the small DLC's like karts, marksman and helo, but Apex took this to a whole new level.I mean seriously, atleast ArmA 2: OA was worth buying, but you really want to spend $35 / €30 / £25 for DLC that runs on the unoptimized as hell main game engine? No thanks.)If you'd compare ARK: Survival Evolved to ArmA 3, you'd not be able to imagine why ArmA 3 is such a damned money burden compared to FREE updates and Steam Workshop based content that actually gets added into the MAIN GAME instead of copied by the lazy af devs and charged money for instead.Don't get me wrong though, ArmA 3 is a great game, with just around over 9000 exceptions including optimization and overpriced content (wtf even Battlefield premium is cheaper, and you get ♥♥♥♥ing 7 new maps added in? yeah right Bohemia).(I mean it would be worth it if my GTX 980 Ti OC+, i5 4690K, 16 GB RAM COULD ACTUALLY PERFORM WELL ON ARMA 3)Max cap: 60 FPS, lowest cap: 2 FPS. AVERAGE CAP: 5 - 40 FPS - Depending if ArmA 3 likes your PC build or is NOT optimized for it.My suggestion: Avoid, if NOT on SALE, or buy from a keystore to avoid supporting devs like a boss, same goes for Apex.(I've played over 1k hours in total, this isn't my main acc though :D)			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poor edition to the Armaverse. Tons and tons of potential that is being sadly wasted. The game has nice graphics and lighting albeit not Dx11. The main island Altis, looks quite impressive indeed but has a very empty feeling and doesnt feel alive like other arma maps did. The ragdoll which is one of the new features feels half finished, like the rest of this game if I'm honest. An example of this is all static 50cals have the same model and this situation you will see through out the game, the latest content added were reskined with slight model change BAF helicopter and vehicle which is unacceptable in book if you already payed for that content if you bought BAF for arma 2.The sound leaves very little to be desired, with clipping audio and samples so loud that they actually break up (tank main guns). ArmA and ArmA2 have infinitely better programmed sound engines. ArmA3 is currently a dead duck in my opinion, anything that is positive about this game is quickly over shadowed by lack of content, bugs, inconsistances in code and I hate to say it but, bordom. I never thought I'd hear myself saying it but yes, this game is boring.With the pace of the games meaningful development slower than a snail I'd venture to say dont expect much soon.Maybe if the game still lives in 2015 it could be great, but right now it is certainly not that. Only time will tell if BIS take advantage of this games potentials. My feeling is that it will fall by the wayside because of lost potential and lack of real core code bug fixes.			",97,2,4,7,6,0,1

												Only purchase this game if you are willing to purchase the apex edition for 70 damn dollars. Most AAA games are 60 and unless your just going to play the campaign, you are going to need to purchase the apex edition if you don't want to be swarmed with watermark ads when you attempt to use most weapons and vehicles. This price is too high for what you get in return. Many other games have double the amount of gameplay material than what this game has, and the price for the apex edition is still higher. Yes, I understand that there is the ""base content"" and the ""apex"" edition is just ""extra"" but if I'm going to have to pay 70 dollars for this..... and many other games have way more content...... its a little bit high of a price. Of course, the arma devs probably won't see this review and if they do, well, im just one of the few people that think the price is too high for the quality of gameplay. On the other hand, I'd say minimum at least 40% of the people who bought this game don't even have a job. Just asked mom for the credit card and called it good. But hey, what the ♥♥♥♥ do i know?

												CoD players; Our game is very tactical, while screaming 360 no scope.Battlefield players; phuh our game is very realistic with big maps, while jumping out of a jet to pistol down another jet.Me in Arma; After sneaking around for 15min I got shot while hiding behind a bush when I met my first enemy... for the 20th time. AND I LOVE IT. Keeps me from signing up in the military.I can't spend 45 euro/dollar on a single game and I won't spend it on this game but in contrast to most games. This game is really worth it if you have the money.Pro:-extreme modding tools/editor (== many mods)-campaign is the realism I have been looking for (subjective)-vast visual improvement versus Arma2 (and ran very well with me)-much better controls versus Arma2-Zeus is a vast content addition for strategy lovers-perfect for lan parties-huge amount of contentCon: (nitpicking)-Armory? Where is it!-nvidia physX... sorry amd-lacking fully destructible environment-sometimes horrendous multiplayer community-vehicle physics still need improvement-call me annoying but this game needs many more vehicles-action menu still needs improvement-multiplayer can be very laggy-Arma without bugs is not Arma-noob unfriendly UI/controls etc (or is that a pro?)

												You have to spend another $60 on DLC just to play online.You gotta have a unit to really get the most out of this. The mods and servers for regular multiplayer are abominable in terms of gameplay, functionality, and smoothness. External server browsers are needed just to find any kind of multiplayer match, and good luck competing with already established squads of intense kiddies ready to use every exploit against you. It really is an army simulator, not a game in strict terms, but even there it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Stairs and ladders are often glitchy, certain scope and aiming systems dont work right... mods had to be made just to hop over fences at a reasonable speed. Again, it's totally fun in a team.... but if you're solo player and interested in Exile you shouldnt bother with it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No.Arma 3 has a very bad community, a mate of mine said it had good community so i joined and got left by my own squad.I dislike this game also because of the price. cost me $60 USD for a game where i couldnt even play as a civilian on RP.The Graphics are extremely high and i could run them fine with my Nvidia GeForce GXT... and the graphics are beaustiful.Amazing Graphics, HUGE map. Lots of content but definitly something i would NOT recommend. Shame that the people in Arma 3 ruinned a perfectly good game.5/10bad comuntty			",70,3,0,3,7,0,2

												After years of enjoying the Amra series, im sad to finally change my review to no. At this point the paywall is unreal. The mandatory nature of each ever increasing in price dlc pack makes the game something that cant just be picked up on a short term notice.The original game is nice, the communities and mods out there are great, but the fact that you are now REQUIRED to run apex to do anything other than solo campgian is horrid.Enjoy the milsim, I'll be playing elsewhere unless the DLC takes a 80+% pricedrop permanantly, as the playerbase continues to shrink from blaoted content packs that destabalize and break the game for those with or without.

												Went in to the game based on the reviews, the only good part of it is the team capture mode which makes the game sort of like a real life war. Everything else is a waste of your time/life, game is infested with little boys who haven't even hit puberty and will bad mouth you all day, half the servers are terribly laggy and the game is still very buggy. i.e. moving next to a wall and getting ported through, walking through a glass window and getting stuck, etc. etc. Personally I feel the game was a complete waste of my money as there are many other games in this genre that do it much better and are much more worth your time, since more then half the game you will legit spend driving to nowhere land just to get a gun/money only to come back and get hit once and die. I do not recommend this game to anyone as it should be free, because that is all it is worth.			",43,2,0,2,0,0,1

												O que destaca esse jogo sem duvida nenhuma é o seu realismo...Com isso, em vez de partir para a ação imediatamente, será preciso que você gaste bastante tempo planejando ataques cuidadosamente e se movimentando pelo campo de batalha — caso contrário, prepare-se para enfrentar mortes sucessivas em um ritmo bastante acelerado.Enquanto em outros tipos de jogos FPS você pode simplesmente sair correndo de um lado para outro ou pegar um veículo e se distanciar de seus colegas sem grandes punições, aqui ambas as atitudes significam morrer rapidamente.Assim, não estranhe se você demorar intervalos que duram mais de 20 minutos até chegar a um ponto importante para a missão que está sendo realizada ;)			",252,66,15,20,23,4,22

												So where do I start!! Review is below please read all before passing judgement :)I'm so so so disappointed :( I bought a PC again after a massive 8 year PC break when I moved to console in very late 2006 . I bought an Xbox 360 which I owned for almost 6 years then only 13months ago I moved too XBox One had it for 4 months and thought get rid of this piece of junk and use the money  I get and put it towards a new Gaming PC so june this year (2014) I bought a PC. Anyway so I bought a PC with one thing in my mind ""Yes it will be like the old days I will join back up with my clan"" I was with almost 7 years ago. I enjoyed countless hours days weeks years with the lads on Operation Flashpoint : Cold War, Arma and then Arma 2. I was in the AirCorps for them ""GOL"" clan they are called so I signed up for them cause I forgot my password (come on its been 7 years ago) and used the same name as I was back in 2006 ish 'GOL Tactical' I thought wow its been that long I was wiped from there system :) Anyway LT Chris didnt know how I was so I mentioned a few names to him and that were old clan memebers and he stopped talking for a split second ""are its you Bloody knife"" (which was my original name before changing to GOL Clan when I )was expected) The guy that made me start an AirCorps. I was so excited to be back sadly most of the old memebers werent around (god I sound like a child Im' 25).Sorry for all the text above :) I just wanted you/people to know that I've played Arma before for alot longer than most 7 years straight. I bet most reading this didnt know about Operation Flashpoint was originally part of the same team that is today currently making Amra still  today. Anyway present day 30/12/2014The ReviewI'm sorry but the Arma I grew up to love is just not the same Arma! Arma 3 is like to me the Call Of Duty of today every childs dream, its the game that they must have otherwise your not cool etc although that last statment isn't true for Arma franchise it only came extemely popular in like 2007 to early 2008. Thats how much I love or sould I say loved Arma it was my goto game whenever I was bored I would talk about Arma when I was at school when I was with anyone, as soon as I got in Lets play Arma whenever I had spare time Lets Play Arma I even bunked/skipped days of school to play more. I just didnt get bored of Arma or Arma 2 or Operation Flashpoint Cold Assault if I'm honest it consumed all of my early teens and into my late teens. Yes a full 7 years of my lifeI was coming up to be 19 and on my birthday I bought a Xboxb 360, go and read the above for a full discription :)So the Arma I knew was a realistic military simulator the best simulator infact but Arma 3 what have you done you've gone slightly futurisitc. Why? Its a military sim how can you simulate something that isnt even made yet keep it with the real life stuff that is used today you at least in my eyes have ruined my childhood game thanks Bohemia Interactive and 555 games thanks a bunch. It isnt all bad though its just because of my history with the game as you can tell they are many happy customers giving good reviews. But if Arma 1 and 2 and 2.5 is anything to go by hopefully they are modders out there that feel the same way as me and remove all the futuristic stuff and replace with Real Equipment Weapons etc that are used todayIf you got this far thanks for reading and dont base the game of my review its just because of my history with the game. The core components are there with what I can assume is realistic simulation its just not me furturisitc stuff in a Simulator you cant call it a sim in my eyes anyway. So as you can tell I dont recommend this game. Even the it almost hurts to say it : (			",7,2,3,0,3,0,1

												This could have been a great game, the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990´s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your GPU. With an i7 2600 and GTX 780 i have between 20-30 FPS, and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible. There is only one reason to even consider this game, and its for the great mod community. But overall, this company does not deserve any of your money.			",176,25,4,31,20,4,36

												Sometimes i just wonder what the developers did except creating the very basic of this game, let me remind you.First of all this is not a solo game at all this is pure multiplay game, but dont get excited because you are under the 3rd parties servers rules, and this is not bad actually some of them are really amazing people and i met alot, the point is there is no progress can be build in this game, and all your data will be removed after few weeks of playing in 75% of the servers.2nd if you are planning the build a base with your team then you are wasting your time, there is no way to keep it except if you know the server admin,3rd the weak health  logarithm in the game, and dying from things don't make sense while it is an extremely survivor game, after you gather all your stuff which can take you 1 hour at least.4th having fun in the game takes a lot of time to start, you need at least 4 hours if you decided to have a short gameplay and maybe kill 10 people if you were lucky.5th the rain really makes you crazy, it is lines and lines everywhere, i mean if it is a simulation game,they should conseder that rain doesn't look like lines, i live in a very rainy area and when it rains yes we can't see clearly and far , but not white lines and lines.6th the cheat and the endless ways to do that while they even have an anti cheat system called (BATTLEYE), such i huge name for cute and stupid function.7th everything in here is about huge names, SIMULATION , MILITARY , SURVIVOR, TACTICAL , REALISTIC !? since when if i have to switch weapons the player will stop moving ?? 8th have you ever asked what is the differences between tank and the other type of tank? BTR and BTR? the weapons in the jets? yes there are 6 but that number doesn't make it a simulation game!!!I got some saying to i have to play COD not Arma , well i love Arma but i am tired of alot of things , beside i knew COD games becoming bad, but everyone knows about it and when new release came out TV hostess will talk about it, have you ever heard someone mentiond Arma ?! don't hate me just ask yourself why.I got someone saying i had to search first befor i buy it , are you sure you want to know what was Arma3 once i bought it ?! even tho people didn't care and supported the developers.This review is not becouse i am angry or upset, it is a try to push the develepers to some points i fined that some other games have them while this game still missing them.

												Arma is such an amazing franchise, and Arma 3 is no exeption. The game got over 40 weapons, but with different weapons for each faction, where two is very similar. In Arma 2 there was alot of mods, like DayZ or Invasion 1944 but in Arma 3 they added intigration with the steam workshop, which makes modding really easy.Overall the game is amazing and definitly worth getting, and I would give it a 8/10 with the only downside being what I feel as too few weapons.

												Arma 3 enhances on the Arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience. With Arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you couldn't get in cover because of the really bad control scheme, however with Arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system. The vehicles of Arma 3 are a lot better than Arma 2, it works. I can't wait until mods like ACE are released on Arma 3 expanding on the experience even more. It's well worth the price. Although the content is slightly lacking, the game expands on Arma 2 loads and I'm sure an expansion pack like Operation Arrowhead will appear for Arma 3 aswell.Buy it, well worth it.

												This is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. I had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. I don't think Dark Souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress.One annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage German porn flick, i guess NATO must have lowered the standards in 2035. He'll start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But don't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. It takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it. The graphics is good, but you need a very powerful PC to play it with high settings. The FPS is showing when you do the changes so you don't have to exit the menu to test it. A joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters.The game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles. The ballistics add a touch of realism.			",106,7,0,8,22,0,6

												This is the definitive shooter. Forget Call of Duty, forget Battlefield, this is leagues beyond those titles. From fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventy-two other players on land, above or below seas, and in the sky, everything feels just as it should, just as it would be if it were real. For those that love beutiful visuals, sharp skill curves, and of course, Bohemia's trademark realism, this title cannot be missed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Get 2-3 friends. Play this game. Get some mods. Rinse and repeat. Pros: Two maps with HUNDREDS of locations simulating miles and miles of fully accessable openworld.No two operations are going to be the same. Sandbox with diverse weapons for infanty.Vehicals including multiple variants of cars, trucks, APCs, tanks, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Active moding community to adjust everything including core gameplay, adding new maps/locations, enhanced medical systems, and more.  Bouts of boredom and anticipation followed by intense, heartpounding combat. Its the only game where my friends and I can talk about specific firefights we fought together and actually remember what we are talking about. Cons: Enemy AI in the base game is insanely accurate. Often able to hit targets over half a kilometer away with ironsights on an SMG. This is fixed with mods like ""bCombat"", or by careful editing of text files. High system requirements, (you are usually lucky to get 45fps on a server). There are loads of guides online to maximize your performance, but the game is just so big that the processing power required is going to slow down the game. That being said a friend of mine can run it on a gaming laptop, so you don't need to be ridiculously high end, just dont expect a perfect 60fps experience even on a thousand dollar PC.

												Arma 3 is a very good game.I think it is worth the money, even for the DLC's. Arma is a Military Simulator, Sandbox, First Person/Third Person Shooter.It is not like the average First Person Shooter, and some would probably say it requires a lot of skill. As well as being  Arguably  realistic, it can be quite a challenge to learn. There are many different keybindings, controls and settings to learn, so it can take quite a while before you get the hang of it. Singleplayer: - The campaign is quite enjoyable, all the while teaching you controls and game mechanics. - You can also mess around in the editor and make different scenarios and test vehicles/weapons- Firing drills for working on aim and coordination- Workshop Maps for playing on- Weapon + Vehicle testing in  Virtual Arsenal and Garage  Multiplayer: In my opinion, it is fun to play with friends because you can do things like: - Co-Op missions and scenarios- Working together in a certain vehicle (Gunner, Pilot)- Even just playing on an online server together- You can make your own server to play with friends or even by yourself Settings and Game Mechanics - You can toggle between First Person and Third Person- A lot of vehicles (Air/Land/Sea)- A lot of weapons (Assault Rifles/Snipers/Pistols/Rocket Launchers/PDW/Carbine/SMG's)- Cool Maps and Mods to download from the workshop- Great graphics - HUD Customisation- Customisable Keybinds- Controller Support  Pros and Cons   Pros: - A lot of gamemodes, missions scenarios to play on- Great Multiplayer and Singleplayer options- Good graphics- Controller Support- A lot of different weapons and vehicles to play with- Virtual Arsenal and Garage to test vehicles and weapons- Toggleable First and Third Person- Customisable Hud and Keybinds Cons: - Might be a little on the expensive side, especially with DLC's- To run it, you need a decent computer- Doesn't use your PC's Specs to its full ability- Only for Windows (Mac users are probably used to it anyway)- Quite a tight learning curveOverall, I think  Arma 3  is a great game and is worth the money for it and it's DLC's.

												Awesome game, fluid graphics, perfect for creating a battlefield set for a group. The only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but that's if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 DLC's and an expansion; and also if you don't mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. Any vet of arma(people who've played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) Best part about it is that there's less 10 year olds than COD or BF >:D			",51,2,0,6,3,1,5

												I typically do not write reviews or recommendations on Alphas or Betas of most game titles but it is important to note that even in its Alpha stages, Arma3 is an awesome experience. We all know that A3 is not built on a new game engine and that it is really a polished enhanced A2OA game engine with popular community add-ons integrated into its core combined with a graphic overhaul... but you know what.... that’s fine, even knowing all that, it’s a sweet first person experience. If you do not believe in paying for Alpha access, then buy the game at the now reduced rate and do not play the Alpha but wait for the full release, but buy it, it’s worth it.

												It may look like ""Hardcore millitary simulator"" for someone, but actually, it has nothing to do with realism and simulation. Singleplayer campaign is sometimes frustrating, thanks to the stupid AI, but its not bad. Great thing is the new Eden Editor, where you can make your own scenarios, or just do funny stuff. But the real deal stands in Multiplayer, where you can choose from normal casual conflicts, to organizations/clans and MILSIM simualtions. The realism in vanilla game is almost like Battlefield, with little more options, but more laggy and unoptimized (Engine from 2001?). Irrespective of the LAZINESS from Bohemia Interactive. (example is the new Apex Expansion) Really small amount of Units/Factions and Weapons/Gear, so i highly recommend using mods. Overall I do recommend buying Arma III, if you have NASA PC and you're big fan of more open military action.			",61,3,1,2,3,0,3

												This game is the best simulation FPS ever made. Sure it still has to expand. But even at this point you have unlimited hours of playing with super realistic challenges, mission editor, campaings, different multiplayer games etc. The game gives you a variety of options from squad commands to character and vehicle movements (you have submarines too :P). The shooting is as realistic as a game can offer you nowadays. If you didn't like Arma 2 don't think that Arma 3 is the same. You must check it out.In the end I think that you should buy this game if you like a bit more realistic FPS and want some real challanges to face.See you on the field soldier!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ArmA 3 (Armed Assault 3) is definitely the most graphically and mechanically impressive title so far in the ArmA series. However - despite it being ""released"", there is still a heafty amount of bugs and glitches in the game, although they may be small and more in the background than presented upfront. There are also more optimizations that could definitely be implimented that would fix its problem with inconsistant (few and far between but are still issues) crashes happening during multiplayer experiences. These issues have lead a number of users, both old and new, to see ArmA 3 as still being in beta developement.That will ultimately be left up to you to decide though.Besides these issues though, ArmA 3 has advanced from its previous titles in terms of an updated and continuously polished physics engine, numerous graphical improvements to drive immersion, new mechanical upgrades allowing more in-depth maneuvering in either land, see or air vehicles as well as hoofing it across the battlefield and already developing expansions to add more content to the game. (Zeus game mode) Bohemia Interactive are definitely heading in the right direction withthis title, giving it all the love and attention they can muster and, in my opinion, doing the best they seem to be able to do as they're still defined as an independent developer.Pushing onwards from their previous flagship; ArmA 2, BI so blatently wants their entire fanbase, present and future, new and old to be able to take away and share the same amazing experiences from ArmA 3 as they did from the previous titles. And making way to provide great enjoyment for said fanbase which consists of diehard veteran players and their amazing moding community which has put out vanilla content-worthy additions to past titles as well as already ArmA 3.Being new to the series as of the official beta of ArmA 3, I've gone back to ArmA 2 to see where ArmA 3 is coming from. Even though A3 is considered by some to still be an unfinished product despite being released with a pricetag of $60, I can see that my investment will be paying off sooner or later. However I spent $45 when it was still in beta. So you may have to look harder if you've only recently purchased it.			",39,4,1,9,4,0,3

												Arma 3 is PC's best military simulator FPS today. There are more than enough weapons, vehicles, and equipment to keep you busy for atleast 100 hours (not including the community workshop). The community is what makes this game so great. The community workshop offers players a whole new look at Arma 3 (weapons, vehicles, equipment, maps, scenarios). There is no doubt that Arma 3 is going to be around for a long time. If you love military simulators, this game is for you. 500 hours well spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best mil-sim ever produced. It offers a great variety of units, vehicles, weapons and environmental diversity. The best part, still the modding community and the Arma III Editor, literally endless. You can create at will, modify, script it, doesn't matter, if you want, YOU CAN DO IT. Ballistics and Physics have improved astonishingly, the animations are fluid and you can feel it's verisimilitude. If you're a seasoned ArmA veteran, you'll definitely love this game, you'll find everything you already know and a whole new scale of possibilities and AWESOMENESS. If you're new to the ArmA Series, you, like everyone else, will go through a very steep learning curve, you'll find yourself having troubles running, walking, aiming, shooting, driving, flying, planning and pretty much any activity you're about to perform. but don't give up just yet, I can assure you, if you're a fan of mil-sim, you'll love it and it'll come to life. The game is pretty much awesome, but it'll really come to life once you find a couple of friends to play with! Good Luck! See you in Altis!			",57,2,0,1,7,2,5

												Although not impressed with the ""Futuristic"" setting (equipmemt wise) ARMA3 is the best choice for those who seek ""the something else"".Mainstream/arcade-ish game-modes from other games are already there for those who wany ""Something easy"" whileyou can also achieve maximum complexity in custom missions with custom community addons.Almost ANY situation/equipment CAN BE created/recreated in ARMA verse -especially with the updated engine/functions.Of course..it's not a secret IT IS a VERY demanding game on your hardware-but performance optimizations will be more visible by the time.Bohemia Interactive have never let their ARMA fans without support/optimizations/free content in the past.I don't have reasons to believe something will change in the wrong way in the immediate future :)			",11,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Over 900 hours played.  I'm sure I'll be well over 1k when all is said and done.  While the singleplayer campagn is ok, the game's true potential is unlocked in multiplayer.  This is a true military sim built by the same company that builds sim's for the military.  With mods like Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Wasteland, and King of the Hill, it's hard to get bored.  If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole, you might even find yourself playing Altis Life... the horror!			",47,7,2,2,4,0,15

												Having bought this on day one, I do not regret it. I'll start with the gun play. Small arms feel weak against anyone wearing a vest, taking more than two shots to kill sometimes even with the almighty 7.62. However, if you play a scenario without body armor of any kind you should have a deadlier match. While I wish BI would fix the problem themselves, the Authentic Gameplay mod seems to help, or at least it makes me wanna go back to an Arma 3 firefight. Driving vehicles feels a lot smoother than Arma 2 in my opinion, thanks to PhysX. A lot of it is still off though, for example, the karts turn ridiculously fast. It's no GTA IV in the driving department, but it's clear they're making improvements over past installments in this department. Sounds are... acceptable. It's clear why sound mods are always so popular for the Arma series. They smoothened out the dialogue, but gun sounds sound weaker and quieter, though they can still be heard from some distance. The campaign is good improvement over the past, or that's what I think at least, up until the end. Although, commanding the AI or waiting for them to move can be a tad annoying, AI still need to be improved a lot. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Healing system actually seems kind of worse than Arma 2. The First aid kits everyone has heal you up 75%, so you're not totally good to go, but it still makes medics feel useless. Again, you'll need mods like AGM or XMedSys to get past the healing system. Content remains a bit lacking still. There's only a few civilian cars, literally no women of any kind, and no civilian aviation. Also, NATO, CSAT, and the AAF all lack any kind of transport plane. The only new sort of vehicle they added was either the Tempest ""Device"" or the Bobcat, a Panther APC that clears mines by plowing them. Also, the AAF only has mortars for artillery, which isn't good against NATO with their 155mm guns and 230mm rockets, or CSAT's 155mm guns and 82mm mortars. Also, CSAT lacks rocket artillery. Fun. And, back to aviation, NATO and CSAT don't have an air superiority fighter like the F-15 or anything, which interestingly is where the AAF makes up. If combat photography is your deal, Arma 3 delivers. You can create some beautiful scenes, or horribly gruesome, to capture with the Splendid Camera. Just go into editor and set it up, and then go to the menu and click splendid camera. The new Zeus feature is a fantastic addition though. Whether being added as a supplement to an existing mission to add challenges or relief depending on how things are going, or making an entirely new mission in the Zeus GM missions, it's usually excellent fun as either the victim or the Zeus, although like most multiplayers it can be ruined by awful people. While it may be clunky at first with the controls or function, when you get the hang of it it's a great tool for making other people's fun, or in SP editor preview, just making things for yourself. Karts are terrible fun. Enough said.Considering all these, I'd give it a 7.5/10. Zeus bumps it up a lot, although the weaker guns against just about any armored soldier, and the weakish sounds take it down some notches, it's still great fun to play.P.S. You should really ignore the people who whine about the ""futuristic crap"". Seeing as everything ingame is either feasible or already existant, there's really nothing ""futuristic"". If you wanna see for yourself, check out the forums, with the Arma 3 Is it Authentic? thread.			",61,1,1,1,6,1,7

												Not entirely sure how much of this game I have really played, given that I simply took advantage of the free weekend (Who knows how long ago) and was hesitant playing it, given that my laptop has the processing power of a potato (And even then I think the potato is lighter, so yet another minus for this thing), on lowest settings in the SinglePlayer Act that was available, I was able to get a terrible 2-10fps. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed literally every second of the picture show that was playing infront of me.Riding in a helicopter, getting to see a limited view of the still beautiful island, seeing the troops and vehicles moving around below me, to shortly after scaling a mountain while taking fire from well camoflagued native soldiers, and rummaging through their gears to find the best sunglasses or helmet I liked, every moment was constant excitement, laughter, or crying behind a rock as I am suppressed and see my squadmate fall and need medical attention.Somehow able to survive all of that, with that terrible tract record, I thought ""Hey, I lived, I'm ready for Multiplayer!""Having seen countless, hilarious videos of the Survival (or whatever the name is) gamemode, I joined that first, as a civilian. Not having played much of Arma other then Arma II Free to Play, and even then in terrible Fps, I expected a few people to be slightly hostile, but hoped deep down I'd find a good mate to run with.Shortly after spawning, I found a fully loaded M4-Something or other, nice shades, a backpack, and a cool helmet. A few steps down the road, I found a funny looking Frog-like APC truck, with gas, and decided to take it for a ride. A soldier on an ATV rides up infront of me, I stop and say ""Hey! Wanna hop i-"" and he's already off, pulled his pistol out and shot me in the face.10/10, this is the driving force for an actual gaming setup. My goal is to find the soldier that shot me, kidnap him, take his clothes, pop his knee caps in the middle of the wasteland, and leave him there.He shall be mine.			",135,7,0,17,12,0,10

The good: Beautiful gameGreat squad command moduleLots of weapons and vehiclesThe bad:GAMEPLAYSo, the game is really great, but I just don't find it fun to play. It's really realistis, almost too realistic, and if the player can't succeed, what's the point?Otherwise, it's a great game			",84,2,0,6,6,1,2

												Get 2-3 friends. Play this game. Get some mods. Rinse and repeat. Pros: Two maps with HUNDREDS of locations simulating miles and miles of fully accessable openworld.No two operations are going to be the same. Sandbox with diverse weapons for infanty.Vehicals including multiple variants of cars, trucks, APCs, tanks, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Active moding community to adjust everything including core gameplay, adding new maps/locations, enhanced medical systems, and more.  Bouts of boredom and anticipation followed by intense, heartpounding combat. Its the only game where my friends and I can talk about specific firefights we fought together and actually remember what we are talking about. Cons: Enemy AI in the base game is insanely accurate. Often able to hit targets over half a kilometer away with ironsights on an SMG. This is fixed with mods like ""bCombat"", or by careful editing of text files. High system requirements, (you are usually lucky to get 45fps on a server). There are loads of guides online to maximize your performance, but the game is just so big that the processing power required is going to slow down the game. That being said a friend of mine can run it on a gaming laptop, so you don't need to be ridiculously high end, just dont expect a perfect 60fps experience even on a thousand dollar PC.

												Very interesting choice, I love it, this is my favorite multiplayer game. I play in a Milsim unit and have led them before too. It is best with a group of people; seeing as it is a military simulator this would make sense. I enjoy it very much and my favorite role is to be a pilot. If you are a casual then you can play on vannilla and there are plenty of those. If you are into a little more of a challenge than you may want to go in to Tactical realism or MilSim. It is very fun but can be demanding on your computer, also it has a few glitches and may seem expensive.  The choice is up to you. Odds are that you PROBABLY would have already gotten the idea of what the game is like from the preview. This is one of those games where if you are interested you will probably like it, but don't pass it down if you are curious.  -Message me if you are wanting to join a Milsim Unit. Have fun! Worth the price!			",53,2,0,6,11,0,5

												Arma 3 is an amazing game with alot of potential through mods and ongoing optimization.  The different online modes, and tactical realism gametypes are well done.  Ofcourse with these large games come downsides.  It takes a good p.c to run well, and could be optimized a bit better.  It has occassional bugs, and glitches that make the game feel as though it can always improve,  WHICH IS DOES!  With a game of this size, ofcourse there is going to be holes in the coding.  This game takes practice, where flying well takes time and being in combat situations requires patience, like a military simulator should.  I usually can't stand games worth 60 dollars but this is one of the games that is worth the price, especially when playing with friends which gives a big advantage when in a gunfight.

												Arma 3 has pretty much anything you're looking for...Tactical shooter experiences as Operation Flashpoint, Arma 1 and 2 did before it.Fast-paced arena combat like one would find in Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 massively improved the handling of the player characters and makes faster CQC combat much more fluid.The addition of Zeus mode makes many, many styles of missions possible.Vehicles, whilst nowhere near perfect are brilliant and can be used for whatever uses, be it combat, races or any number of minigame type missions.This isn't even starting from the thousands of custom missions and hundreds of mods.

												This game is very well done.  It is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game.  This is also somewhat a downside though.  It makes missions being done by yourself without any AI or player assistance very difficult.  But if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game.  The multiplayer is awesome.  Before I found this game, I had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point.  The workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have.  This is overall a pretty cool game.			",81,9,0,6,5,0,14

												While it's definitely lacking in content as of yet, the developers are constantly pushing out more and more to add to the game as time goes on. It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place.As said by Runekn so perfectly:""Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately.""The community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible.At the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people ""leave"" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration). Overall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.

I play with intelligent, skilled friends, and I have been playing Bohemia Interactive games for maybe 6 years (since the early days of Arma 2).Arma 3 is a sensational, infinitely replayable game.  There are hundreds (probably thousands) of multiplayer servers, and between them dozens of different game modes.  The most popular among these include Wasteland, Life, Domination, Battle Royale, et cetera.  There are many variations of each.IF YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME, you will find that it is an immensely satisfying and exhilarating experience.  The heart-stopping, breath-holding feeling you get hiding in a city or treeline from an enemy (player-controlled!) attack helicopter, jet, tank, or infantry fireteam is completely unique to the Arma series.  Even in a game like Battlefield, which many members of the Bohemia Interactive community also (or used to) play, you do not feel the same sense of adrenaline-stuffed excitement.Playing together with skilled friends that know their way around the game will greatly improve the experience, and even if all of your friends are newbies, it can still be fun just to try and play as a team together.  It will only make you all better.Arma can be frustrating at times but you just need to be patient and WILLING TO LEARN.  This is not a plug-and-play shoot-'em-up.  You can get right into the gameplay, but it will take some experience to become great.  Beware that this game is not for everyone, and if you are looking for something with instant, quick action then this is not the game for you.If you can't run this but want to, then you may want to try Arma 2, which still has a strong community base and many different servers.  However, if you are new to the series, Arma 3 is probably the best place to jump into right now.			",15,0,0,0,9,0,6

												this game is everything ive been looking for! been playing nothing but King Of The Hill - but there is so much more to the game I just haven't gotten into the rest of it. many many mods and custom scenaros availble - a very community driven game.the perfect mix, counterstrike meets battlefield meets call of duty, but very different from all three games, set in a very large open free world with the realism level pretty high. it's a war simulation, so you have to be patient and tactical. if you're running around in the open you will get picked off. if you crash into a tree while you are driving a small vechicle at high speed you will die. very rewarding game once you get good. you need teamwork and fluid communication. get a headset. get ready to die 25 times before your first kill, and be ready to have no idea where you got shot from :D take cover and keep your eyes open for movement. a few bugs and glitches here and there but doesn't take away from the game. some issues climbing stairs, weird choppy moments trying to climb over certain objects, noticed a few wall issues too.very happy with this game so far i hope they keep polishing itedit: best game i ever played in my life			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played arma2, Loved it, Played arma3 and loved it more. I joined the AHOYWORLD team and thrashed this game hard since alpha came out and its great.Endless possibilities for missions with many servers, editors, mods and scripts.Awesome game to get a clan together for team play although just as fun to play alone or MP.(Server dependent): Custom faces,uniforms,vehicles,weapons,sounds,textures,Virt Radios and more.This game has so much potential its crazy.Although.....known for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥frames 20-30 on mid systems It tends to make up for that in good times to be had. High spec systems will push up to 60-70fps but conditional. Script running, current spawned in objects and AI, graphic effects overload will hammer some systems.Overall if youre system is good enough to run it and you can handle maybe turning some effects down on mid systems its an awesome game sure to entertain and war sim lovers. 9/10			",106,15,6,3,10,0,0

												I Got arma 3 on sale with the dlcs and crap, loaded up the game and selected Koth (king of the hill) i played for a while and really enjoyed myself a bit later in the game i got a sniper, a ghille i was set for some sniping! went to a very popular sniper location on tanou where this log, i came to figure out could glitch you into the ground if you put your bipod on it.I abused this alot -(sorry)i got killed by some guy named Dan who sneaked up behind me, and watched him pick up my rifle so i knew he was going to snipe aswell so, i went back to the log and did the bipod glitch and fired 2 shots into the air so Dan, will comeback. He ended up coming back! and he brought is freind who which, i went into direct communitation and started to make wierd sounds ie -(snorting, yelling, schreeching) and he and his freind 1)shot the ground 2)threw grenades at me 3) told me to get out. i didnt, and while they where trying to kill me 2 other snipers came along and found these guys shooting at the ground, to which they murderd both Dan and his freind right about now i had fallen over laughing and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself, while the two snipers tea-baged Dan's dead body (rip Dan) so after there tea-baging they wanted to snipe now, these snipers didnt know about this ""glitch"" and had layed to the left and right of me so, i started to make wierd noises again scaring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them, and while they layed there they started to try to use the bipod and got the same glitch i was in, and they soon realized that i was lying beside them so, they started to shoot the ground throw grenades and blah blah blah well, other snipers from MY team found them, and killed one of them, and the other sniper 360 noscoped one of them (no lie it was amazing) and while they where distracted i poped up out of the ground and shot 7 rounds of 9mm into his chest to which he shot me in the face with a .307. i then fellback and started to laugh very loudly and started to cry from laughing so hard and my window was open so the whole neighborhood heard me, snorting, yelling , laughing and schreehing at 1am.

There is zero reason to not have this game. 11/10 Amazing job Bohemia. *Note even though it has some bugs i only find those relevent in multiplayer and its not even that bad.

												As coming from arma 2 and what it gave was out-standing. Arma 3 atm gives alot to do from player made missions to mods. With time to come am sure this game will grow. The only downside is the fps lag and servers with lots of plug-ins and player count. Overall this is a great game and if you are fan of arma, battlefield or just looking for a game to buy i recommend this (10/10)			",134,5,1,1,6,1,8

												Arma 3 has a great campaign and intense battles! You can download and play countless singleplayer missions created by the community and even make your own with the level editor! The multiplayer experince is certainly spectacular with the infinite amount of gamemodes you can play, for instance: Stratis/Altis Life, Wasteland, Domination, Deathmatch, Armory, and many others!! I recommend this game 100%.			",36,1,1,1,1,0,1

												Good game...  better than Arma 2 or Operation Arrowhead....  BUT and a BIIIIIIIG BUTT.  please please please please FIX THE FREAKING AI PILOTING AND DRIVING ALREADY!!!!!!!!!     Ex:   Yesterday I'm playing Arma 3 (Bennys CTI mode), I have 7 M4 Scorchers all parked at HQ with 1 gunner in each.  The plan is to sneak in at about 500m from the objective, use the M4s to eliminate all opposition, then take the objective single handed while the rest of the team is attacking another objective.    I hire a quadbike w/driver, assign the driver as Green Team and jump on the back.  I tell him to move to the next town, and I open the map to select my best approach to the objective.  After selecting my approach I go back to 3rd person view.  We are about 10m past our HQ.  The AI is crashing into a small rock on the side of the road.  Over and over and over and over and over and over again.  To my left there is apx. 10m of wide open road.    :SAll I can say is WTF.  A statement, not a question. WTF.  Not WTF?.  WTF.  Get it.   Anyways good game.  No other game is as extensive as Arma.  I would even call it more a ""sim"" than a game.  Not a true sim, but a sim none the less.			",122,20,1,14,32,0,29

												Over 900 hours played.  I'm sure I'll be well over 1k when all is said and done.  While the singleplayer campagn is ok, the game's true potential is unlocked in multiplayer.  This is a true military sim built by the same company that builds sim's for the military.  With mods like Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Wasteland, and King of the Hill, it's hard to get bored.  If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole, you might even find yourself playing Altis Life... the horror!			",47,7,2,2,4,0,15

												I know a lot of you are probably looking into this game because it's on sale and you have heard a lot about it. The realism, the tactical team based situations, and the wide variety of wepons are amazing! HOWEVER..... I, the mighty Edgar Allan Bro, have a realistic review for this realistic shooter.In all honesty, Arma 3 is much more a strategy game than it is an FPS. You have to use your team, depending on the gametype, and you have to plan out your offense. For instance, I was in a Sector Control match on Stratis. My squad was given the order to move through a village and take an enemy heald building. So, we all chose a class type. I picked up an LMG, a buddy of mine took a DMR, and the others had assault rifles and SMGs. I was to give covering fire while my men moved up through the building and cleared it out. We were doing great until an LAV rolled up and shot all of our men out of the building. What we failed to do was make sure one of us had an anti tank/infantry launcher. You MUST make these decisions in this game. I can't stress this enough. The fanbase is INSANE. If you do something wrong, they will call you out on it. I was shot by a team mate, because I didn't clarify my orders once. The game is a great time to play if you have thick skin and you have a group of friends to play with. The controls can also be VERY overwealimg. every button on your keyboard and mouse has at least two functions.The game has an♥♥♥♥♥load of mods and an♥♥♥♥♥load of RPG games. It is really a sandbox game when it comes to games revolving around RPG elements. Now you may think I'm bashing the game, but I did say I recommend it! I do! It's a great game! SC is a lot of fun and it's very very intense. If you don't want this amount of realism, maybe try playing battlefield on origin, or even DOOM if you want an arena based shooter.I give this game an 8.5/10The only problems are the straight up noobs ♥♥♥♥ing up the flow of the combat and the trolls ♥♥♥♥ing up the flow of the combat. I recommend playing some scenario missions to get the controls and the feel down before jumping into multiplayer. People take this game pretty seriously...-Edgar Allan Bro			",73,6,0,8,6,0,6

												Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch.Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players.Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.			",109,4,10,3,10,1,7

Consider it a mix of any game you care to mention with a-maz-ing graphics, ARMA 2, and the best simulator out there, and you'll get ARMA 3.			",36,2,0,8,5,1,8

												Good game...  better than Arma 2 or Operation Arrowhead....  BUT and a BIIIIIIIG BUTT.  please please please please FIX THE FREAKING AI PILOTING AND DRIVING ALREADY!!!!!!!!!     Ex:   Yesterday I'm playing Arma 3 (Bennys CTI mode), I have 7 M4 Scorchers all parked at HQ with 1 gunner in each.  The plan is to sneak in at about 500m from the objective, use the M4s to eliminate all opposition, then take the objective single handed while the rest of the team is attacking another objective.    I hire a quadbike w/driver, assign the driver as Green Team and jump on the back.  I tell him to move to the next town, and I open the map to select my best approach to the objective.  After selecting my approach I go back to 3rd person view.  We are about 10m past our HQ.  The AI is crashing into a small rock on the side of the road.  Over and over and over and over and over and over again.  To my left there is apx. 10m of wide open road.    :SAll I can say is WTF.  A statement, not a question. WTF.  Not WTF?.  WTF.  Get it.   Anyways good game.  No other game is as extensive as Arma.  I would even call it more a ""sim"" than a game.  Not a true sim, but a sim none the less.			",122,20,1,14,32,0,29

												I know a lot of you are probably looking into this game because it's on sale and you have heard a lot about it. The realism, the tactical team based situations, and the wide variety of wepons are amazing! HOWEVER..... I, the mighty Edgar Allan Bro, have a realistic review for this realistic shooter.In all honesty, Arma 3 is much more a strategy game than it is an FPS. You have to use your team, depending on the gametype, and you have to plan out your offense. For instance, I was in a Sector Control match on Stratis. My squad was given the order to move through a village and take an enemy heald building. So, we all chose a class type. I picked up an LMG, a buddy of mine took a DMR, and the others had assault rifles and SMGs. I was to give covering fire while my men moved up through the building and cleared it out. We were doing great until an LAV rolled up and shot all of our men out of the building. What we failed to do was make sure one of us had an anti tank/infantry launcher. You MUST make these decisions in this game. I can't stress this enough. The fanbase is INSANE. If you do something wrong, they will call you out on it. I was shot by a team mate, because I didn't clarify my orders once. The game is a great time to play if you have thick skin and you have a group of friends to play with. The controls can also be VERY overwealimg. every button on your keyboard and mouse has at least two functions.The game has an♥♥♥♥♥load of mods and an♥♥♥♥♥load of RPG games. It is really a sandbox game when it comes to games revolving around RPG elements. Now you may think I'm bashing the game, but I did say I recommend it! I do! It's a great game! SC is a lot of fun and it's very very intense. If you don't want this amount of realism, maybe try playing battlefield on origin, or even DOOM if you want an arena based shooter.I give this game an 8.5/10The only problems are the straight up noobs ♥♥♥♥ing up the flow of the combat and the trolls ♥♥♥♥ing up the flow of the combat. I recommend playing some scenario missions to get the controls and the feel down before jumping into multiplayer. People take this game pretty seriously...-Edgar Allan Bro			",73,6,0,8,6,0,6

												I've played this game now for around 135 hours (1st of april 2016) and the reason for this is because, sadly, this is - I'm not going to use the word best because that doesn't really describe anything related to this game - the only available option for this kind of military ""simulation"".Sure there is Arma 2 but it is essentially the same game but worse graphics.So, the game is a broken♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in which you have to scroll through menus to do♥♥♥♥♥♥which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary I'd say. They could just do a radial wheel menu which has all the same options, and could be context sensitive so that the thing you most likely want to do when you point your gun at the door of a car when you are less than a foot away from it would pop up to the top of the radial wheel so you always know where the context sensitive action is on the wheel for quick access. Have reload and some other stuff at left, right and bottom of the wheel and fill in the gaps with something not so often used or let players even customize the menu themselves. Just doing this would make the managment of simple tasks like opening a door when you don't want to pick up that magazine that is under the car much easierInstead they still use menus which are small and you navigate them with your mouse wheel and the best part is when context sensitive stuff starts popping up on the menu things get really funny and it gets even better when you want to do things fast under pressure.Sure, you can use the ""Use action key"" but it does what it shows on the screen and that might not always be what you want to do, like my example of trying to open/close a door when there is an item in the doorway, in which case the game will most likely just make you pick up the item.Better start practicing that precision scrolling!A simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything at high speeds, even a lamb fence is enough sometimes.This is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered ""modern"" was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something.All their games after that have imitated OF and Arma 3 design is still based on that game (Read: doesn't work very well anymore, or never really did but it was the best they could do in -98)			",72,1,0,10,1,0,2

												I played this game for a little while, who knows how much of that is on the menu screen or how much of it is actually playing, but i can say i have some experience in the game. The base game alone is fun, the campaign is long and difficult at times, but that is what makes it fun. It takes a few hundred hours before you can really say you know how to play this game. Where this game shines 100% is in the modding community. Those hours i have on my profile was spent walking around the ingame map fighting zombies, players, and ai in the exile and epoch mod. Personally, i like the exile mod more. The best part is when you start playing with friends on this or meet new ones on a server. I mean i really enjoy this game and i am sure you would too.

												This game is a mix of feelings. A love - hate relationship if you will.        ----------TL;DR on the bottom-------------The game is amazing. Milsims, the mods, various gamemodes provided by Bohemia and the community.Sure, the community tends to be toxic and d*cks, especially in modes like Wasteland and other Co-ooperation gamemodes where you need to work as a team. But those people are most of the time easily ignored.The biggest downfall of this game, and i think every single person that has ever launched play on this game agrees, is the performance. It has gotten noticeably stable with x64 rolling out some time ago and that's helped the case a bit but overall it's still very, very, VERY un-enjoyable at times. Having spent 1.7k hours on this game i've spent most of my time playing with 30 FPS at average while my ""rig"" can easily reach over the minimum requirements. Speaking of which, thats one of the things that decieve players/buyers/users that are looking into buying a game such as this one, the requirements tab you find above the tab where you're reading this review. You know, that Minimum and Reccomended sys. requirements? Yeah, that's complete and utter bullsh*t. Maybe it couldve held true if the game had been optimised but at the moment of this review being written and before, everyone knows it's false as the statement that Russians despise of Vodka. Even the ""beast-est"" of rigs cannot run this game properly. The thing that YOU NEED in this game is single core performance, which can be achieved easily with overclocking your CPU. You may have six cores and octa cores but that's just extra numbers for the game to ignore, it barely uses 3-4 cores as it is. Like i said, SINGLE CORE PERFORMANCE is the key to achieving an enjoyable framerate. GPUs don't do much, other than help with textures and resolution settings, AO, AA , PPAA and so on.The gameplay is amazing, so much to choose from, from the campaign to the widely extensive  multiplayer mode that this game focuses on mainly. You have official modes such as Zeus, End Game and others and then you have modded modes such as Wasteland (which isnt really modded, it's just modified vanilla) and then Exile, which is an amazing mod btw, except for the bots that shoot you from a kilometer away from where they are and you haven't even came close to even looking at them. But that's only the top of the list. One mod of hundreds of thousands for you to choose from. Endless fun really, depending on what kind of action you prefer. Altough keep in mind that more mods sometimes equals lesser performance and ALOT of troubleshooting, unless you're lucky as hell.Movement is decent, alot of stances to choose from. Pretty much every one of the 3 main stances have atleast 2 ""sub-stances"" if you will. Play through bootcamp and or watch some videos or do the showcases that Bohemia provided for your education on how to properly play this game. Altough keep in mind, you can die from falling 5m off a ledge, and sometimes you can get glitched in certain terrain and die out of thin air.Mainly this game is alooooot of fun. Especially with friends. You get alot of shennanigans, mainly from some of the bugs and glitches this game has to ""provide"".This game has alot of those. Bugs and glitches. You can't play this game without experience most of them. You come to get used to them and overcome some of them, that are able to be overcome but there are some gamebreaking ones that just make you furious at times.Bohemia doesn't really care about all that much, i mean i hate to say it, they've made an amazing game but lately i dont know what's going on with their minds. From my perspective as i see it, they either don't know what they're doing or are just lazy as hell to do it anyways. You might experiece this very likely if you contact support regarding their product. You'l be asked to do some potential fixes to your problem but only find out that they give up after like 3 suggestions they provide for you and realise they dont work. There's a fair number of errors and glitches and crashes they've havent fixed and have been present for TOO. LONG. A great example of such error is UNABLE_TO_INIT_DXGI. The error has been present for nearly 2 years yet they haven't been even interested in acknowledging it's existence. They're completely ignoring these errors and not caring about them and just making DLCs instead of fixing their game to make it run smoother and more enjoyable.TL;DR : Game is great, decent ammount of bugs and glitches and errors the devs dont give a flying f*ck about to fix or deal with in general, lower than average performance, but the gameplay and shennanigans make it all worth it. You learn to love the lower performance compared to other games but the gameplay and shennanigans man. Priceless stuff :) ",31,0,0,0,2,0,1

												I really loved the demo. At first i was sure that i could not run arma 3 at all, turns out that it runs stable 40-60 fps.The game engine is amazing and feels much better than in arma 2..			",35,2,0,6,4,0,2

												this game has many modified servers making it worth every penny, and even though it has a full inventory of vehicles it is incredibly difficult to stop playing even if you change server it has details you will not find in most games of its kind. on different servers and on singleplayer mode it is not a walkover, and you are challenged with the full feel and suppression war brings with good graphics quality  and huge map enviroments citys and towns to explore. i feel as this game should win more awards just for the playability alone and incredibly varied choice of things to do in game its quite simply  never ending ,  the maps are very very big. 20km  what game makes you travel that distance and your still not quite where you want to be .there is always a little more to see with all the mods that are being done in multiplayer  £20 this cost me on a pre release alpha . the best money i have ever spent so much so i bought 4 friends a copy of this game ....... and ive never done that in 30 years of gaming.update ....the amount of hours i have put into arma 3 is over 4000 now  mainly on one multiplayer server .but having tried many i feel happy with the life servers . ALTIS LIFE at  ts @ sealteamsloth.comthe life servers replicate working robberies, bank heists and many both legal and  illegal activities .an all round well blanced community helps . but hard to keep trhat way at times with new people just not reading the rules ,copying  their watched videos and trolling to no end . hysterical at times the wasteland is an obvious military style  game type with an arsenal of weapons  to be found by scavenging around the island  then by team blue or red you take the fight to the enemy . or you go solo in greenfor killing anyone in sight . so a more single minded tactical strategy is needed to survive .  one can get weapons by buying them at often with enemy watching gunstores .so an all round awareness is needed to get in and get out alive as its often a sniper haven area . the sights on your weapon are vital to success at distances exceeding 200 metres or more .and can be found around the islands and gunstores .the ability to get your soldier to settle before shooting in distance fire is needed to aim accurately.i cannot stress this enough at long range shooting distances.often a soldier on the slow move is the best at distance and close up contact . but it is terrain dependant also . the best way to find out your weakness is to play on a public game server .with the weapons of your choice . one has to just get in the game to get better at it .  map, navigation and compass are vital tools to easily find your destination and objectives .strategy is needed on most game modes and servers with many choices and decisions to make a quick game experience of  different game servers will help you improve your skills .the ARMA£editor, is a a 3d enviroment now with many tactical options and decisions to be made .with arma 3 you can play for a year and still not be anywhere near completion of the game .it is the best money i have personally ever spent on a game . there are always new mods and options to try new servers with arma 3 .one just has to get into the role and read the rules set by the server where applicable or needed. many servers have admins watching / playing which helps out a lot with issues and glitches we find as arma 3 progresses to a better experience for us  all.  failures .glitchy actions sometimes the occasional lying down to stand glitch can happen . but overall a great experience when using teamspeak which is free to download as a communication aid between you and your team .  there is other in game communications and chat one can use . task force radio  being one also.my first server i ever played on was an american server an experience i cant forget . the bravado and communication skills are needed to communicate in a effective manner  so a microphone is needed for quicker communication in your team or group, even groups can communicate individually and between each other with channel commander and task force radio options .sound .well you will need to adjust your sound options turning down the music and renaming your soldier in your profile to suit your batallion or group  you play with . optional. in profile .some servers have built in ear supression  by pressing a few keys together so only chat can be heard.  and other sounds reduced .in game view distances are a helpful aid also to aid in viewing enemys so adjust accordingly between playability and safety. graphical quality ... arma 3 will use whatever you throw at it and you can still not get full view distances unless you use the top graphics cards out there and often in sli or dual configurations .but anything from an NVIDIA 750ti or higher should help more .the Nvidia 970 is  best for price today so dual cards will beat a 980 but not on GDDR5 memory as it cancels to 4 gig on the 970.so be warned  get a good system with intel 4th generation or above  i5 or i7 series cpu, to get the best from arma3 .yes 6th genertion cpu,s will beast this game the 6700k is probably the best option. today .but not needed  should you not have it you will still gain by using a high core cpu  even on AMD systems one can have a great experience for less money as many gamers do . quad core  4ghz is a fair balance as arma 3 is cpu intensive. on 1 core , but one can change the pc options to perform better should one need to.a good sound program is vital if you need to survive long on arma 3 , but not absolutely vital to play the game .  5.1 0r 7.1 headsets are a bonus and work just  on lesser priced pc,s through the usb or front jack options. razer are an effective way to quickly gain surround sound in game and the higher priced turtle beaches are an option also but if im fussy i would use the Astro A40 or astro A50 to get some real sound quality to the game .so the learning curve is high when coming from battlefied 3 or 4 or counter strike  games .but the footstep function can save you or your team  if you have it  in close town battles .a well coordinated team policy is just part of the excellence that arma can provide when engagements are in your sights .the game updates are just an important  part of playing arma so do it often or when they are shown.see you on the game if you have the right stuff. you probably do ,and if you do not .you soon will.

												By far the best sandbox shooter to ever come out. The game is enriching and engaging, there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by constant developer updates and the community contributions. Everyone in their right mind who claims to be a PC Gamer should play this game.Bohemia's dedication to the developement and improvement of this game is astonishing, one of the very few developers who actually keep their word of ""constant updates"" and ""community oriented updates,"" the game has come a LONG way and the way it's going with the HUGE level of content I can only wait to see what else the developer's has in store.

												Arma 3 is an amazing game, however I'd reccomend doing your research before considering purchasing it. I personally am not a massive fan of ""life"" servers or that sorta thing, and I think public servers that try to be tactical are (with the exeption of a select few) mostly terrible. The base game has a decent ammount of content, but I personally can't deal with the AI and can't stand the single player. The BEST thing about Arma 3 is mods. Mods, Mods, Mods. Mods fix many of Arma's intrinsic problems and provide you with more content than you could ever want. It turns Arma from an okay-shooter to... well, pretty much anything. Life servers, Milsim groups, more relaxed tactical groups (my preference) - Arma 3 is the BEST sandbox shooter out there and, assuming there's something you're interested in, it's definately worth the price.

												Although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (Try Invade and Annex which is what I'm referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear AOs with the help of coordinated allies. Zeus is also incredibly fun if you're into dropping people into S**t Storms. The ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed.  Workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it.  If you want to buy it or not, I don't mind but you definetly keep your eyes on ArmA if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (Like many, MANY mods) and I hope to see you on the field.

It has completely changed what I expect from FPS games and I look forward to continuing to play this game as it grows in both features and community made mods.			",186,10,3,11,8,0,15

												I played the Alpha Lite, and was not too impressed by ArmA 3, I saw it on sale and bought it. I can say I do not regret my choice. I'm having a blast with it thus far. If you played ArmA series before, you know what you are in for. Content wise its lacking compared to 2, but that has been out longer. I have faith in the community to make some intresting mods for this game.			",68,3,6,2,9,0,3

												Arma is simply the best movie ticket I have ever spent. 2700hrs and counting for under 100 CAD. Can't beat that.There are plenty of mods and add-ons so that you can choose from a wide variety of different options.The glitches / bugs that are still in the game are outweight by far by the fun of playing the different mods.

												Arma 3 is one of the best games for your money (especially if you buy it on sale) simply because of the sheer potential. Whether you want to play single player, multiplayer, PVE, PVP, long campaigns, short missions, fly jets, fly choppers, drive tanks, trucks, IFVS, or create your own missions it's all there.Arma 3 boasts the best ballistics of any game out there. Firefights are truly enjoyable, and thoroughly heart pounding. You can be getting shot at from 10m or less or more than 1000m. Bullets travel in arcs, and you must learn to adjust your aim according to the distance of your target. It is like for every weapon, and vehicular weapon. Concealment, and camouflage are also realistic, and effective and add to the feel of the game. The multiplayer aspect is definitely this game's strongest point. There are a ton of different game types. From various sandbox survival mods, RPG mods like altis life, CQC oriented KOTH, to Zeus gameplay that allows scenarios/missions to be edited on the fly by a game master. Now all this positive stuff isn't without some downsides. The most serious issue in my opinion is the way you get past obtacles is stupid as hell. Half the time you just clip through/into a low wall, or into a short set of stairs instead of climbing over it. I have accidently hit the key and walked through a tower wall to my death. This clipping can also happen unintentionally without using the key around doorways, into the floor, or through walls. As frustrating as this can be it is not game breaking, just annoying. Commanding friendly AI is also a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and makes single player games more frustrating. The hardware requirements to run smoothly are quite demanding, and could be beyond what some people's rigs can handle without looking too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to play effectively.*edit*This is my nomination for test of time. I keep coming back to it, and it has ruined other military games for me.			",146,10,0,15,8,1,13

												I love this game. It has a completely different feeling to other FPS shooters - even the ""brutally realistic"" titles such as Insurgency and RO2/Rising Storm. This game is just so expansive (and not just in the scale of the map sizes) and it is so easy to get immersed in this game - you may lose yourself in a 4+ hour stint playing online with your friends and you won't feel exhausted or regret it. I haven't completed the story yet, but I am loving the online play (and I haven't even branched out to all the plentiful mods!) and the community has been great so far. People actually work together and communicate like you wish they would in so many other games.What this game does well - it does REALLY well.			",64,8,6,5,11,1,16

												Bohemia Interactive Fans have been waiting 4 years for the next instalment of their most favourite PC open world military tactical Shooter franchise, Arma 3. Tacking place on the Aegean islands of Altis and Stratis of Greece with both Islands featuring the largess terrain of 290 km2 for any Arma game, Arma has never been so open world before. The islands features over 50 renamed villages with buildings that are both penetrable and destructible. The islands also include all sorts of kinds of wild life ranging from goats to grass snakes, bunnies to butterflies and even sharks and sea turtles in the surrounding waters. The republic of Altis and Stratis is populated by 5 unique factions that includes NATO and CSAT alongside the local AAF, FAIA gorillas and the civilian population. Each faction has their own motives, characteristics, vehicles and weapons.Arma 3 contains over 20 Vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can be driven by players in the game. Plus, there is a selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types of scopes and other various types of attachments. Each type of weapons has its own handling, sway and recoil meaning that a Sub Machine gun is much easy to handle at close range then a sniper rifle. Arma 3 is so tactical, it features 15 types of stances that can be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy. Although, Arma 3 has realistic ballistic penetration physics depending on weapon type, attachments, material, calibre and distance meaning that hiding behind a wooden fence or plaster wall may not really be a suitable type of cover. In Arma 3 you will have to be careful about how much weight you’re caring which can have effect on stamina. Arma 3 features a realistic night sky which can be useful when you are lost on Altis without a compass as the stars can be used to navigate. There is reasons why so many military veterans are into the Arma franchise. “Arma 3 makes Call of Duty look like a kid’s game.” If you’re a new player to Arma 3 and are intimidated by the large amount of complexity to such a realistic open world military tactical Shooter then you can start off with boot camp. Recently introduced in a free update it offers up a single payer tutorial campaign and virtual reality training topics.Arma 3's multiplayer is where the game really shines. Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare. Other than the vanilla game modes there is a bunch of community made game modes including the very popular DayZ zombie survival game mode. Arma 3 comes with a free DLC called Zeus which can be used create multiplayer scenarios from a birds eye view perspective. Arma 3 content creators also can easily create and save multilayer scenarios by using the in game scenario editor in a matter of minutes. Arma 3 content can be shared and downloaded over the steam workshop with over 10,000 scenarios and addons that have been published and is growing each day. There have been Arma 3 content creation contests with prizes veering from €20,000 to €200,000.Arma 3's new graphic engine unleashes the full potential of PC gaming. Fans will notice that the new real virtuality 4 engine Is great improvement over Arma 2's engine implementing all sorts of new changes with significant improvements to animations and sounds, combined with the introduction of Microsoft directx 11 and Nvdia physX™, the battlefields of Arma have never felt more real. However Despite being the 4th version of the real virtuality engine it’s still heavily based on the decade old Bohemia Interactive real virtuality game engine that is known for its poor optimisation leading to poor performance making it very demanding on PC hardware, epically when there are allot of AI’s.Arma 3 Averages reviews of 9/10 (55,000 being positive and only 6,000 negative) on steam. You can download the game now at a standard selling price of $39.99 USD off steam. Although, a steam sale would put a huge discount on the standard sale price if you choose to wait for one. I would recommend getting the Apex Edition as it’s come with all the DLC’s and the just recently released Apex expansion which is currently 20% of. With the game being constantly updated and having constant flow of community made content, the game is a must buy for any PC gamer. As expected for any Arma game it requires a very beathy gaming PC with both a powerful Graphics Card and processor so we recommend that you make sure that your system is well over the games system requirements before you make your purchase. A PC with an Intel core i7 processor and a strong graphic card along the lines of an Nvdia GTX 970 or AMD r9 390 would be an ideal system for Arma 3. Installing Arma 3 on an SSD would also lead to much faster loading times. Pros - Open world with eye dropping graphics- Realistic tactical Shooter- Amazing campaign that reliably produces stories- Large Varity of over 20 vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can bedriven by players in the game- Selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types ofscopes and other various types of attachments- 15 types of stances that be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy- Realistic weapon Ballistics- Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare- Community made content Cons -Highly PC system demanding-poorly optimised game engine			",32,0,0,3,2,0,9

												This game is really quite good. It wholly deserves the 60 dollar price in my opinion, and that is true to form. There has been a huge amount of work put into the game. Its scale and the seriousness with which it was handled by its developers absolutely deserves them the full 60 dollars. This game puts even next gen games to the test. It is fantastic. I will relay some of my experiences with the game:Personally I am a HUGE fan of the lighting in the game. The dark is really dark, and the light is really light. The light is in fact just beautiful. There is nothing like driving in the night with your headlights on, and stopping somewhere with the light of your headlights to work by. Or moving through the dark in the morning, with a flashlight and a lighthouse far above you to keep things clear. Even tracers are quite well done, and you will constantly be taken aback by the absolute beauty and accuracy of both the lighting and the environment.On to the environment. The environment is enormous. Hills, plains, farmland, valleys. It is all very well designed and is covered by very accurate and realistic looking flora which all server the purpose of providing some very useful and much needed cover. The scale of things is just huge, and is enough to blow ones mind. It is really something, standing on a hill 1 km away from an enemy platoon on the face of another and exchanging fire. That is what battle is, and that is really the scale that stands true to the test as what Arma is really about.The vehicles are also a great part of the game, they are all EXTREMELY meticulously designed, and appear to be very much the real thing. In some ways, different, but you will not mind your long commutes via chopper or land solely because of the eye candy that is your ride.The gunfire is a bit disappointing, however. Firing ones gun is not as much a pleasure as it may be in other games. It does not convey the same detail or intricate beauty that other parts of the game do, and does not feel nearly so powerful. I am not sure as to why this might be, but the guns are just so... light. I would like to see some more impressively realistic muzzle flare and gun interaction.Additionally, the AI in the game is very flawed and can certainly leave one disappointed, especially during showcase missions. When I would like to play with a fully interactive AI, I meet soldiers who are completely unresponsive, downright born with autism and having a heart attack, or are just altogether far too quick to respond and accurate, just like a robot. The AI opponents often leave one shaking their head at the huge holes in interactability, especially on missions where otherwise this would be the focus of the game.In total, however, the game is huge. If you are interested in the sort of fully fledged MILSIM combat that this game has to offer, please get it. I assure you that there is nothing else like this out there, and this is a game of its own. The creators had a mission, and that mission was achieved. Be responsible when you are flying your intricately designed helicopters or blazing tracer rounds at enemy soldiers down the ravine. Its fun stuff, and you never know where that may lead.

It also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins, vehicles and all sorts being added each day. This game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny. 10/10			",68,7,0,7,10,1,5

												The Arma series is one of the greatest I have ever played and it continues to be my gaming choice. The game is for hardcore FPS tactical shooters, it is seen as a milsim and a sandbox game. Remember slow is fast and fast is slow...			",33,0,0,3,2,0,9

												My first review of a game, because Arma 3 is just so good that it deserves 30 seconds of my time to write a review. In my opinion this is possibly the best game ever made. I often get sick of games quite quickly and then never play them again, I always keep coming back to Arma 3. So much variety of playing styles that I enjoy, so much awesome modding that I keep finding new great conent. Briefly played on the the Tanoa map in development build and am super excited for Apex to be released, they're taking it to the next level with this update and I look forward to the future of Arma 3.

												I love this game. It has a completely different feeling to other FPS shooters - even the ""brutally realistic"" titles such as Insurgency and RO2/Rising Storm. This game is just so expansive (and not just in the scale of the map sizes) and it is so easy to get immersed in this game - you may lose yourself in a 4+ hour stint playing online with your friends and you won't feel exhausted or regret it. I haven't completed the story yet, but I am loving the online play (and I haven't even branched out to all the plentiful mods!) and the community has been great so far. People actually work together and communicate like you wish they would in so many other games.What this game does well - it does REALLY well.			",64,8,6,5,11,1,16

												Not entirely sure how much of this game I have really played, given that I simply took advantage of the free weekend (Who knows how long ago) and was hesitant playing it, given that my laptop has the processing power of a potato (And even then I think the potato is lighter, so yet another minus for this thing), on lowest settings in the SinglePlayer Act that was available, I was able to get a terrible 2-10fps. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed literally every second of the picture show that was playing infront of me.Riding in a helicopter, getting to see a limited view of the still beautiful island, seeing the troops and vehicles moving around below me, to shortly after scaling a mountain while taking fire from well camoflagued native soldiers, and rummaging through their gears to find the best sunglasses or helmet I liked, every moment was constant excitement, laughter, or crying behind a rock as I am suppressed and see my squadmate fall and need medical attention.Somehow able to survive all of that, with that terrible tract record, I thought ""Hey, I lived, I'm ready for Multiplayer!""Having seen countless, hilarious videos of the Survival (or whatever the name is) gamemode, I joined that first, as a civilian. Not having played much of Arma other then Arma II Free to Play, and even then in terrible Fps, I expected a few people to be slightly hostile, but hoped deep down I'd find a good mate to run with.Shortly after spawning, I found a fully loaded M4-Something or other, nice shades, a backpack, and a cool helmet. A few steps down the road, I found a funny looking Frog-like APC truck, with gas, and decided to take it for a ride. A soldier on an ATV rides up infront of me, I stop and say ""Hey! Wanna hop i-"" and he's already off, pulled his pistol out and shot me in the face.10/10, this is the driving force for an actual gaming setup. My goal is to find the soldier that shot me, kidnap him, take his clothes, pop his knee caps in the middle of the wasteland, and leave him there.He shall be mine.			",135,7,0,17,12,0,10

												Having bought this on day one, I do not regret it. I'll start with the gun play. Small arms feel weak against anyone wearing a vest, taking more than two shots to kill sometimes even with the almighty 7.62. However, if you play a scenario without body armor of any kind you should have a deadlier match. While I wish BI would fix the problem themselves, the Authentic Gameplay mod seems to help, or at least it makes me wanna go back to an Arma 3 firefight. Driving vehicles feels a lot smoother than Arma 2 in my opinion, thanks to PhysX. A lot of it is still off though, for example, the karts turn ridiculously fast. It's no GTA IV in the driving department, but it's clear they're making improvements over past installments in this department. Sounds are... acceptable. It's clear why sound mods are always so popular for the Arma series. They smoothened out the dialogue, but gun sounds sound weaker and quieter, though they can still be heard from some distance. The campaign is good improvement over the past, or that's what I think at least, up until the end. Although, commanding the AI or waiting for them to move can be a tad annoying, AI still need to be improved a lot. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Healing system actually seems kind of worse than Arma 2. The First aid kits everyone has heal you up 75%, so you're not totally good to go, but it still makes medics feel useless. Again, you'll need mods like AGM or XMedSys to get past the healing system. Content remains a bit lacking still. There's only a few civilian cars, literally no women of any kind, and no civilian aviation. Also, NATO, CSAT, and the AAF all lack any kind of transport plane. The only new sort of vehicle they added was either the Tempest ""Device"" or the Bobcat, a Panther APC that clears mines by plowing them. Also, the AAF only has mortars for artillery, which isn't good against NATO with their 155mm guns and 230mm rockets, or CSAT's 155mm guns and 82mm mortars. Also, CSAT lacks rocket artillery. Fun. And, back to aviation, NATO and CSAT don't have an air superiority fighter like the F-15 or anything, which interestingly is where the AAF makes up. If combat photography is your deal, Arma 3 delivers. You can create some beautiful scenes, or horribly gruesome, to capture with the Splendid Camera. Just go into editor and set it up, and then go to the menu and click splendid camera. The new Zeus feature is a fantastic addition though. Whether being added as a supplement to an existing mission to add challenges or relief depending on how things are going, or making an entirely new mission in the Zeus GM missions, it's usually excellent fun as either the victim or the Zeus, although like most multiplayers it can be ruined by awful people. While it may be clunky at first with the controls or function, when you get the hang of it it's a great tool for making other people's fun, or in SP editor preview, just making things for yourself. Karts are terrible fun. Enough said.Considering all these, I'd give it a 7.5/10. Zeus bumps it up a lot, although the weaker guns against just about any armored soldier, and the weakish sounds take it down some notches, it's still great fun to play.P.S. You should really ignore the people who whine about the ""futuristic crap"". Seeing as everything ingame is either feasible or already existant, there's really nothing ""futuristic"". If you wanna see for yourself, check out the forums, with the Arma 3 Is it Authentic? thread.			",61,1,1,1,6,1,7

												Over 900 hours played.  I'm sure I'll be well over 1k when all is said and done.  While the singleplayer campagn is ok, the game's true potential is unlocked in multiplayer.  This is a true military sim built by the same company that builds sim's for the military.  With mods like Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Wasteland, and King of the Hill, it's hard to get bored.  If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole, you might even find yourself playing Altis Life... the horror!			",47,7,2,2,4,0,15

												Before I begin, I want to clarify that I use Arma 3 almost exclusively for multiplayer.  I play with intelligent, skilled friends, and I have been playing Bohemia Interactive games for maybe 6 years (since the early days of Arma 2).Arma 3 is a sensational, infinitely replayable game.  There are hundreds (probably thousands) of multiplayer servers, and between them dozens of different game modes.  The most popular among these include Wasteland, Life, Domination, Battle Royale, et cetera.  There are many variations of each.IF YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME, you will find that it is an immensely satisfying and exhilarating experience.  The heart-stopping, breath-holding feeling you get hiding in a city or treeline from an enemy (player-controlled!) attack helicopter, jet, tank, or infantry fireteam is completely unique to the Arma series.  Even in a game like Battlefield, which many members of the Bohemia Interactive community also (or used to) play, you do not feel the same sense of adrenaline-stuffed excitement.Playing together with skilled friends that know their way around the game will greatly improve the experience, and even if all of your friends are newbies, it can still be fun just to try and play as a team together.  It will only make you all better.Arma can be frustrating at times but you just need to be patient and WILLING TO LEARN.  This is not a plug-and-play shoot-'em-up.  You can get right into the gameplay, but it will take some experience to become great.  Beware that this game is not for everyone, and if you are looking for something with instant, quick action then this is not the game for you.If you can't run this but want to, then you may want to try Arma 2, which still has a strong community base and many different servers.  However, if you are new to the series, Arma 3 is probably the best place to jump into right now.			",15,0,0,0,9,0,6

												this game is everything ive been looking for! been playing nothing but King Of The Hill - but there is so much more to the game I just haven't gotten into the rest of it. many many mods and custom scenaros availble - a very community driven game.the perfect mix, counterstrike meets battlefield meets call of duty, but very different from all three games, set in a very large open free world with the realism level pretty high. it's a war simulation, so you have to be patient and tactical. if you're running around in the open you will get picked off. if you crash into a tree while you are driving a small vechicle at high speed you will die. very rewarding game once you get good. you need teamwork and fluid communication. get a headset. get ready to die 25 times before your first kill, and be ready to have no idea where you got shot from :D take cover and keep your eyes open for movement. a few bugs and glitches here and there but doesn't take away from the game. some issues climbing stairs, weird choppy moments trying to climb over certain objects, noticed a few wall issues too.very happy with this game so far i hope they keep polishing itedit: best game i ever played in my life			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you were to buy this game today, with no DLC or Mods, or anything of the sort, you can easily get hudreds of hours of enjoyable playtime. That's all with just Vanilla Arma. You see, the thing is though, this game has never been about the vanilla experience. This game is about experimenting with new mods and joining a community and experiecing some of the best virtual days of your life with the person to your left and to your right. Alone, this game is amazing, but with the millions of free mods? Priceless.			",91,4,1,8,10,0,7

												-Second time writing review!-Best Military Shooter game i'v ever played!Pros-Realistic physics-Beautifull graphics-Good Optimization (after 1.60 update)Cons-Playing in servers,fps drops---Wasteland---So here i am with my cousin,next to city named ''Kavala''. We started to run towards the city to get some better gear,and hope to not see anybody. When we we're in city,we heard tank coming towards us,so we ran away and got lost,i didn't know where my cousin was,but one thin i knew,that he was somewhere in the city. I found an MK rifle and found RPG rocket,but not an actual RPG,so i didn't take it. Then i heard gun shots,so i started to run where sound led me,thinking that its maybe my cousin,when i was close to gun shots,i started to hear Tank engine sound,so i crouched and aprouched area. Saw tank was shooting at house with machine gun,so i aimed at guy who was shooting,and shot him in head. Tank wasn't moving so i realized thats an AI,so i aprouched tank from behind and set three mines that i found and ran away,then started to shoot at tank so it drives backwards to my location,and it did. Tank exploded but i didn't know,what they we're shooting at,i cerafully went in that house and saw my cousin.--Exile--So i spawned,and got killed by zombie horde.--------------------------------Sorry for my english! :Pwell.....yeeeahhh.....buy it.. actually...eh			",249,51,9,56,32,2,37

												WowI've played 500+ hours on this game and I'm still not bored of it. The game throws you into the battlefield with no help at all, in fact it can be a little confusing at your first minutes of play. But once you dedicate yourself and learn the Art of War, you will soon be talking, what almost seems alien language, to others in your house. From your usual mainstream happy-go-lucky Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 teaches you the realism of war by simulating... WAR. It will be frustrating, it will be dirty and it will rewarding! You can either get into multiplayer (strategic and friendly for the best part), single player (which has a good campaign at the same time introducing you to what you will be heading into for the rest of the game) and editor (a huge sandbox where you can do anything and make anything such as missions, mods, and just mess around to get used to the gameplay and physics).Absolutely love this game and totally recommend it for veterans and people who are interested in the whole military theme.

												Besser als der Vorgänger, schon in der Alpha gefällt mir die allgemeineSpielmechanik. Die Grafik ist schön anzusehen und die bugs sind bei der Alpha nunmal nicht anders zu erwarten. Trotzdem besser als Battlefield 3 und der andere Shooter Müll.I can already say that I like the Alpha from Arma 3 more then Arma 2 with better game mechanics and beautiful Graphics. The bugs aren't unusal for an Alpha version. But I still prefer Arma 3, rather than the rest of the ""shooter-crap"" like Battlefield 3.			",175,39,6,31,23,3,38

												How to fully enjoy ARMA III In my oppinion:1. Get a launcher to run it with (ArmaIIISync is great). That way you can tweak the performance so it runs properly, and it makes it easier to run mods.2. Find a good clan to play with. I can heartily recommend the VDV-GRU if you like serious Mil-Sim experiences in a friendly enviroment, no matter your starting skill level. Be advised: we use a lot of mods, and we play as Russians, so be prepared for a lot of AK's and shooting at NATO-friendly forces.3. Get some good mods to shape your arma Experience the way you like.Have fun!Sincerely, Efreitor Hansen , Bravo LMG, 1. Squad, C-Company, 45th Light Recon Detacthment of the VDV (Russian airborne) (Arma titles, not real life)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for another FPS to play like COD, this is not for you. This game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. The situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to Arma II, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. This game is not for any COD player (or Battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. Once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. Especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.			",40,4,0,5,4,0,4

												Buy it and start with the Battle Royale mod (which is excellent for both solo and coop play) if you like super tactical shooters with roaming like far cry/crysis games. The map is 270 km2 and super varied so the encounters are always different. I've played 110+ hours and i still haven't seen everything on the map. I experience immersion in this game like nothing else i have played for a long time. There is a lot of potential in the mods. The value is good because it's future proof due to mods and updates. You can really stress out your high-end rigs with this game, and the optimization isn't terrible - it runs better than Arma 2 and Dayz. I tried the game with a 7 year old rig and it was playable. The game is pretty much reliant on mods so you should be prepared to install some, they are easy to install thoughThe game is definitely not bug-free at this time, and the physics are questionable. You'll get stuck inside rocks and walls, shoot invisible obstructions, and die some unfair deaths. The controls are also really technical, so it is best for hardcore and patient players, maybe as an evolution from Battlefield-like games			",170,21,8,20,16,1,28

												Bought this while it on was on sale for 50% off. So far it has been well worth the money and I plan to keep playing for quite some time. So far I have experienced hilarious moments with friends and in online servers but at the same time, I've experienced ""milsim"" roleplaying and taking scenarios and missions much more seriously which is a blast as well. Although there can be an FPS problem at times, which I have not experienced very much at all, I highly reccomend the game. With the in depth combat gameplay, amazing graphics, and and huge mod selection, I can't complain much. Highly recommended.			",50,2,0,6,15,0,6

												This is my most favourite game  to date , I love it !  ,  the new DLC is great in particular the new Opfor Heli  but it seems a little expensive ,  What I really would like to see is a return to the the old days with Maps like Fallujah and Takistan etc and the more familiar vehicles such as Abrams Humvees  and British Challenger and Jackals  included rather than be downloadable as a Mod  .   The Altis and Stratis maps look super but they look more like a Holiday Resort as opposed to a war zone and they lack the Atmosphere  of the A2 maps .  I would glady pay for a more for an ""old style"" map,  I'm sure I'm not alone with thoughts on the direction Arma is going ( With Altis Life and such almost more popular than Arma Military Sim)  they are more suited to the A3 maps and there popularity is understandable.  Lets get back to WAR !			",5,1,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is an incredibly good one, but like past bohemia works it has a long path ahead of it. Do not go into the Steam Community Hub for this game, it is a disgusting look at overrivliged and spoiled children who don't understand how the game works they expect it to run like triple-A action shooters. The Reality is Arma is a military Simulator: your character can get hurt from non combat experience, he will become incredibly exhausted after running and carrying heavy gear, one bullet from any range can cause him to bleed out, it take time and patience to make a shot over 500m away. The vehicle combat requires multiplayer players, if your driving you'll need a gunner and a crew chief to spot targets for the gunner. Helicopters are fragile and take practice for good maneuvering and landing. Part of combat is the journey from your base to the AO, it can be anywhere from 2-25+ minutes of NO combat.To enjoy this game you need to give it time, The studio is still releasing content (FREE CONTENT) on an almost bi-weekly basis. If you don't like the game than I recommend keeping quiet about and maybe return in a year or two. For better opinions on arma 3 go to the arma 3 community website, this steam hub is just a cesspool, much like how the A2:OA hub turned into a DayZ orgy a year ago			",65,5,0,3,3,0,1

												UPDATE:I believe its time to update this review as this game and its community have become part of my daily life. Since my original review, I have upgraded my computer and Arma 3 runs really well, keep in mind that CPU is more important for this game than GPU. I have joined a wonderful Arma unit since then, I have invested in a head tracking system and voice commanding software and the experience in Arma 3 and Arma 2 that I recently also purchased both for its campaign and also for the DayZ mod is unsurpassed by any other tactical milsim FPS. This game will reward you in many ways, from the incredible campaign and feel of the in-game environment to the friends you are going to make playing this game on public servers and with your team unit (you should definitely join an Arma unit to enjoy the game at its fullest). Just give it a try and you'll fall in love with it.Original review:I had this game on my mind for a long time now, but I was divided by the reviews on Steam, on Web and also from trying the Arma 2 Demo. I tell you now, I regret for waiting for so long, I regret for not playing Arma 2, I regret for not playing Arma 1.This game is fantastic, is the pinnacle of the tactical squad shooters.First things first:If you tried the Arma 2 Demo and was buggy and choppy and freezy for you, don't connect these two games, Arma 3 has nothing to do in performance compared to Arma 2(and in graphics). It playes fine on my PC on High settings, though I have disabled AA,PP,AO, but it still is perfectly beautiful.My hardware is:i5-3550 3.0 GHZAMD HD Radeon 6870 1 GB16 GB Ram500 GB SSDAbout the reviews:People saying that this game is a sim, it's not a sim. DCS world is a sim. In Arma 3 you can fly and drive any vehicle with easiness. This does not mean that the game is arcade of course. It's just not a sim in the way other sims are. In the infantry emulation sector it's perfect, it feels like you are out in the fields.Gameplay wise is a great sandbox with perfect ballistics, physics, dynamics, graphics.If you liked Rainbow Six Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six Vegas,  S.W.A.T. 4, Insurgency, then it's your next step.If you can buy it with the DLC Bundle, do so its totally worth it, I had extremelly fun with kart racing, something I couldn't imagine.If you have a xbox controller it's worth it to set it up for vehicles, it will make handling them even more easy.If you want the best experience and immersion play the game in Elite difficulty with every help disabled, it Rocks.Bear in mind that this game is life consuming. It's world siphons you in.			",254,39,10,21,17,0,37

												About the game background: In 2001 the game Operation Flashpoint was made for the PC, it followed the Cold War era fighting between America and Soviet Russia. Due to copyright names in 2007 Bohemia Interactive created Armed Assault or ArmA. ArmA was followed up in 2009 with ArmA 2. Now in 2013 the fourth game is out. Armed Assault 3 is set in the near future of 2035 where NATO forces are pitted with a equally powerful foe. Gameplay: ArmA 3 is a very fast paced realistic shooter. With smooth controls and advance movement and stance options. The biggest feature is modualr gear and weapons. The ability to switch scopes, vests, or anything else on the fly to help protect you or assist you in combat sets this game apart from anything else. The AI in ArmA are ruthless and relentless, with advance path finding and adjustable skill they are able to hunt you, flank you, and take cover from you. Multiplayer: The game supports missions with over 80 players! Everything from Death Match, cooperative, team, squad, and unit missions. With the new physics system weapons are more realistic and so is the damage. The Community: ArmA's community is one of the strongest around. Skilled missions makers release daily content. Amazing Modders make new addons that completely change the way the game is played. Final words: While I personally enjoy this game, I do understand it has a lot of content that has not been added (yet). The development is always working on the game, and  adding more conent but in its current state it only has half the units, weapons, and vehicles of its predecessor. Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 8.5/10Story: 5/10 (next DLC will add more story content)Multiplayer: 9/10Overall: 8.5/10 Worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK first things first. This game has endless possibilities, great campain, PVP modes king of the hill or wasteland, even better PVP in battleroyale, role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life, Zombie(dayz) mods like breaking point. In fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games, which is awesome!My first day in altil life looked like this: i go get my licence, buy a car, get a delivery mission. I got one farest, like 26 kilometers acros altis. Got on a highway, after couple of miles, i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit. Some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continue(awesome guys). Couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me, and he did robbed me. He walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashed(talk about insta karma?). I picked up his money and procced, only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding, he wrote me a ticket. Finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package, i was so happy.10/10 would recommend to anyone!			",47,13,0,5,3,1,8

												Arma is a game that takes a type of person to like it.  It has its glitches, and its awesome things.  Altis Life is something you should check out if you are more of a casual RP player.  If you are more serious, try out a mil sim server where literally everything is simulated like the military.  There are also domination servers where you capture towns from enemy NPC forces.  If you have no patience, there is always wasteland, or king of the hill, where you can shoot people on sight without worry of a ban.  Personally I think arma is a great game.  I would give it a 8.5/10 due to the ""arma glitches"" and learning curve.  They are working on fixing the learning curve though.   I would like to see more out of the devs, even though I believe they are working hard.  Most of my time is from playing on an altis life server - Therevolutiongaming.  Now that it has closed down I play other gamemodes like exile, KOTH, or random missions with friends.			",129,9,2,15,23,0,28

												As a veteran of both Battlefield and CoD Franchises, I can say that this game WIPES THE FLOOR with BOTH of them. Due to recent computer upgrades I can finally dive into this franchise and experience what all my friends have talked about for years. Yes this game has its glitches, bugs, crashes, ect.. But then again, what game doesn't(yes even TF2)? I have got to say this is a game that you either LOVE IT or HATE IT, and since this game keeps me up till 3 a.m. and gives me hours of mindless fun(giving a reason why Special Forces is ""Special""), keeping me on my toes(on my butt and my head down), nearly endless mods and player created content that are added everyday to keep the game fresh, and giving a sense of realism that Battlefield or CoD can't.. This isn't any casual shooter that you can run at the enemy and expect them not to hit you and you suddenly regenerate health, this makes you feel like you're at war.. Should you buy it? Thats up to you and your bank account, but in the long run, it's completly worth it..			",118,5,0,9,7,1,9

												Do I recommend this game? Yes I do. If you are coming from console shooters, then the pace might be way too slow for you. But I recommend you stick with it: once you get over the adjustment, you will be rewarded with some really memorable moments.  I found my way in to this series with Arma:Gold, which still looks great to this day. They all feature the same basic framework: large open world, your choice of weapon/vehicle/aircraft and a powerful editor for creating your own missions. This is why it appeals to lots of us, because you may have had Airfix soldiers when you were younger, where you set up battles on your bed, using the folded quilt as custom topography. Arma taps into that part of you, giving you the tools to create your own stories. The only limit is your imagination.Other reviewers here Im sure will have commented on the other game modes, so I dont think I need to review them again.Prerequisites to enjoy this game are: 1) Patience, you need to learn the controls, and dont expect to be firing your weapon at enemies every second. You sometimes will have to travel large distance by foot. 2) A PC that exceeds the requirements. It looks fantastic. 3) Toy soldiers as a kid. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so amazing.  It's made to be a fun, military simulator but its so much more.  There are game modes for every kind of person, or all people. Let me name a few: RPG, Zeus, Big team, Wasteland, Epoch, and much much more.  The community is great.  There is nothing wrong at all to say about this game.  Just go ahead and buy it.Okay, I have a cool story just to tell all of you guys. This isnt my only one, I have alot.  Me and my friends are in a gang war with some enemies and have been searching for them throughtout the map or an entire hour.  We eventually decide to do a drug deal with them because the drug traders arent safe.  We go to the airport and I set up in a tower to watch over while my leader is outside the building and my frends are outside.  All of the sudden our leader gets taken out and to guys go over to loot his body.  In the meanwhile, they've got a heli flying over and guys infiltrating the building my friends are in.  I immediatly take the two guys out from the tower and move to a different position.  One of my friends was shot in the building and the other took the enemy out.  We eventually clear out the building and the heli flew away.I hope this helped. You really need to gett this game its worth well over how much they price it at.  I also wanted to tell everyone that this game isnt about the gameplay.  It's about the experiences you have in the game.11/10Would reck a squeker again			",15,0,0,2,0,0,1

												I really can't say enough positive things about ARMA in general, or ARMA III specifically.  This is a carefully crafted, technically ambitious, loveably flawed addition to a long and growing line of similarly awesome titles.  This is certainly NOT the game for a more relaxed gamer.  Players need skill, focus, and practice if they are going to be an asset to their team, not to mention lots of patience.  If you're a gamer looking for a quick-fix, I'd point you elsewhere, as there are plenty of great games out there for that kind of experience.  If you're looking for a slow-burn thinking-man's shooter with an immense scope and unforgiving simulation, then ARMA is a great place to go.  If you preferred the early Rainbow Six games over Counter Strike and Unreal Tournament, then you'll find yourself right at home with ARMA's dedication to realism.  It's not perfect by any means; it's ambition to cover the full spectrum of combined-arms warfare at the tactical level means no one area has a truly complete simulation, but the love of the subject matter by the developers oozes out of every frame, and the darn near limitless possibilities for adventure thanks to the built-in mission editor keep me coming back no matter how many times a rogue AI squadmate or uncooperative mission objectives force me to ALT-F4.  To top it all off, ARMA has one of the most active, mature, and dedicated modding communities I've seen in a long, long time, a product of the type of player a game like ARMA attracts.  The development company has shown itself to be a classy, player-orientated organization with pretty solid business ethics and a respect for our choice, as gamers, to spend our free time with their products.  If you're interested in ARMA III, check out ARMA II, its predecessor.  A free version is available on STEAM, and it can give you a solid idea of whether or not this is the game for you.TL;DR: Fantastic game for realism junkies.  9/10.			",184,18,1,24,34,0,77

												While it's definitely lacking in content as of yet, the developers are constantly pushing out more and more to add to the game as time goes on. It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place.As said by Runekn so perfectly:""Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately.""The community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible.At the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people ""leave"" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration). Overall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.

												I love this game. It has a completely different feeling to other FPS shooters - even the ""brutally realistic"" titles such as Insurgency and RO2/Rising Storm. This game is just so expansive (and not just in the scale of the map sizes) and it is so easy to get immersed in this game - you may lose yourself in a 4+ hour stint playing online with your friends and you won't feel exhausted or regret it. I haven't completed the story yet, but I am loving the online play (and I haven't even branched out to all the plentiful mods!) and the community has been great so far. People actually work together and communicate like you wish they would in so many other games.What this game does well - it does REALLY well.			",64,8,6,5,11,1,16

												The Arma series is one of the greatest I have ever played and it continues to be my gaming choice. The game is for hardcore FPS tactical shooters, it is seen as a milsim and a sandbox game. Remember slow is fast and fast is slow...			",33,0,0,3,2,0,9

												My first review of a game, because Arma 3 is just so good that it deserves 30 seconds of my time to write a review. In my opinion this is possibly the best game ever made. I often get sick of games quite quickly and then never play them again, I always keep coming back to Arma 3. So much variety of playing styles that I enjoy, so much awesome modding that I keep finding new great conent. Briefly played on the the Tanoa map in development build and am super excited for Apex to be released, they're taking it to the next level with this update and I look forward to the future of Arma 3.

												This game is really quite good. It wholly deserves the 60 dollar price in my opinion, and that is true to form. There has been a huge amount of work put into the game. Its scale and the seriousness with which it was handled by its developers absolutely deserves them the full 60 dollars. This game puts even next gen games to the test. It is fantastic. I will relay some of my experiences with the game:Personally I am a HUGE fan of the lighting in the game. The dark is really dark, and the light is really light. The light is in fact just beautiful. There is nothing like driving in the night with your headlights on, and stopping somewhere with the light of your headlights to work by. Or moving through the dark in the morning, with a flashlight and a lighthouse far above you to keep things clear. Even tracers are quite well done, and you will constantly be taken aback by the absolute beauty and accuracy of both the lighting and the environment.On to the environment. The environment is enormous. Hills, plains, farmland, valleys. It is all very well designed and is covered by very accurate and realistic looking flora which all server the purpose of providing some very useful and much needed cover. The scale of things is just huge, and is enough to blow ones mind. It is really something, standing on a hill 1 km away from an enemy platoon on the face of another and exchanging fire. That is what battle is, and that is really the scale that stands true to the test as what Arma is really about.The vehicles are also a great part of the game, they are all EXTREMELY meticulously designed, and appear to be very much the real thing. In some ways, different, but you will not mind your long commutes via chopper or land solely because of the eye candy that is your ride.The gunfire is a bit disappointing, however. Firing ones gun is not as much a pleasure as it may be in other games. It does not convey the same detail or intricate beauty that other parts of the game do, and does not feel nearly so powerful. I am not sure as to why this might be, but the guns are just so... light. I would like to see some more impressively realistic muzzle flare and gun interaction.Additionally, the AI in the game is very flawed and can certainly leave one disappointed, especially during showcase missions. When I would like to play with a fully interactive AI, I meet soldiers who are completely unresponsive, downright born with autism and having a heart attack, or are just altogether far too quick to respond and accurate, just like a robot. The AI opponents often leave one shaking their head at the huge holes in interactability, especially on missions where otherwise this would be the focus of the game.In total, however, the game is huge. If you are interested in the sort of fully fledged MILSIM combat that this game has to offer, please get it. I assure you that there is nothing else like this out there, and this is a game of its own. The creators had a mission, and that mission was achieved. Be responsible when you are flying your intricately designed helicopters or blazing tracer rounds at enemy soldiers down the ravine. Its fun stuff, and you never know where that may lead.

Zeus mode alone is worth it when you have friends to play with. Foget Call of Duty and yes even forget Battlefield, this is the ultimate FPS shooter on pc available. Although Arma 3 might be a little taxing on lower end machines its worth the buy if you want a solid campaign, insane multiplayer and all round good laughs with your friends!  ",143,5,1,17,13,1,9

												Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game has many modified servers making it worth every penny, and even though it has a full inventory of vehicles it is incredibly difficult to stop playing even if you change server it has details you will not find in most games of its kind. on different servers and on singleplayer mode it is not a walkover, and you are challenged with the full feel and suppression war brings with good graphics quality  and huge map enviroments citys and towns to explore. i feel as this game should win more awards just for the playability alone and incredibly varied choice of things to do in game its quite simply  never ending ,  the maps are very very big. 20km  what game makes you travel that distance and your still not quite where you want to be .there is always a little more to see with all the mods that are being done in multiplayer  £20 this cost me on a pre release alpha . the best money i have ever spent so much so i bought 4 friends a copy of this game ....... and ive never done that in 30 years of gaming.update ....the amount of hours i have put into arma 3 is over 4000 now  mainly on one multiplayer server .but having tried many i feel happy with the life servers . ALTIS LIFE at  ts @ sealteamsloth.comthe life servers replicate working robberies, bank heists and many both legal and  illegal activities .an all round well blanced community helps . but hard to keep trhat way at times with new people just not reading the rules ,copying  their watched videos and trolling to no end . hysterical at times the wasteland is an obvious military style  game type with an arsenal of weapons  to be found by scavenging around the island  then by team blue or red you take the fight to the enemy . or you go solo in greenfor killing anyone in sight . so a more single minded tactical strategy is needed to survive .  one can get weapons by buying them at often with enemy watching gunstores .so an all round awareness is needed to get in and get out alive as its often a sniper haven area . the sights on your weapon are vital to success at distances exceeding 200 metres or more .and can be found around the islands and gunstores .the ability to get your soldier to settle before shooting in distance fire is needed to aim accurately.i cannot stress this enough at long range shooting distances.often a soldier on the slow move is the best at distance and close up contact . but it is terrain dependant also . the best way to find out your weakness is to play on a public game server .with the weapons of your choice . one has to just get in the game to get better at it .  map, navigation and compass are vital tools to easily find your destination and objectives .strategy is needed on most game modes and servers with many choices and decisions to make a quick game experience of  different game servers will help you improve your skills .the ARMA£editor, is a a 3d enviroment now with many tactical options and decisions to be made .with arma 3 you can play for a year and still not be anywhere near completion of the game .it is the best money i have personally ever spent on a game . there are always new mods and options to try new servers with arma 3 .one just has to get into the role and read the rules set by the server where applicable or needed. many servers have admins watching / playing which helps out a lot with issues and glitches we find as arma 3 progresses to a better experience for us  all.  failures .glitchy actions sometimes the occasional lying down to stand glitch can happen . but overall a great experience when using teamspeak which is free to download as a communication aid between you and your team .  there is other in game communications and chat one can use . task force radio  being one also.my first server i ever played on was an american server an experience i cant forget . the bravado and communication skills are needed to communicate in a effective manner  so a microphone is needed for quicker communication in your team or group, even groups can communicate individually and between each other with channel commander and task force radio options .sound .well you will need to adjust your sound options turning down the music and renaming your soldier in your profile to suit your batallion or group  you play with . optional. in profile .some servers have built in ear supression  by pressing a few keys together so only chat can be heard.  and other sounds reduced .in game view distances are a helpful aid also to aid in viewing enemys so adjust accordingly between playability and safety. graphical quality ... arma 3 will use whatever you throw at it and you can still not get full view distances unless you use the top graphics cards out there and often in sli or dual configurations .but anything from an NVIDIA 750ti or higher should help more .the Nvidia 970 is  best for price today so dual cards will beat a 980 but not on GDDR5 memory as it cancels to 4 gig on the 970.so be warned  get a good system with intel 4th generation or above  i5 or i7 series cpu, to get the best from arma3 .yes 6th genertion cpu,s will beast this game the 6700k is probably the best option. today .but not needed  should you not have it you will still gain by using a high core cpu  even on AMD systems one can have a great experience for less money as many gamers do . quad core  4ghz is a fair balance as arma 3 is cpu intensive. on 1 core , but one can change the pc options to perform better should one need to.a good sound program is vital if you need to survive long on arma 3 , but not absolutely vital to play the game .  5.1 0r 7.1 headsets are a bonus and work just  on lesser priced pc,s through the usb or front jack options. razer are an effective way to quickly gain surround sound in game and the higher priced turtle beaches are an option also but if im fussy i would use the Astro A40 or astro A50 to get some real sound quality to the game .so the learning curve is high when coming from battlefied 3 or 4 or counter strike  games .but the footstep function can save you or your team  if you have it  in close town battles .a well coordinated team policy is just part of the excellence that arma can provide when engagements are in your sights .the game updates are just an important  part of playing arma so do it often or when they are shown.see you on the game if you have the right stuff. you probably do ,and if you do not .you soon will.

												One of the most fun games out in the steam store. There's so much variety that inlcudes mods and different gamemodes. Even though simulator games are not your type you can still find a place in Arma. You can play gamemodes ranging from all of the Life mods (Altis Life, Arma 3 Life, etc), King of the Hill, Domination (coop Players vs. AI), Wasteland, Epoch, Exile, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, and many more. Those are just multiplayers mods and gamemodes you can play, there is also a huge variety of mods and missions available in the workshop that you can download and play nonstop. All of this available in huge maps, such as Altis that is around 260 sq km.Every day, whatever you play, you will always experience something new. Be it either encountering a Wipeout for the first time, getting Allahu Akbar'd at Kavala Square in Altis Life, robbing a bank, being the most powerful group in a Wasteland server, meeting random people and start chaos around Altis, etc. There are just so many things you can do in Arma, the possibilities might be endless. I really recommend this game for anyone who is looking to have a unique experience. One thing though, playing with other people together in a group or clan is 1000 times more recommendable to get the most out of the experience.First Experiences in Altis Life:-Spawn in Kavala-No gear, only hello kitty clothes-Walk in the street-Spot a offroad piled with rebels shooting in the air being chased by 10 police cars-Walk into Kavala Square-Find half the server there (around 40 people)-Police don't know how to control the crowd-People jumping off buildings demanding money-Circle of guys smoking week with Bob Marley music-Sudden shout of ""ALLAHU AKBAR""-The whole Kavala Square gets leveled-Everyone dies-Spawn again-Offroad pulls up, guy says to take a gun-Grab gun from the offroad with 5 other people-Do a 10 min stealth mission around Kavala to avoid cops with the 5 guys-Plan out a robbery-PUT YOUR HANDS UP-Turns out to be an officer-Turns around, spam tazes-Restrained-Go to jail for 15 minutes-10/10 would Altis Life again			",31,0,0,2,4,1,6

												Awesome game, fluid graphics, perfect for creating a battlefield set for a group. The only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but that's if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 DLC's and an expansion; and also if you don't mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. Any vet of arma(people who've played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) Best part about it is that there's less 10 year olds than COD or BF >:D			",51,2,0,6,3,1,5

												Unique game. This doesn't count as a shooter, its a military simulator, but with good reason. The term ""shooter"" is used loosely to designate any game with guns. In this game, understanding military language, logistics, and tactics is just as important as having enough ammo and good aim. I rate this game highly, but don't walk into this expecting guns ablazing and being an insane tank able to take down platoons of dudes. It's for its own crowd, it's up to you to figure out if you are/want to be part of that crowd.			",35,3,0,1,9,1,9

												This game... Well, the story is: if you hope for a campaign, it's here, but it is one of the worst i've played - after 5 hours of a ""meh"" 1st campaign, comes the second one, where a greek insurgent has a terrible accent... polish, to be exact (no racism against poles, i am one, and our accent does sound awful). But the multiplayer - as addictive as it can get. Good balance when it comes to co-op - it always is a challenge to beat the ai. Though it does obviously have some bugs, sometimes.Pros:- Fresh and new compared to BF and CoD... and in my opinion somehow better than both.- Quite good graphics- A nice choice of weapons in MP... though there could be more- A LOT of creativity from the devs- Finally, a truly team-based FPS- A lot of customisability for your character - though it's not Rainbow Six Vegas 2 level of it.Cons:- The campaign is crap - enemies hitting you from impossible angles, a pretty bad story... though better than CoD:G- Even if you have a beastly PC, there will be a frame rate drop when driving in vehicles if you have you view distance too high (as infantry, i use 8000 m, i have to use 1200 in vehicles)- Bugs bugs bugs... Though the devs patched a lot of them already.Overally, the game is a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if the campaign was a tad better, and if not for bugs which actually hurt the gameplay (sinking into a pier when trying to climb it) it would be definitely the best FPS on the market. It is the best when it comes to team play and realism though. Definitly recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is ARMA. This is no joke. The war is no joke.Sometimes it's broken, sometimes it breaks you legs when you hope over fence, sometimes it lags.But it's still the best damn military game out there.Either play it SP or MP, it looks wonderful, it sounds wonderful and feels wonderful.There's nothing like hiding in the bush for 30 minutes to kill someone without them knowing where it came from.Also gamemodes like altislife, invade the island or wasteland are worth a try.

Although Arma 3 might be a little taxing on lower end machines its worth the buy if you want a solid campaign, insane multiplayer and all round good laughs with your friends!  ",143,5,1,17,13,1,9

												I've played this game now for around 135 hours (1st of april 2016) and the reason for this is because, sadly, this is - I'm not going to use the word best because that doesn't really describe anything related to this game - the only available option for this kind of military ""simulation"".Sure there is Arma 2 but it is essentially the same game but worse graphics.So, the game is a broken♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in which you have to scroll through menus to do♥♥♥♥♥♥which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary I'd say. They could just do a radial wheel menu which has all the same options, and could be context sensitive so that the thing you most likely want to do when you point your gun at the door of a car when you are less than a foot away from it would pop up to the top of the radial wheel so you always know where the context sensitive action is on the wheel for quick access. Have reload and some other stuff at left, right and bottom of the wheel and fill in the gaps with something not so often used or let players even customize the menu themselves. Just doing this would make the managment of simple tasks like opening a door when you don't want to pick up that magazine that is under the car much easierInstead they still use menus which are small and you navigate them with your mouse wheel and the best part is when context sensitive stuff starts popping up on the menu things get really funny and it gets even better when you want to do things fast under pressure.Sure, you can use the ""Use action key"" but it does what it shows on the screen and that might not always be what you want to do, like my example of trying to open/close a door when there is an item in the doorway, in which case the game will most likely just make you pick up the item.Better start practicing that precision scrolling!A simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything at high speeds, even a lamb fence is enough sometimes.This is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered ""modern"" was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something.All their games after that have imitated OF and Arma 3 design is still based on that game (Read: doesn't work very well anymore, or never really did but it was the best they could do in -98)			",72,1,0,10,1,0,2

												OK first things first. This game has endless possibilities, great campain, PVP modes king of the hill or wasteland, even better PVP in battleroyale, role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life, Zombie(dayz) mods like breaking point. In fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games, which is awesome!My first day in altil life looked like this: i go get my licence, buy a car, get a delivery mission. I got one farest, like 26 kilometers acros altis. Got on a highway, after couple of miles, i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit. Some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continue(awesome guys). Couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me, and he did robbed me. He walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashed(talk about insta karma?). I picked up his money and procced, only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding, he wrote me a ticket. Finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package, i was so happy.10/10 would recommend to anyone!			",47,13,0,5,3,1,8

												Arma is a game that takes a type of person to like it.  It has its glitches, and its awesome things.  Altis Life is something you should check out if you are more of a casual RP player.  If you are more serious, try out a mil sim server where literally everything is simulated like the military.  There are also domination servers where you capture towns from enemy NPC forces.  If you have no patience, there is always wasteland, or king of the hill, where you can shoot people on sight without worry of a ban.  Personally I think arma is a great game.  I would give it a 8.5/10 due to the ""arma glitches"" and learning curve.  They are working on fixing the learning curve though.   I would like to see more out of the devs, even though I believe they are working hard.  Most of my time is from playing on an altis life server - Therevolutiongaming.  Now that it has closed down I play other gamemodes like exile, KOTH, or random missions with friends.			",129,9,2,15,23,0,28

												I really can't say enough positive things about ARMA in general, or ARMA III specifically.  This is a carefully crafted, technically ambitious, loveably flawed addition to a long and growing line of similarly awesome titles.  This is certainly NOT the game for a more relaxed gamer.  Players need skill, focus, and practice if they are going to be an asset to their team, not to mention lots of patience.  If you're a gamer looking for a quick-fix, I'd point you elsewhere, as there are plenty of great games out there for that kind of experience.  If you're looking for a slow-burn thinking-man's shooter with an immense scope and unforgiving simulation, then ARMA is a great place to go.  If you preferred the early Rainbow Six games over Counter Strike and Unreal Tournament, then you'll find yourself right at home with ARMA's dedication to realism.  It's not perfect by any means; it's ambition to cover the full spectrum of combined-arms warfare at the tactical level means no one area has a truly complete simulation, but the love of the subject matter by the developers oozes out of every frame, and the darn near limitless possibilities for adventure thanks to the built-in mission editor keep me coming back no matter how many times a rogue AI squadmate or uncooperative mission objectives force me to ALT-F4.  To top it all off, ARMA has one of the most active, mature, and dedicated modding communities I've seen in a long, long time, a product of the type of player a game like ARMA attracts.  The development company has shown itself to be a classy, player-orientated organization with pretty solid business ethics and a respect for our choice, as gamers, to spend our free time with their products.  If you're interested in ARMA III, check out ARMA II, its predecessor.  A free version is available on STEAM, and it can give you a solid idea of whether or not this is the game for you.TL;DR: Fantastic game for realism junkies.  9/10.			",184,18,1,24,34,0,77

												This game is a mix of feelings. A love - hate relationship if you will.        ----------TL;DR on the bottom-------------The game is amazing. Milsims, the mods, various gamemodes provided by Bohemia and the community.Sure, the community tends to be toxic and d*cks, especially in modes like Wasteland and other Co-ooperation gamemodes where you need to work as a team. But those people are most of the time easily ignored.The biggest downfall of this game, and i think every single person that has ever launched play on this game agrees, is the performance. It has gotten noticeably stable with x64 rolling out some time ago and that's helped the case a bit but overall it's still very, very, VERY un-enjoyable at times. Having spent 1.7k hours on this game i've spent most of my time playing with 30 FPS at average while my ""rig"" can easily reach over the minimum requirements. Speaking of which, thats one of the things that decieve players/buyers/users that are looking into buying a game such as this one, the requirements tab you find above the tab where you're reading this review. You know, that Minimum and Reccomended sys. requirements? Yeah, that's complete and utter bullsh*t. Maybe it couldve held true if the game had been optimised but at the moment of this review being written and before, everyone knows it's false as the statement that Russians despise of Vodka. Even the ""beast-est"" of rigs cannot run this game properly. The thing that YOU NEED in this game is single core performance, which can be achieved easily with overclocking your CPU. You may have six cores and octa cores but that's just extra numbers for the game to ignore, it barely uses 3-4 cores as it is. Like i said, SINGLE CORE PERFORMANCE is the key to achieving an enjoyable framerate. GPUs don't do much, other than help with textures and resolution settings, AO, AA , PPAA and so on.The gameplay is amazing, so much to choose from, from the campaign to the widely extensive  multiplayer mode that this game focuses on mainly. You have official modes such as Zeus, End Game and others and then you have modded modes such as Wasteland (which isnt really modded, it's just modified vanilla) and then Exile, which is an amazing mod btw, except for the bots that shoot you from a kilometer away from where they are and you haven't even came close to even looking at them. But that's only the top of the list. One mod of hundreds of thousands for you to choose from. Endless fun really, depending on what kind of action you prefer. Altough keep in mind that more mods sometimes equals lesser performance and ALOT of troubleshooting, unless you're lucky as hell.Movement is decent, alot of stances to choose from. Pretty much every one of the 3 main stances have atleast 2 ""sub-stances"" if you will. Play through bootcamp and or watch some videos or do the showcases that Bohemia provided for your education on how to properly play this game. Altough keep in mind, you can die from falling 5m off a ledge, and sometimes you can get glitched in certain terrain and die out of thin air.Mainly this game is alooooot of fun. Especially with friends. You get alot of shennanigans, mainly from some of the bugs and glitches this game has to ""provide"".This game has alot of those. Bugs and glitches. You can't play this game without experience most of them. You come to get used to them and overcome some of them, that are able to be overcome but there are some gamebreaking ones that just make you furious at times.Bohemia doesn't really care about all that much, i mean i hate to say it, they've made an amazing game but lately i dont know what's going on with their minds. From my perspective as i see it, they either don't know what they're doing or are just lazy as hell to do it anyways. You might experiece this very likely if you contact support regarding their product. You'l be asked to do some potential fixes to your problem but only find out that they give up after like 3 suggestions they provide for you and realise they dont work. There's a fair number of errors and glitches and crashes they've havent fixed and have been present for TOO. LONG. A great example of such error is UNABLE_TO_INIT_DXGI. The error has been present for nearly 2 years yet they haven't been even interested in acknowledging it's existence. They're completely ignoring these errors and not caring about them and just making DLCs instead of fixing their game to make it run smoother and more enjoyable.TL;DR : Game is great, decent ammount of bugs and glitches and errors the devs dont give a flying f*ck about to fix or deal with in general, lower than average performance, but the gameplay and shennanigans make it all worth it. You learn to love the lower performance compared to other games but the gameplay and shennanigans man. Priceless stuff :) ",31,0,0,0,2,0,1

												Arma 3 is an amazing game, however I'd reccomend doing your research before considering purchasing it. I personally am not a massive fan of ""life"" servers or that sorta thing, and I think public servers that try to be tactical are (with the exeption of a select few) mostly terrible. The base game has a decent ammount of content, but I personally can't deal with the AI and can't stand the single player. The BEST thing about Arma 3 is mods. Mods, Mods, Mods. Mods fix many of Arma's intrinsic problems and provide you with more content than you could ever want. It turns Arma from an okay-shooter to... well, pretty much anything. Life servers, Milsim groups, more relaxed tactical groups (my preference) - Arma 3 is the BEST sandbox shooter out there and, assuming there's something you're interested in, it's definately worth the price.

												I played this game for a little while, who knows how much of that is on the menu screen or how much of it is actually playing, but i can say i have some experience in the game. The base game alone is fun, the campaign is long and difficult at times, but that is what makes it fun. It takes a few hundred hours before you can really say you know how to play this game. Where this game shines 100% is in the modding community. Those hours i have on my profile was spent walking around the ingame map fighting zombies, players, and ai in the exile and epoch mod. Personally, i like the exile mod more. The best part is when you start playing with friends on this or meet new ones on a server. I mean i really enjoy this game and i am sure you would too.

												Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch.Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players.Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.			",109,4,10,3,10,1,7

The only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but that's if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 DLC's and an expansion; and also if you don't mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. Any vet of arma(people who've played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) Best part about it is that there's less 10 year olds than COD or BF >:D			",51,2,0,6,3,1,5

												It may look like ""Hardcore millitary simulator"" for someone, but actually, it has nothing to do with realism and simulation. Singleplayer campaign is sometimes frustrating, thanks to the stupid AI, but its not bad. Great thing is the new Eden Editor, where you can make your own scenarios, or just do funny stuff. But the real deal stands in Multiplayer, where you can choose from normal casual conflicts, to organizations/clans and MILSIM simualtions. The realism in vanilla game is almost like Battlefield, with little more options, but more laggy and unoptimized (Engine from 2001?). Irrespective of the LAZINESS from Bohemia Interactive. (example is the new Apex Expansion) Really small amount of Units/Factions and Weapons/Gear, so i highly recommend using mods. Overall I do recommend buying Arma III, if you have NASA PC and you're big fan of more open military action.			",61,3,1,2,3,0,3

												Bohemia Interactive Fans have been waiting 4 years for the next instalment of their most favourite PC open world military tactical Shooter franchise, Arma 3. Tacking place on the Aegean islands of Altis and Stratis of Greece with both Islands featuring the largess terrain of 290 km2 for any Arma game, Arma has never been so open world before. The islands features over 50 renamed villages with buildings that are both penetrable and destructible. The islands also include all sorts of kinds of wild life ranging from goats to grass snakes, bunnies to butterflies and even sharks and sea turtles in the surrounding waters. The republic of Altis and Stratis is populated by 5 unique factions that includes NATO and CSAT alongside the local AAF, FAIA gorillas and the civilian population. Each faction has their own motives, characteristics, vehicles and weapons.Arma 3 contains over 20 Vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can be driven by players in the game. Plus, there is a selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types of scopes and other various types of attachments. Each type of weapons has its own handling, sway and recoil meaning that a Sub Machine gun is much easy to handle at close range then a sniper rifle. Arma 3 is so tactical, it features 15 types of stances that can be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy. Although, Arma 3 has realistic ballistic penetration physics depending on weapon type, attachments, material, calibre and distance meaning that hiding behind a wooden fence or plaster wall may not really be a suitable type of cover. In Arma 3 you will have to be careful about how much weight you’re caring which can have effect on stamina. Arma 3 features a realistic night sky which can be useful when you are lost on Altis without a compass as the stars can be used to navigate. There is reasons why so many military veterans are into the Arma franchise. “Arma 3 makes Call of Duty look like a kid’s game.” If you’re a new player to Arma 3 and are intimidated by the large amount of complexity to such a realistic open world military tactical Shooter then you can start off with boot camp. Recently introduced in a free update it offers up a single payer tutorial campaign and virtual reality training topics.Arma 3's multiplayer is where the game really shines. Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare. Other than the vanilla game modes there is a bunch of community made game modes including the very popular DayZ zombie survival game mode. Arma 3 comes with a free DLC called Zeus which can be used create multiplayer scenarios from a birds eye view perspective. Arma 3 content creators also can easily create and save multilayer scenarios by using the in game scenario editor in a matter of minutes. Arma 3 content can be shared and downloaded over the steam workshop with over 10,000 scenarios and addons that have been published and is growing each day. There have been Arma 3 content creation contests with prizes veering from €20,000 to €200,000.Arma 3's new graphic engine unleashes the full potential of PC gaming. Fans will notice that the new real virtuality 4 engine Is great improvement over Arma 2's engine implementing all sorts of new changes with significant improvements to animations and sounds, combined with the introduction of Microsoft directx 11 and Nvdia physX™, the battlefields of Arma have never felt more real. However Despite being the 4th version of the real virtuality engine it’s still heavily based on the decade old Bohemia Interactive real virtuality game engine that is known for its poor optimisation leading to poor performance making it very demanding on PC hardware, epically when there are allot of AI’s.Arma 3 Averages reviews of 9/10 (55,000 being positive and only 6,000 negative) on steam. You can download the game now at a standard selling price of $39.99 USD off steam. Although, a steam sale would put a huge discount on the standard sale price if you choose to wait for one. I would recommend getting the Apex Edition as it’s come with all the DLC’s and the just recently released Apex expansion which is currently 20% of. With the game being constantly updated and having constant flow of community made content, the game is a must buy for any PC gamer. As expected for any Arma game it requires a very beathy gaming PC with both a powerful Graphics Card and processor so we recommend that you make sure that your system is well over the games system requirements before you make your purchase. A PC with an Intel core i7 processor and a strong graphic card along the lines of an Nvdia GTX 970 or AMD r9 390 would be an ideal system for Arma 3. Installing Arma 3 on an SSD would also lead to much faster loading times. Pros - Open world with eye dropping graphics- Realistic tactical Shooter- Amazing campaign that reliably produces stories- Large Varity of over 20 vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can bedriven by players in the game- Selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types ofscopes and other various types of attachments- 15 types of stances that be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy- Realistic weapon Ballistics- Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare- Community made content Cons -Highly PC system demanding-poorly optimised game engine			",32,0,0,3,2,0,9

												This game has been great all the way through. You start the multiplayer completely lost in the number of controls, people running in the base and the helicopters flying overhead. It is a good thing the community if very understanding of this and helps new players get oriented all the time. Playing singleplayer is fun but the real stuff is in the multiplayer.   Once you get tired of the vanilla game  then go and try some mods. Play with six is a mod manager that works great for it. Most of the mods I have run into are highly detailed and work amazingly. It adds a completly new side to the game as it gives the option for players to get new gear, new weapons, new vehicles, new maps  and even new missions. All of which can be used on certain multiplayer servers. 10/10You will get your moneys worthCons- hackers (decent server admins deal with them often enough)- some tkers here and there but the majority of the community is good. - game bugs and servers go down (I feel it just acts as a signal I should finally take a break)- You cannot play for just an hour.  You will play for hours on end. (not something you can just pick up)			",62,4,0,3,7,0,2

												I've been a fan of ArmA ever since it was still known as Operation Flashpoint before the Bohemia Interactive and Codemasters dispute. (most people will now know it is ArmA: Cold War Assault but to me it'll always be Operation Flashpoint) I still have more hours in OpFlash than I probably ever will in any other ArmA game but this game is not disappointing.This game, however, isn't terribly innovative as far as gameplay, realism, or immersion. It's honestly just another rendition of my favorite series with slightly improved graphics, vastly improved physics, and only a few minor tweaks and streamlines to the flow of combat.ALTHOUGH that is not to say this game is bad by any means. ArmA has always had a ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"" mentality and I actually appreciate that about Bohemia Interactive. They realize there's nothing wrong with the current formula for ArmA so they know better than to do stupid drastic changes that would more than likely destroy the series. It's a shame more companies don't do this.Great game from a great company that doesn't jump on some silly ""easy to play easy to win"" bandwagon. This is a difficult game that requires skill, micromanagement, strategic capabilities. This game is not recommended for people looking for instant gratification, easy gameplay, or being able to take more than a couple shots before they're down for the count.However if you like an extreme emphasis on teamwork, combined arms tactics, and community then this game is right up your alley and I recommend you buy it right now.

												This game is complete awesomeness, from all the firefights I have with my friends, to all of the explosions done in Zeus game mode. I really recommend this game to everyone, looking for fun, tacticle simulator. The only thing I would like to see added to this game is more default weapons(You can download some addons for more guns) But the dev's are always adding something new to the game. All in all, I really recommend this game to everyone, it's fun if you play with the right people.			",220,19,4,17,25,3,19
