												Quake is a masterpiece, plain and simple.Quake may be one of my favorite games, but I'll try to make this review as unbiased as possible. Created in 1996, Quake was revolutionary at the time. Following after Doom (Both created by the wonderful ID Software), Quake took all of what Doom did right and pushed it into the third dimension. The levels, music, and enemies all go beyond the call of duty and make this game a timeless classic.Quake is heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, creating a dark and medieval setting. The dark shades of brown, green and bright reds in later levels really play to this note. This is not just to play homage to Lovecraft, but it doubles up as a way to put the player into an uneasy, unfamiliar, and terrifying world. Playing the game in linear order allows you to slowly creep into these unfamiliar waters. The levels are easy to commute, and allow for minor exploration to find secrets and health/ammo packs. When you run into a group of enemies, you rarely feel unprepared. That's not saying that this game is easy, because it'll tear you a new one if you don't watch out. This game isn't about unfairly pairing you with hard enemies; it’s about a gradual learning curve that teaches you to manage ammo, health and enemies. The enemies in Quake are also inspired by Lovecraft's novels. Otherworldly beings with a cameo appearance by the “Lord of the Wood” are just a sampler of what you are in store for. Like I touched on in my levels section, the enemies never feel too tough to beat. The first enemies you'll face are dogs and soldiers, gradually building up to Fiends, Shamblers, and Spawns (Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ these guys). You are introduced to new weapons semi-regularly, and are given a good amount of time to find out what to use on the different enemies. An example (and quick tip) are the Zombies. You can mow the Zombies down with your shotgun, but after awhile they will stand back up to fight. Then how do you kill them? When the level first starts you are given a grenade launcher. The first enemies you see? Zombies. With this new weapon already ready to fire, you unload on the group to find that you gib (kill) the zombies for good. From that point on you know how to dispose of them, and that you shouldn't waste your grenades on enemies other than zombies (with an exception for tougher enemies).With this dark fantasy world coming together with the level design and enemies, there's one last piece missing. Music. The music in Quake was composed by Nine-Inch-Nails. I'm not sure that I can say much else than that. The music fits the game perfectly with eerie, yet appropriate tracks. Take a look at the nail gun ammo boxes for a subtle nod.Nobody is perfect, and sadly this port isn't an exception to that rule. The Steam version of Quake comes without the classic Nine-Inch-Nails soundtrack, and the mouse is locked horizontally. This is quickly fixed however by downloading this fix from the community page -

All in all, Quake is worth the $10 price tag normally, but is an absolute steal during sales, dropping to around $5. The amazing level design, challenging enemies, and great music all come together to create one of video game histories greatest. Never think that you are finished playing Quake. While the main story may have been finished, the lively modding community is doing its job to keep Quake alive. Brand new stories, fun game modes (Team Fortress 2 has roots set in Quake), and many more changes make this game that keeps on giving. I cannot recommend this game more, you'll have to try it for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The early 90s was an interesting time for the FPS genre. The game most often given the title of the original first person shooter is Wolfenstein 3D, released in May of 1992 by id Software. This FPS is extremely primitive by today's standards, consisting of mostly barren environments with many repetitive sprites, but it left a strong impression on the gaming world as being an innovative and exciting game that made you feel like you were a soldier directly killing Nazis. Only eighteen months later, in December of 1993, id Software would revolutionize the gaming world with the quintessential DOOM, a much more detailed, aggressive, and yet comedic game than id's previous game. DOOM quickly became a beloved classic and was one of the most important, if not THE most important FPS of the 90s because of its refined controls, weapon variety, unique environments, hellish setting, memorable music, comedic value, and bright, cartoonish, characteristic and instantly recognizable art style. DOOM may have been gorier and superficially darker than W3D, but the game itself was quite bright and retained a simplistic manner that was palettable to audiences worldwide. Less than a year later, id Software released DOOM 2: Hell on Earth, a stylistically very similar game to its initial DOOM release, albeit with some graphical enhancements. The setting and weapons were similar and the game maintained its predecessor's cartoonish look and feel. There weren't many noticeable differences between the original game and its sequel, save for much better multiplayer and refinements to the original game.Then, in June 1996, id Software released Quake. This game changed nearly everything from the DOOM playstyle. The gameplay was faster. Enemies were more nightmarish and unpredictable. The game used a 3D engine so the game actually gave the player a sense of depth and weight. The setting was dark, foreboding, and more in line with horror. The light/darkness was closer to depicting reality than a cartoon. Quake marked a definitive split from earlier ventures into the FPS genre by giving the player a sense of fear, urgency, and panic. Dark, unrelenting, and frightening for the time, this game took everything comedic from the DOOM franchise (since the series was goofy, silly, and didn't take itself that seriously) and reversed it. It added an actual atmosphere and made a tonal shift from light-hearted goofiness to the grittiness of a biting underworld. As with DOOM and W3D, the goal of Quake is usually to find a key to open up a passage to progress in order to find another key to open up a new area to find yet another key. Yet the enemy placement, labyrinthine level design, and brutal gameplay keeps this seemingly repetitive task from becoming stale. Every section is different and you'll often have the challenge of simply figuring out where to go, what to do, and how to deal with the enemies you're faced with without dying. Sure, DOOM presented some challenges but the enemies always stood out from the environment and had simple-to-memorize patterns, and you generally had enough space to strafe to avoid enemy projectiles. Quake changed this by making the environments more confined (or feel more confined), the level design less straightforward, and enemies don't stand out as much and behave somewhat unpredictably or in ways that can be frustrating to counter. Quake is a fantastic model for how games SHOULD be made: challenging, maintaining a consistent and clear tone, requiring players to think, and never being unfair.After Quake, id Software could never again recapture the intensity or ferocity of this gem. Quake II (1997) was, to me, a huge slap in the face, as it replaced the dark and serious tone of Quake with a silly, cartoonish, and completely out of place space marine story. In fact, the game itself was conceived as an entirely unrelated game, but because of the success of Quake, id decided to just make it a part of the series. To be honest, I never played Quake III until recently but since it was multiplayer-driven, I don't really include it as part of the series (if you want my opinion it just seems like a poor man's version of Unreal Tournament). Quake 4 was absolute trash and DOOM 3 was a major disappointment. I haven't tried id's most recent game, Rage, but I'm told it's incredibly buggy and just overall unpolished and derivative. It just goes to show not only that Quake was id Software's last great game, but that they truly lost something in their image of what their games should be like, instead going for bigger guns and more explosions and scripted events instead of heart-pounding dread and fast and furious gameplay.This game contains something that id could never again recapture. Quake for me will always be about pure aggression, pure violence, pure intensity, and in its essence is the pure FPS. It may feel somewhat clunky nowadays (you will need to change things around in the settings if you've played any FPS's in the last 15 years), and the enemies aren't the most detailed (okay, they're downright ugly by today's standards) but in practice you will see that it is one of the most refined games, fusing fast and unforgiving gameplay with a dark and chilling atmosphere. In my personal list of top FPS games, it ranks at number 4 behind (1) Aliens versus Predator 99/Gold Edition, (2) Half-Life, and (3) Unreal Tournament.The best word to me that sums up Quake is intense. It is a fantastic game that, while perhaps not the most innovative game of the 90s, is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the most important. It helped to shape other FPS's to come in the late 90s, the glory years of the genre, which would come to a sad and ignominious end at the turn of the millennium.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself gets all thumbs up, it's a true classic and one of the best games of all time. You don't get this sort of frenzied action and complex level design anymore, and it's wonderfully dark and gloomy.The soundtrack, made by Nine Inch Nails in the Downward Spiral era, is absolutely fantastic, one of the best soundtracks of all time, incredibly dark and eerie. The graphics look outdated to say the least, but that CD soundtrack didn't age a day, quite the contrary. Alone, the game's darkness can't really impress anymore, but with the soundtrack it really comes to life.And there's the problem. This Steam version comes without the soundtrack. It doesn't even have any. Selling Quake without its epic soundtrack is ridiculous, because it's such an important part of it. I haven't seen any well visible warning on the store page that informs you about this, so it's borderline fraud.There seem to be workarounds if you are willing to download it from the internet (probably illegal). But the as-is version sold here gets a BIG thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review at A GlancePros:Grand-daddy of full 3D First Person ShootersGripping, visceral, atmospheric soundtrackInventive, diverse level and enemy design (Lovecraftian)Addictive multiplayer gameplay, with myriad iterations/mods; alive to this dayUnparalleled, dark, medieval, ghoulish atmosphereCons:So many Source Ports and MODS, which ones to choose?!!?****Steam version does not include the game's original Soundtrack, easy online fix available****Conclusion:Essential gaming for fans of First Person Shooters; cemented the id Software legend. Most popular game engine of its time. If you don't have this already, what are you waiting for?! For current generation play, I recommend one of the common source ports, such as Ultimate Quake (DarkPlaces+).In-depth review, not for the faint of heart: ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"":1996. DooM had introduced ""Deathmatch"" to the popular lexicon three years earlier. id Software managed to capitalize on the addictive nature of online multiplay, while advancing the technical limits of FPS gaming. What followed was the most popular game engine of its time, and it revolutionized online multiplay. Engine novelties included polygonal models, fully 3D environments, easy tools for Game Modding and hardware 3D acceleration. Quake may single handedly be the game that made a cutting-edge graphics card an essential component for the modern PC gamer. Unique gameplay features included bunny hopping and rocket-jumping. Game emphasis was on the online, multiplayer experience, utilizing a client-server model rather than peer to peer, the preeminent model of the time. This model allowed players to create and mantain a session, while additional players would be able to join or leave at any time, without disrupting the game. Story: BAHAHAHAHAHAH!! Story?! Pffffftt. Don't let it get in the way of an epic, legendary, awesome FPS game. Beat the 4 episodes and collect the rune at the end, solve environmental puzzles, kill everything with a pulse...or rather, that moves! 'Nuff Said. There is something resembling a story that was thrown in to provide the semblance of a gaming thread.Gameplay:Fast paced, bunny hopping, rocket jumpin' non-stop, edge of your seat, deathmatchin' action. Gameplay intuitive enough to allow a beginner to jump in and start fraggin', yet, complex enough to allow a bustlin' pro scene to develop, and spawn a successful franchise. Responsive controls allow you to float through inspired levels and maneuver your character, even when airborne! Weapon selection established the standard with a good variety of now conventional, classic weapons; including the revered Shotgun, the seminal Rocket Launcher and the mighty Lighting Gun. Weapon balance and choice, depending on level design and range of combat, had never been this intricate.Design: Iconic palette hard on black/browns with excellent use of lighting and shadows for emphasis and scares. Weapon design is a bit blocky, by today's standards, but sits nicely with the dark, medieval theme. Enemy/monster designs are inventive, with great variety, and a multitude of baddies that attack from above, at ground level and in the water. At the time, probably the only other big title that offered hazards with such a degree of freedom of movement was ""Descent.""  Enemies appear as something out of a medieval demonic nightmare with a hodgepodge of humanoid, hellish Lovecraftian creatures coming at you and wielding a good array of weapons and attacks. The color palette and enemy design allows for baddies to pop out of dark corners and portions of the level, setting up multiple scares, providing a racemic mixture of action and horror that is hard to match.The level design, with its gothic architecture and variety of environmental puzzles and hazards, resulted in classic levels that would eventually be ported to multiple other engines and games. Sound: Immaculate, crisp environmental, creature, character and weapon sound effects that were mostly concocted/mixed in-house by the talented id crew utilizing innovative techniques and processing. Trent Reznor/NIN soundtrack provides a chilling backdrop with industrial, ambiental brilliance that peppers the game with a pumping, blood curling soundtrack, which seamlessly potentiates the dark visuals and sound effects.Replayability: The online multiplayer experience is at the core of Quake. It would offer more options than any other FPS at the time and, out of the box, would allow for Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Cooperative Play. It would also allow for Time and/or Frag limits. After some time, popular free modifications included Team Fortress and Capture the Flag modes. The transition to a Client:Server model would permit a server to run continuously and for players to drop in and pop out of the game, without interrupting it. This dramatically improved the chances of finding a working game. Moreover, whereas most multiplayer experiences at the time emphasized 1:1 or games of up to 8 players, Quake allowed up to 16 simultaneous players in its original iteration; resulting in unprecedented chaos and murderous destruction.Conclusion: Quake is a legendary, classic game from FPS greats, id Software (id Tech 2). The Quake engine fueled the upcoming games for a generation and set the blueprint for FPS and online gaming. Dark atmosphere with ghoulish, sadistic enemy design set in a medieval, gothic world full of environmental dangers and light puzzles. Online experience is the core of the game, and would shape the FPS landscape for the foreseeable future. If you enjoy FPS, horror, inventive level design, Lovecraftian creatures, NIN/Trent Reznor or are just interested in gaming history, you cannot go wrong with this game.

												Quake is the legendary old-school first person shooter from ID Software that was a step up from Doom as a true 3D game. The controls are simple, move, strafe, shoot, jump and change weapons. It is fast paced and you can strafe avoid most everything, so if you get hit, its your own fault. Because this is such a fast paced game, gone is the use button, instead you'll walk up to a button or a door and automatically interact with it.As a shooter, Quake features a lot of guns such as double barreled shotguns, various versions of nail guns (machine guns), grenade and rocket launchers. The weapons feel nice and have great impact, everything from making an enemy fall backward to gib explosions everywhere! There are no throwable grenades or alt fire, but the weapons feel so good to use you won't need them.You'll need the diverse array of weapons to take on an army of enemies in every level. Everything from standard soldiers and attack dogs to grenade launching chainsaw wielders and electric shocking giant yetis. There is a diverse array of enemies, that always keeps ramping up the challenge and tactics you'll need to kill them. The enemies will fight against one another, which is fun to see, but there aren't factions that you'll see intentionally compete against each other, but Quake still boils down to you vs everything else.The levels are expertly designed, but can be overly brown, but I guess a game named Quake makes me think inner earth and inner earth makes me think brown. Each level will have you going up, down, forward, opening doors, finding keys, falling in traps, jumping over lava, finding secrets, swimming through ugly water, dodging enemies and murdering much more. It is not straight forward, but you won't get lost, because it is well designed. There are four episodes with 8 or so levels each. Not just that, but because this game is so old and was so wildly popular, it has a million mods and levels.For new players, there is no regenerating health, but health and ammo are abundant, this is an action game. Kill an enemy, get rewarded with ammo. There is also armor that will let you take more damage.The music was performed or designed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and feels like a touch of ambiance amongst scratch guitars. The nail gun ammo also has NIN logos.The Steam version of Quake offers QuakeWorld compatibility, but the big problem with that is QuakeWorld uses GameSpy servers, which were shut down. There are no achievements, but it is still a classic game that holds up today as one of the greatest old-school first person shooters.In all this is a fantastic game that uses a game engine that spawned dozens of other engines.

												*Disclaimer: I have HUNDREDS, if not THOUSANDS of hours with this game outside of steam*So what is quake? Quake was, and in my opinion, still is a benchmark of what a  good  absolutely amazing game should be. And that benchmark doesn't only aply to the FPS genre, but all games.When this game first came out, there was a demo for it. (That's a sample of a game that lets you try it out for free to know if you like it). Only quake didn't do what most games do now. Firstly, It HAD a demo, and it was non-restrictive. No time limit, nothing. You didn't get the whole game of cource, but you got ONE QUARTER of it! That's better than the one dinky level you get to play with in modern game demos. Or the $4.99 you have to pay for a...sports game demo. *Cough* EA *Cough*.Its this kind of commitment to giving the customer a great experience that contributes to Quake's general awesome factor.This game came out before Triple A companies were pandering to people with... How should I put it... Less than adequate skills to beat a level. If you chose a hard difficulty, the game let you know, by PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE if you were inept enough to shoot yourself in the face with a rocket, or give a Shambler a bear hug. Quake asks the question ""What's regenerative health? You messed up and had yourself a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripped by a demon? Tough luck bud, you're gonna play though the next two minutes with ONE helth!"" This game made you feel like you actually acomplished something if you beat it on the harder difficulties. If you played through on easy, yah you beat it, but you can't look someone in the eye and say ""I beat quake"". You have to beat it on HARD...or NIGHTMARE. In fact, only the worthy Quakers could beat the game on nightmare mode because they hid it. That's right. They didn't want people smashing their computer screens because they thought they were home free with 49/50 kills, only to be mucked by a fiend.There was more to this game, and more though put into it in 1996 than there is in a lot of big budget games of today. The levels weren't linear and you weren't forced to do anything, because that's stupid...STUPID!. I lookin' at you Call of Duty. All Quake did was say ""Hey. You see that level there? There's an exit somewhere in there. If you find it, you beat the level."" Then Quake patted you on the head, and let yo go on your merry way. There was no loud messages says ""PICK UP THE GUNS AND SHOOT THAT ONE SPECIFIC GUY!"". You could run though the levels dodging all the enemies and picking literally nothing up, although I speak from experience when I say that does NOT work on harder difficulty levels.Quake has a lot of replay value. Mostly because unless you go down the scrub road and watch a walk through so you can brag ""I got 100% completion on Quake on my frist play though!"", then you're gonna miss stuff, such as secrets. Hell, sometimes even I forget to walk through that one window that looks slightly different than all the rest. But when you DO get all secrets and all kills on all four episodes (yes there are four), each of which contains 7 levels (not including the SECRET FREAKIN LEVELS), then you have won not only Quake, but life itself. Quake doesn't have achievements because it doesn't need them, because when you tell osmeone you got 100% on Quake on NIGHTMARE mode, they believe you. Because one does not simply lie about gett 100% on nightmare mode on Quake. Besides, if you want to play Quake for achievements, you're playin' it for the wrong reason.Let's quickly talk about the story of Quake. There's not really a story to Quake, aside from a dinky little .txt file. That's because Quake IS the story. If somebody asks me what the story line of 'That old♥♥♥♥♥game' I'm playing is, I yell in a very peculiar voice ""QUAKE. That's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story!""The enemies in Quake are amazing. They show no mercy. They don't have some stupid weak spot for you to shoot while they stand still for 10 seconds. Oh no. If you're low on ammo, and you see a Shambler, you don't simply try and kill it. You have two choises. Run, fast, in as straight a line as possible to ammo, and to health because you had half of it zapped straigh out of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or you climb to the tallest tower that's convenient, jump off, and restart the level, this time not being so dumb as to forget to pick up that pack of ammo. If you're looking for epic climactic (hehe, that's a double entendre) boss fights, then you might be disappointed with Quake. There's two of them if you really want to call them that, but again, if you're playing Quake for boss fights, you're playing it wrong. Quake is about fighting through hoards of ememies that on their own may not put up a huge fight (although most of them could single handedly rip off your face while reading shakespear), when you have 10 grenades flying at your face at the same time as your testies are being gnawed off by demond fishies, you health goes from 100 to squichy mush pile status real fast.Sound design is something that Triple A companies like to talk about a lot, but then they often end up goofing it up, providing me with a symphony of mushy repeating sounds. Quake isn't like that. The ambiant noise is actually scary sometimes. Not spooky... Scary. They sound track is bang on. People often ♥♥♥♥♥ that the Steam version's sound track doesn't work. It doesn't work 'right out of the box' so to speak, but give the game a break. Its running on an operating system SIX..count 'em...SIX generations newer than it was designed to do. That game was made in '96 and its 2016. The ♥♥♥♥in' game's onlder than I am, and I can't play that sound track either. But I digress. The sound track works fine with a few little tweaks, and its amazing.Multiplayer is also something that is, or rather I should say 'should' be important today. It was important for Quake though. Over the years, there have been many MANY Quake tournaments. And they're still going on. There were no official dedicated quake servers, but there are dozens that you can connect to that have been running since '96. Have you got ANY idea how amazing it is that there are still multiplayer servers with people on them? Codemasters shut down all their Race Driver Grid servers two years ago for whatever new game they were releasing at the time, which nobody played online anyway. The Quake community does it RIGHT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.In 1996 people loved to mod Quake. Today, there is still a huge modding community (where's our gaddamn steamworks!?). You can play Quake in a client that can make it look comparable to some modern games (and no I'm not talking Minecraft or Clash of Clans graphics either. Proper graphics from today). And your not going to have some dickweed company try and ban you for enhancing graphics. Also, this game is DRM free, because DRM wasn't a thing in 1996, and thank ♥♥♥♥ that Steam or ID didn't try to empose some form of BS DRM on the Steam version of Quake. When I buy a game, and give somebody my money for their game, I don't wana have them check in on me every half our to see if I'm doing 'illegal♥♥♥♥♥♥ with my game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT! *Clears throat* Anywho, you can get countless mods and maps (some with stories too!) from a bunch of different websites over this magical thing called the internet. And the game wasn't built to reject mods because they didn't want you to 'tamper' with their baby...*Cough* Rockstar *Cough*In conclusion, this game is WAY beyond amazing. No joke, I give this game 10/10. This may be the best game ever made.Remember this. Whether or not you know it or not, you love Quake. And Quake loves you... In a rip you face of and make you restart the level because this game is not for the weak of heart and doesn't have stupid annoying auto save and you forgot to save your progress kind of way.

												Legendary game. One of the most satisfying shooters ever and the birth of online gaming. Very atmospheric and creepy at times thanks to the great soundtrack by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) which Steam does NOT provide. You can download it here[www.quaddicted.com] and use a source port that will play and loop the music files as intended.20 years later the community continues to create impressive, high quality content (single player maps) which will give you hundreds of additional hours of gameplay. No HD patches needed; Quake aged like a fine wine and looks great in all its glorious square pixels at 1080p. Just skim through my screenshots and see for yourself.There's nothing quite like Quake. Every fan of the FPS genre should play it at least once.RECOMMENDED SOURCE PORTQuakespasm[quakespasm.sourceforge.net] - Very faithful to the original and plays the soundtrackRECOMMENDED MODS/EPISODESArcane Dimensions (2016)[www.quaddicted.com] In The Shadows [Demo v1.1] (2012)[www.quaddicted.com] Func Map Jam 1 - Honey Theme (2014)[www.quaddicted.com] Func Map Jam 2 - IKblue/ IKwhite Theme (2014)[www.quaddicted.com] Func Map Jam 3 - Zerstörer theme (2014)[www.quaddicted.com] Func Map Jam 5 - The Qonquer Map Jam (2015)[www.quaddicted.com]Func Map Jam 6 - Fire and Brimstone (2015) [www.quaddicted.com] Retro Jam 1 - Medival/Castle Theme (2014)[www.quaddicted.com] Retro Jam 2 - Fantasy Brick Cities in the Skies Theme (2014)[www.quaddicted.com] Retro Jam 3 - Vertical Metal/Runic Theme (2015)[www.quaddicted.com] Retro Jam 3 DLC (2015[www.quaddicted.com]A Roman Wilderness Of Pain (2009)[www.quaddicted.com] Rapture (2001)[www.quaddicted.com] Something Wicked This Way Comes (2012)[www.quaddicted.com] Honey (2012)[www.quaddicted.com]RECOMMENDED MAPSThe Altar of Storms (2011)[www.quaddicted.com]The Horde of Zendar (2013)[www.quaddicted.com] The Ivory Tower (2013)[www.quaddicted.com] Backsteingotik (2013)[www.quaddicted.com]Metal Monstrosity (2014) [www.quaddicted.com] Concentric Devastation (2005)[www.quaddicted.com] ANYTHING BY THE FOLLOWING AUTHORSsock[www.quaddicted.com]mfx[www.quaddicted.com]Skac ky[www.quaddicted.com]Tronyn[www.quaddicted.com]czg[www.quaddicted.com]negke[www.quaddicted.com]OTHER LINKSSoftware vs GLQuake[www.quaddicted.com]Steam Guide - How I play Quake in the Current Year Steam Guide - Quake Owner's ManualFUNC_MSGBOARD[www.celephais.net]Masters of Doom[amzn.com] - A great book about how id software started up etc.This game was released in 1996.

												I am not going to dispute the quality of Quake, as I personally believe that it is one of the finest First Person Shooters ever made.  I would also argue that the game still holds up today.What I am going to draw attention to is the simple fact that the version on sale on Steam does not have its soundtrack.  This is quite unnacceptable.  While you can get it back through mods the fact that this is necessary is an horrendous oversight that plainly should not be tolerated.  Arguably the soundtrack is a major draw if not the major draw to this game.  Great ambient work by Trent Reznor that sets the mood  as a perfect compliment for the level design and art design.  Without it, much of the atmosphere is lost, and much of what made it a special complete experience is lost.  There simply is no excuse for leaving this out.However, as I said, it is a fine game.  Even with that in mind, simply put we should demand better treatment for our classics than what we have on display here.			",1485,495,53,205,147,17,259

												If you loved DOOM or DOOM II then Quake is a god-send. The Original Quake was THE FIRST TRUE 3D First Person Shooter ever made. And it did (then as well as now, if anyone could see past then next CoD) phenominally. 32 is the magic number when it comes to great FPS' , as all 32 levels (and 6 underplayed 'Deathmatch' levels) were intense and enjoyable from start to finish.    The Original Quake may as well have been a DOOM spin-off during it's initial release, but copying a great formula isn't always a bad thing, IF you know where to go with it. Quake knew EXACTLY what it was doing, and IMPROVED upon all of DOOM's previous work. Taking DOOM 2's 32 level formula, the ability to look up and down (It was REVOLUTIONARY I TELL YOU!!!!!!!), intense gore (which, back then made the game ""M for Mature"" but now, with graphical updates, the gore has been downgraded too ""T for Teen""), fast-paced (CoD has NOTHING on this) multiplayer, and over the top violence (A.K.A. The AXE OF EXPLOSIONS, seriously... no joke... go smash up a corpse with this thing...), that made it a 'Must have' for EVERY gamer that owned Windows 95.     NOTICE (FOR CLARIFICATION ONLY, You can skip this if you want):Now, I must clarify one thing, I didn't grow up on DOOM or DOOM II or even Quake, BUT I believe Wolfenstein, Spear of Destiny, DOOM, DOOM II, Quake, and all of the other great 90's First Person Shooters are what we should all take a page from when making the next CoD. SERIOUSLY my first First Person Shooter was CALL OF DUTY 4 for God's sake! When I played DOOM for the first time I was... how shall I say this....MIND BLOWN, FLOORED, & BLOWN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR! SERIOUSLY! I play CoD 4 now and I'll ALWAYS go back to DOOM & DOOM II before the day's up.     The Original Quake is, in my opinion, better than Quake 2 & 4 (Which are basically part of a 'mini-trilogy' I call ""The Quake Wars""), Quake 1 is entirely seperate from the rest of the series. It is closer to a fully 3D DOOM game more than Quake's 2, 4, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (A.K.A The Quake Wars Trilogy)  Quake is the name of the final Boss in this game, though (Can this really be a spoiler? I mean, all I said was the name, right?) not a boss in The Quake Wars Trilogy, has no mention of even the name ""Quake"" EXCEPT when the Intro of Enemy Territory: QW has a slip-gate (pretty much a space teleporter) shaped like the logo summon invading ships.     NOW, all mentions of other games aside.... Quake is an addicting, fast paced, rocket jumping (yes, we has those), barrel O' fun. In the words of a wiseman ~ ""In my day, we rocket jumped to school, both ways."" - Wise guy, 20XX (because I don't remember his name or the year). You would be a FOOL to pass this game up, give it a try, there's NOTHING to lose, and everything to GAIN!P.S. It is ALMOST REQUIRED to have this installed onto the game to make run properly on modern PC's:  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923 (The ULTIMATE Quake Patch IS LITTERALLY the 'Best Thing Since Rocket Jumps')			",90,1,0,1,1,0,1

												The first-person shooter genre is built on the backs of giants, and few are as big as the Quake series. It was the first fully-3D shooter success story and helped kick the online multiplayer scene into overdrive. We're a long way out from the golden age of iD Software, but their titles have incredible staying power thanks to solid fundamentals and vibrant modding scenes. The original Quake is no exception, but as I'll explain, you may want to consider your options before picking up this particular version.Quake technically has a plot, but it was literally one type-written page in the jewelcase-insert manual. Government makes portal thingies, demon thingies come out of portals, you kill demons with gun thingies. In practice this means four episodes of gruesome treks into ruined bases, medieval castles, nonsensical hellmazes, and twisting eldritch architecture. There are a lot of elements to laud about Quake but the one I'm really going to harp on is the feel of it, because it's one of the best cosmic horror FPSes to date outside of the literal Lovecraftian ones like Call of Cthulhu and Eldritch. Levels are tightly-designed labyrinths of decaying arches and gothic spires, impossible woodwork and ageless caverns. The modeling detail and texture work really drives home the atmosphere of ancient, neglected places full of unspeakable things, and the dated, chunky graphics actually help the unearthly feel.Then of course there are the unspeakable things trying to kill you. Quake features a refreshingly diverse cast of beings to forcibly disassemble, from corrupted marines to bloodthirsty knights, self-dismembering zombies to spider-legged horrors. The key here is that they cover the standard enemy roles in unusual ways, the Ogre being the prime example of this. One of the most common enemies in the game, he's armed with a heavily-damaging grenade launcher and an even nastier chainsaw. This wouldn't really fly in a lot of games, but the combination of high movespeed and effective weapon variety means you'll always have options in combating him and avoiding his brutal damage entirely.It's these player elements that make Quake feel like a bridge between Doom and the modern era. You avatar still darts around levels at inhuman speeds, allowing you to weave between foes to spark infighting or bait melee attacks. Your freedom of movement also lets you seek out the many secrets of every level, often hidden in ingenious ways. The weapons are a good spread of utility but without any real stand-outs like the BFG of old, giving you an effective if not exciting arsenal to dispatch your enemies with. There are some creative interactions, at least, like zombies only being killable with explosives, or the lightning gun killing you (and everything else) if used underwater.The ironclad fundamentals of Quake make it a timeless classic that still holds up to this day, even discounting the incredible multiplayer or soundtrack (an original Trent Reznor creation!). And you will need to discount those if you pick this version up, because they're not included. The Steam version of Quake lacks the CD soundtrack, and features four outdated executables for the game. Two of these are old Quakeworld multiplayer-only clients that are now defunct. The other two are ancient versions of winQuake designed for Win95 that may not run on your system at all. The unfortunate truth is that Quake might not work for you at all out of the proverbial box. There are plenty of source ports that WILL work if you download them, as long as you own the official game, but understand that modding may be your only option to enjoy what you're buying.In the end, what I'm saying here is that you should own Quake and you should play Quake, but this version isn't necessarily the best way to do that. A retro-friendly storefront like GOG is more likely to have one that will play without any fiddling, but all the same you should be prepared to mod Quake if you want the most out of it. I don't normally speak of modding in my reviews but this is one of the rare times it's a necessity, especially if you want to dip your toes in the multiplayer. I assure the hassle is worth it, because Quake formed the foundation of FPSes for good reason, and even now it's a unique and thrilling experience.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												This was the first game I ever played; not the pc version, but the very bad N64 port. It features great level design and a veriety of weapons. Have you ever used the ""Original"" rocket launcher in Tf2? It is actually the rocket launcher featured in Quake. It features many frightning enemies, dreams of running down a long corridor being chased by Shamblers still haunt me. The game was the first 3d FPS with acctual; 3d models ever made, and can rival then likes of Duke Nukem 3D. Those were my Compliments, now here are my complaints: 1. For those who do not like old graphics...well.. these haven't aged well.2. The game allways feels a little to short, I crave more levels.3.I personally feel the game should be 7$, but thats just me4. Again may be just me, but I allways had trouble with later levels even   on easy.Conclusion: I find that Quake is a nifty little gem that will eat up some of your free time.

												The music is missing from this version of quake 1 and 2(I haven’t tried 3 yet). When I buy something. I expect to get the complete experience. Especially when the product is this old.  I don’t mind tinkering around to get the game working as long as it is complete. But if the game is not complete and I need to find another source (the internet for example) to get the missing component. I cant really be ask to bothered with it. It’s like buying a puzzle. But you need to download(or by other means) to get the last couple of pieces. It is just frustratingly. On the up side the gameplay is excilent. As long if you like old nineties fps games.

												A must buy for anyone ever - Quake offers a frantic shooter experience like no other and stands among the best games ever created. id Software has once again pushed the limits of gaming and has harnessed the true power of PC's processing power. Quake's fully 3D rendered maps make you weep in joy as you make your way through the dark castle corridors and mansion cellars while spraying lead - or in this case Nine Inch Nails - to the brains of the undead while listening to the terrific ambient soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor.Oh, I recommend using the DarkPlaces Quake engine.

												I loved Quake back in the days and I still enjoy it today. There's no doubt this is a legendary game with near to perfect level design and gameplay, a lot of atmosphere and a huge legacy.But I can't recommend this package here on Steam. You are forced to install source ports like ProQuake 4 (http://quakeone.com/proquake/) to make it run properly. Because they actually have the balls to shove a supposedly unmodified version of WinQuake into your mouth that's just not working properly - at least for me. I am sorry but that is not what I expect when I buy a release of a game that's 20 years old. Not for 5 Euros or even 50 Cent. Not if you consider the source code is open for more then 10 years and there are tons of source ports, modifications etc. Just pick one for christ's sake and use that you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.But the biggest letdown of all for me is that they didn't include the kickass soundtrack by Trent Reznor aka Ninch Inch Nails. Are you serious? Either they want to save download time or were they just too lazy to figure out how to playback the CD music. Again: must be one hell of a task considering the source code of Quake is available for more than ten years now.In the end, this is just sloppy, quick moneymaking. Some dudes at ZeniMax or Bethesda (did id belong to Bethesda in 2007 already?) probably thought: ""Let's shove out that Quake game my kids once talked about. Who cares if it runs. The stupid muppets will buy it anyway to have it in their so called 'Steam Library'. Let's make a buck or two without any effort! Ha ha."" Yeah, well, screw you, Corporate Commander.

												In honor of Quake's 20th birthday and Quake Champions announcement, I feel it's relevant to say how great this gem of a game has aged. As id's leap into 3D, and one of the first truly 3D polygonal shooters I can recall, Quake is still as much fun in 2016 as it was in 1996. The game oozes a dark, eeire and ominous atmosphere, with an interesting blend of gothic fantasy and gritty sci-fi for a really one of a kind look. The 3D graphics, though obviously very dated, are still rather charming. This is too speak nothing of Trent Reznor's fantastic soundtrack, which deeply enhances the creepy atmoshphere. If you enjoyed Doom 2016, this would be right up your alley. It makes me very happy to say how well Quake holds up.  ",26,6,0,6,0,0,1

												In the 1990s, the first-person shooter was still a new genre to many, and id Software were the kings of the genre. Starting by introducing many to the genre with Wolfenstein 3-D, id created a shooter that had the player running through a 3-D maze gunning down Nazis and killing Hitler, and it was really all people needed in 1992. The next year, id got a little more ambitious and unleashed Doom onto the world. Allowing players more weapons and adding a vertical axis to the game, Doom took gaming by storm, with gamers all too happy to dismember the armies of Hell and play with their friends online (it got so popular many offices had to install programs onto the computers that could prevent people from playing Doom deathmatches because so many people slacked off and went online fragging each other in deathmatch.) Doom got a sequel, which got two expansions endorsed but not made by id, and a collection of levels created by fans of the games were released. It seemed like id had peaked and that there was nowhere else for id to go from here. But then Quake happened.Quake again redefined what it meant to be a FPS and shocked the gaming world by adding a truly 3-D environment that was filled with all kinds of unique and varying types of enemies. With 4 episodes and 7 levels each, the game is smaller than Doom, but the gameplay is off the hook, balls-to-the-wall, rocket-jumping, grenade-hopping, MADNESS. There's a less overt evil you see in Quake compared to Doom, as these aren't just Demons from hell, they're inspired from H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, and other classical horror works. While it's lacking in the epic-boss-encounter department, the game is more concerned with being a damn good shooter, and it certainly accomplishes that. I've been playing Doom and Wolfenstein for quite some time now, but Quake is better than both those games and I've only been playing it for about 3 hours, which is saying a lot because I've played over 500 hours of Doom (don't check the Steam hours, I use GZDoom.)If you like first person shooters, buy Quake. You'd be doing yourself a favor.			",12,1,0,2,0,0,0

												I've been meaning to write this review earlier, but I know that no one in the world knows about this game.  Now with the achievements, I have an excuse to finally write this!Quake is id Software's first foray into a true 3D game, a first person shooter in the vein of Doom.  During it's debut, it was groundbreaking for its technological advancements, and is now well known for being the basis of some of video game's biggest hits, where they originally branched out of a Quake mod.Most remember it for its multiplayer, but few talk about how its single player campaign holds up.  Admittedly, the story is very anachronistic and shoehorned due to it being based off of an earlier build; Quake was slated to be an RPG in a dark fantasy world before id decided to turn it into an FPS, which is why you'll see a blend of futuristic weaponry mixed in with medieval backdrops and Lovecraftian-inspired monsters.  A lot of people will dismiss the graphics for running the ""Real is Brown"" trope to the ground, but I personally love it.  It adds to the atmosphere of the game along with the ambient music (wonderfully crafted by NiN) and truly lets you feel like you're alone in a desolate dimension.The gameplay is where it truly shines.  While it was always marketed for its (at the time) amazing visuals, not a lot of people payed heed to its amazing gunplay and well-crafted difficulty.  While the original game suffers from lack of customization, source ports more than help to enhance the overall experience.  The controls really feel tight and responsive, with the gunplay rivalling modern-era games with how all the guns have a real sort of ""punch"" to them (the Super Nailgun in particular is absolutely cathartic).  The difficulty is also very tough, but fair.  While it still falls under the usual usage of ""higher difficulty = enemies do more damage and you do less"", it isn't exaggerated like in a lot of other games.  I, myself, found the highest difficulty to be a good challenge.In all, I'd say this game has aged fairly well.  Whether it be my nostalgia goggles or not, I feel like the muddy graphics enhance the overall feel of the game's otherworldly tone.  The gameplay is as excellent as ever, and the sound design is truly phenomenal.  If you're a fan of FPS games and you're looking for another classic to play, I'd recommend this title to you, as well as the expansion packs with it.  While the multiplayer's pretty much dead (at least to my knowledge), it's worth it if only for the single player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since I reviewed Quake II and Quake III Arena, I could not finished the Pre-DOOM 3 Quakes without including the legendary Quake! Let's start how I discovered it... On a typical trip to best buy in 1997, at the time, I grew up with macintosh than windows, we were looking for a new Mac game to buy and play, I discovered Quake, and looking through the back cover of the box, I felt scared of the screenshots in it. When I played it, I loved it, even the clever thing one time when I put the Warcraft II CD in, it would play Warcraft music!The game's final boss, monsters, and art style is primarily based the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, or better known as H.P. Lovecraft. And no, Cthulu isn't there, Shub-Nigath is there. Same gameplay as the other Quakes I mentioned were fun, fast-pace, and addicting.For the story, you are Ranger, a soldier who has investigate the incidents happened with a monster known as ""Quake"" (AKA Shub-Nigath). You are there to kill Vores that shoots energy that follows you, Powerful Death Knights, the tough to kill Shamblers, Zombies only killed by Explosives, Possessed Soldiers and Rottweilers, And the apprentience Knights. Yeah, even Quake 1 has enemy variety. It also has some iconic weapons, like the rocket launcher featured in Team Fortress 2 (AKA The Original) and Lightning gun, powerful yet consumes ammo fast! Aside from that, there is the Nailguns inspired by the band Nine Inch Nails. Yes! Trent Reznor, as a DOOM Fan, along with Nine Inch Nails, did the music and sounds for Quake.Totally get this game that revolutionizes the 3D world of gaming.P.S. I can't spell Shub's name right due to the censorship in steam reviewing, blame Valve, not me.			",254,22,3,24,30,1,33

												+fun+looks insanely good in darkplaces with dynamic lighting enabled and GL_NEAREST(AMD Eyefinity doesn't produce awkward weapon positions in darkplaces!)+insanely good soundtrack-no music included on the steam release, (Thanks whats-left-of-id software!)-Neither Carmack OR Romero and a hell of a lot of others, including ALL of the original founders don't even work at id anymore, Zenimax/Methesda owns id now, so no reason to financially support id by buying new games.Just ask your friend for his CD he doesn't use anymore and move the paks to a darkplaces install.I really don't see a reason to buy a /new/ copy of Quake now other than for nerdcred.If you decide to play with darkplaces? I highly recommend you manually set the GL_TEXTUREMODE to GL_NEAREST.The crispier graphics that GL_NEAREST gives you over GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR (default) is definitely something I like in Quake. (Mind you, the setting doesn't stick for some reason, probably a bug in darkplaces)

												The Revolution of Multiplayer Real-time games all started with this game that made it to the No.1 game of year 1996. Most Half-Life 1 mods are decended from it's Quake modified engine and this game rocks and will remain No.1 for many years to come and its sequels.The only thing you need to be aware is using +mlook and making a autoexec.cfg file to even the odds out and making gameplay less awkward. Also you will need to update and set your OpenGL extension limit on when playing this on GLQuake mode.

Quake				* 7/10A game that represented a historical turning point for gaming.Quake is an FPS from iD software that followed Doom II. Its importance is mostly due to the technical evolution at the time of its release. Available both in software renderer and OpenGL renderer it allowed real 3d environments, items and enemies, advanced architecture (overlying floors, floating lifts, moving surfaces or floors...). Nowadays we take this for granted but for the time it was a real revolution especially the GL version that allowed a smoother graphic and a superior performance.Nowadays Quake's engine looks pretty old, with very low polys models and undefined blurry textures. Yet even nowadays there are many ports available with texture packs, improved renders and effects that allow to play this old classic with a 16:9 high resolution giving a great (and resource demanding) aesthetic experience, even though the game is over 20 years old.I wasn't forced to use those ports as the game luckily runs both with software and OpenGL render On my machine but the graphics is so old that I had to use an updated port to play (Personally I've used Darkplaces, you can see pictures in my galleries).Music score was composed by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and is made of environmental and instrumental quite heavy tracks. Unfortunately once again there's no soundtrack available in this steam release for no logical reason, luckily with ports and updates there are also packages available in the web that includes the full soundtrack for both the game and the expansions.Story is almost inexistent as in most old iD games, it's more like a context: You are a soldier or better, Ranger that has to save the earth from an alien, codename Quake, and his army that moves to places with portals named ""Slipgates"".What's more important then the story is the game's art, heavily inspired by medieval themes, so you will be exploring many locations with typical elements such as rose windows, mosaics, churches, castles, libraries, drawbridges. Even some enemies are knights with swords. Still this is an FPS so you have shotguns, chainguns (converted to nailguns, who knows why), rocket launchers and there are also enemies with chainguns, grenade launchers, ghosts, zombies, so this is not an accurate medieval reproduction but mostly just an artistic choice. +++PROs+++ FPS. This is the good old classic frantic FPS, with loads of enemies, weapons, secrets and more. Just run and shoot everything that moves and go ahead. Simple and fun.---CONs--- OLD. Quake is 20 years old as I'm writing and its age is really a visible issue. Even in GL Render models have a really low polycount and textures are barely detailed, not to mention the lack of mouselook support or 16:9 display compatibility. Luckily there are updated ports that can MASSIVELY improve the experience with new effects, lighting, textures pack, and new models (I've used Darkplaces, you can see pictures in my galleries). STEAM RELEASE. Even though there are no relevant compatibility issues, once again there's no music in this release (Same problem as in Quake 2). Luckily there are patches that bring it back both in Vanilla and Any other port release.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												Id Software's Quake is the game that popularised online deathmatches. This first game in the Quake series is inspired by Gothic-style environments, medieval settings and Satanic imagery (similar to id's predecessor, Doom). It also has been the starting point and an influence on user mods, machinimas and speedruns.Thanks to Trent Reznor, founder/leading singer of Nine Inch Nails, his music and sound design/effects for the game added to the creepiness factor of the game, other members of the band contributed to the soundtrack as well. Though in order to get the soundtrack for the Steam version, you need the Ultimate Quake Patch.Quake is also the game that the original Team Fortress was based on by John Cook and Robin Walker (who are now working in Valve).Its singleplayer campaign consists of four episodes of eight levels each (including a secret level). You play a protaganist only known as Ranger sent into a portal to defeat an enemy codenamed Quake. As you collect weapons/items, they are carried over to the next level. The higher level you reach, the more challenging and intense it becomes than the last.			",74,2,0,4,2,0,1

												1996.  One of the very first full 3d first person shooters.   combine the fast-paced action from Doom and throw in some hellish-outerworldly evil with a faint scent of medieval vibe to it while Ogre's with chainsaws and grenade launchers, undead knights and even those raptor things that spring out of the dark and rip you to shreds.   You also got weapons that that makes today's military firearms in modern fps shooters look like kindergarden playsets that you find in toys r us, such as nailguns, shotguns..even the supershotgun loads it's shells in automatically in a second, grenade launchers, thunderbolt guns (don't shoot that in the water for the love of god) and even iconic Rocket Launcher that♥♥♥♥♥♥rockets which gave great results, and also gave birth to a risky technique called ""rocket jumping""...and... that weapon made an unfortunate dumbed down return on Team Fortress 2 for the Soldier class with only 4 shots in the chamber before you have to reload.  bummer.  you don't ever reload the QUAKE rocket launcher.  EVER.The Story of QUAKE has you going through slipgate dimensions to stop this thing from sending their armies of unspeakable evil to earth.  Yea it's got that Doom vibe to it.  each set of 8 or 10 levels are all broken up into episodes and you just walk to the area whichever episode you want to play.  I'd start with episode 1 if I were you.   You just clear out each section that's crawling with hostiles, so you just shoot to kill, find any keys, and move on to the next level.  Find better weapons as you go, and kill each boss at the end of the episode and at the final boss in the game, you have to telefrag it.  You figure it out how to do that.  It's not that hard.While Doom pioneered the term deathmatch for multiplayer, Quake Perfected it and brought a new name to first person shooters involving a competition based on weapon/item/powerup pickups, player movement, map knowledge, weapon skill: Arena FPS.Unfortuntatly, there's not much people online but you can check out Quake World and other communities that are still around keeping this game somewhat live.The other thing is that the visuals are very, very outdated.  again, this is an almost 3 decade old game, but in my opinion it has stood the test of time.before you play the game, be aware the programs that come with the game are outdated and may not fuction properly on a modern OS.  You should download Darkplaces, which is a modern engine for Quake.  unzip the files into the directory of this game and just run Darkplaces.   Better yet, there is an ultimate Quake Patch you can download as well.  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923 ",223,12,9,3,8,1,4

												Historical RootsThe year is 1996. The games industry had already been presented to games like DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D but Quake take the experience of first person shooters to another level. The Game inserts you into an environment full of darkness and fallen demonic beings – all of them willing to kill you, off course. You walk – or run –  by yourself through dark and scary corridors solving puzzles, pressing buttons, dodging bullets and escaping from traps. Each new area guards a new surprise and, most of the time, you going to fell relieve when you find the last portal and complete the stage. Why play Quake nowadays? It’s simple, no one could truly respect the FPS genre without knowing his history and his historical development process. To play Quake is a prior condition for anyone who wants to set himself up as a gamer. 21 years after his debut the game remains fun and challenging – try the nightmare difficult – the sounds are iconic and, of course, the gameplay is remarkable. There’s no present without history and there’s no history without the present. Just play. ",432,90,5,35,18,4,25

												Quake's 20th anniversary is here and I started playing the singleplayer campaign again. I played Quake when it originally released and it still holds up today. Quake's legacy might be its multiplayer, but Quake 1's campaign is great. It's all about the creepy atmosphere. It's not a game where you quickly mow through legions of demonic creatures. It involves exploration and some minor puzzle solving (mostly just finding keys or pressing a panel to open a wall, etc). You're wandering around a dark, subterranean castle-like environment which is in stark contrast to the sci fi settings of the sequels. This is by far the best setting out of the Quake series and I wish they'd do a modern take on the original setting, instead of all the sci fi Strogg nonsense that came after it. None of them captured the eerie horror setting and atmosphere of the original which is a shame. There is a basic story and lore to the game you can read about, but its not really presented in the game. You don't need to read anything to enjoy the game though. Similar to how Doom had a basic plot, but the game itself just involves you navigating levels and shooting stuff.You must play this game with the Ultimate Quake Patch installed. It restores Trent Reznor's (of Nine Inch Nails) original soundtrack which was a creepy atmospheric masterpiece. To play the game without it is doing yourself a serious disservice. In addition to the soundtrack, it adds support for new resolutions. I personally don't think it needs any high res texture pack, playing it at a higher screen resolution is enough. It might look primitive by today's standards but id Software did a superb job with the limitations they had at the time.Multiplayer is all but dead. While servers still exist, good luck finding anybody to play with. I had loads of fun with the multiplayer when the game was new, the Headhunters mod was particularly entertaining. You're not going to be playing this game today for the multiplayer, but for its singleplayer where it really shines.			",155,5,2,30,11,0,41

												There could not have been a better time for a game like Quake to be launched than its own. Feeding upon the virtues and vision of Doom and Doom II, it reaches even farther confines of first-person gameplay, something it excels at, even if  compared to games of the same genre from years later. It is outstanding how well this behemoth of 1990s shooters has aged, since its frantic and well-balanced action gives way to countless reruns should the player wish to have some more of the Quake elixir. That could be explained by its advanced mechanics - quick strafing, jumping, recoil, plurality of enemies and plurality of ways to face them, among other gameplay qualities. It could also be explained by its unparalleled level design, which may very well be the game's utmost asset. Here, names such as Tim Willits, John Romero, and American McGee spring to mind. Throughout Quake's four episodes, the player is challenged with labyrinthine keeps, gloomy catacombs, unforgettable halls... all of them filled with key areas that quickly swarm with just enough creatures to keep the protagonist busy and trigger-happy at all times. The bridges, narrow corridors, staircases, secret passages, underwater ruins, all respond to the player's arrival and can be revisited in punctual moments during the progression of the stage. Not to mention that each level has its own mechanisms of completion, often related to the acquisition of keys that open gates that give way to advanced rooms in the map. Never will a room, corridor, or any piece of game space feel redundant or undistinguished, as the game will give the player a purpose and leverage to keep progressing through the areas, using each level's singular rationale. Play maps like The Crypt of Decay (E2M3), The Vaults of Zin (E3M2), or The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), and have a wee glance at how memorable level design is here. Also multiplayer, still in its baby steps back then, provided great fun with maps like The Dark Zone (DM6). It is no Tokay's Tower, but it offers satisfactory deathmatch action.This Steam version comes with four different applications that will behave distinctly depending on the system being used (two of them dedicated to QuakeWorld). Some resolution and colour issues hinder the experience more often than not, which is why the player should make sure to search for optimisation mods and patches online, such as the extremely efficient Ultimate Quake Patch v1.11, which works in perfect unison with the GLQuake application.I find it nearly impossible not to value the game's momentous contributions to an almost perennial genre. It is unique in its techno-Gothic aesthetics and its veer towards an all-Lovecraftian story - with references spanning even post-Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos bestiaries, such as the Chthonians - while staying simplistic and not bothering the player with plotline complexities, which is understandable, considering the forthrightness of old-time shooters when it comes to writing. It is heart-warming to notice that almost twenty years have not stained the delight of mouse-and-keyboard frenzy that Quake inspires.			",219,35,14,36,22,1,38

A Classic that still holds up today, and graphics mods make it even betterYea!-Classic FPS style with health/weapon pickups and no 2 weapon limit-Fast paced and fun-Gibs!-Level design you don't see at all today-Tons of Mods/levels out on the intranetsMeh!-Quite easy even on hardest difficulty as AI shows its age-Really needs to have Graphics mods to be enjoyable this day and age-Nice weapon selectionBleh!-Missing the NiN soundtrack that shipped with it back in the day-No save feature(unless i missed it somewhere) means you need to complete an act in one sitting to beat it--""edit I totally missed it the SAVE feature is listed under new game"" The Lowdown Quake is still a classic FPS that is still a blast to play today. Its fast paced requires quick aiming skills on later difficulties. The level design is top notch, which compared to todays corrider shooters which is quite sad we have evolved backwards due to the ADHD generation. While there are only 4 acts with a handful of levels each and no real story it can be a quick play for veterans of this era. But what makes up for it is there is tons of content out there for Quake so you basically have endless hours of content. Steam workdhop would be amazing if it was p[ossible.The graphics did not age  that well, along with the S#@% brown color palete will hurt your eyes. But this is quite easly fixed with a good number of graphics mods that make it on equal terms of todays indie games(Epsilon/Darkplaces). And last but not least be aware that the steam version is missing the NiN soundtrack that was on the release disk so long ago.Verdict:Buy It! ",439,123,12,73,77,7,70

												I don't know what else there is to say about Quake that hasn't already been said.This is one of my favorite games of all time.If you played it in the past and enjoyed it, purchasing this classic FPS is a no brainer at $5.If you've never played quake, are a fan of first person shooters, and don't mind changing the controls a bit to make them more modern, you need to play this game before you die.-UPDATE-As others have stated this version does not come with the soundtrack, but there are ways to get it into the game. However, if you have a disc drive and open the game with a music CD in it the game will take the tracks from whatever CD you have in there. It makes for a weirdly great experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Another aspect i like is the secrets in every level you have to find. Great retro shooter, i suggest you check it out. Not to mention bunnyhop kills are very satisfying, especially with a shotgun.

												Best $3 I have ever spent on Steam hands down. Grew up playing DOOM I & II, so this game was a welcome refresher. Never played Quake before so its been great playing through all the cool custom map packs available. In my opinion, FPS level design has regressed quite a bit when you compare it to what Quake offers. This game is what FPS should strive to be.To avoid playing this game would be an incredible disservice only to yourself.			",224,30,2,10,4,1,15

												After all these years, after the rise of Call of Duty, Battlefield, the advent of free to play, Half-Life, and the entire history of the modern FPS, Quake still more than stands up. This is a very important game in the development of the FPS genre and is often cited as the point where the term FPS was coined and the term ""Doom-clone"" was dropped. It also brought us such classic things as rocket jumping and bunny hopping.You're going to crawl through legions of Eldritch horrors which offer balanced and distinct challenges. The weapon selection is small, but well defined in its capabilities and roles.For $5, you can get currency for some terrible Free to Play or you can play one of the best FPS's ever crafted. Just do yourself a favor and seek out QuakeSpasm if you do.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

Posted: May 16, 2015
												Welcome, my goal in this particular review is to explain you that Id Software caused the destruction of Lijiang. After the success of DOOM, Id Software had some pretty big shoes to fill. DOOM was considered a milestone in the history of gayming and many many people called it the grandfather of shooters (Because f*ck Wolfenstein). It introduced new gameplay mechanics, which were unheard of at the time and therefore revolutionary. It stimulated many gamers to become a part of the newly founded PC Master Race, which was part of the plan. Back in the days, consoles ruled the gaming world. Then, out of sudden, 3 devils appeared. John Carmack, John Romero and Tom Hall. They became very jealous demons, because of the great reception of Back to the Future and Friday the 13th, both for the NES. They saw the potential of video games and the cash, they could bring you, so they decided to create Commander Keen, which should have topped even the best of the best games. This phenomenon caused multiple horrible events. Commander Keen, a Jump 'n' Run, was a great technical achievement, because of it's smooth-scrolling graphics game engine, specifically made by John Carmack. It actually managed to show that not only platform games, but video games in general could work on the PC. Back in the days, raster graphics were pretty hard to emulate, but thanks to his genius engine, it managed to keep the transfer of graphics from the main memory to the graphic card as low as possible, because the memory of graphic cards were pretty bad. Their plan for the perfect game was nearly fulfilled. They published it on the operating system, MS-DOS. Because it was Microsoft's first operating system, it had too much of Bill Gate's power to just support the game, which was John Carmack's black magic. Thus, the simulated world of Commander Keen spawned several Vorticons for a brief moment, who rampaged through the epicenter at the town Rascht. This caused the Manjil-Rudbar earthquake. This earthquake killed almost the entire population of console gamers (Their consoles too!), so the remaining ones were forced to play Commander Keen, when it became more popular because of this disaster.This event didn't get unnoticed by Bill Gates. He felt how his power, mixed with the game engine/black magic, caused the earthquake. However, Apogee Software, which published the game, confirmed his theory. He tried to blackmail them, because he knew what they had done and he also wanted the lucre of this technological monster, which they created. They had no choice, so they made the deal.Their next choice was to create the first Ego-Shooter ever made, Wolfenstein 3D. It was their next technical achievement. Finally enabling three-dimensionality with 2D Sprites.However, their goal was not only to create money, but to secure it. Only Bill Gates, Id Software or also called ""the three demons"" and Apogee Software knew of this horrible method. Bill Gates was able to control or cooperate with the three, since they were just as evil as him, but he feared that Apogee would someday gain enough money with this pact in order to beat all of them and bring back balance to the console games with the greatest console game of all time, which was part of a ♥♥♥♥ing prophecy, as always. So, Bill Gates and the two Johns decided to sacrifice Tom Hall in order to manipulate this path of the prophecy. In 1992, after Wolfenstein 3D was released, it caused, once again, an earthquake, which killed three people in California (Which is why Apogee didn't notice it). One of them was Tom Hall. Now, his fellow partners resurrected him as a new fallen angel with no knowledge of his past life. They sent him to Apogee, so they would all get amnesia from him and forget about their work with Bill Gates and Id Software. They then became 3D Realms and created Duke Nukem 3D. Later, they created Duke Nukem: Forever, which was supposed to be the greatest console game of all time, but became corrupted (Kinda like the Anakin Skywalker of video games). The hope for the console age was already demolished at this point, but the 2D Sprites from Duke Nukem: 3D, which were dark and corrupted sources, were implemented in CoD. http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ubpKUvd8NXM/0.jpg This 2D Sprite fire manipulated all the other developers in the world to create ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD clones. Only Indie Developers (because they had low power) and Valve (because Gabe Newell worked at Microsoft) were spared. Then they started to work on Doom, which should have perfected everything from Wolfenstein 3D, because they wanted to make as much money as possible, without spending too much money on creating something new. Doom was, as previously mentioned in the beginning, a sucess (Even though Wikipedia says that Tom Hall was one of the Designers, it was just an actor, who played him). Since Doom's Id tech 1 engine was just an improved version of the Wolfenstein one, it was a bit too much for the same platform/operating system they used before, MS-DOS (Now Win95). But instead of causing yet another earthquake, it just corrupted the new publishers, mainly Bethesda and ESPECIALLY Activision to spread the destruction to console games even further in the future (They basically became Bill Gate's Nazguls). The problem for Bill Gates was that the black magic, which the 2 John-Demons used for the previous 3 games, confused too much of his own power. The first real evidence for this was when he promoted Doom: 


YouTube™ Video: Bill Gates Doom 

			Views: 467,534		

			Hate Bill Gates? Love Doom? What you are about to witness is a video that has never seen the light of day outside of the Microsoft Judgement Day event on October 30th, 1995		

I mean, he even wears a coat! Anyway, he realized that he could control the black magic, which John Carmack put into his game engines, before getting trumped by it (Microsoft was the second most installed software...second to Doom). The only problem was John Romero, who was pretty much the heart of Id Software, while Carmack was the brain...and their pawns were the muscles.  He could control the brain, and therefore it's muscles, but not the heart. So the best choice was to let them create yet another game, sadistically called Quake, for all the previous earthquakes, but most importantly, for the upcoming one. He knew that the new Quake Engine would be so extremly powerful that even months before it's release, an earthquake would emerge. He guided it's direction to Lijiang, birthplace of John Romero (I mean, he does kinda look asian: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1534/15343359/262233) This attack weakened Romero so much that he went batshit insane and left Id Software, because of certain ""disagreements"". He later co-founded with Tom Hall Ion Storm and created one of the worst known games: Daikatana. This harmed the image of the PC-Gaming scene, but was soon balanced out by a hero called Warren Spector, who made Deus Ex, the best game ever made. Let's go back to the past. After Quake was finally released, Bill Gates still became corrupted, even though he had only John Carmack to control. The problem was that Doom was already a little bit too much for MS-DOS and the quake engine, with it's polygonal models and full 3D level design, a fortiori. Bill Gates knew the risk, when creating a new game with a new game engine from Carmack, but he didn't expect it to slip that much away from his hands and it was still better than creating a new game with Romero, which would have caused more horrible things. (Id Software and it's two leaders were too much of a threat to just say:""♥♥♥♥ it! I won't let you create another game!"", because video games ruled all over the world, which is also why TV tries to bring back it's reputation by blaming video games for mass shootings.) Bill Gates became completely the opposite of his past self, creating the Xbox and supporting not only Bungie or the Xbox, but the entire console age with Halo. So, at the end, the prophecy went true. The console age would return, it just wasn't directly Apogee, who caused it with their ""best console game ever"" Oh, by the way, Quake is great.			",77,2,0,5,2,0,3

It's very dissapointing to not see it included however it's still a great game and people are still playing Quake multiplayer to this day.

												Quake, twenty years on, is still an amazing game that has endured the test of time. I played it for the first time only last year and I enjoyed it immensely. The gameplay is incredibly fast and smooth--it differs itself from Dooms methodical room-clearing by being all about movement. The only way to play this game is on the hardest difficulties, when rooms filled with obsticales are littered with dozens of enemies and you're utilizing the game's fast paced movements and gravitational physics to bounce around at high speeds, doging projectiles and spraying bullets everywhere. Quake is a punishing game that rewards constant vigilance with your movement, and it's what makes the game shine. Every level is intense on an emotional and logical level, so no encounter is ever dull or boring. It's immensely rich, gameplay-wise.Aesthetically, the vistuals are naturally dated, but I think this works in the game's favor. If Doom was that excitable 80s metal head who's presence demands attention, Quake is that mid-90s industrial loner in the corner, brooding quietly. The levels are a mishmash of industrial gothic castles and cathedrals, but the atmosphere itself is a perpetual sense of nihilism and dread. The choppy and rusty graphics just work in favor of the game's visuals.This is aided immensely by Trent Reznor's work on the sound design. The sound effects are meaty, the guns sound piercing and LOUD, as they should, and grabbing an ammo box gives such a satisfying CHH-CHH sound that I can still hear it now. It's not just the sound effects either--the music is also equally amazing. It's one of the best ambient-droning-industrial soundtracks out there for video games, and the fact that it's not somehow packaged in the Steam release is an absolute shame, since I can't imagine ever playing this game without music. If you are going to buy it on here, get a CD of the game and keep it in your harddrive, or use the music pack mods. I cannot stress that enough. Playing this game without the gloomy, screeching soundtrack takes away so much to what this game already has to offer.Playing Quake is like seeing all the rings on the inside of a tree-stump for late 90s, early 2000s PC FPS games. Absolutely play it.			",218,36,1,9,1,1,1

												Quake is one of the best Id titles around. It has bad♥♥♥♥♥weapons, enemies, sound effects and music (provided by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails). It has very interesting level design that is a lot more advanced than Doom's. Each episode starts out in a military base that has a portal to other dimensions, so there's lots of variety in each episode. The enemies range from grunts with shotguns to giants who shoot lightning, there's a lot of things in between. Weapons are amazing, with sound effects that make them all seem very powerful. The weapons in Quake are all very useful for various situations, it is important to learn each weapons functionality. Armor is a very important item in Quake. You die much quicker in Quake without armor than you do in other games from this time period, so always be well stocked up on armor. My only complaints are that only the first episode ends in a boss fight, the rest do not, though the other 3 episodes are much harder than the first, still a boss fight for each rune would've been nice. Another thing, Quake has aged quite a bit, in the 90s Quake was a pretty scary game, but at least for me, its fear factor is no longer present. A Steam version only complaint, Steam Quake doesn't loop the music tracks on its own, you must use a patched EXE and rip the CD audio to mp3 format to get it to work (there is a guide on Steam about how to do this). This should not be a problem, but it is, and it seems to be a problem that plagues not only Quake, but other CD audio based games such as Quake II, Hexen II, Blood, and more. There are no achievements, which doesn't bother me but it might bother others. I have yet to try online play with the Steam version so I have no real comment, but Quake multiplayer is amazing, I hope that it works on Steam.If you like Doom, or other FPS games of the 90s, you'll love Quake.

												The original Quake is awesome, but you're going to wanna restore the music missing from the Steam version. Find the ""Darkplaces"" Engine for Quake and install it, and do a little searching for the OGG's to put in. There's a guide with all the music in the Community Hub if you poke around.

												For a game nearly as old as myself, Quake has held up VERY well. Each level is a medieval maze filled with monsters and creatures straight out of your worst nightmares who all want to kill you. Starting with just a shotgun, you collect your weapons as you progress until you have an arsenal good enough to take on anything you could encounter. As older games do, Quake doesn't go easy on you. Even on the easy levels, I often found myself in dire need of either health, armor, or ammo. Learning what weapons work best, what traps to avoid, and where to look for secret health packs is vital to your survival in this nightmarish world.For me, the best part of this game is the movement. Fast movement and the ability to bunnyhop around enemies you just can't fight at the moment really seals the deal on this excellent game.And let's not forget that a mod of this series led to Team Fortress 2, everyone's favorite game at some point. Also rocket jumping. GOD I love rocket jumping. Also install the Ultimate Quake Patch. It adds the original soundtrack and a load of other fixes to make this game even more wonderful.

												TL;DR: Best power-up, Quad Damage = max fun gibbing demons. Also telefrag = pro final boss fight.Not the very first first-person shooter ever made, but close to it! If you do not own this game yet... well, were you born yesterday?! Ask a random person if they know of Quake and nine times out of ten they will. Quake's infamy knows no bounds, and for good reasons.At its core, it's a demon slaughterfest. Run around finding keys and open up more levels  so you can blow up, pump full of shells, and even gib your enemies everywhere you find them.It survives almost all versions of Windows over the years - in many cases fans themselves find their way around compatibility problems. You are given a few choices as to how to boot up your game of Quake on Steam. Just find whatever works best for you, experiment a little. The graphics are dated but playable, even more so with new resolutions available. On the plus side framerate will never be an issue here.Enemies consist of all sorts of memorable foes: human grunts (enthralled or converted or something), vors, scrags, ogres - even yetis. Thankfully there's a nice selection of weapons and power-ups to help you wade through the carnage. Shotguns and double-barrelled shotguns, grenade and rocket launchers are all solid choices, but my favourite weapon would have to be the super nailgun. Yes, there are nailguns; a nod to Trent Reznor, who did the game's soundtrack. Why do I say this? The proof is on the ammo boxes of nails, for they bear his band's logo, NIN, better known as Nine Inch Nails.Yet, for some reason or another the soundtrack is absent from the Steam version of Quake. Never fear! A quick download and patch can fix this - in the form of Ultimate Quake. Just Google it, easy fix.I've mentioned some enemies briefly. What makes them all so special, huggable, and why play this instead of, say, DOOM?The answer is fun factor. With game elements such as a yeti's projectile lightning, vor bombs (capable of turning corners!)ogre grenades and ridiculously high and long fiend jumps, there is a far easier time of getting demons to fight each other.. So forget trying to line up cacodemon cheese-and-bacon balls with a hell knight, Quake is where you crack open the popcorn.But wait, there's more. Everyone's favourite power-up is the Quad Damage. The name is kind of hard to misconstrue. It goes without saying that they never last long enough either - once I get one I run around at top speed trying to find and kill everything in the level. Even the toughest foes flinch at a 4x damage hit from most weapons. One double-barrelled shottie blast at point-blank is... epic.Other odds and ends: great enemy sound effects, they're all unique and specific to each enemy. Some damage flinches are golden too - the knight clutching his ear and stumbling always makes me grin. Good take on zombies too - kill them with anything other than explosions and they just keep getting back up again. Proof that explosions are f***ing awesome in everything you do. I'm pretty sure their attack is picking off a bit of their own brain and throwing it at you. Ew. But I guess they don't have any need for it!Still further is the replayability. Finished Nightmare without saving and thought it was too easy? Join the speedrun community! It's crazy stuff, but great for a laugh. Rocket jumps (think: get hit by your own rocket or grenade) for boosting speed and getting to places that may seem like cheating is almost a sport in its own right.Get this classic in your library and give it a gib. Rediscover the meaning of FPS fun.			",144,138,1,51,6,0,4

 Played on Darkplaces Sourceport via Ultimate Quake patch  A DISCLAIMER Everything you are about to read is entirely my opinion, proceed with caution. Now, before an angry mob comes and chews me out. Just hear me out, alright?  My Thoughts I  personally  (as some may agree) think that Doom was a much more enjoyble experience than this. But that doesn't take away anything from Quake itself, the game is great, fast paced, definitely set the standards for the FPS games we have today, as well as introducing tricks such as b-hopping, rocket jumping, etc. Without Quake, there would be no Half-Life, without Half-Life, there'd be no Counter-Strike and so on, you get the picture. Quake was also id Software's first full fledged 3D game, everything is fully modeled. From the maps, to weapon models, and to enemies. Definitely a step up in a technical standpoint compared to Doom, kudos to John Romero and John Carmack. I appreciate what Quake is, and what id Software was going for. A kind of gothic sci-fi shooter that's episode based, much like the style of Wolfenstien and Doom. Only except you choose your skill level, and episodes in game by walking through portals, ""slipgates"" to be more precise. There are 8 regular maps in each episode, again like Doom. The soundtrack however...is meh to me, it's not bad. But it's nowhere near as memorable as Doom's, the only track I remember from Quake is the menu theme, all the other tracks are just ambience that only fit when listened in game. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack was made noneother by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. (Who happened to be a huge fan of Doom might I add), but it's just kinda strange to me how none of the other tracks really just stick to me, you know? Considering NIN puts out some really good music. The Plot Wait what? You can't be serious, you're not playing id's games for the story, are you? Ok, well the plot is very minimal. You're a guy named Ranger, you kill stuff, you travel to different dimensions, and you kill stuff and collect runes at the end of each episode, where small plot is given through text,  again  like Wolfenstein and Doom. The Enemies You'll Face In my experience, the enemies also seem to both lack, but at the same time have variety to them, you have the standard former humans you encounter in the beginning of each episode (a la the zombiemen and shotgun guys in Doom), then later you fight these demonic kind of enemies. Most common enemy you'll face mid to late game is the Ogre, which use a grenade launcher in one hand, and a chainsaw in the other, fairly easy to kill, just shoot at it until it's dead.Though, the one enemy that stands out the most to me would have to be the Zombies, you think giving them the good old one-two with the super shotgun will kill them? Think again, they're a lot more resilient than you think. You'll have to launch a grenade at them, or maybe jam a rocket in their mouth to make 'em rest in pieces. Now I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, but Mr. Dude Man Guy, what about the Shambler?!"" yes, yes. Calm down, I was just going to get to him, it, whatever. Basically this thing is the absolute most putrid offspring between the Arch-Vile, Cyberdemon, and maybe a bit of the Baron of Hell, it's very tanky (like the aforementioned Cyberdemon). It has an attack that is based on line of sight, as long as you break it, you should be fine. It also has a very strong melee attack, like the Baron's. Truly a challenge to take on. Final Thoughts Quake itself is a great game, pioneer of the FPS genre, I'd recommend this to about anyone who's willing to go back to the roots of FPS gaming (ofc Wolfenstein mainly popularized it due to its success if you want to go deeper). But seriously, it's worth the money, I'd pick it up, especially during a sale.P.S. Easiest way to kill the shambler? Follow this very easy step  shoot at it until it dies  ",133,2,0,0,2,0,2

												In a world where every FPS tries to have some gimmick to get you to buy it, you can always turn to this gem and just shoot things.The story is similar to Doom: a top secret experiment known as QUAKE goes wrong, and monsters pour forth from another dimension. You have to stop them. The monsters in Quake are well designed and have a fun eldritch feel to them. I cannot remember their names for the life of me, but my favorite is what I like to call Electro-Yeti. The action is similar to Doom, but slightly slower paced. You won't open a door and have fifty demons charging at you at once. However, everything deals more damage and combat is more visceral.It's totally worth what little money they're asking for it.

QUAKE - while this is an absolute-no-questions-asked classic FPS, I'd say only pick it up for purposes of nostalgia. If you didn't play it a decade ago, I wouldn't start now even though it has surprisingly aged well IMO compared to others of this time period. I wish the base game that I bought on Steam had more bells and whistles, though, such as higher resolutions and maybe crisper graphics. That's fine though.QUAKE was one of the few classic FPS games that helped define modern gaming. Much respect.			",561,162,5,75,79,8,72

												Yes yes yes and YES. The original QUAKE is required reading for fans of the shooter genre. I won't make comparisons between this masterpiece and modern shooters. QUAKE shines the most with its fast, tough-as-nails gameplay. The enemies are scary and merciless, not to mention pretty powerful. BUT your character has all the tools they need to blow them away. There's no excuse for failure besides the gamer's own lack of skill and nerves. Thus QUAKE forces the player to become a stone cold Cthulu @$$-kicking motherf*r and when you finally waste the final boss, the feeling of accomplishment is something I rarely feel in other FPS games.I highly recommend the Ultimate Quake Patch available in the QUAKE Steam Guides. I also recommend playing on Hard mode, maybe throwing on a little Lustmord in the background for mood. And remember:  QUAKE IS FOREVER			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that's not only aged well, but arguably gotten better with age. It's stylish, it's simple, it's a hell of a lot of fun. In what other game do you get a wild juxtaposition of sci-fi themes, anachronistic medieval environments, and demonic enemies all in the same package? If you like first person shooters, chances are your favorite fps uses a distant branch of the Quake engine and those of you who play TF2 frequently might find a comforting familiarity with the controls and weapons.The game still has an active modding community to this day, and while not as prolific as Doom, I find this game more enjoyable and a visual treat especially as the ""low poly pixel aesthetic"" is becoming popular again and has a much tighter art direction.Just be sure to get a modern engine like Darkplaces or Quakespasm. The steam release doesn't include the music so you'll have to download that. I /highly/ recommend playing with the music on as it gives a unique and chilling atmosphere to the game like nothing else.If you finish up Quake and are looking for more action, there are plenty of maps and mods to download that continue the Quake experience. One I highly recommend is Arcane Dimensions if you're looking for new weapons, new enemies, and newer, bigger worlds to explore.			",84,10,1,3,3,0,0

												I'm disappointed in this version. No music! First and foremost. Sure you can add it in with mods, but I thought bringing games to the Steam platform involved modification. It's not that hard fella's, Standardize it, that was half the reason I paid money for this again. Next there are glitchy animations, the sky never glitched in any version or source port of quake I had. My sega saturn has smoother texture animation than this port. This is basically GLquake and Winquake packaged together with the core files. No effort whatsoever. You would think with this one game being the grandfather to Valve and the entire Steam storefront operation they would pay respectful homage. No. I feel ripped off. Bad Valve, Bad Steam. No Megusta. The least you could do is make a free-to-play Quake: Source package like TF2. That would be truely respectful and fitting. Oh right, ID's basically owned and being dryhumped now though.

												At first glance, you'd probably say that you should only really play Quake 1 since it was the first ever truly 3D polygonal first person shooter.You couldn't be more wrong, since it takes Doom's high speed, fast paced gameplay, and adds an entire dimension of speed and flow to the mix you simply cannot find elsewhere, just replace demons with Lovecraftian, eldritch horrors and abominations.I don't really need to SAY anything, so much as point you to the ""Quake done Quick"" speedruns.

			Complete speedrun through the legendary game Quake. All runs were recorded separately. The runs were improved again and again throughout the ages since 1996, when the game was released.		

All this said, I wouldn't advise playing the base game since at low resolution you can give yourself a headache.

												Quake is a single-player and multiplayer FPS developed by id software and released 1996. It got quite infamous and is recognised today as classic. It was one of the first FPS to fully use polygons to create game enviroment and established multiplayer over Internet on PC.So, how Steam was handled? It's pretty straight copy-paste. Copy-paste of game folder. Not of game's CD. And that means that music is not just not working, but it's not even included to begin with! You will have to find somewhere soundtrack or music files or CD to get it back. And if mounting CD will not work for you, then I would recommend getting music files and _inmm software to fix it. And even then it looped too early. Soundtrack is quite important in this game, even though I have a bad feeling that most remember this Quake without it.Now, when you launch the game you will be given the choice between running Quake or Quakeworld. You also will have to choose between Software and OpenGL versions of each.Quake, also known as WinQuake, is actually a Windows-compilated version of Quake. There wasn't much difference. It's for both Single-player and multiplayer.QuakeWorld is stricly competive multiplayer. This client was released some time after Quake and was intented to make it more playable on low-speed Internet modems back then. Different way of handling server-client relations.Software is original Quake rendering. Pixelated, gritty and dark. Lo-fi. I recommend playing game in this mode on low resolution, like in DOS release, it captures Quake feel better than most other fans Source Port. Or OpenGl.OpenGL mode was added some time after game's release and made use of new-by-then hardware 3D accelration. And well, it's not pretty. First, it lacks some features when it comes to lighting. There is no such thing is ""brighter than grey"" and there are no special textures that are always full-bright. And then the main point of this mode if to make game look more high-resolution. By making every texture look muddy and uglier, actually. I mean, you can like such thing only if you really hate pixels.And last thing, once you start playing, write ""+mlook"" command in console, that you can open with ""`"" keyboard key. This will enable mouselook. Why it's not part of game's options I don't know, especially seeing how demos make use of mouse in such way.Plot of single-player is once again simple: There is unknown enemy that was given codename ""Quake"", who teleports it's army through slipgate. And now that your base was overrun, you have to make use of slipgate to travel to other otherwordly dimension, find out who ""Quake"" actually is through intermission text and then kick it's butt in most gimmicky way. And then watch the oh so epic bright ending in form text where you are told ""id software salutes you"".That pretty much means that you got 4 episodes to choose from beggining, you lose equpment in beggining of each one, the first level of each episode is base themed and actually has unique enemies and then you are off to medieval-like setting.And yes, when it comes to single-player, one of the best things Quake got to offer was atmosphere. Gritty. Dark. Well, ugly brown at times. you fight some kind of monsters in their low polygonal details. You get weapons like nailgun. It just has a bit of lovecraftian inspiration to it. There are even traps placed here and there. Bloody bloody traps. Soundtrack, while small, contributes a lot to it. And then there are some maps in Episode 4 which play strong on lights blinking or shadows being pitch dark, all in small rooms. Quake is at it's best in such levels. I am pretty sure that people who thought that Doom was scary back then were blown by Quake.And when you look at more gameplay side of it, well, on theory it should be like Doom but worse. It's slower. Physics are slightly worse, you stop completely upon encountering walls. There is less variety in weapons, even though they introduces grenade launcher, yet some weapons are just direct upgrades to others. Like, Super Shotgun isn't even good at close range, not as much as Super Nailgun. Just something when you run out of ammo on other weapons. There aren't as many enemies, nor as much of variety. You can say that half of Quake gameplay is shooting two rockets at the Ogre, who has grenade launcher and chainsaw. Or shooting 4 times with Super Shotgun at them. And it's too grey at times.But somehow game pulls through and becomes quite fun. Even if there are less enemies on the levels, it got quite a nice combat to it. And for a game that is supposed to be rushed, level design is great. It got verticality, it is mazey but not too complex, it just has floors on top of each other, fully embracing the fact that game is fully 3D now.You would think that first introduction to fully polygonal world would be quite underwhelming. That it will underuse it and later games will make it better. But no, Quake still has some good layouts, better than many later games. Should thank that talents at id software were still thinking in abstarct ways, didn't try to be as realistical as Build engine games like Duke Nukem 3D.It still got some weak points though. Like, Vores, spiders-like demons who shoot homing missiles. Actually, their missiles track players so good, that one corner is not enough to stop them and you can't circlestrafe around them. I don't understand what is the point, what kind of tactic developers wanted to use there. That, and game underdelivers on boss departament. There are only two ""proper"" bosses in the whole game. And when I say ""proper"", I actually just mean gimmicky ones.As for Deathmatch and duel parts, the multiplayer side, well, it's not so good. It made multiplayer over Internet more mainstream and common, yes. But the game balance, it doesn't age too well. It's only good on high-level of play, but same can be said about many games. Yes, it's not Quake-exclusive quality, don't tell me.You mostly have to dominate arena by grabbing most powerful weapons and powerups. Red Armor is better than any other armor, as it not only gives more armor points, but actually is more effective too. Rocket Launcher shoot quite fast missiles which are too quick to avoid properly. It's also most powerful weapon and most used one. Aside from lighting gun, which is good alternative too. Things die fast there.So, you just have to grab superior weapons and powerups and then go roflstomp everything else, including those who just spawned in.It gets even better once you realize that players are actively exploiting glitches in physic engine, like bunnyhopping and voodoo-like strafejumping, thigns that don't make a single sense. It become a standard nowadays, thus creating an artificial barrier between high-level and low-level players, where you have to practice much more than you should have to be as good and have some fighting chances.So yea, casuals should avoid. Normal players should avoid.You will have ot use server finders on Internet. And then chances are, there will be barely anybody playing. But then, most still play Quake for duels, so it must not be big issue.Still better than Valve's Deathmatch Classic.So yea, game's quality itself is good, but not groundbreaking. Just good game. But what made Quake so overpraised is technical side. The engine. First, it introduced console. Then it allows you to record demos, thus creating competiveness where players try their best and creating some kind of ""public"". Then when you combine it with glitchy physics, you will see how Speedrunning was created. And then multiplayer was more focused on Internet public. And even better, game allowed more modding abilities, much more than in original Doom. And then it allowed modding in multiplayer. Thus creating Team Fortress mod, for example. And Capture the Flag mode too.So, yes. Technical amazement, good single-player and finey multiplayer. This is the first Quake.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												First off, if you plan on buying this, be sure to install the ultimate quake mod so you can have the game be rendered at 1080p or higher, actually be able to look up and down and have the original ambience be restored.Anyways...An oldie but a goodie. Very fast paced, quick gameplay that has aged very well. For sure worth a look at if you're looking for an excuse to play an old game or just craving a new FPS in general. Not much to say, honestly, except for the fact that it still holds up and is enjoyable.			",276,43,2,14,16,4,13

												This is pretty much the 3D version of Doom (Well, before Doom 3 came out) so if you liked that game, you're gonna love this one. Let me tell you why:The Pros:-It has great variety in its weapons, enemies and levels-The graphics (For its time) are great-The sound effects are awesome-The controls are smooth-The game can be REALLY challenging (Especially if you play on the Hard or Nightmare modes)-The enemies are, also, challenging (Again, if you play on the higher difficulties)-There's alot of secrets you can find in the game (Much like Doom 1 & 2 did)The Cons:-There's no music for the Steam version (Thankfully, you can get a source port called Darkplaces which adds the music back in)-The game is really short if you play on the lower difficulties (Easy & Normal)-No proper final boss fight like its successor, Quake 2, didAll in all, this is a game I recommend. If Wolfenstein & Doom popularised the FPS Shooter genre, Quake would be its continuation.I rate this game a 9/10			",307,23,0,12,18,2,64

												Is this the last ""classical"" FPS?  Or the first ""modern"" shooter?  After nearly two decades I'm not even sure anymore.  All brown jokes aside, consider the following:* Graphics and lighting that have aged beautifully, unless you're an unrepentant graphics ♥♥♥♥♥.* Incredibly immersive sound design and score by Trent Reznor that beats most games today (playing SP campaign in the dark with headphones can get ridiculously unnerving)* FAST, FLUID, SKILLFUL GAMEPLAY -- YOU CAN AND WILL DIE.  BRUTALLY.And I'm not even going to talk about the mods, or multiplayer, or any of that other stuff we take for granted thanks to the breakthroughs this game made.  We all know.  It's not much more than a slight update of the DOOM formula, without ever really hitting those same heights, but I keep coming back to this game once in a while simply because - well, because they don't make them like this anymore.  There's the most grudging attempt at a story, not nearly as many enemies as you'd like, and a confusing mish-mash of design elements owing to the chaos at iD.  But it's a classic anyway, and IMO the last great iD title, because it just wants to be fun and atmospheric.  And it succeeds.Boot it up.  Blow off some steam.  Gib some grunts.  Axe a dog.

												This is one of the best games ever made, and certainly my favourite despite the huge number of other mind-numbingly awesome games I have played. Whilst the original game might not stand up in some ways to modern FPS games, its focus on simple satisfying carnage, and near total lack of a story or any semblance of realism to get in ther way of said carnage makes it one of the most pure and enjoyable FPS games in existence.The main game is fairly short, but there are so many add-on levels and mods, you could easily be playing this for hundreds of hours without running out of new content. It also supports coop play, so you can blast through the main game and various mods together, and when you get sick of coop, you play one of the first ever deathmatch FPS games. Although Doom had deathmatch, it was Quake that caused an explosion in its popularity, and through mods spawned many new deathmatch modes, such as CTF and even Team Fortress.Although there have been games since that have tried to bring players the classic gameplay focussed carnage of Quake and Doom, few have come anywhere near to the greatness of the originals. You'd be mad not to try this game if you've never played it before.Disclaimer: I played Quake from 1996 when it came out. I still play now from time to time. I don't play the Steam version, hence I don't have much recorded playtime (just played ep1 to get enough to write this review! Still fun as hell).Also, although the Steam version of the game works fine, I recommend getting hold of modern engine, such as Quakespasm to play it with. Check out the website Quaddicted to get new levels, mods and engines.			",183,28,2,13,7,1,5

But if you remember the days of fragging back when polygonal models and Internet multiplayer were new, and you haven't dusted off Quake recently... you should!The Steam version is playable as-is, but probably what you should do is take the Quake data files from Steam and use them with a ""modern"" Quake engine:

												Quake is a game that is difficult to describe accurately. It is an experience that takes everything you think you know about first person shooters gets thrown out the window and replaced by a new standard.Quake is the first truly 3D first person game, no longer are the enemies and objects in the world represented by mere 2D sprites but are instead rendered in full glorious 3D letting you view them from every angle. This also opens up the maps and up, down, left and right are now all equal and most all be checked to find that one pesky monster shooting at you.The weapons are plentiful and varied from the grenade launcher which, thanks to the 3D engine, can be used to bounce grenades off walls and ceilings to hit enemies that are hiding to the iconic lightning gun and extremely entertaining nail gun. All the weapons have excellent sound effects and animations and use them efficiently leaves you feeling powerful.Using the weapons efficiently however requires more skill than ever before, aiming in the general direction of your enemies will not suffice and only a steady mouse hand will prevail against the alien hordes.Map design is of an equally high quality with a great emphasis on atmospheric lightning and a decent about of nooks and crannies to find hidden goodies in. The multi-player maps are equally well balanced and will reward only the most skilled among you.Throughout the maps, both single- and multi-player, you will encounter power-ups that grant you various short lived bonuses such as increased damage, more health, invisibility and other good stuff. Knowledge of their locations can quickly turn defeat into victory for the observant player.Graphically there is not much to say. Quake simply sets the bar and it is up to the rest of the world to follow.An excellent soundtrack sets the mood throughout the game and creates a dark and tense atmosphere that only increases as you progress through the levels.All in all Quake is perhaps the greatest first person shooter every released simply because of how many firsts it can boast. Without it nothing would be the same and for that reason alone this is a game that no self respecting gamer can go without.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Together with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, Quake completes the unholy trifecta of classic FPS games, the ones who started it all. Truly an ageless game, few things come close to its frantic gunplay, awe-inspiring levels and horrific, if low-resolution, enemies. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already, but I do advise anyone who's ever been slightly interested in FPS games to buy it and play it, after eventually patching it with the DarkPlaces engine. It's worth your time and money and demands your respect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the epitome of classic first-person shooters. My second favorite in the first-person shooter genre, but nothing will  ever top the Half-Life series. With suffering from one problem, no music during gameplay. Maybe because of licensing issues. I'll call this one ""SilentQuake"". Some like it that way, mainly because people think it's creepier that way. Before Quake, First-person shooters especially Star Wars: Dark Forces were referred to as ""Doom clones"", despite that game being made on Lucasarts' Jedi engine.			",160,8,2,11,6,1,1

Quake is a first person shooter released by id Software in 1996. One of the earliest 3D shooters, Quake became the basis for shooters beyond it for years to come, like Doom before it. Quake was also one of the most popular games to mod. Aforementioned mods also spawned franchises that are still popular today, such as Counter-Strike and Team Fortress.Quake's artstyle is one that immediately stands out, it's very Lovecraftian, with indescribably horrifying monsters and huge creepy castles.The sound design is great too. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame was brought in to do the music and sounds, and they're absolutely fantastic. With creepy ambient sound effects, and horrific monster voices, the whole game's atmosphere is practically made by the sound design. The biggest problem with all of this, is that the Steam version doesn't contain the soundtrack, so you need to download a patch to add them back in, or simply put the original cd in if you have it.Back to the aforementioned castles, the levels largely consist of maze-like castles and fortresses filled with secrets and monsters. Powerups, weapons, and shortcuts are all hidden behind secret doors and in the shadows. The level-design overall is par for the course when it comes to old-school id, meaning it kicks major♥♥♥♥♥The weapons are pretty varied, with shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers, pretty much all the tropes that these games invented, Quake has. It has a few powerups too, these being the Quad Damage, Pentagram of Protection, and the Ring of Shadows. Enemy variety is also fantastic, with some enemies that are explosive resistant, others that need to be blown to smithereens, otherwise getting back up and continuing the fight. The multiplayer isn't really active, although it's still great for lan parties.ProsSolid, if simple, gameplayGreat map designArtstyle was original for games back then, and is still somewhat original today.Sound design on the level of games like ThiefWeapon and enemy varietyConsSoundtrack is missing in Steam version, requiring a patch to add it back in.Multiplayer isn't very active. Understandable, as the newer games have expanded upon it.Final Thoughts:Quake has a fantastic artstyle and horrifyingly awesome sound design. It's officially 20 years old as of today, and it remains one of the best arena shooters of all time.Rating: 10/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												Brings me back to the good old days of when I had a 100MHz Pentium and 8 megs of RAM...  This game is great for what it does.  It shows where 3 dimensional first person shooters came from.  Yes, one can argue that the genre started with games such as Wolfenstein, Doom, or even Duke 3D...  But fully 3D enemies and environments started here.  Back when video cards were first starting to hit the market and everything was still being done on the CPU.The CPU utilization of the game becomes apparent when you notice just how bad the animations truly are.  You'll first notice it with the dogs and the fact that their legs don't even have a full loop and they simply look silly when they run.  This is a very minor detail when you consider the game's mechanics.The motion of the player is smooth and the guns shoot as you'd expect by today's standards.  This game set a standard that was long followed up until regenerative life was put into games.  I am hoping that the Doom reboot successfully brings the arena shooter genre back.  I appreciate a good story but the action in games of this caliber can make up for all that side♥♥♥♥♥♥  Let's face it, running around with a rocket launcher as your main weapon and blowing everything up is good for your stress and all kinds of fun at the same time.

												So even to this day, there hasn't been a Quake more visually disgusting, and truly macabre. The weird psuedo-gothic horror of character themes and world designs haven't been visited since its debut, (except for Painkiller?)  really, and overall it is a must play. It was the first fully 3d fps on pc and layed the groundwork for what we have today. I will say honestly, it is still enjoyable to this date, after slight tinkering for modern desktop resolutions, is completely enjoyable. Do you even quake? If you haven't been quaking over the porcelain throne that most of all of us use, daily. this game will surely help that next bowel movement pass with ease. I first played this game when I was 6 years old, and it's just as scary as a 25 year old manchild (age of writing this review) Dat grenade launcher sound is awful, the idle npc groans and moans are truly gutteral, flatulent, and thick, like beyonce, you gotta hear it! -Donz			",102,2,1,3,7,0,9

												A real old classic in almost all of its horror glory. Only thing missing is the music which is sadly on a long unsupported and obsolete sound format. Other than that this is the same old game released decades ago, a real genuine classic and a must for retro fans. For people growing up with modern FPS games might find it challenging as this game was created in an age where quest arrows were not invented and level design decided the quality of the game.I can not recommend this game enough. Another thing worth noteing is that this is old school difficult. So don't expect your hide to be saved by auto-saves and check points when you die. And I do say WHEN. MUAHAHAHAHAHA!Welcome to Hell.			",137,20,1,42,33,0,55

												An endless classic that brought about some of the great violence and fun in horror-style shooters. Quake was yet another landmark game that really brought out talented players and a whole new style of gaming overall. The single player game brings you plenty of fun and playing the secret Nightmare difficulty really is how the game is meant to be played. If you like Lightning guns and Nail guns, get Quake now!

												Rocket Launcher + Quad Damage in multiplayer will let you experience what it's like to have the power of a God at your finger tips... until you're swarmed by enemy boomstickers into a crowded corner and blow everything within the blast radius of a nuclear strike - including yourself - to smithereens. Thus creating a downpour of fleshy limbs, decapitated heads and torsos amidst the mile high blood cascades, painting the entire vicinity into a hellishly beautiful scenery. In short: The most satisfying gib fest-simulator ever made.			",307,106,7,21,10,1,31

												Brings me back to the good old days of when I had a 100MHz Pentium and 8 megs of RAM...  This game is great for what it does.  It shows where 3 dimensional first person shooters came from.  Yes, one can argue that the genre started with games such as Wolfenstein, Doom, or even Duke 3D...  But fully 3D enemies and environments started here.  Back when video cards were first starting to hit the market and everything was still being done on the CPU.The CPU utilization of the game becomes apparent when you notice just how bad the animations truly are.  You'll first notice it with the dogs and the fact that their legs don't even have a full loop and they simply look silly when they run.  This is a very minor detail when you consider the game's mechanics.The motion of the player is smooth and the guns shoot as you'd expect by today's standards.  This game set a standard that was long followed up until regenerative life was put into games.  I am hoping that the Doom reboot successfully brings the arena shooter genre back.  I appreciate a good story but the action in games of this caliber can make up for all that side♥♥♥♥♥♥  Let's face it, running around with a rocket launcher as your main weapon and blowing everything up is good for your stress and all kinds of fun at the same time.

												Quake is a first person shooter that has you traveling through four different dimensions in search of runes that will allow you to fight the main villain. That is pretty much all the story you get and it is up to you to reach the end of each level until you retrieve a ruin and must go to the next dimension. You are free to choose whichever dimension to go to first but I suggest starting from left to right since that introduces all the weapons and enemies much more smoothly. Starting off you must walk into a portal to choose which difficulty you want and to select hard you have to jump over lava which was a nice touch. Your starting weapon is a shotgun, which sounds a lot more awesome than you may think since it is pretty much as useless as the pistol from Doom, disappointingly enough. This is a very fast paced shooter where your moving speed is swifter than that of most games sprinting speed these days, which really comes in handy when there is an enemy pouncing toward you and another is shooting grenades at you. Learning an enemy and it's weaknesses is vital to surviving as you will be under attack by several different types of enemies at once and must learn to choose which one poses the biggest threat or simply how to spot an opening. Like in Doom they will also attack each other if they accidentally hit one another, and that can be very advantageous if you have enough skill to cause the enemies to fight each other to the death, as it saves you both ammo and the risk of taking them on yourself.  It is still exhilarating gameplay after all this time and is just as fun today as it was back then.Environments are still rather acceptable and the atmosphere retains a strong horror vibe to it. Character models have not aged well at all and are rather laughable unfortunately. You will not have time to gawk at them though unless you want a chainsaw to the face. Enemies are pretty versatile since most have both a ranged and close quarters attack. An example is an enemy with a chainsaw attacked to it's arm that will use it when you get too close and a grenade launcher when you are at a distance. That is just one enemy, they usually through multiple types of monsters at you and adapting on the fly is the biggest part of winning a battle. All the enemies are instantly vastly different from one another and instantly recognizable which is a important thing in these type of games. Even a slime is more than capable of killing you if you are not careful.That same level of awareness is necessary when traversing the levels. You are in their world and if something looks to good to be true it most likely is. One thing that I found strange at first is that there is no activate button and you most shoot or simply walk into to switches to activate them. I was unsure how to feel about this at first, but risking a bit of ammo to shoot something that looks out of place and suspicious to find hidden secrets did end up being much better than pressing your face against walls and mashing the activate key like in Doom. Level design is amazing in Quake and each level somehow manages to feel different than the last. The four dimensions do end up blending together in my mind though since they don't really have any real noticeable gimmicks to differentiate them from one another. There is an extra dimension to fight the bad guy but it is a tiny level and ended up being a very disappointing fight.As mentioned before your basic weapon to fend off monsters is a underwhelming shotgun and a fire axe in case you are desperate. There is also a double barreled shotgun you come across later on but it is probably one of the most disappointing shotguns I have used in recent memory. It takes about 5-6 point blank shots to take out some of the most common enemies which makes the game feel bullet spongy  but worse still it burns through ammo which you can only carry 100 of that type. A huge disappointment after the legendary double barreled shotgun from Doom 2. Other weapons fair much better and are a lot more useful. There are two versions of guns that shoot nails and are very useful against enemies though ammo does go by quickly. Your most useful weapon will be a grenade launcher which outputs a huge amount of damage and ammo is plentiful though you will obviously not want to use it when enemies are close by.As is typical from games of this era, there are health kits to replenish your health and armor pickups that will allow you to take more damage. There are other pickups like a hazmat suit that lets you walk on hazards, a quad damage pickup that allows you to completely dominate your foes , a protection pick up that makes you invulnerable for awhile and a golden ring that turns you invisible. Turning invisible sounds cool in theory but once you fire at an enemy they can see you perfectly and avoiding them may not be the wisest choice as you may be attacked by those same enemies if they hear a battle nearby. On the topic of sound one thing that must be mentioned is that the Steam version had all the music removed. I don't know why but if you do not want to mod it back in I wouldn't even bother playing this game.Quake is still a very playable game if you can get past the dated graphics. It is unlike any other shooter released today and is an extinct brand of FPS which is a real shame. If you are buying it expecting multiplayer do know the community is dead and there are no bots so it all falls to the single player. One heck of a campaign though and it should last you about 6 hours. There is no real reason to play it again other than for fun or wanting to try the hidden difficulty mode. It is a perfect game to pick up and play when you are bored since most levels are only 10 to 15 minutes long. If you are on the look out for some fast paced FPS action or simply want to see why the Quake series is held in such high regards by most, Quake 1 is highly recommended.

												If you're wondering if you should buy Quake, I pity you. You don't know what 'frag' means. You've only played multiplayer online, alone in front of your desk. You think rocket-jumping is a stupid idea.And you, hypothetical person, need to buy Quake. It has fragging. It has a deathmatch multiplayer mode that is fast, frantic and acrobatic. And the rocket jumping? Totally practical, along with strafe-jumping, bunny-hopping, grenade jumping, and the more technical wall-rocket-jumping. Of course you should get Quake. Get four and give Quake to your friends.The world needs more fragging, and the world includes you.It's your duty as a PC gamer to at least play a game that is only slightly less important a shooter than Doom.

												This game has a few issues on steam, luckily they can all be fixed if you just take a very quick look at the forum.Everything still holds up, although there are a couple levels that are a tad dull, perhaps maybe it\'s just my personal taste, but overall the atmosphere, enemies, and levels are all very interestingly designed and you can just tell that the original development team was very excited to do all kinds of weird things with the new engine they were working with.  The levels have tons of different elements to them, constantly mixing jumping, with swimming, with playforming in some area\'s.  They really took advantage of how versatile and free your character was and makes the gameplay feel very dynamic and energetic.Great experience through and through, with 2 expansions in case you want more.  There\'s also a semi-active modding community still around, not sure if it\'s still as active as Doom\'s, but they\'ve produced some great content.			",351,51,0,25,11,2,68

												Quake: The great-grandaddy of 3D/FPS, son of Doom and Heretic, son of Wolfenstein-3D (1992) and Stellar 7 -- The beauty of Quake is that is was the first bona-fide 3D 'engine' in commercial PC games. Releasing the original Quake engine to the dev community was the move that later inspired Valve Software's Gabe Newell to release their own engine-dev environment, ""Source"", owing to the first Half-Life game being built upon a modified Quake 3D engine. (dubbed ""GoldSrc"")Quake is easily one of the most significant, if not enjoyable, shooters of all time, with hundreds of different mods (including the original Team Fortress) and is still supported by a rabid fan base. Without Quake, PC gaming would not be what it is today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is a fun shooter that's similar to likes of doom so if you enjoyed that game you will enjoy this.I had a good time playing this game for the first time since I enjoyed doom, duke nukam etc. Here's a list of things I like>>Great weapons>>Very difficult and rewarding(on Hard and Nigtmare mode)>>Enermys are tough>>Sercuts>>Graphics>>Good sound effects>>Good controlsWhat I don't like>>Steam version doesn't have the soundtrack on it(Tho there is a source port you can download thanks to raven for the heads up)>>The game was short since I did the game on normal in 4 hours tops(But longer if you tackle the harder modes)>>Sometimes the enemys are overpowered>>Swimming isn't that greatI do recommend this to old school shooter fans and FPS's ones as well.8/10			",78,4,0,6,4,0,2

												Quake came out in 1996 and is still one of the best FPS games ever made despite having virtually no plot.  It is all about the gunplay, the level design, and the encounters. And it has all of that in spades.  The actual visuals are dated, but I wouldnt want them changed. They hold up their charm well even after nearly 20 years. On top of all that, the game is moddable to your heart's desire. If you like shooters and want a well dsigned one that is just plain fun to play, then - even by today's standards - look no further.

												Not much is there to be said about Quake. I wouldn't say it's ID's magnum opus, Doom has that title. Quake is still an amazing game. It's lovecraftian horror theme mixed with the theme of a military base gone with the wind is 5spooky7me. It plays just like doom but it's grittier than doom. I recommend playing it through Proquake  mainly because it comes with mouselook as an option, Doom is meant to be played without mouselook but Quake is definitely meant to be experienced with mouselook. Proquake also comes with them great greaiphics m8.  Quake is a legend and don't bother with the rest of the Quake games. Quake 2 is not a continuation of Quake 1, it's dull, boring, and bad at story telling. Quke 3 arena has been replaced by Quake live which is free. Quake 4 is a continuation of Quake 2 and is the Doom 3 of Quake.			",183,21,1,7,8,0,3

												Quake set the standard as to what a fully 3D first-person shooter should be. Don't let nay-sayers talk smack about the dated graphics, this game's the real experience and after a few minutes soaking up the rich environments you won't even notice anythin but legit awesomeness. The sound design is top of its class, and this game just plain rocks. The original releases used redbook (CD audio) for the ingame soundtrack, so that is impossible to reproduce when selling a digital version of a grame, however this can be easily resolved. Personally I prefer UQE because this engine is extremely vanilla faithful but supports using mod files as the music sources.			",159,13,0,0,2,0,1

												Reasons why first Quake is the best current game.WARNING!:Its not my opinion,its based of facts.(Ignore down votes on this review,its from trolls)(Also my english is not that good,but i tried,so dont be a♥♥♥♥♥♥)1:Defined FPS genre.As made in the late 1996 by ID software,it was the definer of Doom.Full 3D poligonal graphics (first in fps),soundtrack and many more.1.1:Quake's engine is one of the most revolutionary engines in history if not THE most,and thats why you should ♥♥♥♥ing respect it.In 1999 ""Half Life"" was realeased,its was based on Quakes highly modificated engine version,Half Life defined FPS even more with its second and other parts,then all-famous Counter Strike was realeased which was mod for the first Half Life.Then CS:S,and now the Counter Strike:Global Offensive which is the most currently famous game (Accept it).Than Dota,TF2 (which respects quake with his ""Original"" weapon).And all this thanks to Quake.2:Its playable even from 20 years.You can say that FPS is not your thing,youre wrong!,it is,everyone will play fps no mather what.Quake is playable till this day,If you are saying that im wrong,than you are ignorant♥♥♥♥♥♥and very selfish.2.1:People who dont agree with me.Cmon man,if you dont agree with me than you are complexed and stereotype based dude.Also you are not respecting classic at all.Final Words.Kids,if Quake wasnt realeased when ur dad met your mom,you wouldnt have your favorite CSGO,your favorite DOTA 2,your favorite TF2 (im not saying that tf2s community is kids,its the best from those 3 games.).YOU DONT EVEN LIKE HALF LIFE 2 BECAUSE ITS NOT NEW.If steam was this popular in 1996,it would be the csgo replacer,Get your facts straight and respect classic kids!.That's all,you can ♥♥♥♥ off now.Proofs:http://edgecast.buscafs.com/www.levelup.com/public/uploads/images/272731_832x1501.jpghttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_enginehttp://www.gamespot.com/forums/system-wars-314159282/is-quake-the-most-well-designed-game-ever-made-32183270/

												I was just shy of 2 years old when this game came out so I never got to play it back then, but I think Quake is an example of a first-person shooter that can be appreciated by both the veterans and those new to the genre. I decided to buy Quake (and its sequels) after finding the shareware version on an abandonware site while looking for DOS games to try out. For its age it is simply beautiful. No matter how long you have been playing FPSes for, I think Quake is an essential addition to your collection. It's a game that has aged very well.			",157,15,2,4,22,2,6

												This game is legendary in the FPS genre for good reason. At the time, it was a technical milestone for its superbly impressive 3D engine (which is quite dated, of course), which would later go on to power games like Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight and Half-Life. It pioneered online multiplayer. It spawned a series of FPS's responsible for defining the genre throughout the 90's and beyond, though Quake 3 is probably the most widely-known of the lot these days. Ultimately, Quake 1 is an insanely fun, action-packed FPS that I can do nothing but recommend to everyone who enjoys the FPS genre. It's both great to see the history of the genre as well as still being an absolute blast to play.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												Do you like/play videogames?Do you like/play First Person Shooters?If the answer to any of those questions is ""Yes"" then PLAY THIS GAMEQUAKE FREAKING RULES: It is simultaneously the most important PC videogame to ever be released aside from Unreal and Doom, and at the same time one of the most pulse pounding, erection throbbing, masculine pieces of hardcore videogaming to be ever devised.  If you haven't played this game, you can't call yourself a lover of videogames.The story is.... Well WHO GIVES A HORSE?? But in case you want to know what's going on:You are Ranger: A warrior of earth who is sent by the leaders of earth through these ancient portals (Called Slipgates) into other dimentions to retrieve 4 runes and stop the evil overlord Shub-Niggurath that is controlling all the monsters that you fight. The whole story is told through the level design, and from the text and the end of each episode, just to make sure you haven't ran away to burn down your school.The art style is very reminisent of Gothic, Sci-fi, Hell, and the Occult. The whole art style feels like a love letter to the powerful H.P. Lovecraft (if you don't know him, get out and read Cthulu).  Playing Quake feels like being trapped in a metal band's nightmare of awesomness. It's dark, gritty, terrifying, and it just feels wrong. but plays so right. And it should feel like a metal band's nightmare, because Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails helped ID Software create this masterpiece. He did the amazing music, some of the iconic sound effects, and the voice of Ranger.The level design is SECOND TO NONE: This is as criptic as Doom, and every single map is carefully constructed and planned so that you feel overwhelmed on where you need to go, yet they are simple enough to navigate so that you get the feeling of being a baddass, overcoming the criptic levels. The sheer amount of effort and detail that went into these levels puts every single fps level made today to shame. Even Doom 2016's levels, while criptic and challenging, are childs play compared to the epicness of Quake. The only other games I can think of that have better level design that this are Doom 1 & 2, Heretic/Hexen, Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Unreal 1. And even then, I would say that Quake is more complex and better than all of them: the levels are not as straightforward as Dooms, nor as brainkilling as Heretic/Hexens, nor as believable or iconic as Blood or Duke Nukem 3D's; Quake's levels feel like something out of a nightmare and there has been nothing like this ever been seen since.The music in Quake is just simply amazing. It captures the whole mood of being in a nightmare, and is as iconic as Quake it'self. Just listen to this, and it sums up what playing quake is like:


YouTube™ Video: Nine Inch Nails - Quake - Main Theme 

			Views: 824,128		

			This is the main theme from the legendary PC-game Quake, released in 1996, which became a worthy follower of the id-software´s cult Doom.		

The enemies are amazing and very original too: You have to learn and memorise all their attack patterns and behaviours to overcome them, and use the right weapon for the right enemy.The weapons themselves are also metal as ♥♥♥♥: You start off with Ranger's iconic useless Axe, and a fast firing shotgun. There is then the Double barrel shotgun, and the rocket launcher, all stuff you expect. Instead of a machine gun, you have NAILGUNS: a Double barrel nailgun, and a Gattling nail gun, and the nails are not hitscan attacks they are projectiles, so you have to lead your targets. You also get a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher to kill the undead zombies, as they can only be killed by Gibbing them. Finally you have the lightning gun, which requires you to have a line of sight on your enemies to use, so you can't simply use it and duck behind a pillar, meaning you have to THINK on how you will use it.And did I mention this game is hard? FREAKING hard? Even on the easiest difficulty this game will test your skills to the bone. In fact the Nightmare difficulty is so hard that they hid it in the episode select hub. See if you can find it and takkle the ultimate challenge.This is also one of the most important PC games ever made: It was one of the first games to use 3D polygons and run itself off a computers CPU, which was mindboggling for the year 1997. It was the first FPS game to implement the WASD+Mouse controls as standard for FPS, it cemented the fast paced arena deathmatch multiplayer, and it's mindblowing idTech graphics engine created a game engine for HUNDREDS of games to use. So many iconic games today have used this game's engine; Call of Duty, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, the original Team Fortress was a mod for this, and I could go on ALL DAY.Quake is one of the greatest videogames of all time, and the aftershock of it's impact and legecy are STILL being felt to this day. Quake changed videgames forever. 5/5 An unmissable masterpiece.Still not convinced? Watch this:

												By all accords I see the first person shooter genre as something of a terrible plague on mankind. It kills millions and spares no one, its a terrible way to die but this♥♥♥♥♥♥still piles up like Mcrib orders. Its not to say that it doesn’t have its high and lows, but rather its become somewhat of a mainstay in the modern gaming industry, and a quite unwelcome one at that. In fact the industry has a become a breeding ground for generic garbage. To be honest, garbage might be too kind of a word to describe what the genre has devolved into, But that’s a story for another day buckaroo. In the case of early FPS games I can say this much, at least it felt like I was playing a game and not a dribble of cinematic boredom as contrived and cliché as Jar Jar Abrams and his infatuated fan base. But I’m getting ahead of myself as I walk down a path of that I know I cannot return. In the meantime, let us revel in what is the genius of Quake. Quake can probably be best describe as the peculiar case of taking Lovecraft, Heavy metal, and guns galore and mixing it with its own touch of Nine Inch Nail ambiance. I'm no Nine Inch Nail fan but even I can appeciate a good mind♥♥♥♥ that is the soundtrack to this game. However, perhaps that’s what stands out most about Quake… is The Lovecraft worship. No, were not talking about the sorry excuse of a Elric Rip-off style worship imbedded into the Witcher franchise, were talking about a disturbing reimaging of the idea of twisted. A twisted that crawls up your spine and pulls it out while at last laughing in your face spitting your own blood back into your eyes. Yeah a cruel sight, but I would be damned if it didn’t hit the mark and make me ask for seconds. Quake is no different. It doesn’t apologize, it doesn’t hold your hand, and it sure as hell doesn’t slow down so you can duck behind cover and whimper like a little♥♥♥♥♥♥as you wait for the guillotine to chop your sorry♥♥♥♥♥in two. You shouldn't be ducking to save your life you should be blowing your enemies into pieces to save your life. In a time where Iron sights where but a distant idea, and quick action events were nothing more than a way of describing your sex life Quake stood the test of time as a master of its craft. It’s FPS at its best, with no compromises and no Bull$*&#. You want filler, well take that crap back to anime and give it a resounding middle finger while your at it because that doesn’t exist here. This is pure mayhem and death like never before all in its own twisted world to boot. It's not here to pour out the horrors of war or to make you feel for someone its here to blast you away like a good Bolt Thrower riff. I didn't ask for a melodrama I asked for a damn game, and Quake gave that and more. To say that this is a doom clone would be a little bit of wrong misrepresentation of what is otherwise a ground breaking game in not just the FPS genre but in 3D gaming at large. I’m not here to give a history lesson but to be frank with you, this game deserves more than just praise. Quake expanded the graph from being purely horizontal to being horizontal, vertical and misdirectional (if ever that was a word) without taking a second to stop and say “well my works done here lets hit the can…”. Yeah, enjoyed the most recent entry in the Doom series (Doom 4) then you can thank Quake (and Id software who HELPED make the recent DOOM) for making what is practically an identical experience. Let’s be honest, Doom needed a little Quake to take it out of its primordial roots. No shame in what Doom started as but a facelift didn’t hurt this Hollywood failure from getting a deserving reboot. In short, Quake is to FPS what Judas Priest is to metal. It’s the ♥♥♥♥ing embodiment of FPS at its best. I couldn’t recommend this game more. Between the twisted creatures, the atmospheric environment, and a soundtrack that even Penderecki would smile in glee and lube up for... this game was FPS heaven, before cliché after anime level cliché took over the industry and Metal Gear Solid was praised as the second coming of gamer christ we had Quake. Praise the high fathers of whatever mad studio (Id studio) had the balls to do what most couldn't, make a great FPS! Sadly, we have yet to get a proper sequel to this game, and it doesn’t look promising in the future. But hell, it doesn’t stop you from going and getting this damn game. If I have any criticism of the steam version it would be simple… “Where the hell is the soundtrack?” I mean I understand copyrights a ♥♥♥♥♥, but how hard is it really to get such a thing done, I shouldn’t feel the need to make it an addition to the game but such is life. If it isn’t already obvious get this game… Better yet, get the real version of this game and enjoy you what FPS could, and should be.This is MasterOfThePit calling…“Praise to Deus Ex and praise Kek...Out”			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's not much I can say about Quake you haven't heard elsewhere. It's fun, it's dark, it's immersive, and it firmly established many of the conventions of FPS gaming we now take for granted. There would be no Team Fortress 2 without Quake, and that is why I wield the Original with pride.

It's important to know your roots in gaming, and while I got my online start in Starsiege: Tribes, my favorite singleplayer FPS of yore was probably Quake, if not Half-Life. Quake gave me my love of shotguns and grenade launchers and if an FPS cannot deliver me satisfying examples of such, then it does not measure up to my expectations for what constitutes adequate firepower. You can keep your assault rifles, throwing knives and tactical nukes. Give me a little buckshot and a little boom, and I will give you delicious interdimensional demon gibs.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												I have to admit I bought this as sort of a history lesson. I feel this is one of those games you need to play if you call yourself an fps player. None the less it is still really fun, really simple, and very challenging. This is a shooter in a raw sense and I wouldn't have it any other way. Also the Lovecraftian references are entertaining if you are familiar with some of it. If you need motivation for your character, interesting narrative and cutscenes to play a game, don't buy it. If you like shooters becasue of the gameplay, then this is a title that you should have in your library much like a scholars bookshelf should have The Iliad.			",64,10,0,1,1,0,5

												It may be fairly short (even though I'm sure Doom 2 was a comparable length, Quake just seems to go by quicker), but isn't that much better than wishing it were over sooner? Every episode I finished had me smiling with glee, while at the same time feeling regretful that I was that much closer to finishing it. Isn't that a definitive description of a fantastic game? Make no mistake, Quake came out in 1996, and while it may not hold a candle to modern games graphics-wise, it still has aged EXTREMELY well. Once you get the graphics and keymapping set up to your liking, you'll be caught up in the dark, bloody, violent, gruesome, and AWESOME explosion that is Quake. What other game takes elements from sci-fi, fantasy, some oddball Doom-esque religion, and H.P. LOVECRAFT?If you're looking for a game with tight controls, fast gameplay, creepy atmosphere, intense firefights, and GREAT music/ambience, then you've been looking for Quake.A note about the music:Due to the way the music was integrated into the original game (playing off the game CD in the drive), the Steam version does NOT include ANY music in the game. Luckily, there's a patch someone made, named ""Ultimate Quake"", that installs all the original music at the appropriate levels and times!			",79,4,1,5,9,0,0

												What's there to say? Quake is one of the earliest First Person Shooters with a fully 3D world, items, and enemies. It hasn't aged quite as well as Doom in my opinion, but don't let that discourage you, quake knows what it is doing, and does it well. This game still stands as one of the most solid FPS experiences ever made, laying the foundation for many future games in the genre. Quake plays similar to most of the original FPS games, you run around at a fast pace killing monsters, finding secrets, and collecting keys. It features the classic arsenal of shotguns, nailguns (basically machine guns), rocket launchers and more. The enemies and locations follow a medieval/dark magic theme, with a few futuristic settings here and there. This theme is pretty unique and isn't used for any of the sequels, in fact I'd go so far as to say that this game never got a true sequel. The game's music was originally played from the disc so you will need to get a patch somewhere if you want it (The soundtrack was made by nine inch nails, it's worth your time).There are some notable issues with the game however. I would not recommend playing the game as is when purchased. Go find a community made source port or patch, because it's not set up well for modern systems. It also crashes on rare occasions. One big issue is a bug involving runes. Quake has four runes which you must collect to enter the final area of the game, said runes will occasionally disappear when changing levels or respawning, this causes you to need to redo an entire episode of the game to get them back. The good news is that you can avoid this by making some extra backup saves here and there.If you are looking for a classic key collecting and monster gibbing experience, then pick this sucker up and rocket jump to victory.

												Created on the heels of the runaway success of the Doom series, Quake paved the way for the first-person shooter with its fast-paced action and graphical advancements. Fully realized 3D graphics resulted in some of the most intricate and well-designed maps in the genre's history. The feeling of running around the various honeycombed shortcuts is an unmatched satisfaction in FPS movement. Each map is made eye-catching and memorable by the game's distinct artstyle which draws from a fusion of medieval and metallic. The same can be said for the game's enemy roster, which range from laser rifle-lugging shock troopers to muscle-bound bundles of teeth and claws. Unfortunately the base game doesn't take full advantage of the diversity of its enemies, with later levels sinking into the tedium of firing shotgun shell after shotgun shell into ogres and death-knights. This is rectified somewhat by the higher difficulties, which see no problem in pitting unrealistic numbers against the player. Quake is an addicting and wonderful game at any price, and it's worth owning to understand what makes this game such a solid pillar of the genre. Now let's hope they don't give this an ill-fitting modern reboot as well...If you want to improve your experience check out some of the community guides on how to implement things like different engines and the soundtrack. The base Steam release is unfortunately lacking in some areas, and the work getting in fixes can be well worth the effort.			",68,8,0,3,0,2,1

												This game is beautiful and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Not as much as Doom, but a close second. This is a retro shooter with mouselook. That is great. It handles and plays well and feels amazing. It has aged very well and on a modern gaming PC will play at a buttery smooth 100+ frames per second (please note that this is just a guess and that I have not actually measured it). By the way, the command for mouselook is +mlook1 (which you type into the console).			",91,7,0,12,11,2,4

												This is still after all these years the game I run to when I need to have fun.  ID still pretty much owns the genre of ""I just want to kill everything with this giant gun, flick a switch, find a key, find a new gun, and kill some more.""  I still love Doom, Wolfenstein, and the rest of the Quake series; but playing the original Quake - with Trent Reznor's awesome soundtrack pumping behind the cacophony of explosions, zombie moans and chainsaw wails - takes me right back to the summer when the demo came out (THANK YOU PC GAMER) and my father and I ran to the store that night to buy a computer fast enough to play it.

												It may be fairly short (even though I'm sure Doom 2 was a comparable length, Quake just seems to go by quicker), but isn't that much better than wishing it were over sooner? Every episode I finished had me smiling with glee, while at the same time feeling regretful that I was that much closer to finishing it. Isn't that a definitive description of a fantastic game? Make no mistake, Quake came out in 1996, and while it may not hold a candle to modern games graphics-wise, it still has aged EXTREMELY well. Once you get the graphics and keymapping set up to your liking, you'll be caught up in the dark, bloody, violent, gruesome, and AWESOME explosion that is Quake. What other game takes elements from sci-fi, fantasy, some oddball Doom-esque religion, and H.P. LOVECRAFT?If you're looking for a game with tight controls, fast gameplay, creepy atmosphere, intense firefights, and GREAT music/ambience, then you've been looking for Quake.A note about the music:Due to the way the music was integrated into the original game (playing off the game CD in the drive), the Steam version does NOT include ANY music in the game. Luckily, there's a patch someone made, named ""Ultimate Quake"", that installs all the original music at the appropriate levels and times!			",79,4,1,5,9,0,0

												A good shooter from the 90s, with graphics that are a little (ok, VERY) dated now, but with good sound design in terms of overall presentation. Actually, speaking of presentation, this game has a large quantity of brown and grey, and does seem a little ugly. But it's a part of the style, so I won't complain. The gameplay (being the most important) is what you'd expect from a shooter, but the locales and enemies keep it interesting. The difficulty is varried, but fair given that you can use quicksaves/quickloads. Again, no complaints on this front, What I will complain about is the story, it's a hodge-podge of vague text boxes jammed in your face before and after every level that I don't even remember half of. But the game doesn't really suffer for it, the gameplay is what we're all here for, and like I said, it's fun and functional to play, and I definitely recomend it... unless you're bothered by dated grapics.8.5/10			",74,13,1,14,14,0,9

												released by id Software on June 22, 1996, Quake was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash and John Cash. The level and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero and Tim Willits. The graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud. Music and sound design was by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame.The game engine developed for Quake, the Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the 3D game genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications (mods).

												Do i really need to tell you how good it is ?I won't talk about how important this game was to gaming as a whole, with it's innovative, revolutionary, previously unseen tech  and addictive, genre defining, balanced multiplayer that created a stone solid community which is still strong today, and united gamers around the globe.But i think, because of all that, it's singleplayer was overshadowed and somewhat underrated, it has best fps design i have seen in a game to date. Yes i know you may say: -But, Duke nukem 3d...  and to that i say: -no, i am sorry, it's not even close. This game is atmospheric, to the degree that it would make Lovecraft proud. The soundtrack is creepy, and if fully immerse into this world, it's so unworldly it becomes scary, i am genuinely terrified and scared when i play the game, not that it has jumpscares, it barely does, there's something sinister about everything surrounding you. Help...And yes i see, the state steam sells this game is terrible, but please Download Quke ultimate patch, it resolves all the issues, at least it worked perfectly for me. you should find it in web or steam guides. Yes it even fixes soundtrack. 9/10 one of best shooters, much, MUCH better than duke nukem 3d and/or Quake 2.			",100,13,1,13,8,2,6

												I own the original shareware release disc, also own another compilitation boxed release but had a fiver sitting in my steam wallet so figured eh why not lets buy it again here.Now for a really goodtime get some friends on a server, load up a level with some water and then grab the lightning gun and have a pool party. Take it a step further and install 3wave CTF and go for the BM+quad combo and really see how fast people get gibbed. Goodtimes, goodtimes, remembering the joys of hearing that sound and running your♥♥♥♥♥off in the other direction until the timer on it expired.  Then while you're at it get the original TF mod also, maybe throw in some Future vs Fantasy for a real good time since the 4 runes from 3WCTF just weren't enough.  Sadly now now in 2016 you can't really enjoy the joys of this original release while playing on the net with a server of hpb and lpbs' mixed together with the original netcode.  300/200ping vs some sub 100/50/20's oh hell yeah those were good times indeed. Ugly by todays game standards yet who cares as it was/is fun to play still.			",43,3,1,5,0,2,4

												Quake.If you’re here, the odds that you know what Quake is are pretty significant, so this review might seem a little (or quite a bit) pointless.But, Quake has a special meaning to me – Quake and I go way back, it being one of the first games I would ever play, along with Half-life and Doom. I still remember those days, zipping around those moody corridors and those dank, decrepit hallways, filling everything that moved with as many rounds as my 6-year-old hands were able to pump out... Before inevitably dying at the hands of some monstrosity, of course.Sure, I wasn’t good at it by any conceivable degree, but damn, I still loved it. It was more than just a game to me, the environment, the enemy design – it all came together to create an experience that I just can’t seem to dig out of my head, not that I would ever want to. Even now, I still feel that urge to boot it up and shoot something.I can’t promise that your time with Quake will be anything similar to mine, and you may find it to be dated, uninteresting or dull (and, in my opinion NONE of those things can define Quake). But to me, Quake will always be there, flashing through the back of my mind, making me feel the same way about it as I did 12 years ago, and because of that, I have no choice but to recommend it.

												A true classic FPS. It's a must play for anywone who has played a game with a first person camera. Sure, the graphics are ugly and envirements suffer from ""BROWN SYNDROME"". If you look past that though you find amazing enemy designs and places. There is nothing like shooting lovercraftian monsters in a gothic castle. The combat is fast-paced like DOOM. No wimpy cover systems here! Each enemy is dynamic and intresting. Giant monsters with only a mouth and brutal claws that shoot lighting, to leaping monsters who jump at your face. Sadly, the weapons are weak. That does make each enemy intimidating though. 10/10 MUST PLAY ",67,6,0,2,3,1,3

												Thanks, valve germany for letting me write this.Quake is id software's other FPS giant that co-created the online-FPS with all its beloved tropes. Quake offers four episodes of fast-paced, exploration based, pre-2000s FPS-glory. Despite its grim, colourless visuals, Quake plays in a much more engaging way than modern products of the genre, with its medieval/lovecraftian inspired style and ambience coupled with fast-paced movement and gunplay, it can be easily classified as a 3D Doom.However, like Doom, Quake was originally meant to be run on MS-DOS, so you might require a source port for a more convenient (or let alone executable) experience. My biggest recommendation would be the darkplaces engine, you can download it for Quake 1 as well as its expansions in this link http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923Quake remains one of the most popular retro-FPS games for good reasons, it still holds up as a fun and challenging arena shooter for both singleplayer and multiplayer.It's basically Deathmatch Classic if it had a singleplayer and a right to exist.And yes you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is where Kindergarten Fortress 2 came from.

												I hard to figure out what should I say now... This is old game, original debuted in 22nd June, 1996.  I guess those players have bought this game who have played this game before, and now they are enjoying nostalgia. For the same reason I bought this game.  About the game: The gameplay is really simple; collect guns and ammos, shoot at anything, find the exit.  But, why did I recommend this game? Because of the atmosphere! This game has an atmosphere what I have not seen in others game yet. The sounds, the design and the silent mysterious. I think those things gives that great atmosphere to the Quake universe.  I advice if you are thinking to buy this game, see a few gameplay video of Quake. Good things: -Mystery atmosphere. -Simple gameplay. -It has online and local Co-op mod.  Bad thing: -Only a few hours gameplay. (in single-player mod) -The game does not include original musics. (you can solve this, read below)  Solve music issue: If you need the original music and little bit better graphic quality, then you must download and install [Ultimate Quake Patch].  


Ultimate Quake Patch 
A Guide for Quake
By: MOOK

			This patch utilizes the DarkPlaces engine developed by LordHavoc, the plasmagun fix by OoPpEe, the music patch originally hosted on widescreengamingforum.com and the NSIS install system developed by Nullsoft.		


Only one thing bad! After you installed this patch you must disable the Steam-overlay on this game, otherwise the game will be frozen.  I recommend this game those who want a lazy gameplay for a few hours and those who want a little bit nostalgia.  P.S. I apologies of the Quake fans for my review have not been absolute positive. I wanted to be objective.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

Shoot and try to stay alive, yeah that's a good advice.now these days it's rare to see some games that use this mecanic, your ennemies are not the average soldier who asks how do i shoot correctly ? but these are FU#CING lovecraftian monster, who wants to kill you.Maybe the graphics could be old for some peoples, but for other peoples, its alway fresh to see the good old msdos graphics, and some gory kills.did i mention the great sound design and the excellent soundtrack by trent reznor from NINE INCH NAILS,who give you some chills and oppression.I give to this game a note of A+/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The king... no, the GOD of first person shooters! This is the genre-defining, timeless masterpiece of a game that was released back in 1996. The first true 3D engine, amazing music track, horrifying monster sounds, unrivaled smooth gameplay, complex level designs, do I need to say more? You choose a difficulty and get right into the action! A must play for everyone.Oh and kids, THIS is what a FPS is. Don't get fooled by the unfortunate mistakes that are called ""games"" nowadays.P.S. There are some mods that drastically improve the graphics, and since the game is very old, some users might want to take advantage of those, even if only to play on HD resolutions. But I am sure anyone can enjoy this classic even in its purest form.			",472,91,8,55,30,1,69

I will never get tired of this game, it was sent to us by the gods of FPS and they have only one task for us,that being: PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET THE QUAKE MARATHON BEGIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",39,0,1,1,2,0,9

												in modern video games, you always have questions about violence, choice between good and evil, thinking about the life of a digital character (like undertell me about what is good in that game plz ?)dont be triggered guysQuake give you this answer... Shoot and try to stay alive, yeah that's a good advice.now these days it's rare to see some games that use this mecanic, your ennemies are not the average soldier who asks how do i shoot correctly ? but these are FU#CING lovecraftian monster, who wants to kill you.Maybe the graphics could be old for some peoples, but for other peoples, its alway fresh to see the good old msdos graphics, and some gory kills.did i mention the great sound design and the excellent soundtrack by trent reznor from NINE INCH NAILS,who give you some chills and oppression.I give to this game a note of A+/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is a amazing game with it's addicting multi-player, and revolutionary style of gameplay, remember this was the first ever true 3D FPS game. This game blew everyone away at the time because people were use to Doom and Wolfenstein 3D then suddenly a nuke detonated in PC gaming when this game showed it's existence. However it is not Quake the game I would like to talk about it is the steam version, it is exactly the same with the only downside being no ingame music like Half-life instead you had to still have the CD to play it's epic ambience, there is a solution though once you get The Ultimate Quake Patch, and if you do not like the look of the game grab the darkplaces engine but also take it for easy server connection. 8/10 93%			",115,5,0,6,2,0,2

												Doom's Big Brother.This is the heavy hitter of id Software's library. Quake is an evolution not just for FPS games, but games as a medium.In Quake, you fight through 4 episodes of Adrenaline pumping action, much like Doom, albeit with a much much MUCH darker atmosphere. The game is quite a lot faster than Doom, with Speedrunning being quite popular with the game. Gameplay remains unchanged from Doom. You move through the levels, killing everything in your path, then leaving via exit. The game doesn't have many bosses, only really 2 (End of Episode 1 and the Final Boss), but the encounters are memorable. The enemies are all interesting, and frightening, with such enemies as the giant Shambler, Ogres that hurl grenades at you, and Fiends that claw you into bits.The maps are inspired by several dark fantasy influences, notably that of H. P. Lovecraft; most notably, the end boss of the first episode is named Chthon, and the final boss is named Shub-N iggurath, although there is little resemblance to the original literary descriptions. Some levels have Lovecraftian names as well, such as the Vaults of Zin or the Ebon Fortress. The original Quake runs on DOSBox, but you have the option to run GLQuake. Regardless of which version you want to play, make sure you look for source-ports, such as Quake Epsilon, or FTEQW to name a few to play the game at its max potential. The games soundtrack ran off of red book cd, so look for the Ultimate Quake patch as well if you want the great soundtrack as well (100% must install.) Also look for multiplayer source ports as well because the Quake community, like the Doom community, is still alive and kicking.Quake is as great as Doom is, with darker tones, and faster gameplay. If you enjoyed Doom, or just wanna play an arcadey fps, Quake is the game for you.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												Quake is a FPS game made by id software and released in 1996. it stood put among the FPS or ""Doom Clones"" at the time for a few notable reasons. It was fully 3D, had smooth animations at complex (for its time) level design. But how does it hold up? How does it play for a first time player? The awnser to both is amazingly well.Game:The game is set across 4 different dimensions. This causes each of the four episodes to have its own unique location. The weapons are plentifull and fun to use. The line-up includes grenade launchers, nail guns and a lightning gun. The only problem I had with the game was the two bossfights. They didn't require shooting, but pressing buttons. You may have to shoot you way to the buttons, but the bosses themselves doesn't require one bullet to kill, which really sucks. The games difficulty is on the heavy side. I played on normal and found the difficulty what I would expect on hard with other games. Respect to the people finding nightmare enjoyable and finishable..Technical:The game works out of the box with the steam version, but there are a few issues. The controls are not as smooth as modern FPS games. The soundtrack ran off a cd, that means no soundtrack for the steam version. the resolution is really low (Doesn't bother me but can bother you). To fix all three issues mentiones above (The only technical complaints I had) I used the Ultimate quake patch. It uses the DarkPlaces engine developed by LordHavoc, the plasmagun fix by OoPpEe, the music patch originally hosted on widescreengamingforum.com and the NSIS install system by Nullsoft. The Ultimate Quake Patch was compiled by (as I understand it) MenaceInc.I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE!!P.S. Don't forget to download episode 5. Its calles DOPA and was developed by Machine Games (Who did a amazing job with Wolfenstein the New Order and Wolfenstein the Old Blood) for quakes 20th birthday. It has te same old school design and if it was included with the original game, I wouldnt have know that it wasn't id that made this episode.I can't think of higher praise for DOPA. Get it if you get Quake. It was released for free. To install it you just have to create a dopa folder where quake is instelled, extract the zipfile in the folder and double click the batch file.

												Odds are you already know if you like Quake. It is by far the defining title of the FPS genre (after Doom and Wolfenstein 3D). The Steam version comes with WinQuake, GLQuake (which never worked for me), and QuakeWorld (which didn't work for me either). Mods and a still thriving multiplayer base makes this game worth buying even today.			",214,44,3,25,18,0,25

Yup, I'm pretty much the grandaddy of fast paced deathmatching and fragging your friends over the internet, why back in my day we had Quakeworld and that Gamespy thing those kids seem to love so much used to be called Q-spy! That's right! A whole industry sprang up around me! And now look at you kids and yer gosh darned military shooters! Yer precious hats and yer ingame stores! All them fancy graphics and DLCs! But you go on! You have a good ol time! I'll be here, I'm always here because good games never die, they just fade away.....			",319,32,9,82,28,2,71

												It's the mac daddy king from the original O.G.'s- id software. Doom was like Hiroshima and then Quake was like BOOM, How you like that!?!? Doom is still brought up to this day in congressional hearings about video game violence because it was the first stand-out mainstream game to be so realistically violent and evil with upside down crosses and pentagrams. Quake was sweet like that too. You are not a real, true old school gamer unless you can admit that this game was the original king before Quake 2, Quake 3, and all this new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you kids have nowadays. LONG LIVE QUAKE!

												Awesomeness in 5 letters :)Here is a more updated review, as requested by Butane:Note: I had to cut my review, most notably at the end, because apparently Steam only allows so many text. That is the reason there is no modding and sourceports 'chapter' are limited. Sorry for that.Quake is a first person shooter or FPS developed by id software, released in 1996.Originally planned to be released way earlier (it was mentioned in Commander Keen as a follow up) aimed to be a Magic&Melee type of game. The name for the game came from the protagonists name, Quake.Quake was presented as ""The most dangerous person on the continent, wielding a hammer of Thunderbolts, a Ring of Regeneration and a trans dimensional Artifact, fighting for justice""This idea was later scrapped for a more 'id software' approach, which is of course, an FPS.Quake's development was rough. Because of the 3D technology they were going for, it took John Carmack a full year to make the engine. What didn't help either was the release of games like Duke Nukem 3D, which used the Build engine, a very advanced 2.5D engine for its time. Carmack wasn't impressed by it though.When the engine was finally finished, the guys at id could finally work on the game. Sadly, the tensions were high and lots of work was wasted. So was originally a Dragon planned and a lot of other stuff. John Romero was absent a lot as well. This resulted in John Romero being fired from id after the game was released.In short, the game was rushed.In Quake, you play as a character named Ranger. Quake is the codename for an unknown enemy using slipgates (fancy word for teleporters) to send all sorts of monsters to earth. As a part of a special forces team, you have to use the slipgates to travel to Quake and kill him! Only problem here being, your team is killed off quickly and you are the only one left to fight. You have to collect 4 runes, 1 in each episode, to open a slipgate to the final boss. Thats the story in a nutshell.The gameplay is similar to previous id titles. Kill bad guys, find secrets and keys, collect supplies and exit the level. Simple stuff. After 7 levels, you have the final level where you can collect a rune, resulting in a bossfight and the exit to the level opens once you've defeated the boss. Each episode has a secret level as well. But while in Doom you could have 10 or more enemies on screen, with the new 3D engine every monsters is fully 3D. This had a large impact on performance. So in Quake you have a maximal of 5, maybe 10 enemies on screen. To compensate for this, most weapons are a lot weaker. (Than say, Dooms weapons)Speaking about weapons, you have 7 to choose from:The Axe, Shotgun, Double Barreled Shotgun, Nailgun, Supernailgun, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher and Thunderbolt.- The axe is your basic melee weapon. Does little damage against enemies but has unlimited 'ammo'.- The shotgun is your basic hitscan ranged weapon. It fires 6 pellets, doing 4 damage each. It can kill a basic grunt in 2 shots and a dog 1 one shot. Uses shells.You spawn with the shotgun, axe, 100 hp and 25 shells when you start a new game and in multiplayer.- The super or double barreled shotgun is a better shotgun. Uses 2 shells and does more damage, but only effective on close range (whilst in basic shotgun has pretty good range)- The nailgun is a projectile based weapon, firing nails (duh) rapidly. It can be seen as your basic machine gun. Uses nails.- The supernailgun is the nailguns bigger brother. It has a higher firerate, does more damage and uses 2 nails for 1 shot.- The grenade launcher need no explanation. Oddly enough, it uses rockets for ammo.- The rocket launcher is pretty self explanatory, just like the grenade launcher. Uses rockets.- The Thunderbolt is the games most powerful weapon. Being a gun that shoots out lightning, it uses cells as ammo and can even kill the biggest foes in a matter of seconds. As a counter to this power, cells are pretty rare and pickups yield only few cells. Warning: don't fire this thing underwater, its totally.. Lets say, ridiculous.To spice up the gameplay, you have so called powerups. These are items that last a short time and give you a benefit.Powerups are:Quad damage. 4 times the damage for 30 seconds for every weapon. Gibbing time!Ring of shadows: invisible for 30 seconds. Sneak past monsters and players alike!Biosuit: with this, you can swim in slime without harm and it provides oxygen underwater as well. Lasts 30 seconds.Pentagram of protection. Invulnerable to any incoming damage for 30 seconds.Other powerups include armor, ammo and keycards.But what are these weapons and powerups worth when you have no bad guys to shoot? Luckily, there are plenty. I'll go over them really quickly, I promise :)Rottfish. Piranha on steroids.Rottweiler. Annoying dog.Grunt. Basic soldier.Enforcer. Basic soldier Mk. 2Zombie. You can't kill the undead, but you sure can blow it into giblets!Ogre. Uses a chainsaw Evil Dead style and wield a grenade launcher.Scrag. Floating enemy that shoots projectiles.Spawn. Slimey, jumping thing that explodes when it is killed. Episode 4 exclusive.Knight. Uses a sword.Death knight. Knights bigger brother. Comes with a projectile based attack as well.Fiend. Leaps toward you to use his sickles upclose.Vore. Mutated spider that launches homing rockets.Shambler. Big♥♥♥♥♥guy that has a lighting and melee attack.There are two bosses as well, which I'm not going to spoil :)Quake offers 4 episodes from the get go. Each episode has 8 levels, making for a total of 32 levels. (Final boss level and introduction level not counted)When you start a new game, you start off in the introduction level. It offers 3 slipgates, offering 3 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal and Hard. There is a 4th difficulty, Nightmare, but it is hidden in the episode selection.Selecting a difficulty leads you to the episode selection. From there you can select 1 of 4 slipgates to play that episode. After a episode is completed, that particular slipgate is locked off, meaning you completed it, since you collected the Rune.The first levels of each episode are the easiest levels. You start off in a military base with low level enemies like Rottweilers, Grunts and Enforcers. These levels are often my personal favorites, since you can see they put the most effort in them. (And I just enjoy fighting the soldiers.)After you completed all episodes, and thus collected all the runes, the gate to the final boss opens.One thing Quake is really well known for are the sounds and the soundtracks. When Doom came out, the band Nine Inch Nails got addicted to playing Doom. When they heard of Quake, Trent Reznor wanted to do work for id.He did created a lot of sounds and the legendary soundtrack. His sounds range from the voices of the grunts to the pickup sound for armor.Quake's soundtrack is really unique. It offers a more ambient horror theme than the usual id metal. With Quake being a dark and gritty game, this really sets the mood.Its hard to describe this on paper, but I suggest you go and play Quake or listen to its soundtrack at night. Back in the day, this really made people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants whilst playing.Note: Quakes soundtrack does not come with the Steam version, since it ran off an CD. Don't fear though, there are tons of patches for the soundtrack. A quick Google search will do the job. SourceportsTo run Quake on a more modern system a sourceport is recommended. I use DirectQ personally.Quake didn't became big for its singleplayer. It was the multiplayer that really gave Quake its legacy. I'm not going to go really deep into the multiplayer, since I mostly played singleplayer. Sorry :/TL:DR:Quake, a great game for its time and even nowadays. Rushed, but still very impressive. A classic id software title thats really worth picking up!			",68,2,0,0,3,0,0

												10/10this game is so well designed I was really surprised, because I played it in 2014 for the first time and didnt expected this level of quality. Everything in this game makes sense and fits very well, there isnt much you could take out without killing the experience. Every weapon has its place and situation where its good at (except the weak nailgun, but since you loose all your weapons every new episode you still use it).I especially like how the guns feel. The shotgun for example has this deep sound with a quiet click sound after it and when you hit enemys with it they make a sound and cancel their attack. This makes the gun feel like you really shoot something and hurt the enemys. I cant really describe it.The levels look similar but thats because of the age of the game, they still look interesting and dont get boring.The soundtrack is extremely well and isnt some random metal music like in Quake 2 but only atmosspheric music which really fits the game and sometimes even creeped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.ATTENTION: The game doesnt come with the soundtrack, install the Ultimate Quake Patch which not only fixes the music but also improves graphics and animation quality.

												Trent Reznor.....not that it matters mind you. There is no music included with the Steam Version.Amazing, fast paced, run-and-gun FPS gameplay from the mid-90s. An ID software classic with awe inspiring gothic theme. Quake is all about an invasion of Earth by Shub-Niggurath (a cthulhu like being which resembles a Dark Young) via a series of slipgates created by humanity in an attempt to create teleportation technology. A lot like DOOM when you get right down to it. This is Gothic though, DOOM was more or less......well hellspawn. Without this game there would be no Half Life or Call of Duty. Period.

												What I like about the very first Quake is its very gothic and satanic, its as satanic as Doom where you fight demons and monsters from hell. Its very similar, but the difficulty is not that hard like Doom. But i do like the movement in the game. Highest difficulty (nightmare, which is a secret mode), will only increase enemy speed movement and reaction, life damage should be the same (i think, or it may add more damage). What i know for sure, they dont respawn after killing them, so if you are smart on tactics, you should be able to find a way to find a room to take a breather from all the pressure on killing, unlike Doom where in highest difficulty you have little chance to breathe from, and dont have much time.

												     This game is the base of every modern FPS. This game was revolutionary for many reasons. One of these is the amazing Team Fortress mod (which I still play to this day), also its engine was the same base engine of all gold source games (Day of Defeat, Half-Life, TFC, and more), plus this game was one of the first FPS, and one of the first to have online multiplayer. I might not of played Quake ""back in the day"" but I can tell that it is still a amazing FPS and more people need to rejoin its amazing online multiplayer. I highly support this game and belive it is a gold mine of gaming history.-John			",105,6,0,3,5,0,0

												- Note that I've played at least 10 hours via a launcher that doesn't add to Steam playtime -I never played the original Quake until I got it this year so I don't have the whole nostalgia thing but even so this is it, when action games had effort put into actually making them fun and engaging with actual areas to explore and decisions to make before becoming more about hand-holding and empty spectacle.There's some weird stuff like the Super Shotgun and Nailgun just being flat upgrades of the non-supers and hit detection with some enemy attacks being a bit off, but...that's kind of it. Sure it's simple but everything works so well. This is a damn good shooter far better than most despite being two decades old now. The age sort of works to its advantage in a way, it can run on just about anything, there's a good number of levels in the main game and a history of loads of mods and maps, with people making more even today. Machine Games who did the awesome Wolfenstein reboot actually made a free level pack recently which is pretty kickass.Every fan of action games, especially those who've mostly only played recent ones should play this.

												This game fun. But... it has some issues. Like,the visuals. It's hard but it is fun. It is so mutch like the Half-Life series, in the fact that it is hard, and challenging. I would recommend this game. The controols are w,a,s,d and to look up you have to press,delete. To look down you have to press page down. to look around you use the mouse. umm... just fiddle around with the settings. Atliest untill you get the perfect play settings for you . :) ENJOY THE GAME PEOPLE!!! IT IS THE FIRST, FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!!! So give it love.			",45,9,0,5,7,0,0

												Trent Reznor.....not that it matters mind you. There is no music included with the Steam Version.Amazing, fast paced, run-and-gun FPS gameplay from the mid-90s. An ID software classic with awe inspiring gothic theme. Quake is all about an invasion of Earth by Shub-Niggurath (a cthulhu like being which resembles a Dark Young) via a series of slipgates created by humanity in an attempt to create teleportation technology. A lot like DOOM when you get right down to it. This is Gothic though, DOOM was more or less......well hellspawn. Without this game there would be no Half Life or Call of Duty. Period.

												What I like about the very first Quake is its very gothic and satanic, its as satanic as Doom where you fight demons and monsters from hell. Its very similar, but the difficulty is not that hard like Doom. But i do like the movement in the game. Highest difficulty (nightmare, which is a secret mode), will only increase enemy speed movement and reaction, life damage should be the same (i think, or it may add more damage). What i know for sure, they dont respawn after killing them, so if you are smart on tactics, you should be able to find a way to find a room to take a breather from all the pressure on killing, unlike Doom where in highest difficulty you have little chance to breathe from, and dont have much time.

												     This game is the base of every modern FPS. This game was revolutionary for many reasons. One of these is the amazing Team Fortress mod (which I still play to this day), also its engine was the same base engine of all gold source games (Day of Defeat, Half-Life, TFC, and more), plus this game was one of the first FPS, and one of the first to have online multiplayer. I might not of played Quake ""back in the day"" but I can tell that it is still a amazing FPS and more people need to rejoin its amazing online multiplayer. I highly support this game and belive it is a gold mine of gaming history.-John			",105,6,0,3,5,0,0

												- Note that I've played at least 10 hours via a launcher that doesn't add to Steam playtime -I never played the original Quake until I got it this year so I don't have the whole nostalgia thing but even so this is it, when action games had effort put into actually making them fun and engaging with actual areas to explore and decisions to make before becoming more about hand-holding and empty spectacle.There's some weird stuff like the Super Shotgun and Nailgun just being flat upgrades of the non-supers and hit detection with some enemy attacks being a bit off, but...that's kind of it. Sure it's simple but everything works so well. This is a damn good shooter far better than most despite being two decades old now. The age sort of works to its advantage in a way, it can run on just about anything, there's a good number of levels in the main game and a history of loads of mods and maps, with people making more even today. Machine Games who did the awesome Wolfenstein reboot actually made a free level pack recently which is pretty kickass.Every fan of action games, especially those who've mostly only played recent ones should play this.

												amazing and timeless game, but I recommend playing it on a sourceport (see: community hub guides, they'll explain everything for you) instead of the winquake or quakegl executables that come with the game. Also, Machinegames released an additional fifth chapter you should check out after playing through the original game. Multiplayer servers are still active, although I'd recommend nQuake/ezQuake for the best possible experience there. Lastly, if you go to the quaddicted website you can find some really amazing custom campaigns that modders still release up to this day. I've spent about 10x as many hours on this game as my steam hours show because playing some of the sourceports won't log your hours on steam, and after all that time spent I can honestly say this game is tons of fun even today			",111,8,3,5,1,1,5

												I have to admit, this game's starting to grow on me.That doesn't mean I'm ignoring it's flaws though.The BadFirst of all, because of the game's poor optimization for modern PCs, you have to set the resolution EVERY.  TIME.  YOU START THE GAME.  And the max resolution is only 1280 x 720.  Also, to enable the ability to look vertically and diagonally, you have to press ` to enter the game console and type in ""+Mlook"" and to get the crosshair back, you'll have to type in ""Crosshair 1"".  Again, you have to do this EVERY.  TIME.  YOU ENTER THE GAME.This port also does not come with the game's soundtrack which many people are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about, BUT honestly I think this is a good thing.  The atmosphere is impressive and honestly the lack of soundtrack really brings that out.  And while the soundtrack is amazing, I still say that the game is better off without it.  It just doesn't really fit in for me.Also, there's something I have against the enemies and weapons.  Whilst there is a lot of them and they are rather entertaining, the game seems to have a strong habit of constantly throwing fat shreks with chainsaws and grenade launchers in literally every corridor, and it gets really samey and repetetive at times. With the weapons, I can't help but feel like some of them are completely worthless.  For instance, you start out with the shotgun on level 1, and you progress onto level 2 and all of a sudden you have the Double-Barrel shotgun, which is basically Quake's faster version of DOOM 2's Super Shotgun which immediately renders the normal shotgun completely worthless.  Some would argue that DOOM 2 did the exact same thing yet I disagree; the normal shotgun in DOOM 2 had much more range compared to the Super Shotgun and still did a decent amount of damage, but the shotgun in Quake becomes completely forgettable with it's apaulling amount of damage against most enemies in the game.  Hell, the exact same thing happens for The Nailgun and the Grenade Launcher!  They all get replaced by more powerful copies of their own self, a la the Super Nailgun and the Rocket Launcher.  This was just my thoughts on it though, you guys probably completely disagree with me.  I just feel as though they could have made some of the weapons in the game actually worth something and not have to be thrown away as completely useless later on.And what the ♥♥♥♥ is the story?  Am I just some dude in some weird places killing random living creatures native to the area because he's a psychopath who enjoys blood, gore and murder?  Until you lot give me the full story, that's what I'm going with.Also, the graphics occasionally give me headaches.  Just sayin'.The Good♥♥♥♥♥♥/div>Right, I like the gunplay, it feels really great.  Actually, the combat in general is really satisfying (minus the melee weapon, the axe) through and through.  The enemy design is really creative, especially for the zombies and each map, despite all having the same atmosphere, all feels unique and different.Like I said, the atmosphere is brilliant.Also, that ♥♥♥♥ing Shambler.  The ♥♥♥♥ing shambler.  Scary af.So overall, despite having ♥♥♥♥ loads of flaws as of today, Quake still remains to be a fun game and of moderate challenge.6/10Still though,

												Judging from single-player alone, the game is a typical id shooter but it was more of a tech show for John Carmack and team's highly sophisticated new 3d engine. Multiplayer is still alive in some circles and I can see why. The weapons are the least interesting aspects when compared to Doom and Heretic but atmosphere, level design (be proud John Romero) and sound are top notch for their time. If you like shooters and don't mind the dated graphics, this is a classic well worth playing. Just don't expect anything TOO epic here.			",492,214,5,51,25,2,32

												And... lightning does in fact strike the same place twice.If you like, you could just read my DOOM review, swapping the word QUAKE for DOOM. But that wouldn't be fair.iD managed to produce another industry changer, a scant three years after DOOM was released. Whereas DOOM brought 3D gaming to the masses and made multiplayer something that people felt should be included as standard, QUAKE raised the bar even higher.PC Gamer certainly helped QUAKE along, thanks to including the shareware episode on their coverdisc. So those people not lucky enough to have fast internet access could still join in the fun.I think at the time, QUAKE was even more of a global sensation than DOOM was, but with hindsight I think it's fair to say that DOOM shook things up more than QUAKE did. But only just. A lot of QUAKE's legacy is thanks to the addons and patches which quickly followed the main game.QUAKE proved that smooth, fluid, entirely polygon-based games were feasible and practical. Suddenly, all the sprite-based FPS games that were being released looked incredibly dated. Not their fault - nobody but iD saw it coming. Duke Nukem 3D had been released just one month before iD pushed their tech demo out into the world, and everybody knew something big was coming.If DOOM made multiplayer gaming on company LANs the next big thing, then QUAKE made internet deathmatches the in-thing. Quakeworld which followed later on in the year greatly improved and streamlined this service so even those with dial-up connections could participate.GLQuake greatly improved the graphics for those lucky few who had these new-fangled 3D accelerator cards - suddenly everybody was buying Matrox and Voodoo cards just to play the new, improved QUAKE.And if people thought DOOM was expandable, QUAKE blew their minds. Not only could you make levels, you could make new models, new sound and music, and even rewrite parts of the code to make entirely new games (QUAKE Chess anybody?)Personally, QUAKE is not my favourite FPS. Not by a long shot. I don't think I ever even finished the single-player campaign. But I can't deny it's influence, and it is amazing to see what they did with the hardware at the time.

												As an enlightened, modern parent, I try to be as involved as possible in the lives of my six children. I encourage them to join team sports. I attend their teen parties with them to ensure no drinking or alcohol is on the premises. I keep a fatherly eye on the CDs they listen to and the shows they watch, the company they keep and the books they read. You could say I'm a model parent. My children have never failed to make me proud, and I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest family in the USA. Two years ago, my wife Carol and I decided that our children's education would not be complete without some grounding in modern computers. To this end, we bought our children a brand new Compaq to learn with. The kids had a lot of fun using the handful of application programs we'd bought, such as Adobe's Photoshop and Microsoft's Word, and my wife and I were pleased that our gift was received so well. Our son Peter was most entranced by the device, and became quite a pro at surfing the net. When Peter began to spend whole days on the machine, I became concerned, but Carol advised me to calm down, and that it was only a passing phase. I was content to bow to her experience as a mother, until our youngest daughter, Cindy, charged into the living room one night to blurt out: ""Peter is a computer hacker!""As you can imagine, I was amazed. A computer hacker in my own house! I began to monitor my son's habits, to make certain that Cindy wasn't just telling stories, as she is prone to doing at times.After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking, I confronted Peter with the evidence. I'm afraid to say, this was the only time I have ever been truly disappointed in one of my children. We raised them to be honest and to have integrity, and Peter betrayed the principles we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities. His denials continued for hours, and in the end, I was left with no choice but to ban him from using the computer until he is old enough to be responsible for his actions.After going through this ordeal with my own family, I was left pondering how I could best help others in similar situations. I'd gained a lot of knowledge over those few days regarding hackers. It's only right that I provide that information to other parents, in the hope that they will be able to tell if their children are being drawn into the world of hacking. Perhaps other parents will be able to steer their sons back onto the straight and narrow before extreme measures need to be employed.To this end, I have decided to publish the top ten signs that your son is a hacker. I advise any parents to read this list carefully and if their son matches the profile, they should take action. A smart parent will first try to reason with their son, before resorting to groundings, or even spanking. I pride myself that I have never had to spank a child, and I hope this guide will help other parents to put a halt to their son's misbehaviour before a spanking becomes necessary.1: Has your son asked you to change ISPs?Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict ""No Hacking"" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider.I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to ""adult"" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites.2: Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under ""Install/Remove Programs"" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes ""Comet Cursor"", ""Bonzi Buddy"" and ""Flash"".The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to ""download"" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding.3: Has your child asked for new hardware?Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request ""faster"" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer.If your son has requested a new ""processor"" from a company called ""AMD"", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, ""knock-off"" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.4: Does your child read hacking manuals?If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds.There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: ""Snow Crash"" and ""Cryptonomicon"" by Neal Stephenson; ""Neuromancer"" by William Gibson; ""Programming with Perl"" by Timothy O'Reilly; ""Geeks"" by Jon Katz; ""The Hacker Crackdown"" by Bruce Sterling; ""Microserfs"" by Douglas Coupland; ""Hackers"" by Steven Levy; and ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" by Eric S. Raymond.If you find any of these hacking manuals in your child's possession, confiscate them immediately. You should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves. You may meet with some resistance at first, but even booksellers have to bow to community pressure.5: How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the ""command prompt"" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day.6: Does your son use Quake?Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school.If your son is u			",197,33,5,10,19,1,5

												Im a big fan of the origional Doom game, and I think it's safe to say that this isn't as fun as Doom. Theres a strange lack of music and the gameplay just feels slow. I'm not sure really what else to say. It's not bad, it's just kinda....meh. I baught this game origionally because I heard there's a new Quake game coming out and I thought that I would give this a try.There was no in between option for wether I recommend it or not.

												I'm really not sure why this is on Steam when the Nine Inch Nails Soundtrack has been removed. It's understandable that the developers can't completely get the rights to the tracks, but if the music is going to be absent it may as well not be in the library at all. I've heard some people like it without it anyway as it adds to the atmosphere, but taking a feature out of a game just ruins the experience for me. Unfortunately the same fate happened with Quake II on here.			",82,5,4,17,1,0,1

												Most of the games today, have good graphics and a sh.it or don't even have something you can call a gameplay..well, back in the day of 1996 where Quake was firstly released, games had in the monocle of today a ""not so good"" graphical engine, but they had a gameplay where you needed ""skill""..I mean..              look at the timeline of the DOOM games:Take the first doom and compare it to the 4th from today..DOOM (1993):A very tricky to hardcored gameplay with a lack of ammunition and strategic well made maps with very good kept secret rooms and a frantic atmosphere.and of course:     YOU NEEDED A HELL LOT OF SKILLDOOM (2016):A game with a bit of the frantic atmosphere from of the original game, but with less lack of ammunition..    I mean..WTF ID-Soft?!    Back in the day, you had to kill as much demons with as less shots you could, to save ammunition because ammo packages were excitingly rare, compared to todays DOOM where you just have to chainsaw one lil' less demon to get a full ammo supply laying all over the place to keep on tearing yourself thru this game with the non-skill this game actually uses..WHAT THE ACTUAL &%!?#/I could have been sitting a five year old re.tar.ded kid with a parkinson syndrom in front of that screen to complete that game in less than 5 seconds..      ARE YOU SERIOUS?!Anyway..    this was just an example of how games changed over the years..BACK TO QUAKE!Well it was, it is and it will be still one of my favourite games of all time, whether somebody complains about the graphics or not!Thumbs up, nice game!

												As much as the game is fun, it's not worth the headaches it gives you.  Just to run at 1080p, you have to install some confusing mods. The game says that you can modify the resolution through the command prompt, but that crashes your game. On top of all this, this version of the game doesn't even have the soundtrack. Seriously? WTF man. You shouldn't sell quake without its soundtrack, because that is just grade A autism right there. Gameplay:10/10Bugs/problems are what kill this classic for me though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is like Doom except the physics feel much nicer and you can jump, aim up and down and there's an increased emphasis on movement in general. The trade off is that there's smaller groups of enemies (rarely more than two at a time) and they're all a bit more bullet-spongey. The weapons can also be a tad unimaginative (no BFG here, just a gun that shoots lightning and chews through it's max amount of ammo in seconds).A lot of people dislike this game's visuals for relying a lot on the color brown. Personally, I don't mind this, as I feel that the more complex lighting and architecture of the maps (compared to Doom) compensates for this. That and the crappy low-poly monster models (that are still surprisingly well animated) combine with the rusted look of the game to create a wonderful aesthetic of low-tech creepiness. (I'd compare it to Silent Hill, but no part of Quake is ever set in a foggy town in the countryside - though there is at least one user-made map set in Innsmouth.)This game also has excellent sound design by NIN's Trent Reznor. Don't bother with that EpiQuake junk, the game's audio is perfect enough as it is ... and on that note, I have to explain exactly why I'm giving this a thumbs down, even though I've just been gushing about the game.It's because the Steam version doesn't include Trent Reznor's ambient soundtrack that Quake played off it's CD as in-game music. Unlike Hexen, there aren't any MIDI tracks or anything for the game to fall back on if the CD is missing - just nothing. The in-game sounds of wind and flickering torches are slightly more audible, and that's as good a compromise as you get.Now, I can understand the absence if it was a rights issue with Reznor, but that supposedly wasn't the case. Apparently, it was because when id put the Steam version of the game together (which runs in DOSBox) they couldn't figure out how to simply rip the tracks off the CD in OGG format and configure DOSBox to load those files in lieu of redbook audio. Maybe John Carmack was too busy working on his new engine for whatever that game no one cared about was called.Regardless, get Quake if you can find the original CD release on the cheap - which you probably will, as it's not a particularly rare game, nor one as valued by collectors as Doom (though be careful not to buy a  shareware version by accident). Alternatively, wait and see if this ever shows up on GOG.com - as those guys will probably put more effort into a basic digital release of this game than it's own developers.------------------TL;DR, Quake is a very good game, but don't buy it here or you will get a version without music.

												Quake is a classic FPS that, alongside Doom, helped Id Software codify the genre. How, I don't know, because Quake is an unbelievably boring game.The game's plot is, ostensibly, about fighting the Lovecraftian Old God Shub-Niggurath as she does... things. Which are bad. Quasi-demonic invasion from beyond the veil of space. As a Lovecraft fan this would seem rather encouraging... if in practice the game had any real plot at all. In practice the game is almost gleefully self-aware in how much its plot is a thin excuse to commit mass murder.Quake's ""story"" is broken up into four Episodes, of which I have admittedly only played the first two. The difference between the two seems to mostly be the upgrade of a single enemy type, and a slightly different wall texture. Any actual plot developments are mostly limited to easily-missed text blurbs at the end of each Episode, which mostly just seem to foreshadow the final boss.Gameplay-wise, Quake is a tedious, linear run-and-gun set in an endless parade of largely identical brown hallways against the same five brown enemies (with a few exceptions, like the odd miniboss and the very rare ""Base"" levels featuring soldiers and dogs, all similarly brown), in levels that offer no trace of setting, motivation, or purpose besides a playground to kill things on. The entire game could be proceedurally generated and you'd never notice.The combat itself is rather annoying. You're equipped with three main ammo types throughout the game - shotgun shells, nails, and rockets - and have two weapons for each, the second being a straight upgrade of the first (except for the grenade launcher and rocket launcher, which have different firing methods with different situational uses). In theory this weapon selection is servicable, but in practice it's rather lacking. Shotguns are the mainstay weapons of the game, probably to minimize the need to actually aim. Nailguns are vastly more effective weapons, basically being automatic weapons that have a degree of aim-assist to them, however their ammo is considerably more sparse and is burnt through much more quickly.None of this is really a dealbreaker, the truly annoying part is that this game is old enough to have multiple floors overlapping one another, but functionally lack the ability to look up or down. Star Wars: Dark Forces had a similar conundrum mostly solved by the fact that most weapons would aim up or down for you in a limited cone, and your enemies had similar limitations. However, in Quake the most common enemy by far is the Ogre, a stocky brute with a middling level of health and equipped with a chainsaw and a grenade launcher. Bullets shoot straight, but grenades arc with gravity and bounce around corners. Cue every single level filled to the gills with Ogres on high ledges where as often as not you can't hit them, but they will gleefully pelt an endless stream of grenades down on your head.Don't make the mistake of me blaming my dislike of this game on it's difficulty. I died plenty, but I'm describing the game's combat as ""annoying,"" not ""difficult."" Quake's uncomplicated setup makes it difficult for anything to become legitimately unbalanced, but managable does not mean fun. And when you take combat that isn't particularly fun, a plot that barely exists, and repetitive, bland aesthetics, you get a game that has essentially no merits to recommend.			",101,21,0,17,4,0,1

												EDIT: Yeah, that's right you salty lot, downvote this since it doesn't make you happy. I leave an honest, HELPFUL review about my settings so the developers can read this, and that the game doesn't work despite trying the settings they suggest in-game. But by all means, tell me my info isn't helpful since it's probably just negative to all of you.Upon starting the game and putting the resolution up to 1024, the game proceeds to run poorly. Tried the other mode but doesn't give me the option of changing video unless I go into the console, in which it won't accept any commands. I have a GTX 1080, so yes, I have enough power.Real shame, was hoping to play this milestone. But I'm not going to a low resolution when the game provides higher and gets choppy (on a game that's 20 years old).			",221,39,6,15,14,3,6

												The Quake Series -  These games focus on Gameplay and they do it well.  Fun weapons, fast gameplay, rocket jumping, and mosters from knights to demons.  Always focused on speed and Mutiplayer Gaming.The Original Quake did not age as well as the other Quake games with regards to animation and level design.  I played it recently and did not remember the levels being so... lame and the animations so square.  How I loved shooting the guns in Quake.That being said:  This game and some of the other Quake games really pushed the FPS genre into mainstreme and as a competetive sport.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

I know it says I only played quake for like an hour, but that is because i used the darkplaces mod, which I also highly reccommend. In short its an awesome shooter made my the awesome guys at awesome id software who soak up each others awesomeness.			",136,7,2,11,5,2,7

Even if your not used to this kind of game give it a chance, the gameplay is solid, just like Doom, and Duke Nukem. i Highly Recomend this game. Also dont worry if you dont like playing with a keyboard and mouse, u can use pinnacle game profile and setup a xbox 360 controller to this game. a controller feel quite comfortable with this game.

Sadly the music is gone in the Steam version, since it was CDA on the actual game CD back then. Hope they bring it back into the game... that would be AWESOME!			",275,15,2,29,11,0,16

												The thing is, most big budget shooters like Call of Duty have set the example for shooters, but they have set a bad example that has lead to the downfall of the FPS genre. It is actually kind of sad, really, to see that games like this one just aren;t made anymore. Quake ism prime example of a game made in a time when gameplay was put over graphics and story, which is how it should be for most FPS. One of the very first FPS rendered in true 3D graphics unlike games before it like Doom, Quake is filled with run-and-gun action, a variety of weapons and enemies, and John Romero's amazing level design. Sure, the graphics are certainly arcadie, but that is what gives the game it's charm. Unfortunately, the graphics and animations are a bit grainy on the steam version when compared to, say, the Dark Places source port. Another problem is that the music is misiing from the steam version, which isn't neccesary to enjot the game, but it would have been an nice addon. Overall, this game will give you far more action than almost any other shooter out there, and for a low price of 10 dollars, Quake is a game everyone needs to play. You are not a true FPS gamer if you haven't played Quake.			",62,2,0,7,3,1,1

												Quake has a lot of the fast paced action and neato weapons that are missing from a lot of single player FPS experiences these days, and its influence on a handful of titles overtime really shows. I'm going to inject a controversial opinion though and say that the game kinda gets monotonous toward the end. The enemies stop being enthralling around then and hunting for the keys feels more like a chore than anything in a game where you shoot lods of dmones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can't beat the classics, Quake is no exception. This game is pure, agonizing fun filled with low-poly gore that is sure to entertain. As you fight your way through demonic hordes while gleefully rocket jumping into the chest cavities of your enemies, you'll be filled with a sense of euphoria that only Quake can give.12/10 If this game were a pizza, it would be a pizza that I would never forget.

												Quake is one of the best FPS videogames I have ever had the honour of playing, initially I felt that the campaign was too short I realise that I first did a run-through of this game of the Easy difficulty, which may alter the playing time.

												The thing is, most big budget shooters like Call of Duty have set the example for shooters, but they have set a bad example that has lead to the downfall of the FPS genre. It is actually kind of sad, really, to see that games like this one just aren;t made anymore. Quake ism prime example of a game made in a time when gameplay was put over graphics and story, which is how it should be for most FPS. One of the very first FPS rendered in true 3D graphics unlike games before it like Doom, Quake is filled with run-and-gun action, a variety of weapons and enemies, and John Romero's amazing level design. Sure, the graphics are certainly arcadie, but that is what gives the game it's charm. Unfortunately, the graphics and animations are a bit grainy on the steam version when compared to, say, the Dark Places source port. Another problem is that the music is misiing from the steam version, which isn't neccesary to enjot the game, but it would have been an nice addon. Overall, this game will give you far more action than almost any other shooter out there, and for a low price of 10 dollars, Quake is a game everyone needs to play. You are not a true FPS gamer if you haven't played Quake.			",62,2,0,7,3,1,1

												Quake is one of the first FPS games that is fully rendered in 3D.  Now it is more of an interactive museum piece than an entertaining game, but still has a little charm for those who really fell in love with the FPS genre when it grew big.  The guns are creative and semi-traditional, as well as the enemies.  This is also one of the first games to offer enemies that will fight each other when they get caught in crossfire.  This game also was one of the first games to be openly modded, but most mods have not been carried over from the past.  Multiplayer mods have to be downloaded separately from the base game.  I still enjoy this game once in awhile, but this is one of those gems that is simply more hard rock than actual diamond.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake has a lot of the fast paced action and neato weapons that are missing from a lot of single player FPS experiences these days, and its influence on a handful of titles overtime really shows. I'm going to inject a controversial opinion though and say that the game kinda gets monotonous toward the end. The enemies stop being enthralling around then and hunting for the keys feels more like a chore than anything in a game where you shoot lods of dmones.			",143,15,2,17,4,3,4

												This game is fast-paced, frantic, loud, nervewracking, and a ton of fun. All of the weapons are fun to use and inventive, ranging from a most manly shotgun to the Fickle Finger of God...I mean, the Lightning Gun. The levels are well-designed deathtraps forcing you to think quick on your feet and rewarding you for exploration and skill. Quake is tough, but never made me want to rage quit during my entire playthrough of the game. All in all, this a game I can recommend on a whim to anyone who likes fast-paced old school shooters, but I should add a note to this review: If you are going to play this game (and you should, it's fantastic), you would do well to get a source port to play it on (I play Quake on a source port, hence the 1.8 hours on record). The version on Steam has no music, which is an integral part of any game's atmosphere and feel, Quake in particular. In addition, if you like eye candy (and if you have a beefy enough rig, why wouldn't you?), source ports are the way to go in that regard. You can get the necessary files right here on Steam, and for $10 USD, I don't see how you can go wrong. Quake is more than just a relic of a past era, it's an enduring classic that still manages to compel a jaded modern gamer like me to play it for hours on end. Give it a spin, if you haven't already.			",90,8,3,8,3,0,3

												Excellent level design, movement, weapons, and music.  Truly a wonderful classic shooter. I used the Quakespasm sourceport to play this and had no issues. I used ""Simple Quake Launcher"" to start the game instead of using Winquake (renamed the file to ""testapp""). I also use Quake Injector to download user maps, and you can play the game from there too. To me these are the best ways to play this on modern computers. Darkplaces is a fine sourceport too, but the fiend enemies are a bit glitched from my experience.			",117,2,1,6,2,0,2

												The Good old days, it surprised me how much I still love the hell out of the old days FPS games. It's been so long since I last played Quake, it shows why these games where so popular back in the then.I guess I will pick up on playing some more old skool FPS games after this one.It might look very dated, it still plays awesome, especially with an extra engine like Quakespasm.Just remember that no one will hold your hand, like in most modern shooters, no checkpoints. Quick saving at the right moment, saves you from having to do a large part over.But be warned a wrong quick save can screw you over as well :PIt's a shame that console gaming mostly destroyed what was once a standard for FPS games.

												This game still stands as a unique, abstract shooter with a thickly-dark atmosphere.   No storyline; just a series of demonic mazes and fast action.  I lost much of my youth caught up in the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Gameplay-wise, it's a  basic but smooth formula.  It offers a challenge that is purely skill based; not just on your aim; but your timing, prediction and almost gymnastic movement around the levels.I still think it's a technical marvel.  This was one of the first full-3D games; and the levels are deliberately vertical and abstract in their design.  Everything has long since been open sourced; as a coder it's intriguing to inspect the design from a kind of archeological perspective.When starting, you're given the option to choose which executable to run;  QuakeWorld (which was its brilliant online version - though surely not noob friendly), didn't work for me.   Perhaps with some technical tinkering you can get this to work.  (It was never straightforward back in the day anyway)I've tested the GLQuake option, is the hardware rendering option, this works without any issues.  I'm sure there are mods out there that improve the experience, though.Gamers today will probably never feel the same sense of awe and wonder and compelling multiplayer gameplay as we did when it released.  I'm kinda glad that games have moved on though, this game has a slightly discomforting pull, like it's almost half-living, a demon demanding my return.   As a skeptical atheist, it's beyond disturbing.My time with this game is done;  it was a strange friend that was always present, but I hardly miss.  It still quietly haunts my subconscious to this day.   Damn.			",69,15,0,12,6,0,16

												This game still stands as a unique, abstract shooter with a thickly-dark atmosphere.   No storyline; just a series of demonic mazes and fast action.  I lost much of my youth caught up in the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Gameplay-wise, it's a  basic but smooth formula.  It offers a challenge that is purely skill based; not just on your aim; but your timing, prediction and almost gymnastic movement around the levels.I still think it's a technical marvel.  This was one of the first full-3D games; and the levels are deliberately vertical and abstract in their design.  Everything has long since been open sourced; as a coder it's intriguing to inspect the design from a kind of archeological perspective.When starting, you're given the option to choose which executable to run;  QuakeWorld (which was its brilliant online version - though surely not noob friendly), didn't work for me.   Perhaps with some technical tinkering you can get this to work.  (It was never straightforward back in the day anyway)I've tested the GLQuake option, is the hardware rendering option, this works without any issues.  I'm sure there are mods out there that improve the experience, though.Gamers today will probably never feel the same sense of awe and wonder and compelling multiplayer gameplay as we did when it released.  I'm kinda glad that games have moved on though, this game has a slightly discomforting pull, like it's almost half-living, a demon demanding my return.   As a skeptical atheist, it's beyond disturbing.My time with this game is done;  it was a strange friend that was always present, but I hardly miss.  It still quietly haunts my subconscious to this day.   Damn.			",69,15,0,12,6,0,16

												Well, QUAKE. There is probably nothing more to say. One of THE best games of the golden era of ego shooters. As a child I wasted so many hours, alongside with DOOM, DUKE NUKEM and TYRIAN, it's unbelievable. It has'nt lost any of its flair and charme. I even play it on a crappy sofware 640x480 solution, since I played it that way back than. Almost twenty years? Holy f! Didn't hurt this game in any way and it aged beautifully!This game is and always will be a 10 out of 10 for what it is: A masterpiece!Unfortunately, the soundtrack from NINE INCH NAILS is not included. Thanks,  Steam. As usual. And the mission packs are excluded and I needed to buy them seperately. Thank you, Steam.Such a thing would not have happened on GOG (Good Old Games).In the meantime, Quake is available on GOG, WITH the soundtrack, WITH the mission packs and even cheaper than this version here.

												For this Steam edition, be aware that you don't get any music at all in Quake. Apparently there is a work around, but when one purchases a game they should get the full content.  Otherwise, all seems to be well in the delivery of the game.Quake itself wasn't quite all the gaming public had hoped for back in the mid 90s.   The music, visual design and action seemed quite dull compared to the hell-ride that was Doom, whilst the ""full 3D levels"" didn't seem to impress as much with competition from console games such as Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider - which both offered smooth character animations where Quake's creatures-from-the-abyss were very jerky...That said, this game still manages to be a mile stone in gaming history.  Its multiplayer culture was massive back in the day and for years to come, and somehow, there is a gritty and creepy menace to the games characters - the jerky animation is actually a strength in this regard.  While Doom was Id's finest hour, Quake is still a highlight for the Texas-based developer.  Go grab a horror/action soundtrack CD from an old film and set it running before loading up Quake, and you'll be pleasantly surprised how delightfully nasty this classic game can be...Oh, for those wondering how to look around with the mouse; open the console and type ""+mlook"" and press enter.

												""Classic"" is an overused term in gaming.  Because to be classic, a game must catalyse a revolution in style at it's time of release. To be classic, a game must transcend the simplistic outcome of entertainment and  become a canonical representation of both the gaming industry and the zeitgeist. It must raise the bar inalterably. Even by this dizzying standard, QUAKE stands aloft as perhaps the game most deserving the title of ""classic game"" in the history of the medium.Continuing id Software's epochal hewing of the FPS out of the shapeless mass of code in the 1990s, QUAKE springboarded off of it's cousin DOOM and formulated the rules of the Shooter that remain strictly enforced today. With being the first of it's kind, QUAKE is a game of absolute purity and speed. Slick as a razors edge and twice as sharp: you can almost feel it's surgical incision as you traverse it's beautifully functional level design, weild it's mathematical precise weaponry and do battle with it's unprecdented opponents.Reading this, QUAKE may come across as more of an algorithm than a game. But it's biggest feature, as well as it's best one, is it's heart. It is clear that the game is a labor of passion created by geniuses. QUAKE's aesthetic finds itself in the deepest recess of a Lovecraftian nightmare, playing host to ornate keeps haunted by demonic servants of a dark god. When pitted against overwhelming and brutal hordes of monsters clearly on their home turf, QUAKE is a game that will surely send a twang of fear up the spine and a shot of adrenaline into the heart of all gamers, regardless of their tenure.So, as a gamer, you owe it to yourself to experience this paradigm changing piece of art. If you fancy yourself a Warrior-God of Shooters who feels that you can best any challenge that the industry has thrown at you in the proceeding 20 years, play it on hard. If you're a maniac, play it on Nightmare. Or if you just want to know what all the fuss is about, simply play it. Live it. Let it absorb you like a dark, swirling apocalyptic sky.All hail the legend that is QUAKE.			",138,3,1,9,2,1,14

												Such an Iccon of its time and every bit as groundbreaking as Doom was. This is where MP deathmatch began with the likes of Doom and Quake. The Singleplayer level design is built in such a way that it is always fun to explore. The levels are riddled with secret passages, areas and even secret levels. Modern games could learn a lot from games such as these when it comes to level design. The sounds are just as creepy as I remember them. The success of Doom 2016 shows that these types of games are still very playable with modern graphics. I very much hope that a new singlepayer Quake campaign will happen in very much the same way as it did with Doom. For fast paced twitch shooting and fun levels... you cant get much better than this!			",42,5,1,8,1,0,1

The labyrinth stages, the plethora of monsters, KICK♥♥♥♥♥weapons, the Lovecraftian art style all blend together to create an enthralling experience. The gameplay (with a couple tweaks here and there from the amazing online community) is just as fresh as it was back in 1996, and just as surprising and challenging.

												The obvious stuff-A great FPS, I'll say. Better than most choices these days, but IMO it doesn't beat its sequel or Unreal. Why is that, for me anyway? Because its sequel was my first game ever, I learned to love the sci-fi look on it and get used to it rather than the Lovecraftian style that I came to experience some time after. Same goes for the music, a lot of people are going to hate me for this but I dislike most of the music for this game, with the exception of its main theme and the 'base' theme of every first level of each area. I really like those two, the theme's badass and the base music is relaxing, in a way. I really hate one of the tracks, the one with the piano and then you hear a voice that's like hearing someone dragging their finger nail down a chalkboard. Seriously, that's what I hear everytime I hear the song and its headache-giving, to me anyway, don't let that affect what you might experience. Sorry if I did. :/This game IS less repetitive than Doom, I'll give it that, its great for what it is, MUCH better than CoD, BF, and so on. I know I kinda already said that before but I really need to get that out there. This game's great, but only if you have bought and played others that might be better.The Stuff you'd probably need to know before you buy the darn game-You start out at a Hub that lets you select your difficulty, you proceed to such difficulty and you enter another hub that allows you to select the area of which will allow you to gain a rune. Such runes allow you to gain enough power to gain access to find the game's boss. You collect the runes by reaching the end of the area, that being the area's last level. The first area is the only one that has a scripted boss, the others are all walking enemies, though they can be considered bosses too, the game can get much harder depending on the area's number. You can finish the game pretty quickly, and its also easily speedrunnable if you know how to. Its overall very fun and as I said, only get it if you already played stuff that could be better. Get it on a sale if you want, I am known for being cheap like an old man so I dunno, I always tell people to buy stuff on a sale because its totally worth it. :p			",56,2,0,9,2,0,1

												Having dissecting and hacked both the Quake source code and the QuakeC game logic files, played through the game and all expansions, and made levels for this, I can say I throughly have enjoyed Quake in all of its many forms. My Steam hours played here are tiny, but the total hours of my life in this game are probably even greater than all of the RPGs I have here combined.			",86,10,0,11,2,0,1

												I was going to leave this review for later when I had more hours in but now seemed like a good time. First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might find it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the ""modern military shooter,"" I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will stillbe played in the future).			",87,10,4,1,6,0,2

												Well. If you dont know about Quake your either 3 years old or a complete gaming virgin. And even then i would be surprised. Quake is to 3d shooters what Black Sabbath is to Heavy Metal (which should be listened to loudly while playing). From ID after the iconnic Doom games Quake is the first shooter to go properly three dimensional and pioneered the keyboard and mouse style controls of basicly all shooters made to date.Incredibly emersive even to this day especially played in the graphics excellerated mode ""GL"". As well as fantasicly terrifying sound this game will get your heart rate pumpingIn my humble opinion Quake was home to some of THE most hardcore online gamers in history. If you are a fan of the modern day shooter and are young enough not to of played Quake, pay hommage to all that you enjoy by diving head first into the world of Quake.(Take your time to set up the controls properly, a small hint, open the console with ` and type +mlook to activate freelook)			",206,4,19,19,9,0,25

												Quake is undeniable. If you're on this store page, you shouldn't need me to tell you how great Quake is, but I am here to assure you that, with a few little patches, you can still play the Quake of your memories.The Steam version, like most digital copies, doesn't include the soundtrack, and GabeN obviously doesn't much care for physical media, so there's not much chance of him sending you a CD. Don't dismay, though. There are all kinds of guides to get the soundtrack up and running, and what a difference it makes! The memories of countless hours spent fragging came flooding back. A few graphical tweaks, and the game actually looks as good as I thought it did the first time I saw it played.If you ever enjoyed Quake, or if you're some kind of child or mutant who's never played before, you owe it to yourself to drop the paltry sum, and experience this masterpiece of foundational game design (foundational to its genre, at any rate) again, or for the first time.

												Quake is probably one of the best video games of all time. It changed gaming forever and gaming wouldn't be what it is today without it. A lot of games came about because of what Quake was/is. Half-life series? Yep. Playing this is going back to the roots of FPS gaming, not to mention it revolutionized multiplayer gaming and game modding.The graphics are dated, but nearly 15 years later and this game is still one of my favorites. I go back and play it all the time. Hard to forget late night deathmatch sessions and Quakespy. Team Fortress 2 wouldn't have existed without Quake...

												Okay, so you got Trent Reznor doing the soundtrack, the soundtrack is done by Trent Reznor... oh, and the music was done by Trent Reznor. Did I mention Trent Reznor did the sound design for this game?Pushing aside my hard-on for Nine Inch Nails, Quake is pretty much FPS heaven. While this formula has passed just like the year 1996, I played this sucker for the first time around a year ago (writing in 2014) and I can easily say this is probably my favorite FPS up there with Half-Life 2... which takes a lot from games like DOOM and Quake, so I'm probably going to get stoned for putting those two games together. Major red flag, I suggest... I COMMAND that you get the Ultimate Quake Patch.

												Ah... Nostalgia. Simply put.Great level design, despite being somewhat maze-like. Sufficient ammo per level, and an absolutely vicious Hard Mode (just beaten it again on this difficulty before review), backing up that ammo statement (needed every shell/nail/rocket/cell, especially at the end), and Nightmare Mode.Always a fun challenge: 1 on 1 a shambler or 3 fiends at once with an axe.Or start some fun infights, like this one:Ogre (grenade launcher and chainsaw)vsZombie (fights by throwing chunks of himself at you)Guess the winner in that infight I started.Answer: The Zombie, believe it or not. I am not making this up. Those skinny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are durable, right? And yes, it not only survived, but killed the ogre by throwing his own zombie chunks at him. It was oddly amusing. Lasted 5 minutes.

												I absolutely loved this game, this game is so good I'm not sure why a remake hasn't been made yet. It mixes gothic horror (think Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft), freakishly monstrous monsters (Zombies with chainsaws bro {need I say more}), and the awesomeness of first person gameplay. Add in a soundtrack done by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and you've got yourself one scary but awesome game. One of the easiest bosses to defeat too but I'll let you guess witch one. At any rate if you took the time out of your busy day to read this review cool beans, but those but Ranger won't get through those gothic levels themselves...			",34,1,0,4,5,0,20

												Okay, so you got Trent Reznor doing the soundtrack, the soundtrack is done by Trent Reznor... oh, and the music was done by Trent Reznor. Did I mention Trent Reznor did the sound design for this game?Pushing aside my hard-on for Nine Inch Nails, Quake is pretty much FPS heaven. While this formula has passed just like the year 1996, I played this sucker for the first time around a year ago (writing in 2014) and I can easily say this is probably my favorite FPS up there with Half-Life 2... which takes a lot from games like DOOM and Quake, so I'm probably going to get stoned for putting those two games together. Major red flag, I suggest... I COMMAND that you get the Ultimate Quake Patch. Without it you'd be playing a dated version with no music... and don't get me started on the music.Here's a link to the patch, enjoy killing hellspawn: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923 ",121,28,5,11,5,0,6

												The Steam release of Quake could definitely use some work. Unless you prefer the original, mid-90's pixelated graphics and low resolution, you'll need to download a seperate game engine, since the included GLQuake doesn't operate properly unless you have a pc from that era, parts included. There is also a distinct lack of a soundtrack for this release, which ruins the overall atmosphere. There are patches out on the internet that can easily fix all the issues with this release, it's just too bad they didn't do a thing to prepare the game for Steam. I still recommend the game; it's nostalgic for some, difficult for many, and fun for all.			",120,8,0,2,3,1,2

												Oh Quake, how I love thee.  Quake II was my introduction into First-Person Shooter, and after I had absorbed as much of it as I could I went to its predecessor and played that.  And boy are they different games.The funny thing about Quake is how different the games have been.  First there is Quake with a gothic feel that isn’t far from the Doom mold. Then you have Quake 2, which wasn’t intended on being a Quake game until they were unable to gain the rights they were looking for, and decided to just use the name Quake II.  It has a very technological theme with aliens.  After which there was Quake III Arena, which took all the great things created and learned from Quake and Quake II’s multiplayer, making almost a third setting/storyline, with characters from previous ID titles.  And finally there is Quake 4, which is a direct sequel to Quake II, back the the technological aliens.  And there is rumor of the next Quake game going back to the gothic style.While the story isn’t entirely there, Quake is ultimately an excellent game.  And maybe it’s simply because I just played all the great games in the right order.  Where each game fed into the next, and really displayed how they were truly remarkable.			",379,53,20,28,68,7,68

												Ah, the Classic Quake. The first true 3D FPS game. 13 years on, how well has it aged?Surprisingly well actually. I suppose the first thing to note is that the game played a lot like DooM, I personally like to consider it one of the 3 DooM 3's also consisting of DooM64 and the actual DooM 3. But I Digress.Quake, as the first FPS to use actual Ploygons manages to hold up quite well, you have the basic DooM style controls, using the arrow keys to turn, Ctrl to shoot and WASD to move (That is unless you're using the Ultimate Quake Patch, but I'll get to that later). and it does feel like a well-rounded experience that manages to hold up today. Of course it has graphically aged poorly with Jerky animation (this can be fixed with the UQP) but to fully enjoy the game you have to put your mindset back in 1996 where the best looking 3D was Virtua Fighter, This game puts you in a realisting looking (for the time) environments and gives frigtening enemies that have never been seen before.Story Wise the game doesn't offer much, but the game doesn't really need to, you're just a guy (Who I like to call Quakeguy) who must stop evil creatures from an Alternate Dimension. It is sweet and simple.All weapons handle well, from the Shotgun, Nailgun, Their 'Super' Counterparts, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, all are simplistic in their design and manage to hit their target with a bit of help from auto aim (Again, UQP). The game features a fun Fast paced game that is perfect for speedrunners and delivers on the retro feeling and boasts great level design.The Enemies themselves are actually made creepier with an effect that would not exist if the game had more polygons, The Gothic scenery makes the mood and feel of the game and gives the game It's own unique identity.Unfortunatly the game has some problems cause by some sort of steam optimisation. The Music is Non-Existant, even though there exists OST tracks on YouTube, none are featured in this game. This is Where the Ultimate Quake Patch comes into effect. The UQP fixes a lot of the Steam problems as well as some more of the poorly aged parts: Enemies have now got fluent animation, Mouse Control is Enabled, Improved Lighting and Particle effects as well as the OST added. Personally though I thought the 1996 graphics and improved lighting and effects were too distracting and I had no idea how to get the game to look like the Original game with just the Soundtrack so I removed it. The game still has a great Charm to it and is memorable for it's environments and enemies. The game is still fun without the UQP but may turn people off with the lack of soundtrack.I suppose the bottom line is that Quake is a Good, if not Great game the has fun retro gameplay but naturally has not aged well in many areas. This leads to 3 possiblities for interest in the consumers purchase:1) Buy the game on GOG where it (apparently) plays Just like the Steam release but with working OST2) Buy on Steam with UQP, if you aren't bothered by the clashing graphics and enjoy updated versions of old games then this should be fine for you3) Just buy the Steam release as it is and Play some 'Through the Fire and Flames' to the game and enjoy it for what it is.Quake is a Landmark in the FPS genre that doesn't hold up as well as it's older brothers DooM and Wolfenstein but leaves it's mark in it's creative level design and fun fast gameplay.FINAL VERDICT: RECCOMEND			",96,24,0,5,5,0,7

												That's the kind of game that I shall remember until the end of my life. It was the first 3D FPS that I've ever played and how amazed I was for being able to contemplate enemies that had depth instead of simply being made of some thin texture that would always stare at me (even when dead). The campaign mode is awesome, not only because of the gameplay, music, weapons etc, but also because you have the opportunity of playing it cooperatively with your friends. Talking of multiplayer, although Quake was so innovative back then, it also had to bear the weight of handling dial-up connections from most of the players (except in LANs), making the overall multiplayer conditions somewhat unfair. That's simply because some players had a better connection than others. I've played countless hours of CTF and later Team Fortress (how I miss those crafty grenades and maps). Besides that, I can't remember how many demo videos I've seen in-game, another wonderful resource that created a legacy. Oh well, if I may summarize this game in a single word, it can be only this: Epic.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

												Good times to the nth degree. So many hours playing this game, and even now I still fall back to it occasionally.This game(+engine) has spawned so many other enjoyable games, yet still holds a special place in my heart.Back before games spoon-fed you the action or led you around on rails,  Quake kept you jumping(manual, rocket or grenade:D), made you think occasionally, made you work to find 100% of the map Secrets, and then, when the as-written game was done, allowed all sorts of shenanigans undreamt-of in modern games. Plus, there's only one other game I'm aware of whose music/score was created by Trent Reznor. This one was the first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was going to leave this review for later when I had more hours in but now seemed like a good time. First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might find it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the ""modern military shooter,"" I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will stillbe played in the future).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am not making this up. Those skinny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are durable, right? And yes, it not only survived, but killed the ogre by throwing his own zombie chunks at him. It was oddly amusing. Lasted 5 minutes.

												Such an Iccon of its time and every bit as groundbreaking as Doom was. This is where MP deathmatch began with the likes of Doom and Quake. The Singleplayer level design is built in such a way that it is always fun to explore. The levels are riddled with secret passages, areas and even secret levels. Modern games could learn a lot from games such as these when it comes to level design. The sounds are just as creepy as I remember them. The success of Doom 2016 shows that these types of games are still very playable with modern graphics. I very much hope that a new singlepayer Quake campaign will happen in very much the same way as it did with Doom. For fast paced twitch shooting and fun levels... you cant get much better than this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say that hasn't already been said a billion times about Quake? Quite simply it is one of the most challenging, brutal, and beautifully crafted shooters ever created. The labyrinth stages, the plethora of monsters, KICK♥♥♥♥♥weapons, the Lovecraftian art style all blend together to create an enthralling experience. The gameplay (with a couple tweaks here and there from the amazing online community) is just as fresh as it was back in 1996, and just as surprising and challenging. If you have never touched a game of Quake, do so. I can't assure you you'll sleep well ever again, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually kind of like this game more then Doom which is a pretty high bar, maybe because of the Lovecraftian feel, since I was kind of getting bored with sci-fi shooter elements. I know it says I only played quake for like an hour, but that is because i used the darkplaces mod, which I also highly reccommend. In short its an awesome shooter made my the awesome guys at awesome id software who soak up each others awesomeness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Steam release of Quake could definitely use some work. Unless you prefer the original, mid-90's pixelated graphics and low resolution, you'll need to download a seperate game engine, since the included GLQuake doesn't operate properly unless you have a pc from that era, parts included. There is also a distinct lack of a soundtrack for this release, which ruins the overall atmosphere. There are patches out on the internet that can easily fix all the issues with this release, it's just too bad they didn't do a thing to prepare the game for Steam. I still recommend the game; it's nostalgic for some, difficult for many, and fun for all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is one of the first FPS games that is fully rendered in 3D.  Now it is more of an interactive museum piece than an entertaining game, but still has a little charm for those who really fell in love with the FPS genre when it grew big.  The guns are creative and semi-traditional, as well as the enemies.  This is also one of the first games to offer enemies that will fight each other when they get caught in crossfire.  This game also was one of the first games to be openly modded, but most mods have not been carried over from the past.  Multiplayer mods have to be downloaded separately from the base game.  I still enjoy this game once in awhile, but this is one of those gems that is simply more hard rock than actual diamond.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, my favorite FPS of all time.  Impeccable level design, great enemies with really good AI for the time, and an environment and mob placement that actually lends itself to be legitimately scary.  It has surprises that you're usually ready for, but you're not the golden god you are in most FPS games where after the initial startle, you realize you can not be stopped and then wait until the next cheap shock.  Brilliant weapons, an awesome soundtrack and very cool odes to Lovecraftian lore make this a title that no gamer should ever have to claim they have not played.  If you love the Halos and Call of Duties now and have not taken a step back in time to play this gem, then make sure to put it on  your list.  You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The more abstract levels are really showing their age.So how do I run Quake on modern PCs?Well you're in luck there are alot of good source ports of different variation, my personal favoutires are Quakespasm and Tenebrae.I give Quake 4/5 Fiends!Hey wait a minute you didn't mention the MP of Quake!?!Well I really never played it other than gainst bots :C			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Blowing zombies and orwellion horrors to bits with rocket launchers and nail guns. Parents and me would get into competitions of seeing how fast we could get the game completed. Some of the best memories of growing up go back to this game.Quake will always be there when I need to cheer myself up or need to wind down after a day of work.10 / 10 would play again and again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Truly one of my favorite video games of all time. For the time, the graphics were stunning and unfathomable. Even in an age of much better graphics, I still thoroughly enjoy looking about the levels and marveling at the superb design. The soundtrack is very fitting with the atmosphere that is placed around and creates a sense of immersion. The story is not clearly explained and is not emotional or anything but compelling enough to keep you blasting through enemies and exploring the environment. The gameplay is what to be expected, a fantasically crafted simple yet enjoyable first person shooter that screams everything is classic about this game. I would recommend this game to anyone in the world, even if they do not play video games often. This is a must play for anyone and everyone, this fine piece of gaming history should be known to all.  Quake is not just a game, but a whole culture that has culminated a certain part of video game history that still stands today in 2016. As one of my favorite games, even today, I can recommend this game to anyone. The graphics are not the absolute best, but were still revolutionary at the time. The sound is nostalgic to all of those that stayed up late nights playing with their friends blasting eachother with the crazy fun arsenal of weapnry. The environments took you to places that were quite unique for the time and somehow made sense to be designed the way that they were and not only that, but enjoyable to the average gamer. Furthermore, I think if the graphics get to you now, there are still modders that have improved on that to either get new players to experience it or bring some older players a new experience.

												An absolutely fantastic game with smooth gameplay despite it`s age. The overall design and atmosphere within the game is astounding and can be genuinely frightening if played on higher difficulty settings such as nightmare, not through arbitrary and scripted sequences, but through the enemy design and gameplay. HOWEVER, I must stress that despite this, a newer sourceport such as quakespasm or darkspaces is recommended due to the original engine not having aged too well.I personally recommend Darkplaces due to it`s compatibility and options such as FOV sliders and customisable lighting and effects, allowing you to give the game some visual upgrades.The weapons all serve great purpose and some damage enemies better than others, combined with the unique behaviour of each, the player is left with a game of great challenge and intrigue. The game features a well composed soundtrack by Nine inch nails and their logo can be seen on ammunition containers throughout.While the game is definitely not perfect, it is a game that any oldschooler would be incredibly comfortable with, however newschool players may find it less.Overall a solid gold piece of the past, not for everyone but for me, it was a good time.

												OK this time this one is for the STEAM AWARDS.I played Quake 1 in 2002 for the first time, and it's still a great first person shooter in all time.Quake is fast, wild, speedy, furious, goreness, bloody, dark, crazy, incrediblely fun. And Quake requires raw skills to beat. It's one of the kings of the thrones of the early 3D FPSes among with Unreal which make your dizzy, vomitting, adrenined. It makes the weak want to quit the PvP electronical sports until years later they can play Counter Strike or Call of Duty. It makes your little sister and brother admire you more. It makes your future son never dare to challenge your FPS domination. It makes your parents hate video games brainlessly. It makes your schoolmates stun and your old Pentium II 450MHz processor with Voodoo 2 graphics card burning besides the crying of your Microsoft mice. It makes you a special person who has the balls to tell the differences of different monitors which support 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate between 60, 90, 120, 180 framerates. It make you seem like to be a insider of Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk at its best of 4K resolution with 120fps. And after all, it makes you never be afraid of any 3D sickness and years later laughing and having fun in Virtual Reality while the others can only play just minutes.If human race will vanish, and there is only one FPS game can be saved. I will recommend Quake along with the sound tracks made by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.I don't play much Quake on Steam, mostly on an old copy I get from retail with GLQuake executables. New community mods make old Quake so fresh and shinny that almost a modern game with incredible lightening and shadow effects. Still a bad♥♥♥♥♥I would recommend Quake to anyone who's interested in first person shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah... Nostalgia. Simply put.Great level design, despite being somewhat maze-like. Sufficient ammo per level, and an absolutely vicious Hard Mode (just beaten it again on this difficulty before review), backing up that ammo statement (needed every shell/nail/rocket/cell, especially at the end), and Nightmare Mode.Always a fun challenge: 1 on 1 a shambler or 3 fiends at once with an axe.Or start some fun infights, like this one:Ogre (grenade launcher and chainsaw)vsZombie (fights by throwing chunks of himself at you)Guess the winner in that infight I started.Answer: The Zombie, believe it or not. I am not making this up. Those skinny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are durable, right? And yes, it not only survived, but killed the ogre by throwing his own zombie chunks at him. It was oddly amusing. Lasted 5 minutes.

												recent playthrough left me in love with the game all over again, ive played this game countless times since my early childhood and nothing else compares in terms of single player FPSthe movement tech, allowing you to flow with style through maps as smoothly as a hot♥♥♥♥♥♥through vaseline... even games later in the series dont let you bhop and strafe jump as good as this classic. great for anyone who loves FPS with great movement and shooting mechanics. absolutely nothing else comes close to how tuned quake is for FUN fps gameplay.get it, play it, love itone consideration, the steam version comes with WinQuake, GLquake, and Quakeworld/GLquakeworld versions. none of these versions use music off the HDD, which means the default steam install does NOT include the amazing trent reznor soundtrack. it is a MUST to download the darkplaces sourceport and the missing music patch from the steam forums if you want the complete experience. darkplaces has some issues with multiplayer but you can easily swap to quakeworld/GLquakeworld if you want to play over over the internet.if you want to deathmatch it will probably be best to just go buy quake live though.

												Excellent level design, movement, weapons, and music.  Truly a wonderful classic shooter. I used the Quakespasm sourceport to play this and had no issues. I used ""Simple Quake Launcher"" to start the game instead of using Winquake (renamed the file to ""testapp""). I also use Quake Injector to download user maps, and you can play the game from there too. To me these are the best ways to play this on modern computers. Darkplaces is a fine sourceport too, but the fiend enemies are a bit glitched from my experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself stands the test of time, so a thorough review of the game on here would be redudant. For people new to Quake and would like to play it, you can try the shareware version online for free before you decide you want to buy it. If you decide to buy it, you can buy the game files from Steam, GOG.com, or even buy the retail copy from Amazon.com or Ebay.com if you want the CD-ROM, either way you'll be buying Quake. Please note that the Steam version does not include the music for the game and must be downloaded separately as long as you purchased a copy of the Quake game files. The GOG.com version includes the music files which may be added to the \id1\music directory in your QUAKE folder. To get Quake running on WinXP and up, download an updated version of the Quake engine (I recommend FitzQuake or Quakespasm for an authentic Quake experience) and follow the instructions listed on <https://www.quaddicted.com/quake/installation> (QUAKE may also be installed on Linux and Mac). You can also play custom maps from other Quake players on <www.quaddicted.com>. If you're interested in making custom maps yourself, check out <http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/> and download GtkRadiant. Happy playing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game looks rubbish. It should be rubbish?Oh no, oooo no kiddies of graphical fidelity and micro transactions. You may need a mod to play at 1920x1080 so whatever time I've spent won't be recorded. I've only played the first few levels and have already had fear, frustration and joy from this game. Joy being the primary feeling. It's simple, but the fundamentals of good level design and gameplay are there. Start playing for more than 10 minutes blasting bad guys and soon you're in another shooter. You still want them dead and your charecter alive. It doesn't matter that they're blocky and featureless. They're still evil mothers trying to stop you doing whatever the heck this game is trying to get you to do. I guess pest control from the looks of it and they're angy. But you've got low poly kick♥♥♥♥♥guns that sound... well they sound like a game from 97 with some being pretty decent.The enemies are actually interesting. Some can't be defeated by certain weapons and if you've only ever played quake 2 (like I had) then it's fun to see the recycled boxes and mechanics in different monsters and it's easy to see how the developers could see strogg in these weird mutants from hell beings. Some will launch, fire grenades and be hard to kill. Levels are interesting with limited puzzle elements and the completion time at the end of each level with the number of enemies reminds me of mario. Oh, did I mention you have an axe? I'm using the ezquake mod for quake 1 that cleans up the graphics a bit and allows you to run it in 1920x1080 although I found I had to use the load command from the console with the saved files name. It saves just fine, just won't load via the menu.Anyway. I'm actually impressed. I feel like I've had my own avgn episode, but instead of playing a rubbish game I've come out playing something awesome! Even as this game ages and looses it's looks it's kinda like your grandma. She's old and haggard on the outside, but when you engage you discover the fantastic person and the awesome things she did. She was sexy in 97.Quake will never be pretty again, but it will always be awesome and for that it's worth your time. Maybe it's time to go and play the original doom too before the newest one comes out. Oh right. And before you expect some fantastic single player quest and campaign. Forget it. There's no 10 minute man feeling scenes here, it's you, your gun and that monster your blasting into oblivion. Go nuts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For this Steam edition, be aware that you don't get any music at all in Quake. Apparently there is a work around, but when one purchases a game they should get the full content.  Otherwise, all seems to be well in the delivery of the game.Quake itself wasn't quite all the gaming public had hoped for back in the mid 90s.   The music, visual design and action seemed quite dull compared to the hell-ride that was Doom, whilst the ""full 3D levels"" didn't seem to impress as much with competition from console games such as Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider - which both offered smooth character animations where Quake's creatures-from-the-abyss were very jerky...That said, this game still manages to be a mile stone in gaming history.  Its multiplayer culture was massive back in the day and for years to come, and somehow, there is a gritty and creepy menace to the games characters - the jerky animation is actually a strength in this regard.  While Doom was Id's finest hour, Quake is still a highlight for the Texas-based developer.  Go grab a horror/action soundtrack CD from an old film and set it running before loading up Quake, and you'll be pleasantly surprised how delightfully nasty this classic game can be...Oh, for those wondering how to look around with the mouse; open the console and type ""+mlook"" and press enter.

												The best FPS ever. If you haven't played it, you should probably do this now. Else the PC gaming gods may strike you dead. Message me if you would like to modernize the game and are unsure what to do. Or just go here https://www.quaddicted.com/ and do it for yourself. I personally use the DarkPlaces engine with texture smoothing turned off. I do not use any high resolution texture packs or new models, as I prefer to play reminiscent of when I originally play, just with better lighting and high resolution. I keep this game installed on my PC as I'm always down for a game of Quake. The multiplayer community is still there. Quakeworld is fine, or go check out www.quakeone.com ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is everything that the fans of the series claimed it would be. Quake follows the ranger (the protagonist) as he goes about collecting the 4 legendary runes in order to stop the Shub-Niggurath. The theme of interdimensional beings invading Earth seemed to be a popular theme among the time. The game is split into 4 episodes and the final boss fight. You can access any episode from the hub which has a great layout that I really enjoyed. Each episode is a decent length with around 7 or 8 levels, and the levels themselves usually have a few puzzles in order to keep you from just speed running it like in the DOOM franchise. The movement is fast paced allowing for you to easily out maneuver your opponent, while also keeping things from getting stale. The weapons in Quake are all unique in their own way some more useful than others. The enemies of Quake seem to share an eldritch horror style and are each unique with some requiring certain weapons to defeat them. The graphics in Quake invoke a nostalgic feel but are also heavily outdated. I did not play the multiplayer as I am sure that there are few servers if any at all still running. Quake does everything right that I wanted from a game like Doom and I had a fun time going through the story and playing through this gem of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Works on Windows 10 and if you still have the original CD ROM you can pop that in your drive and it will happily play the Nine Inch Nails music off the disc while you play avoiding any need to download mods so you can enjoy the classic experience!

												recent playthrough left me in love with the game all over again, ive played this game countless times since my early childhood and nothing else compares in terms of single player FPSthe movement tech, allowing you to flow with style through maps as smoothly as a hot♥♥♥♥♥♥through vaseline... even games later in the series dont let you bhop and strafe jump as good as this classic. great for anyone who loves FPS with great movement and shooting mechanics. absolutely nothing else comes close to how tuned quake is for FUN fps gameplay.get it, play it, love itone consideration, the steam version comes with WinQuake, GLquake, and Quakeworld/GLquakeworld versions. none of these versions use music off the HDD, which means the default steam install does NOT include the amazing trent reznor soundtrack. it is a MUST to download the darkplaces sourceport and the missing music patch from the steam forums if you want the complete experience. darkplaces has some issues with multiplayer but you can easily swap to quakeworld/GLquakeworld if you want to play over over the internet.if you want to deathmatch it will probably be best to just go buy quake live though.

												This game looks rubbish. It should be rubbish?Oh no, oooo no kiddies of graphical fidelity and micro transactions. You may need a mod to play at 1920x1080 so whatever time I've spent won't be recorded. I've only played the first few levels and have already had fear, frustration and joy from this game. Joy being the primary feeling. It's simple, but the fundamentals of good level design and gameplay are there. Start playing for more than 10 minutes blasting bad guys and soon you're in another shooter. You still want them dead and your charecter alive. It doesn't matter that they're blocky and featureless. They're still evil mothers trying to stop you doing whatever the heck this game is trying to get you to do. I guess pest control from the looks of it and they're angy. But you've got low poly kick♥♥♥♥♥guns that sound... well they sound like a game from 97 with some being pretty decent.The enemies are actually interesting. Some can't be defeated by certain weapons and if you've only ever played quake 2 (like I had) then it's fun to see the recycled boxes and mechanics in different monsters and it's easy to see how the developers could see strogg in these weird mutants from hell beings. Some will launch, fire grenades and be hard to kill. Levels are interesting with limited puzzle elements and the completion time at the end of each level with the number of enemies reminds me of mario. Oh, did I mention you have an axe? I'm using the ezquake mod for quake 1 that cleans up the graphics a bit and allows you to run it in 1920x1080 although I found I had to use the load command from the console with the saved files name. It saves just fine, just won't load via the menu.Anyway. I'm actually impressed. I feel like I've had my own avgn episode, but instead of playing a rubbish game I've come out playing something awesome! Even as this game ages and looses it's looks it's kinda like your grandma. She's old and haggard on the outside, but when you engage you discover the fantastic person and the awesome things she did. She was sexy in 97.Quake will never be pretty again, but it will always be awesome and for that it's worth your time. Maybe it's time to go and play the original doom too before the newest one comes out. Oh right. And before you expect some fantastic single player quest and campaign. Forget it. There's no 10 minute man feeling scenes here, it's you, your gun and that monster your blasting into oblivion. Go nuts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mannnnnnnn what do I even say? I was raised an id kid. I remember being in the single digits and sitting in a chair next to my Mom and Dad, watching them play Wolfenstein/Doom/Doom2. I was too scared to actually play it myself then, it took me awhile to work up the courage to try it myself, but when I finally did...the rest is history. We played and replayed those early id games for years, and then finally Quake came out. My parents weren't into the transition into 3d, but me, I saw the future in this game, it is responsible for so much.In my eyes, Quake 1 still remains the most excellent FPS you could ever hope to play. ESPECIALLY the multiplayer. I still think Quake 1 far outweighs even the might Quake 3 in simplicity and fun factor. It's just so damn fun and adrenaline-pumping to play, even now. I'm still addicted, even now, after all these years....So in modern reviewing format:Quake gets 420 no-scopes out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is a load of fun. Its fast pace, rocket-jumping, b-hopping awesomeness. The game keeps in going with its unique levels. It has a good variety of weapons. And the enemies are original. The game is great. The only way to truly play is by unlocking your mouse into free look. But everyone does that. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a good original shoot em up game. Also learning to speed run levels is a blast. This is a must buy game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Growing up in the 90s I never got a chance to play Quake or any of its sequels.  Of course I played Doom and even had a decent enough PC at one point to play Unreal Tournament. But I always felt I missed out on Quake.I got the Quake Collection on sale(although its missing Quake 4) and I have to say it has aged well. With certain mods you can upscale the graphics a bit and you can get a hold of the NIN soundtrack or else the game will just have sounds and no music. I like the level design and miss the difficulty of old school FPS games.  I would also say the game has survival horror elements as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Virtually unplayable without DarkPlaces or some other graphical enhancer. Stock Quake is very clunky, missing music, and graphics that don't compare to modern FPS. I definitely reccomend it, but mods are required. I would firstly reccomend the Master Quake I Patch, I think it was called. It installs WinQuake, fixes controls, huds, and other things. In addition, it comes bundled with DarkPlaces, a simple enhancement to graphics and source, allowing for bloom effects, better textures, and a complete overhaul to the multiplayer system. There are other choices for remasters, but this is my personal favorite of them. 3/10 (Stock Quake), 9/10 (DarkPlaces).NEVERMIND QUAKE IS GREAT WITH NO ENHANCEMENTS BUY QUAKE RIGHT NOW			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While modern iterations of the Quake franchise continue to attract new players, there has recently been a clear recognition of the true importance of the very first Quake in shaping the multiplayer FPS games we play today. Clients such as ezQuake, nQuake, and FuhQuake all continue to prolong the multiplayer life of this true classic as well as adding the various options, toolsets, and graphical improvements that most are familiar with today. From Dennis 'Thresh' Fong winning John Carmack's Ferrari 328 at the 1997 Red Annihilation Tournament to the current Quake Live MLG, CPL, Intel Masters, Tek9, and QuakeCon events (to mention just a few), there has rarely been a lapse in the competitive interest this game continues to generate.It is now 20 years since the game's release and there are simply too many happy memories to recount. Without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made and an essential title in any game collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the levels are true classics that my friends and I still reference. It's a great game with great atmosphere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, the good old Quake. I remember back in 1996 how eagerly I awaited the CD-ROM with this gem. This was truly next-gen back in the day, and although still MS-DOS based at the time, it was a huge leap forward from the so common sprite based ""2D/3D"" shooters. This was true 3D, polygon monsters and a dark and foreboding atmosphere.I have largely absconded plain 3D shooters these days, because, frankly, I find them boring. Ten or fifteen years ago the FPS genre was at its prime, with a constant stream of new titles, MODs, re-releases of the same engines with a different graphic set and plot, and I can honestly say I probably played most of them. Nowadays a plain and simple FPS game just doesn't feel that entertaining anymore. It's all been seen and done before. So; what's a gamer to do? Easy. Go back into the past and relive the glory days with the good old quality FPS titles from that era.While it's true that the music is missing from this release, and while Nine-Inch-Nails are definitely a great choice, the game itself is still the fast-paced mayhem you remember (or not). I would strongly recommend to get ""Quakespasm"", since that allows you to play the game as close to the original as possible, but with Keyboard and Mouse and in HD resolutions. GLQuake doesn't work all that well. If you rename ""quakespasm.exe"" to ""winquake.exe"" in Steam's game folder (making copies of both files first of course), Steam will even count your play time.This is truly a classic. If you're looking for an 'old skool' FPS game that was pretty much paving the way for the new era of shooters, then look no further. If you like FPS games, there is no excuse for not having this in your library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game still stands as a unique, abstract shooter with a thickly-dark atmosphere.   No storyline; just a series of demonic mazes and fast action.  I lost much of my youth caught up in the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Gameplay-wise, it's a  basic but smooth formula.  It offers a challenge that is purely skill based; not just on your aim; but your timing, prediction and almost gymnastic movement around the levels.I still think it's a technical marvel.  This was one of the first full-3D games; and the levels are deliberately vertical and abstract in their design.  Everything has long since been open sourced; as a coder it's intriguing to inspect the design from a kind of archeological perspective.When starting, you're given the option to choose which executable to run;  QuakeWorld (which was its brilliant online version - though surely not noob friendly), didn't work for me.   Perhaps with some technical tinkering you can get this to work.  (It was never straightforward back in the day anyway)I've tested the GLQuake option, is the hardware rendering option, this works without any issues.  I'm sure there are mods out there that improve the experience, though.Gamers today will probably never feel the same sense of awe and wonder and compelling multiplayer gameplay as we did when it released.  I'm kinda glad that games have moved on though, this game has a slightly discomforting pull, like it's almost half-living, a demon demanding my return.   As a skeptical atheist, it's beyond disturbing.My time with this game is done;  it was a strange friend that was always present, but I hardly miss.  It still quietly haunts my subconscious to this day.   Damn.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphically, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every other aspect of it, though, has aged extremly well like a fine cheese. Sadly, the music is missing from the Steam release (though you can patch back in), but other than that and the graphics, it's damn good, Worth all the money it costs to buy it. 9/10 best game id ever made.

												20 years after release still a great experience. New single player mods like Arcane Dimensions are great and bring the gameplay to new heights. Quake multiplayer aka Quakeworld is still the most pure deathmatch experience ever and still has a small but dedicated community. In short, one of the best FPS ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shub-Niggurath Fhtang!In 1996 ID-software of ""little"" know Doom-fame came out with another classic, Quake.Quake with it's Gothic Lovecraftian horror vibes and meaty weapons was an instant classic.Quake's fast paced action is still as fresh as it was when I first time got my hands on it.Side note, the level design hasn't aged as well. The more abstract levels are really showing their age.So how do I run Quake on modern PCs?Well you're in luck there are alot of good source ports of different variation, my personal favoutires are Quakespasm and Tenebrae.I give Quake 4/5 Fiends!Hey wait a minute you didn't mention the MP of Quake!?!Well I really never played it other than gainst bots :C			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game, always will. I used to work at an ISP as tech support. During my down time, or not, I would play quake with my buds. They didn't like it that I had the server, and NO lag. I fragged them anyways...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy this game and install the Quake Epsilon Mod if you want it to look like it was made in 2011.If you want a more OG feel with just a smoother experience and widescreen support, which is what I prefer, hook yourself up with Quakespasm.  Regardless of what you do, buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember when I was younger, I used to play this all the time with my dad and my brother! I was sad because we lost the discs, but then I saw it on here. Looking at the reviews, I decided, ""Screw it! I'll buy it,"" even though it says it doesn't have full audio. I bought it and I was pleased- There was audio! I haven't really been to any spots where there aren't any, but overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake is a load of fun. Its fast pace, rocket-jumping, b-hopping awesomeness. The game keeps in going with its unique levels. It has a good variety of weapons. And the enemies are original. The game is great. The only way to truly play is by unlocking your mouse into free look. But everyone does that. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a good original shoot em up game. Also learning to speed run levels is a blast. This is a must buy game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A hardcore and excellent example of a simple concept perfected. I love the atmospere and over the top action. The only problem I had with the game is that opengl didn't work on my fancy desktop, yet it ran smooth as silk on my crappy laptop. Also no music or any ambient sounds at all, but there are work arounds for the audio. Overall a very competent package but the asking price is a little steep in my opinion, maybe 5-6.99.
