												Just completed the game. I usually like playing through rough gems; but while this had one or two bright spots, there is so much wrong with it that those spots simply aren't worth picking through the trash. Don't brush the bad reviews aside because of their hyperbole, this one truly is a stinker. Standout Problems:An interesting story with a terrible endingUgly visuals (I have to assume that they were going for the bleak look that Spec Ops actually achieved)Frustrating gameplay (pinpoint accurate enemies who fire on sight, few healthpacks, and long stealth sections with unclear objectives)Sound equalization issues (voices are too low, gunfire is too loud)			",71,10,0,12,7,2,21

												In spite of the mostly negative reviews, and low metacritic scores, I bought this based on a handful of positive comments. I went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.While this is not a AAA title, it is nevertheless a good game. The low budget does show sometimes (copy paste environments, and typos in the subtitles), but it also does many things right. There are some interesting gameplay mechanics and it does a very good job of changing the pace up. Sound design (especially explosions) is solid, and the gunplay is also quite good.I also had some graphical problems at the beginning, with my framerate jumping between 30 and 60 (and this on a 4790K and GTX 970), but after some tweaking in nVidia's Control Panel, it sat at 60 all the way through. This was on Windows 10 Pro x64.Definitely worth a buy on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. Should be rated at least 60 easily.  Definitely not 34.  Not an AAA grade title, so don't expect CoD and you'll enjoy it. Single player only. No achievements. Good story and ending. Voice acting is good but lip synch not so much. Graphics are good once you switch OFF Bloom and Ambient Occlusion. Controls are fine.So why all the rabid nonsensical reviews?  Well, the game makes a very revealing and unfriendly observation on the real world US involvement in global terrorism as its ending, which I guess explains most of the smear campaign leveled against it by the establishment controlled mainstream reviewers and army of social media manipulation commenting staff.  It is telling that all the major review sites harshly pan this game while almost all the minor lesser known sites are fair to favourable.The real score for this game should be 6/10, and in my personal opinion 7/10. To sum up, I would say worth 20$, and definitely a must have on sale for 5$ or less.			",339,118,25,50,53,2,53

												I have to start by saying that one can't expect Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops to be on par with AAA developer games. SHPO is an ambitious game developed by a very small studio. It's not a horrible game as other reviews might make it seem, but it could probably have been so much better if the developers had more resources. The game has a lot of potential, and could have been a hit if not for its failings. It's challenging and entertaining at times, and has a decent albeit somewhat unrealistic storyline. I would recommend this game only if you're willing to understand that there are flaws. Some of these flaws are just personal nitpicking, but I'd say the other flaws are fundamental issues. A perfect example of the latter would be the enemy AI's uncanny ability to detect and shoot you from seemingly out of nowhere. Another example is that even though I enjoyed the stealth missions, I could not successfully complete the later missions without cheating. Perhaps a more skilled gamer may have done better than me, but I was too frustrated by that point. Here's a breakdown of some of the points that stood out:Not Bad- story- stealth missions- co-op play- character models- weapons/technology- menu interface- sound/musicNot Good- virtually all enemies (Somalis, Cubans) look/sound like American soldiers- inaccurate details in the aesthetics of certain levels- audio & video glitches- random slow load times- cannot adjust gamma levels- cannot adjust sound vs music levels- not enough ammo/health/etc in certain levels- certain levels designed with unnecessary and useless rooms/dead-ends- cannot skip cinematicsThe bottom line is that I would generously rate this game about 65%. It enaged me enough to want to complete it, and I was content when it was all over. I bought the retail version of the game as part of the Action Strategy 4 Pack (Stalker Call of Pripyat, Storm Frontline Nation, Grand Ages Rome, Shadow Harvest) for $5, so if you can make a stand-alone purchase of Shadow Harvest for a low price then I'd say take a chance and try it.

												Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is your typical first-person modern shooter game. The gist of the game is you work for the United States Army and you have your enemies that are fringe organisations. You, the player, play as both Cpt. Myra Lee and Cpt. Aron Alvarez and switch between them in the later stages of the game, but mainly switch between both in solo missions.Well let's get straight to it. The game isn't very good. This game isn't an AAA game, but not being AAA does not mean you can't have good games. It does have its positives in a above-average storyline that covers a wide variety of settings. I will admit that due to how bad the game is performence and gameplay-wise, I did not finish the campaign. However, I finished about four hours of the campaign, with How Long To Beat.com noting the length of the campaign is seven hours. Again, the campaign isn't that bad. I will note that I had not played this game in many months and coming back to this game, I remembered why I never finished this.The main issue is the UI and graphics, performance and the gameplay. To begin, I don't find the gameplay to be appealing. The default control layout is odd to a normal typical first person shooter, but regardless I don't like how the mechanics work. The mechanics include running into cover to go into the cover system, which is annoying, the AI is odd, and the choice of weapons in the game is poor. Also, the graphics are bad for a 2011 game. The performence is very poor. With my specs listed on my profile, I can't get a stable 60FPS with max settings on this game, which is appalling. So mainly, the graphics, performance and gameplay was a major turn-off for I. The game has its fair share of glitches too.Overall, I'll be blunt, I do not recommend this game. The gameplay is poor, the graphics are bad, the game is unoptimised, but the story is above-average. If you do wish to get the game, get it at a very steep discount, otherwise do not bother as their are other great games worth your time. 2/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												I often factor metacritic scores and user reviews into my game purchase decisions. Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is one of those games I put off buying because it was hard to find anything positive about it. To me a 34 metascore means this game is absolutely atrocious, something that isn't even ready for public release. I have to testify that isn't the case. That's not to say the game doesn't have faults. I have yet to find a game that doesn't have faults--ok maybe Call of Duty 4. But I've played some pretty bad games in my time and this one comes nowhere close to rock bottom.It's a traditional cover shooter, but you get to play two different characters, similar to Conflict: Denied Ops. There's a run and gun rambo character and a sneaky, stealth character. Both have their uses in each mission, but the stealth character is by far the more fun of the two for gameplay. Her crossbow works very well and was enjoyable taking out unsuspecting AI from distance. Now there are a couple areas where the run and gun guy gets to control a battle mech which was pretty fun as well (kind of FEAR 2 style). Overall I liked the shooter elements and thought they were good.The story is okay, but feels like it should have been longer--almost like they just had to get the product out the door and kind of wrapped up all the loose ends in a nice bow rather than finishing it properly.Many of the negatives don't even have anything to do with the gameplay. Stuff like separate volume controls for voices, background, and music don't exist. And you can't turn the music off. This makes it hard to hear voice dialog during some of the missions. The graphics and graphic controls are also bad--lots of tearing and jagged edges. There is a bloom option and when it's on, there's too much bloom where a lot of scenes are just a white blur, but when it's off, the environment is so dark, it's hard to see. The framerate gets pretty bad when a lot of things are blowing up simultaneously as well. The cover system is decent, but annoying. It's automatic and you often end up in cover when you don't want to be. The voice acting is obviously not top quality, but doesn't stand out as being bad.All in all, most of the elements of Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops are average or below average. I had fun with it and would recommend it as a bargain bin shooter. It's right in line with bargain bin material like Sniper: Ghost Warrior. I'm glad I looked past the bad publicity and gave it a shot.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												The ""stealth-action"" game ""Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops"" is a technical mess and hard to recommand, but I have to admit,  I liked some ideas of the game. The stealth and the action component is (strictly) splitted between the two main-charaters. Usually you have them both and can switch between them at any given time. You play from the third-person perspective. The game machanics have some flaws, but the core idea is not that bad.It is hard to recommand it, because it is more between ""Yes"" and ""No"". From my perspective now (2014), it is old (game performance is still bad; it crashes a lot on several systems), buggy and outdated, so no recommandation. From the perspective of 2011, I would say ""yes"" with some ""constraints"". It brought back some ""oldschool"" mechanics like med-kits (no regenerating health), it was quite difficult, if you died (or get seen in some missions) you had to restart the complete level again, etc. And this before Dark Souls (and others) was released that made ""harder/frustrating"" games popular again.Another problem is the execution of most elements of the game. Animations, graphics, coding, qa (a lot of bugs, bad performance, crashes), story aren't all that great. I would say, I can forgive bad animations and graphics, especially if it is a game from a small studio, but a lot of small indie devs right now, are doing a far better job here. Admittedly they also often avoid genres like stealth action (like in this case). And this is most likely the reason why this game has a lot of problems. The developers wanted too much. They wanted it to look and feel like a ""AAA-Title"", but this is very hard with a small team, a small budget and right on the first game they've ever developed.If you are looking for an ""old-schoolish"" stealth game with a cheesy story, some nice ideas (here and there) and you can ignore animations, bugs, bad performance and some design flaws, maybe pick it up, if you see it cheap. $7.99 is maybe borderline ok for it, if you are into those games and you know it will work on your machine. Don't expect patches, the Studio was closed, as far as I know. So from the 2011 perspective and with a warning (flawed game with tons of bugs and problems, but for cheap maybe give it a try), I give a semi-recommandation.Disclaimer: I played through it when it was released in 2011, but Steam hasn't tracked my game time on it back then. Also my english is bad, sry =/			",76,23,1,12,9,1,10

												People bash this game unnecessarily.  Yes, it’s far from perfect and has some issues but it dint destroy me having fun with it. Graphics are still nice, even when it has over the top bloom or being brownish when you turn bloom off. The voice acting is poor and it has no facial animation but well, it is the company’s first game. What do you expect?The game is still fun, has a great story and an unexpected ending. You play as 2 different characters; one for shooting and blowing up stuff, the other for stealth, hacking and going undercover. Stealth is fun and rewarding if you manage a difficult section. In most levels you can switch anytime between them and use their ability. Some people complain about hilarious things like; The cover system is broken. No it is not broken, it’s a walk on system and it works perfectly fine.  No regenerating health. What’s wrong with health packs?Checkpoints are far away and no quick saves.There are only 2 spots were they are far away in my view, but otherwise they are located in fair places. The game requires you to be careful. Yes, it can get frustrating at times but it pays off once you manage it.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, if the developers would even take a minute to fix the technical issues, then this game would rock.First of all its frame rate is so low i't s almost unplayable, the main problem here is that if you go to the developer's site and forums for some technical support the guys there (Who are obviously paid employees) will do nothing but praising this game and then criticize you for not liking it!!...There's a very interesting idea behind it and and a great concept, but the game just sucks because of technical issues.

												The Good:- interesting story- character switching (one stealth, one shooting)- some over the top shooting action (you get a mech)- all checkpoints are saved and can be reloaded laterThe Bad:- graphics are incredible dark and have a crap filter on top- you use night vision in broad daylight- no gamma control- performance not that great- no quicksave or regular save, only checkpoints- checkpoints to far apart, but managable- no ammo/health refill at checkpoints, only between missions- old-school healthpacks- bad audio mixing, voice gets overpowered by background noise- difficulty is a bit wonky, play on easyOverall I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It certainly has issues, especially the graphics-filter is annoying and some game mechanics are never that well explained (never used attractor bolts, as they always caused more problems then they solved), but the game provides enough freedom to allow some fun trial&error experimentation. It feels quite old-school in that regard for better and worse. It's certainly far better then the 34 Metascore would make you believe, but it certainly could have used another month or two of polish.			",735,437,45,95,85,7,124

												I got this game for less then $2 Australian . Is it the best game ever? No its not. Is it well made? Yes it is solid and stable.Is it fun? Well I say ""YES"".Will I finish it? Yes and that says something as I own lots of games on Steam.For those who like auto refill HP bars you will need to learn to use cover as you only have limited HP kits.For those who ran out of ammo, well pickup an AK for your secondary weapon. It uses the same ammo as the main gun so every other AK you pickup will give you ammo.It feels like a game from the PS2 era, but with better graphics and its story is solid enough. For $1 US its a steal for the full $10 I dont know. ",869,211,28,118,58,2,105

												Interesting concept but overall bad design.I'll start with the good,The story seems decently written, though cliche in more ways than one.Interesting mix of abilitiesFun to use weaponsGraphics are not terribleand now the bad and the reason I cannot play this game for long periods or my head would likely explode,Animations feel choppy and in some cases non-existant where they should otherwise beThe over-the-shoulder cam is way too close to the character, it felt like the devs wanted it to be more of a first person shooter with some unnecisary third person shoved inFully automatic weapons shoot like DMR's, to me this kind of killed the game, for example, the first chapter during the invasion, instead of an invasion it felt like a slow dance. Because of the slow fire speed it was much easier to pop up and get 5 headshots in succession without getting hit. This in particular made firefights boring.Movement animations are rather awkward.The autosave system doesn't save after cutscenes in many cases. This may not be a con for some people but for me it was as I do not enjoy coming back to the same cutscene everytime an enemy gets a lucky hit on me. Medkits are fed to you, this makes the game far too easy, even on hard. You don't really have to explore that much to get them either. Voice acting is sub-par, granted this is a small studio that developed the game. Still I've seen amazing voice acting come from small indie studios before and because of this I do hold these smaller studios to a higher standard than was shown in this game.tl/drGraphics 6/10Sound 4/10Acting 4/10Immersion 1/10Gameplay 4/10I recomend Alpha Protocol if you're looking for a fun third person game featuring stealthy third person action (Or straight up run and gun as you can do it either way).

												Simple 3rd person shooter, with 2 character control. Each with their own strengths. One suited for pure fire power and destruction, other one for stealth melee and ranged lethal takedowns and recon. Visuals are poor, story is absurd and naive. No AI to speak of. One of the main characters is female, which face has more polygons than an enemy soldier. I have a feeling that all the development team were busy with making the female, rather than the game. But I can't complain, she's easy on the eyes. And apart from terrible story, I completed the game and enjoyed the game never the less. Mostly because of her though. ;D			",228,36,5,24,35,0,27

												For one thing the bloom is out of control, for another there is no real AA and tons of pop-in. Past that the models, textures and general design is bland and simplistic. It's absolutely laughable the game looks like it does.Moving past graphics we have the gameplay itself. In Shadow Harvest you play a typical army macho man for third-person cover-based shooting sections and a Catwoman-style stealth chick for sneaky missions (either or, at your discretion). The shooting segments are very rough and unpolished, not only because the abysmal framerate makes aiming hard but also because the cover-system is all about walking up to walls and having it put you into cover automatically. As any first year programming student could probably tell you, this leads to the aggravating effect of you accidentally sticking to every wall or piece of environment you walk near. The shooting is also hampered by the fact that when in cover you need to hold a direction key to peek out, then also hold RMB to aim, making cover a three-step process instead of two, which is just bad design. The action is simple (shoot dudes! flank dudes! shoot barrels!) and there are glitches abound like floating weapons and checkpoints which don't update.On the stealth side the game is a little better but still not good at all. Stealth is mostly helped by not having to aim as much and the slower pace, but the game still has the same problems. Dark areas are too dark, making moving around sometimes a hassle. The levels are mostly designed to work for stealth or shooting, making it lack a real polished design for one kind of gameplay. The crossbow is not satisfying to use and you have no other ranged weapons.On top of graphics and gameplay issues the game is just very poorly presented. The cutscenes are boring, nothing happens in them. Voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard in a game, much worse than German or Russian games I have played that got quick conversions to English like STALKER or Risen. There is a guy that is supposed to be African in the very first level who literally sounds like a drunken frat boy making fun of Africans more than an authentic African. The game also suffers from a lot of console influences, despite being a PC exclusive. Checkpoint saves, cumbersome menus, the massive bloom I mentioned earlier, limited weapon capacity and more. It just screams amateur hour all through the game.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Relativ kompliziertes Spiel, das nicht gerade die beste Grafik vorweist, aber dennoch sehr interessant, wenn man sich von der Herausforderung kitzeln lässt.Zugegeben, ich habe mir deutlich mehr von dem Spiel versprochen und bin bisher in gewisser Weise enttäuscht worden. Von den Schiesseinlagen ist das Spiel anfangs garnicht verkehrt, aber in einigen Bereichen wird dem Spieler nicht sofort klar, wie er zu handeln hat um das erste grössere Problem zu lösen.Mit der zweiten, spielbaren Person wird es leider nicht besser, da Tipps und Vorschläge gegeben werden, die so nicht durchführbar sind. Man soll sich also mit der Frau (die zweite spielbare Person) sinnvollerweise nur vorwärts, aber nicht seitlich bewegen, damit man vom Gegner nicht gesehen wird. Soweit logisch, aber wenn ich gleich zu Anfang hinter einer Kiste stehe/sitze, kann ich mich nur seitlich rechts bewegen und werde zwangsläufig gesehen. Das ist zwar nicht schlimm, wenn man anschliessend ein paar Sekunden still und ruhig hinter der nächsten Kiste verweilt, verliert der ""Wachmann"" das Interesse und ""vergisst"" einen, bis man sich weiter bewegen muss.Insofern ist die zweite, spielbare Passage nicht weiter schwierig, nur kompliziert dargestellt, zumal irgendwo auch die schlüssige Kombination eines lautlosen Nahkampfangriffs fehlt, wenn man ja schon im stillen agieren soll....Wenn das Spiel im Angebot ist, macht man sicher keinen Fehler, dieses Spiel zu kaufen, aber einen Vollpreis von 19,99 € halte ich leider für zu teuer. Dafür ist die Grafik zu schlecht und das Spielpprinzip zu aufwändig, wobei es mir in der Seele wehtut, diese Rezession zu verfassen.Ich finde es toll, wenn kleine Entwickerstudios solche Schritte wagen und ein Spiel programmieren, was genau meine Genre betrifft, aber um so mehr tut es mir dann leid, wenn sie, die Entwickler, es leider völlig versemmeln.Für alle also, die wirklich eine Herausforderung suchen, den sei das Spiel, wenn es im Angebot ist, wärmstens empfohlen			",165,40,0,18,12,1,8

												Have you ever come across a game that was as bad as the hype says it was? Well if you haven't I've found the game for you. I've played valu-crap that was 100X better than Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops. I will usually finish a game before reviewing but the 26 minutes I spent on this game were enough to tell me otherwise. How this game got the greenlight might be a mystery akin to the Loch Ness Monster, UFOs and who killed JFK. The graphics are OK. Lemme rephrase that. The graphics you can SEE are OK. The game is bathed in a dull brown sheen that makes you really feel like you're in Africa...ok maybe not. The interiors...welp...good luck seeing inside anywhere. They are pitch freaking black. I tried to up the gamma so that I could see where I was going. Couldn't find it and after a minute I stopped caring. Hit detection? Pathetic. Checkpoints? Far and few between. If you die, you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because you will be going way, WAY back. Oh, and remember those dark interiors? I got stuck in a corner between a barrel and some crates? Jump out of it you say? Nope, no jumping. Get behind cover and return fire? Nope. This a shooter with cover but it's not a cover shooter. That's right. Once you get near a wall you go into cover mode. But guess what? You can't shoot anything from behind cover. Yes, really. Artificial Intelligence? An insult to the word. There were instances where I was right freaking in front of the enemy. Couldn't get me. Thank goodness for the hedgehog barriers defelecting every bullet when the AI DID try to engage me. Sorry for the longish review but this game is just bad in every way. Why I bought this, I'll never know. I don't drink (anymore) or do drugs but maybe I did when I bought this POS (for $2.00 it appears). That's too much. Stay away. STAY FAR AWAY from this game.

												I wish I could find something nice to say about this game, but really, it's just a total mess. Really everything about it is bad. Avoid it at all cost. Even in the sales, it's not worth it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has some great ideas and can be quite challenging on the hardest difficulty. Each mission involves actively switching between the two main characters at will and using their unique skillsets to complete the objectives. If you don't like these kind of ""bad"" or ""generic"" games, stay away, but for those of us who aren't spoiled gamer trash, this is worth looking into. Would also recommend Global Ops: Commando Libya.			",174,9,1,11,2,0,6

												Controls are bad. It's like if the sensibility of the mouse changes between normal aiming and aiming trough the scope. You can ""fix"" the problem by having a pro gaming mouse that can adjust the sensibility on the fly. The gameplay have a few goods ideas but everything is executed poorly and you will not care for the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game.If you already have this game, do not install it.If you have this game installed, delete it.This game is not worth buying. Hell it's not worth playing even if you got it for free like I did. In my honest opinion, this is one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games I have ever played, and I have played a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. It's like they looked at all the fps games currently on the market, threw out everything that was good about each of them, and combined all the leftover♥♥♥♥♥♥into one abhorrent abomination of a game.0/10, this game should be nuked from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.			",391,63,21,59,28,3,70

												The overall concept seemed intriquing, definitely enough for me to want to try the game.But shortly after entering gameplay, I wasn't enjoying the experience,The first thing I got annoyed with was the fact that health bars don't regenerate.It makes the combat more difficult then it needs to be and in one specific mission part, impossible!Also, the health packs to heal your character aren't numerous enough to be useful or practical.I eventually got so frustrated with having nearly no health from just one or two shots from enemies, I got bored and gave up.It is not a well designed game.

												AVOID, EXTREMELY BAD GAME Worse game I have played in a while, managed to play 15min of this game before my retinas burned out and I uninstalled the game. Just about everything about this game is frustrating, the jerky movement, blurry graphics that are constantly in and out of focus and give you a massive headache (seriously hard on the eyes) , no indication you have been hit, laughable voice acting, stupid controls. I could go on but I cba, don’t buy unless you got money to burn.			",186,5,5,4,5,0,12

												Great game to test the refund option 10/10 would refund again!ok no jokes i review it like a real reviewer now: I did not finish the game i do not know about its story cause i only played 20 minutes and then gave up and asked for refund why?this game is published and released in 2011, what year was 2011? the year which we got battlefield 3 and 1 year after splinter cell conviction release, why am i giving these games as example? well i tell you why: this game is a 2011 game and has the graphics of 1999 games your character reloads his gun like in PS1 games which no magazine or anything is removed in the anmiation just your character moving his hands around the gun. and do not get me wrong i do not care about graphics at all as long as game play and story is good but sadly it can not be said about this game, please watch a youtube video of how shooting mechanics work in this game you see what i mean so ""no comment""Project I.G.I was released in early 2000s and had mroe realistic animations and better combat than this game. ghost recon advanced warfighter was released in 2005 and compared to this game it was ""next generation"".why did i request refund over this?this game has graphics of 1999s and early 2000s games BUT i can not run it with a playable FPS on a machine which runs MGS V TPP at ultra settings with over 50 fps, it runs at maximum 22 fps or even lower because it is optimized like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so i had to deal enough with the stupid combat mechanics and horrible cover system now i had to add framerate issues to it as well. so >> refunded!

												Most idiotic game ever built, can't jump, the mission objectives aren't clear, can't skip cut scenes and got stuck at the beginning because they put a ♥♥♥♥ing tank on a timer with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover mode and no way of finding wtf the prick wants in 26 seconds.Rubbish buy.
