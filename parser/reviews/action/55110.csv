												This is not a bad game at all. Despite the fact that it's not sandbox-style like Guerrilla, it's still amazing.The ability to destroy, reconstruct and destroy again is just fabulous and I can assure you that it will keep you entertained for hours.The story is just a regular story. Fend off a horde of ugly and disgusting aliens and kill them ALL.In simple words: Collect salvage, purchase upgrades and kill everybody with style.You can choose between an impressive armory and going berserker with your sledge-hammer.Short, simple gameplay but very fun.

												Short game, but tons of fun. The weapons are some of the most unique I've ever come across, and are worth the purchase of the game. The game itself is narrow and linear, with awesome graphics (DX11) and decent voice-acting. Get it on sale and get ready for a fun 10 or so hours. Installed size on hard drive (all DLC): 9 GBThis time around, we are playing as Darius Mason, son of Jake Mason (from the film Red Faction: Origins), and grandson of Alec Mason (Red Faction: Guerrilla). The terraformer has been destroyed, driving all of Mars' human residents underground. But even deeper inside the Mars crust lies an alien threat. If that sounds Red Faction: Armageddon has ventured into B-movie / game territory, you'd be right. It's a linear shooter, with some fantastic weapons (magnet gun! though the Napalm Laser is another favorite) and decent atmosphere and graphics. While I suppose much of Armageddon has been done before, it's done well here. So well that I was disappointed when the game ended that there wasn't more to it. If you're looking for more to do after finishing the single-player campaign but don't want to play through the campaign again, there are two additional modes available. Ruin mode (destroy the environment) is a lot of fun: destroy the environment as fast as possible. You'll be able to use whatever weapons you've unlocked in the main campaign. But there are not enough maps and only two varieties: Free Play and Challenge. Multi-player cooperative horde mode (up to four players on a team), fighting waves of enemies, in either Survive (what it says) or Defend (repair / defend something while waves of enemies attack). There are eight multiplayer maps, each in two varieties for 16 maps in all. There is some fun to be had here, but with so few people playing the game, matchmaking is a problem. You won't be able to get 100% of the game's achievements without getting some folks to help you out. The ""Path to War"" DLC, now included for free, is a series of four missions that tie into the main campaign. There doesn't seem to be any reason for them to exist. Maybe the missions were rejected from the main campaign but the dev team were perhaps proud of the level design and released them anyway. The missions are fun, but it is a short, disjointed experience.I'd like to think that the dev team, knowing THQ was facing troubled times (they went bankrupt shortly after the game's release), said something like, ""However big or small our budget is, that's how big /small our game will be. Whatever. Let's make it the best game that we can."" And they succeeded, it's a tremendously fun game. If you enjoy playing it as much as I did, at the end you'll be wanting more. But there is no more to be had...			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												VALVE HAS BROKEN THIS GAME. Apparently, an update to the steam platform has completely broken new games, so that any time the game attempts to create a new save file it crashes. This was discovered by a number of enterprising users who first noticed this with a beta version of the steam client before whatever code caused the issue was also migrated into the ""stable"" release everyone else gets. There are some save files out there that you can download and continue from, but really valve is basically comitting fraud by leaving the game page up, since the it's documented that a specific update to the steam client is the source of the problem. (note, the co-op infestation and single player ruin modes do still function, since they do not generate save files)Actual review:There's a bunch of stuff online about how this game isn't as good as it's predecessor, Red Faction Guerilla. From my perspective, that simply isn't true. I admittedly have a somewhat unusual point of view, since I played Armageddon first, but the improvements to the central mechanics of this series mean there's really no going back. In Guerilla, you can destroy just about anything in a variety of interesting ways based on the actual structure of whatever it is you're destroying. In Armageddon, this degree of endlessly entertaining destruction is maintained, but it's just as easy to REPAIR those items, even if they're damaged the first time you see them. Guerilla is also an open world game, whereas Armageddon is quite linear, but while I usually appreciate open world games, I guess guerilla is old enough now that it just seems...empty, outdated, and boring. It took me about 12 hours to finish the main campaign of Armageddon, and while it's a much shorter game than Guerilla, I wasn't bored at any point. It left me wanting more, which led to the relative disappointment that was Guerilla.			",121,31,1,3,8,0,38

												This is a very good game. The reviews on it made me anticipate pure trash but I ended up enjoying it just as much as the original. I think you should go into this and treat the game as it's own, not a Guerrilla sequel because it's far more linear.Pros: Inventive Weapons, Cool upgrades, Enemy variety, Geomod Engine, Decent mission variety, Better salvage system than in Guerrilla(IMO), Badass missions with Spider Walkers and Mechs. Cons: Occasionally braindead AI, Awful upgrade station placement (Seriously, one was placed at 44% Story progression when the new tier of upgrades came at 45%...Seriously Volition?), Crappy enemies(aliens jump around everywhere and they deal low damage so they're typically just annoying pests), Linear			",957,273,58,134,112,11,185

												Red Faction Armageddon is a suprisingly good game that unfortunately saw only tepid performance in the marketplace.  The DirectX 11 visuals, physics engine, wide variety of weapons as well as a multiplayer/co-op mode make for a solid third person shooter.  Where the game fails however is in it's lackluster narrative and on the rails play.  The game feels very linear, which is a disappointment after the open world experience of Red Faction Guerilla.  With that said however, there is enough good gameplay and solid voice acting to make this game an enoyable but flawed title.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												My first Red Faction game was 2, followed by Guerilla - I really, really enjoyed both.There have been a lot of negative reviews for this one, but most of those compare Armageddon far too strongly (and unfairly) to Guerilla. Notice that this game is called Red Faction: Armageddon, NOT Red: Faction Guerilla 2.That being said, if you are a fan of the series, like third-person action shooters, and environment destructibility, then you will really, really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are great, with absolutely fantastic environmental destruction depending on what weapon you use. The music and sounds are good. The story is decent, plot and gameplay progression is considerably more linear than Guerilla's open-world freedom, however, you should not be coming in to this game expecting it to be Guerilla 2. The controls are easy to familiarize yourself with and the learning curve is minimal to moderate. There is a horde mode that can be played local co-op or online multiplayer (or even solo) that is extremely fun. You unlock the levels you beat and can start at whatever wave you have unlocked. Solo playthrough is fairly challenging but doable if you keep practicing.There is also a destruction mode that is insanely fun. You can choose whichever weapon loadout to use (you can swap weapons by going back to the equipment console) and just destroy everything in the environment. The magnet gun is amazing - shoot two (applicable) areas and the lighter object will fly toward the heavier one. Most of the weapons available will easily cut through most buildings and materials. You can play without a time limit or try the challenges - clearing the level within a time limit.If you like third-person shooters with a lot of action and colossal amounts of destruction, give this game a try.Highly recommend!

												Red Faction: Armageddon was quite a surprise.I got it way back in the THQ Humble Bundle on December 6th of last year, and up until now went unplayed. What a fool I was not to have tried it until now! It's a great game, and to have gotten it in a bundle? *mindblown*Armageddon is a Third-Person Shooter that puts you in the shoes of Ex-Red Faction member Darius Mason on the surface of Mars. After a series of events spanning a few years, you are set on the path to stop a madman from destroying the planet. Along you way you will face thousands of alien lifeforms hellbent on your demise.But do not worry! You have plenty of weapons with which to arm yourself. The most notable of which is the Nano Forge, a glove-like apparatus that can not only project a burst of force ahead of you, knocking back anything in its way, but can also repair ANYTHING in your environment. Found an Upgrade Station or Weapons Locker, but accidently blew it up in a battle against aliens? Come to a broken bridge that halts your advance? NO PROBLEM! Just use the Nano Forge's Repair ability to fix everything right up in seconds! You will definitely make use of this tool because literally about 98% of what you see on screen (terrain, buildings, etc) can be blown to bits. Other nifty weapons include the trusty Shotgun, 2 different sets of twin pistols (standard Pistols and later the significantly more powerful pair of Banshees <3 ), and even a Singularity Cannon, which fires a mini black hole which sucks in all around it, then explodes! One of the mose useful tools, but one that some might consider the game's way of ""holding your hand"", is the GPS. Simply hit tab and for a few seconds a path will be lit up showing you the way to proceed. For people who like to figure things out on their own, this may seem an annoyance or a turn-off, but for others who prefer the action, shooting, and storytelling, this won't be a problem at all.As you play you will collect Salvage, which you can use to buy upgrades, which range from more health, faster reload times, extra Nano Forge abilities, or increased damage and effectiveness with certain weapons. There was even an upgrade that awards you Salvage when defeating enemies. The game will reward you salvage for exploring your surroundings, as you will find some in dark corners of each area. Just look down every path and around every corner!All-in-all, Red Faction: Armageddon is an exciting shooter, which you will enjoy til the very end. The only downside is that I was able to complete the campaign in just under 8 hours, so it's a tad on the short side. But there are multiple game modes (like New Game Plus) and even a multiplayer I believe, to take the game further. I cannot comment on these because I just played the main campaign though.Highly Recommended ",1534,600,45,244,159,15,219

												Even if you're ok with this being nothing like the previous game this is a big disappointment. They decided to focus on combat this time which would be fine if it was satisfying. Unfortunately you spend most of the game fighting insect creatures which are only tedious to fight against. Even the biggest strenght of the Red Faction series, environment destruction, is mostly ignored towards the last third of the game when you're stuck fighting in a series of tunnels.It's not a horrible game, just completely mediocre and forgettable. I would just replay Guerrilla if you're in the mood for Red Faction.			",466,221,7,63,49,7,69

												It's easy to see why a lot of people didn't like this game - Guerilla gave you an open-world and some really cool weapons to play with whilst this puts you into a corridor/tunnel and throws insects at you pretty much constantly.As a linear shooter it's actually pretty decent - the enemies aren't just dumb targets, you'll need to move and use the right weapons at the right times etc. - but all of the demolition from earlier games is a sideshow here and whilst the nanoforge 'rebuilding' stuff is a really cool effect, it's role in the game is even less central (it's a minor puzzle element at best)So as part of the series it's a let-down, but as a 'bug hunt' shooter it's actually fine - expectations adjusted, you'll probably enjoy it.

												This a decent 3ps with a bit of horrorish touch. The storyline could be better though.Pros-> Destructible environment, use it to your advantage.> Repair ability, use it to create makeshift cover and stuff. Also undo whatever destruction you wreaked so you don't have to pay fines.> Semi rpg like sort of level up system (you use loot points to add new abilities).> Decent length.> All the exotic guns are pretty much designed to aid the kill-your-enemy-using-environment thing.Cons-> There are still bugs and some graphical glitches.> Missions are too linear without any side quests or multiple routes to complete objective.> Mostly corridor like segments with little room to maneuver.Overall it is good shooter but not worth the current price tag. Try it out when it is on sale very cheap.P.S.- I got it for just 1.63 USD at our local game store. So try to get retail versions, they are waaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper.			",392,102,7,40,34,8,45

												Well, if you're looking for the amazing sequel to the open world masrterpiece that is Red Faction Guerilla, you're not gonna like this, sorry. Though the descruction inspires hope that the game will be entertaining or at least fun, it's a linear mess. The shooting mechanics are much improved from Guerilla, but if you were shooting in that game you were doing it wrong. You were to be inspired by what you saw around you to take down your enemies and in this game you're just kinda following the orange line and while the destreuction is there and looks fine, it has nowhere near the impact it had in the last game. Also, the game won't allow 21:9 aspect ratios even though the last game did, so if you have an ultrawide like myself, you will be looking at a streched version of a 16:9 image. Pls just buy Red Faction: Guerilla over this game.			",91,3,2,4,4,1,0

This is the first positive review I've done in a while, Jesus.Well then. This is it.I honestly didn't know what to expect. Red Faction: Guerilla was pretty fun, but the story was very... simple. Boring almost. The Multiplayer was a lot of fun, due to drunk friends, playing hide&seek and destruction. After more than a year, I decided to buy Armageddon for 2.49 on the encore sale.Basically, what Volition with Red Faction: Armageddon did, was:Everything that was missing, is now here!And now, let me elaborate. (This is where the review starts, get hyped)General World Design: This is probably one of the biggest pros. The worlddesign is non-repetitive, detailed and story-fitting. Yes, that's noticable. The fact that you can destroy everything you see makes everything even better. ""Use the world to kill your enemies"". Remember Battlefield 4s ""Levelation""? This game does it better. A lot better. Not scripted.Story: Well, a zombie alien apocalypse outbreak mysterious ancient♥♥♥♥♥♥on Mars. That's it, and I am not going to spoil you about the story. I will try not to. That might sound boring and mainstream (especially on the zombie alien apocalypse outbreak part), but it's actually kind of addicting. I couldn't stop playing to be honest.Weapons and Equipment: We got Mars stuff. We got normal stuff. Lazer pistols. Rocket launchers. We also have nano-robot-grenade launchers and tissue destroying grenade launchers. And shotguns. Can't go wrong with a shotgun.Let's be serious, the weapons and the equipment are plain awesome. Come on, we got magnet guns right here. Magnet guns. We finally have a repair tool aswell, to repair all the things you break. In single player and multiplayer. That's a necessity by the way, you'll use it a lot.Gamemodes: Well, we got Single Player, Co-Op Survival and Co-Op Protection. But let me give you a heads up: You WILL just run around destroying every building and playing around with the environment. Co-Op is insane fun. Like, INSANE fun.  Destruction. Magnet guns. Many zombie aliens. And to top the gamemodes off, we have FREE DESTRUCTION MODE in SINGLE PLAYER. Yes. Destruction without a timelimit. That was the biggest contra in Red Faction: Guerilla, because it didn't exist. BUT IT DOES NOW.Level system: Exists for both Multi- and Single Player. And guess what, the skills you have earned and bought in Singleplayer (It's all in-game-currency [you get that mostly from destroying things {this game has no micro-transactions. No windows live. It's all good.}]) work in Multiplayer aswell. Same the other way around. So, if you are stuck in Singleplayer because you happen to play on Hard or Insane, and you want that one ability that would save you from everything but you cant afford it, do some survival with your best buddy and you'll have it in no time. And the abilities in this game are awesome. It's like having the force. For example, a plasma wave that destroys everything in your path, or a shockwave that stuns your enemies, lifts them up in arcs of electricity, kills them slowly or allows you to smack the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them. Every enemy is liftable. No enemy is too heavy for the magnet gun either. Last but not least (actually very much least after all that awesome sh!t)...Graphics: Textures look horribly upscaled on 4K. Alright on 1440p. Perfect on 1080p. Framerate amazing. Everything good on the performance part. Anti-Aliasing exists. Let's be honest, what did you expect me to say about the games graphics? Just can check that out yourself. You have the internet.Red Faction was always known for having the best destruction. And here they go again. Still here with the best destruction.In the end, this game should be a solid 9/10 for anyone who likes what they see here.Anyway, I hope this helped. :)			",128,9,9,5,3,0,0

												What the hell  happened?  How do we go from the greatness of Guerrilla to this?  All the things that made Guerrilla great have either been completely removed or limited to the point that they aren't fun.  There's mechs in the game, but only one and it's not fun to use.  There's building destruction, but all the structures are barebones and there's no enjoyment in taking a building apart and watching it crumble.Crashes regularly at save points and cutscenes.A linear mish mash of generic mindless shooting of mindless bug swarm enemies.   Open world has been stripped away for a linear straight forward path.Not worth your time regardless of cost.  Awful game.			",250,52,0,11,7,0,5

												I literally could not finish this game.  I'll admit the rebuilding and magnetic gun thingers were cool, but the rest of the game is a flat linear corridor shooter that wishes it was Doom 3 or Resident Evil.  The plot is painful and the combat is repetitive when it isn't unfair or tediously frantic.  GeoMod is utterly wasted in this game, mostly used for stuff that a scripted destruction could have done.  It's limited too: unlike the first game, which also took place in the cramped tunnels in Mars' surface, you CANNOT blow up terrain.  No making your own tunnels to get past the tedium, because that would let you bypass the riveting on-rails experience.This is the worst game in the series, worse even than Red Faction 2.  It's ironic, given that this has some of the coolest advancements in what GeoMod can do.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												I will say one thing about this game: don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and deny it's good aspects purely because it's not open world like Guerrilla. If you've ever liked a linear, story driv- well, oriented shooter there's no discernible reason you won't like this. It might not touch your heart strings as much as say, Gears of War ('cos we all know how much of an emotional roller coaster that piece of overrated♥♥♥♥♥♥was) but it's got everything you need in a story and that's an incentive to play the game. The actual gameplay is pretty good, I enjoyed it at least. There's a variety of weapons, although you'll find your best suited 4 and probably won't use any others much after a while. Destructible environments are always fun and no one does them better than Volition.The repair... erm, thingy is not just a gimmick, it's not only a workaround for the occasional issue with destructible environments whereby you accidentally destroy the way forward but they've also made it actually useful by allowing you to repair cover and certain other things that are necessary to progress. I realize that was more than one thing but all in all there's not a lot to say about this game except don't be deterred by the fact that it's not open world like it's predecessor. That is my only reason for writing this review so just give it a chance. Who knows, you might find yourself enjoying it a little... scary thought for some I know.			",182,19,8,8,1,1,4

												Yeah, when you click on new game it crashes. But I searched online and found a trick that works fine. So you could try it too . Just download beginning save game and click continue, that will bypass new game, and actually start new game. So I think that would be really helpful to you :)			",52,4,0,2,2,0,0

												This game deviated from the more open world predecessor. The more linear storyline, however, has a decent script and quality syfy acting, and the controlled environments make for some interesting shootouts. A wide array of weaponry provides variety while destroying the games destructible environments. New Game Plus enhances the games replayability. Altogether a worthy addition to the Red Faction collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story-driven action-shooter that take place on Mars.Pros:- great arsenal (lighting gun, rail gun, plasma launcher to name few)- spectacular micro black-hole launcher- Very nice UI- you can destroy almost everythingCons:- most of the time you shot alien bugs rather than cultists- lots of cutscenes- DLC gives only few missions			",278,80,11,52,39,4,70

												By itself not a terrible game. As the most recent sucessor to an excellent franchise it was a bomb. The last red faction greatly broadened the scope of what red faction could be and this linear garbage shoved us right back into the box.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ups: -Terrain destruction is amazing-Infestation Mode is intense and can get challenging -Variety of weapons (however some of them feel useless compared to others)-Aliens are generally fun to fight-Some of the guns are freaking hilarious to kill aliens with (Magnet gun anyone?)-In the few short missions that you use a vehicle, you feel unstoppable and badass.Downside:-Quite Short gameplay time, no openworld exploration (apart from free mode, which is just a tiny map)-Can be repetitive in some areas, especially when the same aliens keep popping up.-Game crashed once or twice when I pressed a button in game.-Can feel like it's all going way too fast (might not be a bad thing in your case)Conclusion: I've only ever played Armageddon and Guerilla from the Red Faction series. I found Guerilla to give me more entertainment since it was open world and the destruction you caused wasn't limited to a level. However, Armageddon still gave me a solid 8-10 hours gameplay offline, which only included the campaign, a few infestation levels and about an hour mucking about in free roam. I have not tried Online and there are plenty more things to do in offline mode (achievements, secrets, harder difficulties, etc.) Graphics wise the game was OK. I was playing the game off a new-ish laptop and everything ran fine, however I don't think graphics are on par with games that came out around the same time. But hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?I definitely recommend this game to any one looking for intense FPS destruction game. I payed $5 when it was on sale, however I think the original price of $20 is worth it, especially if you can get some friends in on it. Rating: 7/10			",316,48,14,51,27,5,56

												The basic mechanics – Geo-Mod, guns, camera, movement – are all intact and sound, but Red Faction Armageddon can't think of anything better to do with them but an hours-long, inescapably linear, exhausting slog with no sense of pacing whatsoever and a laughably pathetic storyline. This game might feature the best sniper rifle I've ever had the joy to use, but it still somehow manages to suck all the fun out of killing things.			",194,73,1,27,17,1,23

												Download size: about 8 gigabytes if I remember correctlyPlay time: about 8 hours (with the DLC)Red Faction Armageddon (RFA) is the latest in a series of games made famous for their “destroy the environment” gameplay. Like its predecessors, in RFA you can use your sledgehammer or guns to blow apart basically anything that is “manmade” in the game. This includes walls, bridges, and entire buildings. You can’t break through “natural” obstacles like cave walls, the floor, or most rocks on the ground. A lot of people I’ve spoken to seem to think that RFA is a step down from the previous game Red Faction Guerilla, but I like RFA more. For one thing, it’s much more straightforward and action based (Guerilla was an open world sandbox game like Grand Theft Auto on Mars).You don’t need to have played the previous games to get into Red Faction Armageddon since this game takes place a generation or two after Guerilla. Now the “Red Faction” is the legitimate military of Mars and you’re one of them (in the previous games they were rebels). In RFA you play Darius Mason, an engineer with an artificial intelligence computer companion named Sam who helps you out, like Cortana in the Halo series. Your enemy is Hale, some kind of cult leader who tricks you into unleashing an ancient alien race sealed deep underground. The rest of the game is spent trying to fix your mistake.RFA is a third person “over the shoulder” shooter game with a variety of weapons and “super powers.” The super powers are part of the Nano Forge technology that Darius wears on his wrist and can get you out of any jam. You have Impact (a force push), Shockwave (lifts up enemies around you), Berserk (some kind of damage buff), and Shell (an area effect shield).  All of the powers share the same cooldown bar. Money in the game is “salvage” just like Red Faction Guerilla. Salvage is glowing junk that is left over when you blow stuff up and can also be found just lying around. You mostly spend the salvage upgrading your character, but you can also unlock cheats like infinite ammo or vehicle weapons (guns that are usually mounted on vehicles but you can now use when walking around). Speaking of vehicles, there are a bunch of times when you get into an EXO suit or an assault walker and run around blowing stuff up with your heavy weapons. In the Path to War DLC for the game, you spend most of the time in vehicles. The DLC adds about 2 hours more gameplay and a few easy achievements. I haven’t tried the multiplayer much since the game has been out long enough that nobody’s playing online anymore. You can use the “Infestation” game mode to grind for more salvage since Infestation shares the same unlocks as the single player campaign. Any upgrades you buy in Infestation (except cheats) can be used during the campaign and vice versa.  Infestation is a survivor mode where you just kill waves of aliens, which get more powerful as you progress. It can get boring fast though, since you don’t really get penalized for dying (and there’s nobody to play with). Pros:+Excellent graphics and story. The aliens are freaky looking and it’s always fun blowing stuff up. The game mostly takes place underground, but there are a lot of buildings that you can bring crashing down. The Nano Forge can also repair broken things, so if you accidently destroy a ladder or stairs, you can rebuild it in seconds.+In one playthrough of the game you can unlock most of the skills, and there is a new game+ option where you can start over, keeping everything you bought. During the second playthrough you’ll get enough salvage to unlock all the upgrades you missed, plus a couple of cheats, which can be used for higher difficulty levels. The cheats do NOT disable Steam achievements.Cons:-Multiplayer is dead. You won’t find anyone to play with online unless you set it up beforehand.-Like most over the shoulder games, you might get a headache the first few times you play. It varies by person though, and you’ll get used to the perspective eventually.Overall, the game is great and you should give it a try if you haven’t already. A lot of people probably got this game from the THQ bundles back when THQ was going out of business. The main game takes maybe 7 hours to beat, so you can finish it in a weekend and rake in a few Steam achievements while you’re at it. You get about half the achievements just playing through the game one time.  ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												First impression.This is what happens when you take something that is good and try to make it mainstream. Red Faction Guerilla was one of my favorite open world sandbox ""GTA style"" game, and that's saying alot, since there's only a handful of those games I find most of them boring and repetitive. Admittedly, even I was eventually bored by the RFG singleplayer over time simply because that genre does that to me. What Armageddon does is basically take all the good parts of RFG, but turn it into a bog standard, linear corridor third person shooter. Remeber destroying damn near every object to gather salvage? Don't bother with that here, as salvage is only found via pickups and exploding barrels, essentially discouraging environmental destruction because you need it for cover (and using the repair mechanic, while pretty nifty, seems a tad inefficient when it's destroyed as soon as you rebuild it) and encouraging the typical ""blow up the red barrels"" trope that has existed since Doom. Some how, Red Faction: Armageddo makes environmental destruction boring. How can that be possible? The sound assets feel lifeless - you don't hear buildings creaking as much when you destroyed most of its support, guns don't have any ""oomph"" to their sound feedback, destruction, especially with weapons that disintegrate objects is so quick that they feel more like magical or technical teleportation spells than actual explosions and deconstruction. Despite the quality of the game assets, the game just has no character, even down to the typical  ""soldier needs to save the day plot"". I messed around with the Free Mode, which gave me access to what I assume is end game weaponry, and even those weapons, such as the Plasma Beam, Rocket Launcher, and SINGULARITY CANNON had barely mild entertainment value at best - the gunplay is absolutely boring and is puzzling, as it was so good in RFG that I loved playing the multiplayer for the gunplay (I actually used the guns more than the Sledgehammer or backpacks, which brings me to another point that there aren't any backpacks!). Even the assault rifle feels weak, damn near useless, and not competent with head shots (my bullets always miss the dot on the crosshair, and it still takes like 5 headshots to kill a standard grunt)There's a multiplayer horde mode that looks ok, but practically nobody is playing this game any more and there's plenty of co-op shooters to play on PC. Thankfully, I got this through a bundle so I think I only technically paid less than $1 for this. I can't honestly recommend this, unless you played all the other good 3rd person shooters to death and just want something else to play, or you like run-of-the mill modern, third person shooters and would like to play one with a slightly interesting destruction/repait mechanic. Everybody else should not bother.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												well, this game took a step backwards....we went from RFG and it's sandbox nature to RFA which is very linear.  However, the game does still have some interesting level design, once you get out of the first couple of levels.  The story was actually better than expected.  darius and Kara were the only characters i really cared about, and thats fine because they were highlighted more than others anyway.  I did find myself using many weapons throughout the game, and not so much just the sledgehammer like i did in RFG.  In this game the weapons seemed to be more balanced, and considering there is more z-axis fighting, you might need some long range weaponry to aid you here.  Sorry, no jet pack like in RFG.  All in all a solid game, worth a run through, and the co-op is pretty decent too.  The DLC was pretty forgettable though.  Felt like levels that were cut from the basr game and reinstalled as DLC.  Plus, the first DLC level in the canyon just kept going forever.  Base Game; 7.0/10DLC 3.5/10			",74,4,2,2,3,0,2

												Red Faction: Armageddon still offers beautiful and amazing destructions as they were in Red Faction: Guerilla, but this game is more linear, story based. No open world.Anyway, I enjoyed the campaign, I liked the new main character Darius Mason (grandson of Alec Mason from RF: Guerilla) and, of course, I had a lot of fun DESTROYING EVERYTHING I SEE, so I would recommend it to you too.7.5/10			",555,116,30,35,27,9,49

												Let me take you back in time, to my youth of 2010. I discovered Red Faction: Guerrilla at my local Internet Cafe after school. I sat there, enjoyed myself as I destroyed literally EVERYTHING I could see. The game was a masterpiece, a beautiful black diamond amongst an unholy horde of♥♥♥♥♥♥coming from Infinity-Ward in the form of Call of Duty this, Call of Duty that, and Call of Duty blow it out your♥♥♥♥♥Moving along to late 2011. Walking to school, and I look to the bus stop across the road from my house. New poster day, interesting. On the other side of the two-sided poster wall: Red Faction Armageddon. ""A new one? WOW!!!"" I thought to myself.A year or two later, I get this game on Xbox. Yeah, bit slow, but I wasn't exactly rich. Anyway, play through it, and I'm like ""but, where are all my destructions and my booms and my bangs and whats this annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥on my arm that keeps telling me what to do?""So things I liked about this game:- You can repair♥♥♥♥♥♥ This would have been great in the previous game, because I lost a few missions because a ladder I had to climb broke. EDIT: Thanks to abedsbrother for informing me of the repair function in RFG. Still a pro on RFA because thats where it was first introduced.- You get this super cool futuristic nano-gauntlet that can blast walls to kingdom come at the touch of a button (Mjolnir, you have been replaced). When fully upgraded, you can zap bugs into the air, launch♥♥♥♥♥♥for miles, activate a shield around you, and go Rambo- I mean Beserk.- DUAL WIELDED HAND CANNONSThings I hated about this game- Theres less♥♥♥♥♥♥to destroy. Like literally, cmon man I wanted to see a giant ♥♥♥♥ing tower fall and destroy half of the town, not walk around some ♥♥♥♥ing pitch black cave that sucks balls.- The world is no longer open. This legit means you are walking in one path. Constantly following the story. No fun to be had because no fun allowed. Zero replay value.- DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC DLC[/stike] Well at least they aren't Payday 2 but if they wanted to revive the franchise, remake this game only make it a ♥♥♥♥ing open world dip♥♥♥♥♥.

												Decentu enough game although the plot kinda ruined it for me. Still some of the mechanics do make it feel fresh but at the same time to removal of free roam and mindless destruction hampers to the destruction physics which made Guerilla so much fun. To be honest I would recommend sticking with Guerilla but if you get a coupon or this game goes on sale then it doesnt hurt to play it.			",361,84,9,53,60,2,97

												Actually, after playing Red Faction : Guerilla, i was expecting  a game in same conditions (open world, destroying buildings, killing soldiers, burn the mars, etc.) but that was different type. Anyway im not angry or sad because of this. That was fun. Story of the game is not bad, Insane difficulty is really hard and tough. By the way, everything still destroyable, but after a couple of hours, same enemies start to boring player. Bosses are not hard, but annoying. If you want to buy, also can buy dlc. Its giving just one or two more hours gameplay. Generaly  i can give 7/10 for this game. Try to buy it when it will be on sale.			",66,4,3,4,1,0,0

												Red Faction: Armageddon is... DullLinear, boring, cliched and utterly dissapointing are the words which jump to mind. This FPS action title is the follow up to the hugely successful Red Faction: Guerilla, the open world masterpiece. Sadly, someone sitting in the finance department must have decided that the strings needed tightening and that they should pursue an on rails FPS, and everything went♥♥♥♥♥♥up from there sadly. There should be a strong story here, which follows the Red Faction universe, but instead theres a shadow of a story and a ton of bugs. There should be a ton of destruction and some great hammer battles, but instead theres a limited field of a play to smash up and then little to no reason to whip out the hammer.So the key question.. is this even worth purchasing? Honestly, the campaign is quite long and it's not the most awful game I've ever played, maybe. So I would suggest a purchase price of no more than £3.

												Red Faction Armageddon is a third person rail shooter, and even if i'm not a fan nor a vet of the gerne i really enjoyed it.The narrative is actually good enough, surely the plot is not amazing in itsef, but thanks to a good mix of badass, funny (thanks S.A.M.) and dramatic (in particular THAT dramatic moment) well written lines and moments it really becomes a very pleasant experience, (the absence of secondary quests or other errands which could break the ""flow"" of the main story may also be a plus in this regard). Most levels also have a very good atmospheric feeling.The gameplay is very solid, you have bunch of very different weapons at your disposal (the magnet gun, you never grow tired of that:), plus the distruction mechanics (i think is the best i've seen in a game so far) really let you solve the various challenges you have to face with different approaches, also boosting replay value. Also a nice character progression is implemeted and you may upgrade Darius' gear and abilities proceding in the game.On the technical side graphics are very good, in particular the explosion looks gorgeous, and the performance were fine. I've not expereinced any glitch, bug or crash (but other rewiers instead did).Once you finish the story you have a story+ option that let you replay it with all your upgrades and special weapons (ever dreamed of disintegrating your enemy with a rainbow ray coming out from a pony's♥♥♥♥♥ I didnt but whatever) unlocked from the start.There are also a singleplayer destruction mode that can be a lot of fun and a very good multiplayer coop survival mode (even if recently might be hard to find players online).Conclusion: I really enjoyed this game (completed the main story 2 times and i'll probably come back for more sooner or later) and i surely raccomend it to anyone which is interested in pleasant, linear, story-driven shooter experience.Useless comparison with Guerrilla (if you are not interested in sterile debates or stupid comparison skip this section)Comparing Armageddon and Guerrilla really dont makes much sense, one is a story driven linear shooter while the second is an open world TPS (you have to free a bunch of outpost, assault a bunch of convoys etc.. when you are done move to the next sector and start again)... i played both and i would surely choose Armageddon over guerrilla... but that really depends on your personal tastes.

												Fantastic and very underrated sci-fi game,and overall-Red Faction is very underrated game series.I'm guy who haven't played Red Faction Guerilla,but a lot of people who played both game says that Guerilla is better,so if you're thinkin about buying Red Faction Collection-you won't regret it.Originally,i played Armageddon cca 4 years ago while i was pirate. Nostalgia was strong for this one,so i decide to replayed it,no matter i have one hundred games in my library which still needs to be played.Game is located on Mars in distant future,where you'll have to fight 2 enemy factions,with a goal to correct fatal error which almost lead Mars to extinction.Main reasons why you should buy this game is destructible enviroment and very unique weapon arsenal. You will enjoy causing destruction by creating black holes xDBesides classic shooting,you will also be able to drive futuristic tanks,''IronMan'' suits and fly futuristic warplanes.Another amazing thing about this game is nanoforge system-battle system which gives you more options to fight hordes of enemies-and best of all,it allows you to repair damaged or broken structures.Besides destruction,you might enjoy repairing things you destroyed.Storyline is linear,but very interesting.i won't say nothing more,i won't spoil.Bad things about this game is kinda short-storyline,it took me cca 9 hours to complete it. For example,Lost Planet 3(which i consider Red Faction:Armageddon rival game) took me 2 times more,cca 18 hours.I don't know if it's due to my gaming skill,but game difficulty seems kinda easy,i completed insane difficulty without any bigger problems.Multiplayer is dead,so if you're planning to play it,you'll most likely have to search for your allies on forums.I think developers could and should put grenades in this game.With so much different types of weapons,they wouldn't miss if they added throwables.I'm giving 8/10 to Red faction:Armageddon - and i highly recommend it.

												Red Faction ArmageddonRating 7/10Overview: Linear Third Person ShooterThe Good:+ Varied locations, despite taking place on Mars every location feels unique and varied. + Good sense of pacing, the game introduces new vehicles, enemies, weapons throughout the journey to keep things fresh+ Variety of different weapons that are very unique and fun to use that fit different play styles. + Like previous Red Faction Games, this game features impressive building destruction.   + Solid controls  + Destroying buildings, killing enemies allows you to gain salvage which is used to upgrade your character, weapons and abilities + Infestation Mode (Horde Mode) allows you to fight wave after wave of enemies. The Average:Ruin Mode allows you to destroy environments within a time limit to score as many points as you can. It is a great idea that seems very underutilized given it only has a handful of maps. The previous Red Faction game had the same mode but it was much more fleshed out in its execution so this was a bit of a disappointment. The game has a lot of enemy variation but it certainly doesn't feel that way. For most of the game you will be fighting the same 3 types of enemies over and over again. Main campaign will take around 6 hours to completeThe DLC is decent but also very short. The levels are not as well designed as the main campaign.  The Bad:- The story is decent if a bit simple in its premise, it doesn't feel as developed as it should and serves more as an excuse to kill hordes of enemies. Given the location and history of Red Faction it seems like wasted potential. - Multiplayer achievements which are now almost impossible to obtain. ConclusionI can't recall another series that has had more changes each entry than Red Faction. The first game was a linear first person shooter similar to half life. The second was a level based first person shooter with bosses. The third was an open world third person shooter. This game is a linear level based third person shooter with upgrades. At this rate its only a matter of time before we see Red Faction the real time strategy game. This is a good game but plays it entirely safe with its gameplay and design. The potential is here for something special but never achieves it.    ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Red Faction Armageddon looks like a sci-fi shooter game. Red Faction has been made of one of my favourite game developers when I was a kid; THQ. When I first time played the game I was already starting at the battlefield to hunt down some rebels. In the game you can carry up to four weapons max. The game starts with two weapons: a Maul, an assault rifle and you can find more weapons in the same level as well. At the first mission you will also have a hand that could repair the damaged objects in the environment, but the hand can only repair in a close distance between you and the damaged objects in your surroundings. In the game you can purchase upgrades with the salvages that you can find somewhere around in the game.The game takes place in the peaceful Mars. The peace there was threatened, because of the rebels who wanted to avange the loss of their boss. His family was killed by an important person of the military. This turned out a war with the military and the rebels. And there was also an another problem: at a mysterious wise turned out: that there were Aliens in a underground cave.My impressions of the game.	The game looks in my opinion a bit like one of the games that was made by THQ, meet the Robinsons on the Wii. I came to that impression by one of the boss fights with Adam Hale and in the Robinsons Mega-Doris. Pros and Cons of the game.Pros:-	The graphics of the game is modern-	The gameplay is so amazing, that you most of the times can forget how late it is-	Lots of varieties in weapons-	The hand repair function is amazing to useCons:-	The game looks a little bit like meet the Robinsons on the Wii-	The game needs more varieties in Aliens-	You’ll sometimes die randomlyI'd say buy this game only if it is in a sale for a nice price.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												Red Faction: Armageddon is an action packed third person shooter which follows up from the previous Red Faction: Guerrilla game and continues the Red Faction story line. However, this time the game sticks with the third person view from Guerrilla and also drops the open world concept and is linear like the first original two games. The storyline and missions are still fun as ever and works out well even though the amazing open world from Guerrilla is gone. The gameplay is pretty standard, but lots of fun and you also have a new nifty magnet gun and some powers with the Nano Forge which sometimes make you feel like a superhero or a Jedi. Once again the highlight of the Red Faction series is blowing stuff up, and you can blow up all the structures and also repair things since enemies will often be attacking you and stairs and other things you need to access will be gone. Lastly, there's an Infestion (Horde) mode which is tons of fun where you have to stay alive and fend off all of the enemies. Overall, this game is a lot of fun and is not like the previous game, however for what it is - you'll have a blast playing by blowing things up and fighting off evil cultist and aliens. I spent around 12 hours beating the story and also the DLC campaign (super short) and playing around in Infestion mode.Note: If your game crashes during checkpoints in DX10/11 Mode, turn Shadows OFF. This worked for me and the game never crashed again since I did this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[7/10] - Red Faction games in general have a unique style and feeling that creates a very familiar, yet fun and creative experience for everyone individually.  The destruction is fantastic, and the replayability just because of that is very high. However, I feel they didn't deliver as best as they could have with this title. The physics, story and gameplay are all excellent, however it just didn't deliver as hard as expected. That aside, don't overlook this game altogether as it still has some fantastic moments. I definitely recommend you play this at least once if you're a fan of any Red Faction titles.			",381,70,2,36,24,3,66

												I don't like buggy aliens, and more buggy aliens, and even more buggy aliens. The game just felt really dull to me since fighting the same TYPE of enemies got so repetitive. Also the story felt almost non-existent. I just found myself running in dark areas fighting off similar bugs not even remembering why I was in the cave in the first place. My opinion might be a bit biased since I'm not a big fan of FPS games in general, but this game is probably the only game that I didn't enjoy at all. I respect the opinion of people who actually liked the game, but this is just not my cup of tea.			",73,18,3,7,4,0,9

												This game is a lot of fun to play. Between all the different and cool weapons and powers to use there is going to be something that you will have a lot of fun using. The only real downside of this game is when they lock you into a vehicle section and then the game becomes point and click at everything that moves for a half hour. But yeah, save for those sections there is a lot of fun to be had in the combat. I'd even argue that the main character is funny and witty to a degree. The story... exists and the sound design is good enough. All in all this game gets a great recommendation from me just from how great the gameplay is and that is really all that should matter in games really.Did I mention that the combat is fun? I don't think I said that yet. Seriously though it's great.EDIT: oh yeah also the horde mode style co-op is pretty fun if you can manage to get some people together to play it with. Hell, it's not that bad solo depending on the level.			",155,11,3,16,6,2,5

												Red Faction: Armageddon is the Fourth game in the Red Faction series and the first game of the series I have played. The game is played in third-person, both as a single player campaign and in multiplayer mode. The story revolves around Terraforming operations on Mars and hostile Martian creatures who attack your Terraformer. The environment is destructible which is a departure from a lot of shooter-type games, and makes Red Faction particularly fun to play. Visually speaking, Red Faction: Armageddon seems pretty average for a shooter, though it was released in 2011. The story doesn't seem all that deep, but you do get to blow stuff up and rampage out, so I suppose like a hollywood movie, if you can't win them over with story, just add explosions. I give it a thumbs up, though I think there are better Shooters out there with more depth.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Firstly, I must say devs choosed very different path for Armageddon than for Guerrilla. From open world to more linear story based game. I personally appreciate it, because i like games with this style - game and story have better pace and it's more thrilling, at least for me. But the second reason is that developers have shown that the Red Faction can offer a great variety of gameplay styles, stories and just new ideas. Because I would be honestly disappointed if this series should end up like Assassins Creed with its repetitiveness.Positive:-nice graphic design with destructible environment-great soundtrack-wide weaponry-Infestation mode(its just about destruction)Negative:-short campaign playability-a bit too high price for basic game			",92,3,1,5,11,0,26

												If you came here looking for epic destruction like in Red Faction: Guerilla, you're going to be dissapointed.The story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I almost fell asleep playing this. They want you to care about these characters, but they do an awful job of building them, not to mention the main character, Darius is insufferable! From unfunny jokes to constant ♥♥♥♥♥ing, chances are you won't end up liking any of the characters. And also, there's basically poop for exploration. Remeber the awesome, unique zones in Guerilla, where you had to discover the old map? Nope, not here. Just hit tab to guide you through the whole level. Not like there is anything to explore anyway, because the whole game takes place in one way caves!			",47,27,0,0,3,2,2

												Pretty bad game.Incredible linear and boring overall, I liked the ""twist"" but its even more boring.I mean it says alot if I can just rush and dont bother with enemies while it feels like that guns suck and they so want you to use your hammer or explosives that are of course totally strong. Needing half a magazine of an assault rifle to kill a guy isn't good design while the meele can 1hit and is super fast. I played on hard and could rush the new enemy faction easily. Partly just skip them even..The only good thing are the graphics and that everything is destructible but meh, I played Red Faction Guerilla and it was open world and had alot of activities and variety while here its just a linear mess that also has alot of technical difficulties and crashes. Just go play Red Faction Guerilla, it offers the better gameplay by far and has no crashes.			",201,15,2,33,24,0,43

												Frankly speaking, not as enjoyable as Guerilla. Personally I'm not even a fan of open world games, but RFG gained a lot of being one because of all the destruction you could do and all of the ways how. Not to say that this game doesn't have it. It does, but it's limited to corridors and ruins. The only ""up"" side it has over it's predecesor it the Magnet Gun. It's really fun to use even in the limited areas. That being said, it would have been way more enjoyable if this game was also an open world one.Other than the general setting, the game play seems fine. Not an expert on shooting, but some of the guns felt appropriate (nano forge ones) while some not so much (heavy stuff like rocket launchers). Enemy variety is not all that huge. Most of what you'll encounter are bugs, more bugs, bigger bugs, shooty bugs... You get the idea. There is the occasional human enemy, but they're far too few in far too apart.Vehicle segments feel a bit clunky. Shooting is fine, but the movement is a bit chaotic. It was clearly designed for the console first.The 'powers' you have seem a bit out of place as well. For some reason you can control The Force. No idea what went through their minds when they made that option.There's not a lot of replayability outside of NG+ which gives you two new weapons, but can't really speak on that matter.With all that said, the game is not boring. Started playing and never stopped until I beat it. Sure, the campaign might not be the longest, but I don't know what you expected of a corridor shooter. At least it's not a cover shooter. Here you use the cover to kill your enemies (with the magnet gun).			",136,10,1,20,14,0,11

												Linear as is most liearly-possible. I'll try not to compare, as Armageddon is a game in its own right of course, but it is, however, part of the Red Faction franchise... so I'm going to compare anyway. To start: why? I'm utterly amazed by design decisions that went into this game. RF Guerrilla is an open world, near sand box-destruction, action-shooter. Completing RF Guerrilla, I thought ""Wow. Great game. The next'll be even better! It'll be in a dense, grimy, overpopulated martian city! Yeah! I'm going to be able to bring entire sky-scrapers to the ground!"". Nope.GEOMOD 2.0Of course, the destruction engine is fantastic. Any better than Guerrilla? Collapsing structures have an effect on camera, and deal varying degrees of damage to enemies and you, according to their size/weight. This aspect I feel has improved from RFG as there feels like a real weight hangs behind each structure and destroying one is both a satisfying and almost awesome experience. Why almost? Well, I've seen it. Done it in RFG; this game makes no attempt to scale up from its predecessor, and if you havn't played RFG, then destroying small structures that are verticaly impared, (Of course they're going to be; The game's set underground), will get pretty old, very quickly. That's another thing; the game's setting just doesn't allow for the exploitation of this franchise's destruction engine! I mean, what good is blowing up stuff if you can't see more than 3 meters ahead of you!! The game doesn't even allow you to manually activate your flashlight! Overall, this destruction engine is just wasted, and it's easily the best feature of the game.NARRATIVEBah I havn't even completed it. Honestly, I got bored. That might speak volumes to you, about the game, or about me in fact, eitherway, I washed my hands of the story instantly. It's good in short bursts; I've been on and off the game, but I'm in no way hooked. It's the destruction engine that keeps me playing the game.GAMEPLAYYour standard 3rd-person perspective; the camera is of good distance from the character and worked well without any issues.Good god- Agile bullet-bags! All of them! Small arms weapons, such as your pistols, assault rifle, shotgun, are all just a bit...meh. There's no stopping power behind them, and that's hugely unsattisfying. Enemies dart around, in and out of sight, usualy never bieng able to hit you or, for that matter, doing any real damage. They feel merely time consuming and tedious, for the most part, thanks to frantic AI and pea-shooters for weapons. This isn't the case for all weapons however...""AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY, GOD CREATED THE MAGNET GUN"". Truly, there has never been a more fantastic, utterly enjoyable, gun in gaming history. Got a big fella getting all up in your grill? That's ok; Bring down the very building that he stands in, on top of him! Attatching a...err...clamping node first to whatever you desire, you may then fire off an attractive node somewhere adjacent to the clamping node; the clamping node, and the wall/enemy/debris to which it was attached, will be violently accelerated accross the map towards the attractive node. Chaos, death, destruction, follows. Wonderful! As I've said before, the game features primarily underground sections-this makes the game a bit dull, in terms of locations and scenery, and does not aid the linear gameplay at all, as I found myself quickly bored by the overall atmosphere of the game. The game has Exo suits that you can hop into. They're barely worth a mention; yes you're unstoppable, and a badass, but that gets boring when you're an unkillable, unstoppable, badass. Bieng unkillable, actually, I consider, is the opposite of bieng badass; What's the point of it all?! I played on normal, the reccomended setting, and this game has yet to challenge me. Enemies just feel like a tedious filler, much like all the scenic walks through the game's martian underground.Have I mentioned that the game is increadibly linear? Oh. Yes. Ah.Perhaps they were going for a more...atmospheric and cholsterphobic Red Faction game...If that is the case, they do not focus on the darker elements of the game enough; the main protagonist wipes out any trace of grit about the plot immidiately, enemies are not to be taken seriously- they are mere insects to you, only to be crushed completely and utterly with ease. With this game's setting, it could have been a horror; the enemies look terryfying enough and there's plenty of corpses strewn about. The lighting is dark and moody, and yet, these features were never focused upon; the game does nothing in the way of building any tension. Yes, this isn't the Red Faction I wanted, but this concept... It's not done well, in many of the aspects the game claims to be about. To round up, (Well done for reading this far), I'd like to say that this game is a setback for the Red Faction franchise; the design decisions that are present baffle me, in comparison to Red Faction: Guerrilla, and in some cases just downright backwards. The game's predecessor aside, Armageddon itself is just boring, samey, and needlessly restricted in many aspects. The engine's destruction is good, fantastic, in fact, but that's all I've really got out of this game. Without Geomod 2.0, the following rating would have been far worse.5/10. Worth a 90% off, for the somewhat restricted spectical of the Geomod 2.0 engine, but otherwise, buy Red Faction: Guerrilla. ",131,6,0,20,7,1,17

tl;drThis is a good game and worth the money you pay for it (even more so during a sale). However, the only thing it has in common with Guerrilla is the physics and shooting mechanics, so don't expect it to be Guerrilla++ and don't buy it if you don't like linear shooters that you can complete in a day.ReviewI have heared many bad things about this game, and I therefore never bothered to even look at it. That is until I got this during a sale where I bought all red faction games as a package. I thought I may as well give it a try, and I was not disappointed. I have to say it's a really good game however it is nothing like Guerrilla, so don't judge it by the same standard.This game is a shooter with the physics mechanics of Guerrilla. The story and progression of the game is linear. I find it quite welcome, but I know others don't. That's OK, but I don't feel the bad critique it has recieved is jusified.I like the small improvements and details they have added to the game, e.g.: repairing structures, the new weapons, the improved upgrade mechanics, and the fact that you can pause cutscenes. The controls also feel very solid and it's a good shooter.All in all I think this is a good game and was totally worth the money I paid for it.			",79,6,0,4,6,0,1

Finally after several minutes of clicking, the game starts (why now???). At the second or 3rd autosave the game returns to the main menu again and no amount of coaxing allows me to go on.

												Warning:  You may want to avoid buying until the ""New Game"" crash bug has been fixed.I would give this game a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.  This game is nothing like Red Faction Guerilla.  This game is far more like Gears of War.  I agree with others who have said that this game would have been better received, if it had not carried the Red Faction name.A major con of this game, at least for the time being, is that there is a serious glitch which prevents you from playing the Single Player campaign or DLC without loading another persons save.

												Would have been a fantastic game on it's own. But since it has the title of a ""Red Faction"" game I was expecting more out of it but ended up dissapointed. You are underground for most of the game and on top of that you are ALWAYS in mission! And being able to free roam in the other game was what made me love it so much! You could go about the missions at your own pace. I played the entire game all the way through in hopes for a free roam at the end, but I was let down. So if you have played ""Red Faction Guerilla"" and loved it you may be a little dissapointed with this one. But It's still very fun on it's own, it just shouldn't have been a red faction game with no free roam/sandbox qualities.			",43,5,0,4,5,0,3

												Every time when I play a game serie I try to play each game one after another. I did it with the Red Faction serie. The 1st game was great, the 2nd was terrible (that was my 1st negative review), the 3rd was amazing and the last one was... hmm it is very hard to describe.If you think that the Red Faction Guerrilla is a good game, if you love the open world in the RFG then probably at the beginning in the RFA you will start think WTF is that? Where is open world? Why I can't drive a car? Bugs? Really?Probably you will delete the game and write a negative opinion but you can give the second chance for the game and then you will realize, it is quite good game (if you will not compare it to the RFG every time =P)The game give a lot of fun and a massive number of guns. Also, it give you 4 (or 5) abilities like shield, berserk mode etc. You have to do only one thing in this game.... KILL ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING BUGS AND SAVE MARS.			",97,14,3,8,12,1,21

												Gameplay is samey, characters are ridiculous, story has a lot of plot holes. Destruction is excellent. It's unfortunate the game will let you play through the whole way with very little destruction (If you entirely use guns), when attaching magnets to enemies or detonating entire environments ends up being mostly more satisfying.

												Awful.  Just awful.  Primary reason for it's awfulness is stability.  This game will crash almost every time you hit a checkpoint, so you have to complete the entire section leading up to the crash over again each time you reboot from the crash.  This happens regardless of what alleged ""fixes"" you apply.Aside from that, the game is a corridor shooter in which the camera is glued to your right shoulder.  It's a claustrophobic view that only lets up slightly when you sprint, and your endurance is that of a 68 year old, 300 lb life long smoker, so you can sprint for about 6 seconds.The first few hours are tolerable, aside from the constant checkpoint crashing, then it just devolves to the seventh floor of gaming hell.  Endless waves of enemies.  Less and less frequent upgrade stations the more you play.  Said stations only allow you to upgrade to certain tiers after reaching arbitrary points of the story.  Speaking of the story.  It's another component of the awfulness.  The events are predictable and cliched.  The dialog is sarcastic and annoying.  The characters are 100% forgettable and consist primarily of your sarcastic♥♥♥♥♥ your ""straight man"" AI companion, and a token black guy.I'd say the only saving grace is the combat, but considering it's just average, only slightly better than Guerrilla, and surrounded by the crap that the rest of the game is comprised of, it's not a saving grace.  Just a minor distraction from the rest of this exercise in patients.Oh, and the climactic battle of the game is a ♥♥♥♥ing  stationary escort mission that lasts 20 minutes on normal difficulty ",224,33,4,15,8,4,5

												Great cathartic potential marred by every technical bug imaginable. Graphics bugs, physics bugs, freeze-ups, crashes to desktop and disappearing sound are so common they're infuriating. When the game actually works, it's a pretty decent third-person shooter with great destructive enviroment gimmick and well paced combat. Poor checkpoint placement and linear levels aren't really a problem since the game is well aware of its strengths and always throws something new, be it a new weapon, turret section or putting you in control of nearly indestructible mech and telling you to go nuts.But again, frequent stability issues kept breaking the flow of the game and ultimately made me quit. If developers didn't care enough to fix these bugs in a 3-year old title, why should I ? Terrible PC port. Get it  on a sale or even better, play Red Faction Guerilla. A much better, albeit open-ended experience.			",294,114,2,34,23,2,39

												The game is above average, it has solid action, controls and sound design. It also retains the long running Red Faction theme of being able to destroy just about everything, but this time you are also given tools that can fix any damage done as well, which was sadly underutilized.Characters are nothing special or memorable, the story itself has a good sense of humanity on Mars being overrun by monsters, but pacing itself feels uneven; othertimes it feels like taking too much time in one place and others seems to progress at breakneck speed.The conclusion is also solid and doesn't really leave any unanswered questions, just an open ending of what happens next.However, the biggest reason this game is not as good as it should be is simple; Red Faction Guerrilla.Where RFG was an open world action adventure game that brought the game leaps of new ideas and gameplay to work with, Armageddon takes steps back and turns it into a linear 3rd person shooter.If this gameplay mechanic had been done after Red Faction 2, it would have had more success but for whatever reason they chose to alienate many fans of RFG by going back to generic action formula.This does not make Armageddon a bad game, far from it; the game is very enjoyable when you just want to have a fun shoot'em up with fully destroyable terrain with a pop corn movie feel.It just cannot escape the shadow of its predecessor nor bring us the same level of enjoyment.I recommend this if you can get it at a discount.

												Great game. Story is interesting, somewhat linear, but ties into the lore and key plot points from the other Red Faction games. The voice acting is good, visuals are fantastic and the gameplay is really, really fun. Plenty of vehicles and walkers to use and the gunplay is the best of the series. Fans of Red Faction Guerilla will enjoy the continued emphasis on destruction and will appreciate the new weapons (and the return of some old favourites). Whilst some may be disappointed by the decision to go back to a linear campaign rather than an open world, from my point of view it was a compromise they made into order to change the environment and make the gameplay work in regard to fighting the alien race known as the 'plague'. I don't think fighting in tunnels and caverns under the surface of Mars lends itself to an open-world campaign. Red Faction Guerilla was a fantastic game, and had open world elements, but it was in no way 'open world' in the way we see it nowadays in games such as GTA V, Fallout and Skyrim. You could traverse the entire map and mess around, but the missions were all in set locations, were very similar and the objectives did not vary greatly. Anyway, I love every game in the Red Faction franchise, Armageddon is no exception. Thoroughly recommend purchasing it as the campaign is a blast to play through - one of the best singleplayer experiences I have had to date. I have a lot more hours than what is shown, but played the game whilst Steam was offline so they weren't recorded :(			",51,0,0,3,4,0,21

												Do not buy this game. I thankfully didn't (in a fashion), having gotten it as part of a THQ humble bundle (which I bought for Saints Row The Third), and so my rage at this game was far less than it would have been had I spent my cash on it. So what's wrong with it? It's a horrible sequel for one. Where Guerilla was a open world Sandbox that let you wreck tons of stuff as you pleased, this game is completely linear with basically no freedom of action. Guerilla didn't have an especially strong story, but the one here is even worse, with almost no likeable characters (especially not the main character you play as) and one of the few I did sorta like getting abruptly killed off late in the game. The gameplay is fine, but the other factors here helped to ruin the game for me. Also it's extremely short (Yes I beat the game with those hours played). If you like Guerilla, just stick with that and pretend this game does not exist. Trust me. It's for the best.			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												Coming from someone who has never played another Red Faction game, I actually really enjoyed this game for what it was. The semi destructable environments with some intersting weapons made the game enjoyable and I got my monies worth from the game. Even though it was certainly the most linear shooter I think I have ever played, the gravity gun and ability to reconstruct my environment kept me coming back for more.			",59,6,0,0,1,0,11

												To this date, this is the last game in the Red Faction franchise. It has performed rather poorly in sales and it's easy to see why.There is no more revolution or fight against oppression (which would mean human opponents), in it's stead - bug-like aliens take place. It reminds me of Alien Swarm or Alien Breed but with a much higher level of quality and that AAA feel to it. It's a rather decent game with the physics and destruction being improved, some very nice weapons and fairly challenging difficulty. The storyline isn't bad. In fact it's much better then any of the new blockbusters.A special place holds the music in my mind, it's not only a new style for the franchise, but a very well made artistic move that revolves around a more claustraphobic environement - like the first Red Faction and second Red Faction games to a degree.It feels as if the identity on first glance changed, leaving nothing but the destruction aspect as a standing-out feature. In the end THQ went bankrupt and Nordic games took it's place releasing a little bit of content for free. Thank you Nordic Games!The style is much too different. But don't be fooled by that, it's still a worth conclusion to a story that went on for 10 years with an amazing aesthetic value.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												Red Faction: Armageddon focuses on destructible environments. The player must reclaim cultist fortifications on the disaster-ravaged surface of the planet and defend colonists from hostile Martian creatures in the ancient mines and chasms beneath it and cleansing infestations from all structures.Using the Magnet Gun, Darius, the main protagonist, fires first at one object, then at a second object, and then the first object rockets toward the second.The Nano-Forge returns, having been passed down through two generations of the Mason family. Darius' father has incorporated the tool with a function that reverses any and all destruction dealt to man-made objects. The Nano-Forge will also feature an ability known as Impact, which discharges an incredibly powerful burst of force which can blow away structures and throw enemies off their feet.Darius' Nano-Forge, weapons and armor are all upgradeable, improving their efficiency, unlocking new abilities, and altering their appearances.

												Red Faction Armageddon is a decent game, but what really kills it is its lack of content and it's disappointing story. The gameplay mechanics are a little better comparing to Guerilla but it does not take it far to the point that it makes the game better. The story campaign is somewhat short while the new protagonist is very obnoxious. The cool things that I have to admit about the game are the weapons as they are pretty satisfying and fun to use. Overall, I won't say this game is great, but it is very decent while the fun factor lasted after you've beaten the story. I won't recommend it to anyone who have no qualms of hating games that are dry and flat like this one.Hey! They've finally managed to fix the crash issue of New Game+! Now we can play trough the game again with our previously used weapons.			",107,0,6,13,3,0,0

												This game feels like it was made by talented developers following a checklist, with no regard to how the game will be received and whether the end result will be any fun. They were told to make another entry in the Red Faction franchise, so they did, got paid and moved on. I'll skip ahead and say that this game really should not exist, and it's not fun after 3-4 hours in.The game's campaign is roughly 10 hours long, even on the highest difficulty. Most of the game is spent fighting the same 3-4 enemy types in same-looking caves. The protagonist has a ton of health and regenerates quickly, the enemies are mostly armed with peashooters, and fighting them is about as difficult as playing a cow clicker game. Most of the environment is so generic and forgettable, I couldn't recall most of the game even immediately after I finished it.The destruction engine the Red Faction series is known for is there, but roughly two thirds of the environment are indestructible. Regardless, wrecking the destructible parts of the environment while enemies are in/on top of it is virtually the only fun aspect in the game.Literally every level in the game is at least twice as long as it should be, dragging on so much that I had to take breaks to do something else in order to stay awake. You would think that destroying the environment inside a walker mech armed with infinite missiles never gets old, but it does - every single vehicle scene repeats at least twice, involves no challenge and no risk of dying, and consists of mashing mouse1 for 10 or more minutes.While you can technically have fun in the game if you play it in short bursts and don't treat it seriously, the final 3 levels are disgustingly bad and *will* make you hate it. It feels like THQ told Volition the game should be at least 10 hours long, and they struggled to add enough filler to hit the 10 hour mark.There is a reason this game sold so poorly that THQ decided to terminate the Red Facton franchise. Good riddance.			",139,35,0,11,9,2,36

												As the follow-up to Red Faction: Guerrilla, the game essentially takes everything that made it's predecessor interesting and fun and throws it out the window. Buy Guerrilla and don't play this.			",169,27,1,22,10,1,14

												This Series is one that is well Engrained into my childhood, many wasted days on my old Playstation 2, Happy to buy the entire series during the summer sales. Not personally the biggest fan of Guerrila, but many did.This game in particular, was my absolute favourite. I played the title on 360, graphics were nice and the gameplay was unreal. Have replayed since here on PC and I've loved every moment. Gameplay literally hasn't changed, but the Graphics have made it a new experience, not to mention it's been a couple of years.BUY THIS GAME ON SALE!			",51,0,0,1,2,0,0

												well I played like half of the game so here's my review so farStory: pretty generic just like the predecessorsGameplay: WAY more linear than guerrilla, but with more diverse enemies. Armageddon is a third person shooter compared to guerrilla's free roam gameplaySound: Good, the music fits well, weapons feel decent and monsters don't sound half bad, voice acting is pretty good as wellGraphics: improved from Guerrilla, holds up today, can run on most rigs due to good optimizationSTRONG POINTS: -Destruction system which is a trademark of the Red Faction series works very well here as well, being able to use a magnet gun to take down structures and throw them into enemies (or vice versa)-Varied arsenal & upgrades system gives the game some slight replayability and gives you things to use in any situationWEAK POINTS:-Campaign has a very short length, I played 50% of the story within 3 hours-Multiplayer is pretty much dead, not a lot of people online-Moving can feel weird if you're coming from Guerrilla or the other RF's, since sprint is limited and jumping has a delayGet this game on a sale, or pick it up along with the others in a pack. you WILL have lots of fun with this if you like toying around with physics and such			",131,7,1,6,8,1,3

												★★★★☆This ! Now this was a awesome game ! It's great fun destroying and repairing the objects in the environment , need cover ? Rebuild a broken down wall ! Need to get a shot at a enemy but there is a wall in the way ? brake it down! Ah and the parts you get to use the mech suits are awesome, just walking around mowing down those pesky bugs ! Anyways XD got a bit off topic there, cool 3rd person shooter, cool story progression, nice ending (feels a bit milked out toward the end though), but all in all a really nice game , It also has a Killing Floor like multiplayer mode, where you and a few friends fight against waves of bugs to see if you can last through the onslaught. 4/5!!!

												Pro:Magnet Gun is one of the most entertaining weapons ever.Solid graphics.Repairing power looks cool and offers more freedom.Player is far less fragile than in Red Faction: Guerrilla.Gathering scrap isn't an annoyance anymore. Con:Utterly obnoxious use of cutscenes and walking slowly while talking.Checkpoints despite this being the 21st century.Sound issues for many players.Very short (7 hours).Headache-inducing menu.Overly dark levels that feel oppressive in a bad way.Occasional flawed level design.Repair power is underused.Awful vehicle sections (excavator, lava boat).Lack of enemy variation.A few annoying enemies are bullet-sponges even with fully upgraded guns.Mostly boring skills.Completely linear.Moronic story.Due to ammo limitations you'll probably use the same guns throughout the entire game.ConclusionRed Faction Armageddon takes one step forward and three steps backward. It introduces a few nice elements but cripples the game by taking away player agency through constant cut scenes, linearity, imbalanced weapons/skills and some of the most boring vehicle sections ever. Red Faction: Guerrilla was more generic but it also offered more freedom, more fun and more excitement.			",256,101,3,49,17,2,66

												Personally, i think it's good game hate seeing it having mixed recent reviews. In the future this will be one the games people end up avoiding and missing out on because of opinions and personal hardware failures of idiot gamers/reviewers dropping the positive rating to mixed or negative. It's not the game your hardware has to be the problem. I've beat the game twice once on medium low gfx settings and on my new rig once at max settings never have I seen it crash or freeze. So if you got a problem it's not the game.As for people complaining it isn't open world well no sh*t Sherlock doesn't even state that on steam to be. Why would you expect it to be? Only 1 open world red faction in the entire series...... That was guerilla......  So drop that epic fail out of your review.As for game review not based on bias opinions or sh*tty system configs that cause game crashes.The game it's self is solid bit short lived if you rush through it, rather than taking your time and enjoying the crazy weaponry. Destroying and the rebuilding things. Story is bit off compared to previous red faction games, this one went from fighting the power tripping mars goverment to fighting aliens and extinct races. Co-op side is more survival then anything, there is no story co-op mode so that was a bit of a let down for me at the time i bought it.Challenge modes is ok I didn't mess with it much whats the point with cheaters on the leader boards, but other then that pretty much like guerilla destruction challenges.Plenty things to unlock you'll have to play through it twice to unlock everything (including the cheat unlocks for weapons unless you cheat to get the cheats I could have but I enjoy working for things)Anyone with less than 10-12 hrs play time in reviews is based on bias opinions. They haven't even got the magnet gun yet which i might add reminds me of the gun in half life 2 except way cooler lol....If you unsure or just want a casual pass timer buy it on sale.DLC couple extra guns I enjoyed them but i leave that up to you.....

												Warning, this review may contain spoilers. I wasn't paying close enough attention to the story to tell you if any of the events were foreshadowed or not. Read at your own risk, since I'm not recommending the game, I don't think you're missing much by seeing some of the minor plot points.It's hard to write an in depth review about this game because it does so little that is new or unique. This is essentially a by the numbers over the shoulder shooter and will fail to keep the attention of those who don't find the ""story"" interesting or capturing, but few are going to be really captivated by it.The games gimmick is that you can destroy areas of the world and rebuild them again using some magical nano builder gizmo that apparently only you possess. I wasn't paying close enough attention to the story to figure out if they ever explained why you're the only one with one of these tools. While it sounds interesting on the surface, the destruction tends to feel unsatisfying after the first few times. Most of the time when you are actually noticing the destruction physics going on around you, it is because an enemy with an explosive ability has destroyed the area you were standing on and then you get to rebuild it later once you've defeated them.Enemy variety is fairly limited, and the environments while pretty, are fairly boring to look at and consist mostly of being in tight corridors or in an enclosed outdoor space. Very rarely is there ever any wide open areas. You get your basic trash enemies that you spam the melee key to get rid of, the typical flies around and is annoying but not really dangerous enemies, and then the takes a bunch of ammo to kill enemies that have more powerful attacks. It doesn't get any more complex than that. Some of the enemy designs blend in quite nicely with the environment, and while they tried to add special effects to make them stand out, they were sometimes unsuccessful to make them visually distinct from what they are attached to.Mason has to be one of the dumbest and unluckiest protagonists I've seen in a video game. He's repeatedly tricked, knocked out, and captured, and he repeatedly runs into situations without a plan, without backup, and without thinking things through, often cutting off the recommendations of his personal assistant computer which is trying to give him good advice. It's hard to feel sorry for him and hard to feel connected with him or his plight, which seems to be mostly self inflicted. If anyone on the entire planet of Mars had a few brain cells they could have probably resolved the entire story of the game within 3 days of the introduction.The primary mission objectives are to destroy something, fix something, run around in mazes killing enemies, kill all the enemies, and escort vehicles through heavily scripted events. Most of it is in the guise of him being a good guy and helping out, but a lot of it just feels tedious and forced, just padding out gameplay length. The whole game can be rushed through in about 6 hours if you feel like it, and it isn't terribly hard even on some of the higher difficulty levels. Difficulty curve is fairly flat other than an occasional spike and a hard upwards curve at the end of the game where they throw everything they have at you.Most of the weapons feel unrewarding to use and enemies act like bullet sponges until you begin upgrading. The weapon variety is decent, offering you some fun toys to play with, but you'll likely pick the weapons you like in the first half of the game and never venture out into the newer heavy weapons that the game gives you. Ammo for the heavy weapons tends to feel as though they are giving you very little of it, or way too much of it, depending on the situation. You'll need to keep some of the standbys with you anyways because while the game lets you choose any four weapons, you don't want four heavy weapons. The fire rate is too low and the ammo too limited.There are some fun mech segments in the game, and the unlimited ammo gets put to good use, but it makes you part with the suits too quickly for that high powered, bullets actually kill things feeling to last. Generally you're walking around at a modest pace, and going from place to place takes time, often more than I'd have liked, giving the game a plodding feeling to it. There is a sprint mechanic, but it doesn't last very long and has a moderate recharge time before it can be used again, leading me to believe it is more for panic events than travel. The dodge mechanic feels slightly clunky as it is tied to the jump key, and while useful in some situations, I didn't find myself using it very much.You are given a GPS which always shows you where you need to go, and the pathfinding for it is top notch, working around broken obstacles, or pointing out the path even in there is something broken that is required to advance. You'll make good use of it should you choose to play the game.If you're looking for an over the shoulder shooter that lets you shoot things, has some pretty physics and decent graphics and audio, but not much else, this is right up your alley. If you're looking for something that a plot you can, and want to follow, and something that isn't going to get boring after a few hours, then you should look elsewhere. If this game suffers from anything, it's being too average and mundane.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It rips off Dead Space like crazy but the horde mode in this is probably the most fun I've had in one in any game. Combat in this half is half projectile based, half physics based, meaning that you can use a special gun to literally rip a ceiling down (Including hundreds of uniquely modeled debris with it) on top of an alien then blast them to pieces while they're pinned with the assault rifle. Like wise you can launch enemies through walls, ceilings, blast the floor out from under them, etc. Very entertaining combat system with a huge and destructive arsenal, polished performance for a Volition game on PC, and large campaign and suite of multiplayer options means that whenever this goes on sale it's worthy of your attention.

												No, it's not what you wanted after Red Faction Guerrilla, but it's still a solid game. Game makes pretty good use of the destructibility, resulting in some very unique weapons and tactical situations for a third person shooter. The alien designs, graphics and voice acting are all pretty decent.If you've ever enjoyed a third person shooter this is a pretty interesting and fun one, and really shouldn't be passed over just because it left behind the open world stuff--the vs aliens gameplay in this game wouldn't have really meshed with big open playground maps.Didn't play the multiplayer I'm afraid so no comment there.

												This game has a black-hole gun and lets you crash through buildings in a giant mech while those buildings crumble and collapse in real time destruction.  Every weapon past the standard pistol/rifle/shotgun trio is designed specifically around how much damage it can wreak to the environment as well as the enemy and  once you're done destroying those environments you can rebuild them for navigation purposes which removes all the constraints that would normally apply to enviromental devastation. If you need anything more than that, then you're doing videogames wrong.			",333,19,6,42,4,1,6

												This is an odd game to recommend on Steam mostly because it doesn't have a neutral option. For fans of the Red Faction series, do not buy this game. It will shatter any love you have for the franchise because of its interactive environments, diverse enemies, and deep storyline, because this game has none of those. It is easy to see why, with the incarnation of this game, that the Red Faction series is no more. If you don't understand what I just said, Red Faction is dead, and Armageddon killed it.On the other hand, if you take the game for what it is, and ignore the Red Faction stamp at the beginning of the game, stand alone this is a good game. Not game of the year material, or ""OMG do you remember that game we played 5 years ago?"", but still a fun experience. Best part about it by far is the magnet gun, you can have hours of fun tethering two enemies together to their death. The story is decent, graphics are good, and you even get a few mech moments. All in all, if you can get past the idea that this should have been a good addition to the Red Faction franchise, you would like this game.			",213,57,2,21,21,2,19

												They ditched the ""revolutionary"" storyline from RF: Guerilla for more of an ""end of the planet"" scenario. That being said, it feels like more of a true sequel to the more-linear originals RF 1 & 2 than the open-world destruction simulator that is RF: Guerilla.ALIENS. THERE ARE FINALLY ALIENS ON MARS.I mean they've always been there...just...locked away...for...story purposes? Anyway, kill aliens the way they deserve to be killed - using Thor's Hammer, Mjolnir!Just kidding, but you do get a giant ♥♥♥♥ing hammer. Name's Maul. It destroys everything.E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, like you're in a Michael Bay movie. A++ physics engine.If that's not your weapon, then use a Banshee Pistol, or dual wield the Banshee Pistols, or use the EDF Enforcer, or Laser Pistol, or Magnet Gun, or Marauder Nano Rifle, or The Infamous Mr. Toots! or the Napalm Laser, or Plasma Beam, or Plasma Cannon, or Plasma Thrower, or Pulse Grenade Launcher, or the Rail Driver, or Red Faction Arc Welder, or Red Faction Assault Rifle, or Red Faction Shotgun, or the Remote Charge Launcher, or Rocket Launcher, or Singularity Cannon, or the XNG-5000. Seriously, if you can't find a weapon then you're being a big baby.Move from location to location annihilating alien scum and scavenging for scrap metal. Use the scraps as points to upgrade your character.Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane difficulties are available.New game plus unlocks upon completion.Personal Rating: 8.5/10 A solid and brutal science fiction third-person shooter with a phenomenal physics engine.

												Any game that gives you a maul for beating things up is a good game in my book. This is a standard action-shooter, closed world, with nothing too special in its pallette, but adds in the fascinating realm of a mostly destructable environment. The game focuses heavily on its two strongest components: destruction and reconstruction. Both are fun and useful, and repairing a bridge as you walk across it feels a lot like the scene from X-Men 1 where magneto summons steel plates to form a bridge. Worth about 8 hours of pure fun gameplay, and 2 hours of purely hellish gameplay when the last two levels contain absolutely no destructable objects. Get it on sale, play on Normal, and have fun!

												I don't get the hate with this game. Maybe it's just noobs that try to run it with windows 98? Idk. The game was a tad bit slow but after about an hour I REALLY started to enjoy the game. With a much better story line then the last RF and no boring open world. I was hooked until the end. And I can't believe that I got this game and the DL for $2.67 or whatever it was on the steam sale. I feel as if I robbed the company lol. The game ran great on my pc, had nice graphics, and I loved being able to destroy everything and then rebuild stuff as well. A very unique game with a great amount of replayability. After you beat the game you unlock multiple weapons included a unicorn that shoots magical lasers out of its♥♥♥♥♥and a bunch of addition cheat codes to play with if you want to play some more. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good single player expierence. 8.5/10			",116,5,0,2,5,1,2

I recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person shooters and destrution based games.			",31,1,0,0,1,0,2

												It rips off Dead Space like crazy but the horde mode in this is probably the most fun I've had in one in any game. Combat in this half is half projectile based, half physics based, meaning that you can use a special gun to literally rip a ceiling down (Including hundreds of uniquely modeled debris with it) on top of an alien then blast them to pieces while they're pinned with the assault rifle. Like wise you can launch enemies through walls, ceilings, blast the floor out from under them, etc. Very entertaining combat system with a huge and destructive arsenal, polished performance for a Volition game on PC, and large campaign and suite of multiplayer options means that whenever this goes on sale it's worthy of your attention.

												This is an odd game to recommend on Steam mostly because it doesn't have a neutral option. For fans of the Red Faction series, do not buy this game. It will shatter any love you have for the franchise because of its interactive environments, diverse enemies, and deep storyline, because this game has none of those. It is easy to see why, with the incarnation of this game, that the Red Faction series is no more. If you don't understand what I just said, Red Faction is dead, and Armageddon killed it.On the other hand, if you take the game for what it is, and ignore the Red Faction stamp at the beginning of the game, stand alone this is a good game. Not game of the year material, or ""OMG do you remember that game we played 5 years ago?"", but still a fun experience. Best part about it by far is the magnet gun, you can have hours of fun tethering two enemies together to their death. The story is decent, graphics are good, and you even get a few mech moments. All in all, if you can get past the idea that this should have been a good addition to the Red Faction franchise, you would like this game.			",213,57,2,21,21,2,19

												Any game that gives you a maul for beating things up is a good game in my book. This is a standard action-shooter, closed world, with nothing too special in its pallette, but adds in the fascinating realm of a mostly destructable environment. The game focuses heavily on its two strongest components: destruction and reconstruction. Both are fun and useful, and repairing a bridge as you walk across it feels a lot like the scene from X-Men 1 where magneto summons steel plates to form a bridge. Worth about 8 hours of pure fun gameplay, and 2 hours of purely hellish gameplay when the last two levels contain absolutely no destructable objects. Get it on sale, play on Normal, and have fun!

												This game has a black-hole gun and lets you crash through buildings in a giant mech while those buildings crumble and collapse in real time destruction.  Every weapon past the standard pistol/rifle/shotgun trio is designed specifically around how much damage it can wreak to the environment as well as the enemy and  once you're done destroying those environments you can rebuild them for navigation purposes which removes all the constraints that would normally apply to enviromental devastation. If you need anything more than that, then you're doing videogames wrong.			",333,19,6,42,4,1,6

												I just can't get enough of using the magnetic gun and laughing while I making aliens or cultists fly around or getting showered in debris!I tried the other guns, but they are completely underpowered compared to the magnet gun, when 100% of the environement is destructible and you can make whole building collapse under your enemy, or send an entire building in pieces towards it, or make it fly far in the air, or make it fly in lava, or make it fly towards another enemy, or make it fly towards you to send him flying back with a pulse.I don't really have anything bad to say about this game, sure I didn't really use by nano points to upgrade my powers and weapons as I never used the other guns but it was so much fun to wreck havoc that I don't have any problem with it, even if I finished the game with around 7,000 that I didn't need.The only troubles were the crash on new game, which is fixed with the beta patch, and the crappy field of view which can be fixed with a mod.

You can relieve stress while playing but try not to get stressed when game sends you from one place to another all the the time, when the hell breaks loose on you.

Its is to drive the game forward though been a liniare game now.Graphics: The game boast's DX11, destructable enviroments and amazing set pieces. A well rounded games with some intresting pieces.Gameplay: Average 3rd person shooter with♥♥♥♥♥♥to blow up. A nice collection of epic new guns to play boom boom with.Overall, the real times destruction would not be enough to win me over but huge bosses, an array of new epic guns such as the magnet gun and so on help keep RF: A an extreamly fun game. Whilst no wear near as good as Gurrila its worth a purchase if you loved Gurrila but wanted to shoot aliens i guess.I have still to try the multiplayer.8.0/10 - Good fun game with a few flaws			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is also Coop, in which you try to survive incoming waves of different enemy alien types or try to defend a building which is getting attack by them.

												This game is really underrated, probably because of Red Faction: Guerilla wnich was huge-world sandbox allowing the player to play the way he likes. Like I said, Guerilla does have really great gameplay, sounds effects, always fresh levels wnich never get boring,pretty well-done armory and some RPG elements. I think these arguments are good enough to recommend this game.  Bad sandbox mode and lack of multiplayer games makes the time spent in this game may be not that long like previous Red Faction, but the Single Players pays off with very good exprience.

												Red Faction: Armageddon gets flak for being short and not living up to the acclaim of the previous title in the franchise, Guerilla. But it's still a good game.You play as Darius Mason, the grandson of Alec Mason from Guerilla. Set fifty years after Guerilla, the premise is that the Cultists and their leader, Adam Hale take control of the terraformer, the machine which supplies Mars with its sustainable atmosphere. Darius, working with Red Faction forces, try to assault the terraformer and take back control. Ultimately, the Cultists end up destroying the terraformer and some time later, Darius is a contractor taking on drilling jobs in the underground. Things go awry when, on a certain drilling job he takes on, he awakens an infestation. Turns out he was set up and now he has to save the planet and bring order back to civilization. Along with some help.The unique mechanic in this game is the nano energy and SAM. SAM is like Cortana, but not as emotional. She helps you decrypt things, unlock doors, give you power ups, etc. The nano energy is cool, like the repair mechanism so that you can rebuild bridges you need to cross over canyons or lava flows.The enemies include both the Cultists and the infestation of bugs. The bugs were a dormant species living on Mars that Adam Hale had tricked Mason into waking. They're kind of what you'd expect, and more. They vary in size from flying little things that annoy you, to walking fiends that fire lasers at you. And giant behemoths that charge and shoot green gases at you. And tentacles that pummel you. Basically, there are plenty of enemies and you'll never be bored fighting them.Most of the game takes place in the underground, and I think the devs really nailed Mars' undreground. Mars seems like the place where the underground would be vast and large with flowing lava in various places. But also gloomy and dreadful because life on Mars means being in constant fear of death from seperate factions or unknown species. Especially underground where there are unexplored territories and systems that may have been abandoned long ago. It's really interesting to think about, honestly. You don't see much topside beside the opening mission and maybe two or three more bits, but over 90% of the game is underground.Everything else is nice too, graphics, sound design/mixing. Rarely any bugs. Music is a bit overkill with the guitars. I would have liked something more electronic to fit the mood of sci-fi action. Or at least more orchestral. But the guitars and drums didn't do it for me.Anyway. The game's plot started iffy for me, but I grew into it and ended up really liking it. Also, start a new game plus after you beat it for the possibly the greatest weapon out there, Mr. Toots: a mini-unicorn you carry that shoots rainbow plasma from its booty.8.5/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												In short, this game is no RF: Guerrilla. However, this game is still great fun and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it. I bought the game on sale for $7.50 so perhaps that's why I'm not as critical when it comes to reviewing it. As someone who has little time and a lot of stress, this game provided me with an outlet to destress and I loved every minute of it. Sure, the sandbox is gone, but the destruction and carnage are still there. Nothing brought me more joy than bringing down an infected building with cool and creative weapons, or blasting through enemies with badass vehicles. As an RF fan, I enjoyed the small touches they placed here and there to build upon the lore. Little things references to the RF history I thought were pretty cool and even how the Terraformer had the EDF symbols on it still were a nice touch. Is the game a setback from Guerrilla? Yes, but not a huge one. It's definitely worth a playthrough, at least during a flash sale. It's great, mindless fun and decently long. The enemies, while perhaps a cross between the Flood and Necomorphs, are entertaining to cut down and you learn a good deal about the RF world in the process.			",79,2,1,2,6,0,6

												Red Faction: Armageddon is mostly judged because it wasn't Red Faction: Guerrilla. Guerrilla was the better game, but this is by no means worse because it's not an imitator. For what it is, it's just not very interesting.  It's pretty obvious that the fun factor in Guerrilla made it so well liked, because this isn't nearly as interesting. Most of the game is spent fighting repetitive assaults of alien insects. In fact, other than the first mission, it takes you literally half the game to fight human enemies again. I really liked fighting humans because using the destruction against them was actually fun. Enemy on a ledge? Bring the ledge down. Enemy holed up in a building? Bring it down on him. This was when the game was most fun. However, it's only the minority.Also, the game will crash if you start a new game. There are save files you can find online that start after the first cutscene. Drop them into the save data location, restart your PC, then you can just hit continue.If you really want it, buy it on a really cheap sale.			",178,14,1,11,4,1,12

												Do you want to fill the boots of a roguish do-gooder trying to get by on Mars? Oh and you have some freaking cool weaponry to boot. Then this is the game for you.I know this game got a bad rap when it came out because of how it was “a step back” from its older brother but in all honesty that is a real load.This game is really good, not perfect but great enough to enjoy almost every moment of it. The action is tense and the enemies diverse and fun to battle against. I mean how can giant alien bugs not be great enemies to blast?The weapons are super cool and great fun to use, the super weapons in particular are frigging awesome, especially when they eat away at the environment.

												I'll give it an 8/10 (on my  scale) . The single player campaign is pretty long and satisfying. Enjoyed most of the game like around 95% .Few part had too much enemies lol but it was fun dying at different places :P . The best part that i literally enjoyed was reconstruction. Since most the structures, actually almost everything, in the game is destructible hence it can be rebuilt too :3 too much fun. I dont care of the graphics but still for the sake of review just a comment 'pretty good'. The bosses are pretty damn easy too kill(once you know where to attack), not VERY EASYYY but yes you wont die (max maybe once but not more than that). Lots of weapons but cannot carry then all well you get a lot of opportunities in the levels to change them according to your style. A hand full of upgrades but make sure you look out for nanites(the currency ingame to buy upgrades). They are spread out in almost every corner of the level even at places you dont neeed to visit. (just for sharing i - I was able to unlock around 85% of upgrades)The one weapon which has a unique twist to it is the MAGNET GUN. Most guns would shoot, launch grenades or rockets or even vapourising beams but NO this gun?! well it shoots magnets powerful enough to destroy a whole building. The uniqueness isnt in this though, the uniquness lies in the fact that you can actually throw an aliens at stuff around you. And if not that you can go entirely opposite of it, throw stuff at the alien with it (everything else you'll get to know ingame not gonna spoil it all :P )Once you finish the game you have 'NEW GAME +' too, just like most other games now-a-days. Also you have a few rewards once you complete the game which you get to use in 'NEW GAME +' mode ^_^I highly recommend this game to those who are die hard shooting fans and of destruction.ALL IN ALL I HAD A PRETTY GOOD TIME PLAYING THIS. I DID SOME EXPLORATION SO I HAD AN OVER ALL SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN TIME OF 7:26 HOURS. (NOT VERY GOOD BUT IT WAS WORTH ). (y)			",201,30,14,2,7,1,18

												Do you want to fill the boots of a roguish do-gooder trying to get by on Mars? Oh and you have some freaking cool weaponry to boot. Then this is the game for you.I know this game got a bad rap when it came out because of how it was “a step back” from its older brother but in all honesty that is a real load.This game is really good, not perfect but great enough to enjoy almost every moment of it. The action is tense and the enemies diverse and fun to battle against. I mean how can giant alien bugs not be great enemies to blast?The weapons are super cool and great fun to use, the super weapons in particular are frigging awesome, especially when they eat away at the environment. The storyline, world building and level design are second to none. Also it’s not a bad looker either.It might not be the best game it is worth every penny and when on sale it is a MUST BUY.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												Very good shooter. The graphics and mechanics are well, but gameplay is wasted by the amount of cinematics, too many for the lenght of the campaing, really seems short and easy even in hard difficultly, but its fun, altought maps are lineal. A decent bundle of weapons, with cool effects, specially the gravitatation ones that remind Half Life 2, with a few vehicles to drive and a lot of structures to destroy and rebuild at pleasure. This title introduces a upgradable skill system and includes maps of missions to enlarge the experience for many hours as arena modeSadly, THQ went to bankruptcy after this title. Hopefully designers will make more chapters, should recover the sandbox map and first person view, Red Faction series deserves it.			",308,48,0,52,30,1,96

												After the great open world Red Faction Guerilla, Volition take the series in another direction. Stripping the open world in favour of a tight, linear structure turned a lot of people of to this game as did the focus on fighting alien bugs rather than a human threat. If you can play beyond the first third of the game however up to when you get back to the surface of Mars  the game does open up a little into more open canyons with some great vehicular destruction.The game features the meatiest story in the series and follows directly on from the SyFy movie Red Faction origins with you playing another decendant in the Mason family responsible for allowing the Martian atmosphere processor to be destroyed by Cultists and in turn letting lose a whole nest of alien creatures from underground. The story ties back into the previous games and playing them first would be benifical.Weapons are inventive and forceful and are fun to use, especially the mechs and tanks and their respective missions.Visuals have gotten better from the last game and there is still destruction of buildings but this time you can bring anything back with the new Nano rebuilder to recreate destroyed stair ways etc so you are not stuck trying to climb the geometry to make progress after a fire fight which was a problem in guerilla.The only problem is the Aliens are used a lot and are thrown against you overwhelmingly at some points so it can get a little repetative fighting them again and again.Overall if you're coming back here for more of Guerilla you will be dissapointed but if you enjoyed the first game's structure or like linear shooters in general theres fun to be had here.7.5/10			",287,38,7,10,9,2,16

												What a great campaign--a solid 10+ hours! It's a cross between Aliens and Rambo. Darius Miles is one bad♥♥♥♥♥hombre kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names. I thought the move away from the sandbox play style of Guerrilla might make Armageddon less appealing, but Volition did a superb job keeping the destruction physics center stage. The story takes a detour from its traditional rebellious themed roots and focuses on bug extermination--they actually make it work pretty well. All of the great weapons from Guerrilla carry over plus they added a new repair feature and some special nano powers which are very cool. Include some cool vehicles with bad♥♥♥♥♥weapons, decent cut scenes, and it's a wrap.I thought the campaign was marketed as coop, but it is not. Instead coop is possible in an extremely entertaining survival mode called Infestation with up to 4 players.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												This isn't a bad shooter. The visuals are great, the AI is actually fairly difficult to deal with, the voice acting is good, the weapons are varied and the gameplay feels fluid and varied.The one problem I have with this game is that there are parts in the game that feel like an endurance test. Another issue is that the storyline does not make sense in some parts and that the tunneling from the original game is missing. I assume that this is to prevent GPU-related housefires, but there is no reason why it can't be made an option. I recommend this game to those who want a shooter with some personality that does not take itself too seriously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not as good as Guerilla.  They went and gutted 80% of the gameplay that involved destroying large structures that you were inside.  Just about the biggest redeeming factor of this game is the addition of the magnet gun which is just heinously fun.  Otherwise it doesn't serve as much more than an expansion pack to Guerilla.  Generally speaking, its a step backwards.Freddie Wong made a weapon that's in here though.  That's pretty neat.			",249,35,3,28,10,1,35

												An intriguing third-person-shooter take on the traditional 'Mars settlers encounter alien lifeforms' genre. The story takes obvious cues from similar settings, but what the story lacks, the game makes up with amusing and interesting gameplayStory Pros:- The main character is easy to understand and grasp his personality.- The importance of the previous games in the series is minimal; what you need to know to understand the story is all contained in dialog etc., so you won't feel lost if you haven't played the previous games.- The main character is able to communicate important details of what's going on without directly talking to the player, thanks to his dialog with his ""S.A.M."" AI on his wrist.- The comraderie of the main character and a number of his acquiantances makes it easy to enjoy dialog, instead of it feeling like dead-pan exhibition.Story Cons:- Due to the importance of your character's past, you cannot customize your character at all visually.- The S.A.M. AI on the character's wrist is near omnipotent at times, like finding routes for you through completely uncharted caves, yet other times seems completely oblivious to certain details.- The story will frequently, intentionally mislead you through certain portions of the story, often through the AI either not providing all the details, remaining silent, etc. This tends to create a feeling of Deus Ex Machina when the Story says you can do X thing to fix the situation, long after you should reasonably have been told, or even after it made it seem like that thing was impossible (No spoilers, but the ending definitely reeks of this)- There are a number of cuts the story takes through Cutscenes. The cutscenes themselves are actually quite nice, however, there are a number of occasions where the game will painstakingly walk you through every detail of a particular scenario, and the abruptly move you to the next chapter with no details of what happened in between (I.E. cutscene shows you loading up on a truck with your buddy, talking about where they're going, and then it immediately goes to another cutscene where you've been at that location for some time and are already talking about heading out again.)Gameplay Pros:- Physics & Destructible terrain are immensely enjoyable. This is seriously the best thing about the game. As you progress, you get a number of unique weapons and skills that will wreak havoc on your surroundings. And once you've had your fill of destroying buildings and sending your enemies flying, your AI can use a 'Nano forge' to repair things like bridges, so you need not worry about accidentally destroying your path to the next objective.- There is never any time where the game takes away your progression through the skill tree, nor any of your weapons. Once it's unlocked, you can expect it to be available for the rest of the game.Gameplay Cons:- Objectives aren't always clear as to how you should get where you are going, unless you use the 'Compass' tool which projects the direction to your goal onto the terrain around you. There's no middle ground between, ""I'm lost"" and Handholdiong from the game. I would have liked more well-designed levels that make it a little easier to find where you are going without asking for an explicit map.- Gameplay time is fairly short. Two full playthroughs took me just under 12 hours.Visuals:- Textures are magnificent. The developers knew what they were dealing with, and didn't leave anything blurry or pixelated.- Meshes are a little angular at times, but instead of looking odd, they made sure to make the artistic style incorporate angles as seeming intentional (i.e. crystals on the walls, angular architecture, and spiky enemies)Overall, I definitely recommend the game simply because of how enjoyable it is to be able to destroy the large majority of your surroundings. It makes you feel in control, and powerful. It's definitely not a legendary game like Half-Life 2 or Portal, but it's a good 6 or 7 out of 10. Definitely worth a shot if you see it go on sale.

												Sorry, I can not recommend this game, my friend nor any user to steam. What is it the best on this game, mode for the single player it would simply not work. Unfortunately, it is so only on Steam, because on other platforms is not a problem. I wrote to the manufacturer, may be will think of something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First warning: Since THQ went down the tubes, there's nobody left to support this game. So when you run into the bug that makes it impossible to start a new game, you'll have to find someone else's save-game from the start and work from there.It turns out that work just isn't worth it. Red Faction: Armageddon keeps basically nothing of what made Red Faction: Guerrilla so fun and swaps the big open world and destructible environment mayhem for a humdrum alien shooter restricted to caves. The Magnet Gun is a pretty sweet gimmick but is only as strong as the amount of debris made available to you. Guerilla may have benefited from a little curation because its setpiece fights were so good, but Armageddon over-curates your experience into a straight-line slog through endlessly replaceable alien bugs. It just doesn't belong in the same series as Guerrilla. Buy Red Faction: Guerrilla instead.			",257,179,2,23,25,4,47

												I skipped the cutscenes and turned off voice in the audio settings for the entire campaign. The story is short and it sucks, but the gameplay is a lot of fun! I recommend this game for 10 bucks or less.PROS:Amazing physics engine! You can destroy the environment and use the destruction around you to throw at your enemies!Graphics are great on max settings. Frame rate is mostly consistant and is surprisingly good when huge buildings are being destroyed.Solid enemy variety for how long the game lasts.CONS:Story is forgettable and boring, i suggest skipping the cutscenes and just playing the game.The game starts off above ground but you will soon be trapped underground for the ENTIRE GAME. I was really hoping to get out of that area and explore some wide open areas.Short story. I beat the game around 6 hours and beat it agaain the same day (NG+) in only 3 hours! ",278,43,9,33,13,4,25

												Red Faction has come along quite a bit and over the last decade since I first played the very first version.. I loved the game itself because you could knock down almost anything using something and I'm sure it was one of the first games to have options like this during game play itself.This version of red faction is amazing, the graphics are very clear, surroundings too I love the gameplay itself.. I have read reviews from other complaining about the player himself feeling sluggish during motion but you have to image this is not duke nukem, mario or anything else where you can get speed-ups this is trying to be more along the lines of an actual event in real life which carrying some battle weight!it is indeed a very nice game, I love it :D			",10,0,0,4,3,0,3

												Big part of the people who are interested in this game, are going to want it because of Red Faction: Guerilla. So I'll be adjusting my recommendation with that in context.As comparisons go, the first one is as simple as this: The story is now lineair and you are no longer in a free-roaming world. With that, means that the walls surrounding your path are unbreakable. However, this doesn't mean that desctruction is very absent.On the contrary, destruction and debris play a much bigger role than they did in Guerilla. In said game, your sledgehammer served for nothing to break down buildings, maybe kill those inside.In Armageddon, debris is a potential weapon. The Magnet gun is the tool of the trade now. It's functioning is two-staged: You attach/shoot first what you want moved, then attach the second magnet to where you want it to go. This can be structure parts, pickups or even enemies (all but the biggest Behemoth).This makes for some fun and unique gameplay. And while the tool is powerful and relatively fast, you'll still be needing some firearms. Because the Alien swarm is fast and massive.Besides that, the weapons array is pretty much classic. Shotguns, Assault/Sniper rifles and two sets of dual pistols. The Sniper rifle does feature a heat-mode that allows you to see and headshot through surfaces, which is the only reason the sniper is not obsolete, as vantage points are nigh unexistant.I won't spoil the story because... it's not that extraordinary. Saying anything about it may as well spoil it all. It's classic, a little bit cheesy but not too annoying.S.A.M. however, that's a new box of toys. S.A.M. is your wrist-mounted A.I. that serves a guiding purpose in the story, and a more practical one in combat. You start out with a repair functionality. Anything destroyed can be repaired by the nano-forge that is built in.Which means, you now have a new renewable weapon in debris, as well as a renewable cover source. Too bad there's no cover mechanic. Just crouching, and that's it.The Impact skill basically serves as a short-range air bash that pushes back any debris in it's path. Of course, this makes the sledgehammer pretty obsolete. (which can now be swapped out)It also makes for a nice punching weapon, though eventually you'll want to power it up with upgrades.Besides that, you have three classical 'extra' skills you can get through the upgrade station. Berserk ups your damage and fire speed, Shockwave (that I didn't even bother to try) is a typical Nova ability, and the Shell works as a projectile shield (great for when you're almost dead) and DoT for enemies that are inside of it.As per enemies go... it's a good thing your toys are more destructive rather than precision based. AFAIK 25% of the enemies you encounter are human. And they tend to be pushovers, even at Hard difficulty.The real threat are the Alien creatures. They all come in several ranks, and tend to just swarm you late-game, with the low-rank creatures coming in masses and tending to be very melee based.But, even on Hard mode, the only real threats are the Berserkers are the Behemoths. Berserkers are quite tough and are hard hitting on both ranged and melee. But they can just be punted around with the magnet gun and melee'd to death once you've taken care of the other critters.Behemoths, when not encountered while in a vehicle, tend to be mini-boss fights. The area is locked off and you need to use your weapons or available debris to kill them. They're real bullet spunges and hit pretty hard in ranged and melee.And they can't be punted around.While in a vehicle, they are the only types of enemies that really pose a threat if not paid any attention to.Eventually though, you'll find a gimmick that works for you and they just become a nuisance. Much like the other aliens, really.This is a game with a gimmick that plays it very, very well. But sadly, it can't lean on it to justify a full price. Maybe if it had been free-roaming. But regardless, the game is not something you should avoid simply because of that.			",467,55,7,42,17,3,37

												The story of Red Faction Armageddon can be easy to forget as it strikes as something bland without many surprises aside from a couple of plot twists moments a bit of love here or there and many, many explosions. However, while many games have a deep narrative with a strong storyline Red Faction is worth a play, especially for a nice fill if you are looking to relax and play something easy-to-follow with a love for destruction (and construction). Just like many movies, there are the ones that you can’t wait to go to the cinema and watch it while others you just stumble while zapping on your TV in a lazy Sunday. Red Faction Armageddon is the latter but by any means does this means that it was not an enjoyable experience. Despite being short my time with the game was worth my time investment. In under 6-7 hours I finished the main story and I was happy with the ending although I wish it could have lasted me a bit more.The bigger fun factor has to be all the destruction and the variety of weapons. While I got stuck in the geometry a couple of times after destroying things, nothing like make use of my hammer with the combination of the reconstruction ability to get out of a mess of concrete wall that just crumbled on my feet. From sending grenades and then hit “detonate” to sticking enemies in the walls there is a bit of everything for any gun lover. Assault Rifles and Shotguns are also present in the game but considering the satisfaction from shooting the other weapons these tend to be forgotten through most of my play through.  Besides the standard shooting the enemy with said weapons, some vehicles will be at your disposal during certain missions. These will be armored vehicles to destroy the enemy and can be driven by land or air however, the sound effects felt a bit poor when firing some missiles or other bigger weapons. The visuals are nothing out of the ordinary but considering the time the game was released (2011) my experience in 2015 was not diminished by this, it was all about destroying and exploding things from start to finish and overall I can say it was a positive experience. If you have a little time to spend on something to play in little chunks of time without having to worry about complex systems or controls I would recommend giving Red Faction Armageddon a fair chance. You can play the game in short bursts since it provides a gentle checkpoint system.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, man. Best game of the frnachise. Easily. Hands down. So damn good. I didn't experience as much problems as other people did, all I had was the occasional crash but nothing that made the game unplayable thanfully as what a missed gem this would've been.It's not open world and it has a story alongside actual characters that actually have character. Such an improvement from Guerilla. I know a lot of people like open world but I've been playing a lot of that recently so I've grown pretty tired of it and this was very refreshing. All of the guns are awesome and actually kill things unlike Guerilla, it's just a matter of picking your favourite. For me it was the magnet gun.The destruction is just as awesome as before, if anything it feel sbetter because you're in a smaller area. And you can rebuld everythign and then blow it up all over again.Even if you're not a fan of the franchise this game is incredible and you have to play it.S'good.			",166,30,2,8,10,1,3

												This game is objectively good in terms of the story-driven linear 3rd person shooter genre. Definitely worth a play though if you're a fan of either the genre or series. Just go into it thinking of Armageddon as the sequel to RF2. The nano mechanics and destructable environments create a really fun dynamic that I would like to see resurrected in other games. Continually rebuilding cover as its destroyed is just something I've never seen done in a game quite like it was here.			",87,14,0,10,4,0,13

Posted: November 27, 2013
												Let me start off by saying that I hated Guerilla. I gave it at least 3 separate tries and on each occasion I felt dumber and dumber playing it. The game had huge and bland lifeless environments similar to Far Cry 2 canyon-like map only with no vegetation. The Martian physics were also something that I just couldn't get used to; the game introduced the seemingly unnecessary destruction of everything even of civilian buildings; there was the un-tactical running and shooting gameplay even though there were some guerrilla type raids involved; ultimately most missions turned into run and shoot mess.I had slight hopes for this game because I was hoping that the linear single player story would at least be something to enjoy.Well, as for gameplay, this is a regular run'n'shoot BUT have-the-ability-to-destroy-everything game. There is no cover to speak of, and there's no ability to take cover and for a good reason - everything goes. That is, taking cover behind a wall will result in the wall being destroyed so you would attempt to kill the enemy before he or it kills you after blowing your cover, literally. There is no real tactical movement required - just keep on shooting and moving and you will most likely win.As you descend deeper into the Martian caves you will encounter aliens. For the most part you are going to be battling angry insectoids, small roaches, giant roaches and some other disgusting creatures including huge mean looking worms. There's some suspense to have as you go deeper and deeper into caves and the CGI cut scenes are pretty cool however, this suspense is quickly dispensed by hordes of insects swarming you from every direction throughout the game. From that point on, the game pretty much becomes a giant insect fest comprised of killing as many bugs using different weapons as well as the environment before they get you. I think I've seen this somewhere, dare I say Lost Planet 2? Only that game had co-op.Besides, for some reason, you will constantly encounter the ammo for your guns even in the deepest caves where no man has set foot. You will never run out of ammo because the ammo caches are spread out in almost every direction.The portable computer system that you have, SAM, is reminiscent of the Dead Space navigation pointer, except this time, SAM has a voice and it tells you what to do constantly. You don't really have to think or wander around caves because the SAM guiding system will tell you where to go. The game practically plays by itself.The weapons are okay. We have the usual guns as well as magnet gun that connects point A and B- this gives you the opportunity to hurl objects from point A at enemies that are located at point B. You can also destroy entire multiple story buildings and constructions with one placed shot.The graphics are great, the DX 11 and all. The water looks okay and for the most part the environments are well detailed. The aliens are sometimes revolting to look at too.You do have the ability to break through walls as well as re-construct virtually every man made structure via your molecular reconstructor or whatever, which is neat, but extremely unrealistic. So, in the end you end up with great looking engine that actually lets you destroy just about everything but at the same time lets you fix pretty much everything. Take that for what it's worth. There are also some weapon and skill upgrades you can buy with your easily earned credits.I guess the biggest disappointment is the gameplay. You just want to keep running and shooting without looking back. Or you DO look back only to shoot up some chasing insectoids while keeping on running.There are no invisible walls in the game but some battles requires you to stay within a set sector without having the ability to retreat. Thus you are given 10 seconds to get back into battle...The game is also extremely easy, even on Hard. The health regenerates within a few seconds. The game itself runs smoothly though and the controls for your character are fluid. You will be able to move fast and avoid being hit.All in all, buy the game at bargain.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

												Remember how amazing the destruction was in Red Faction Guerilla?  Where you could drive cars through walls, detonate the explosives as you bail out, and destroy an entire outpost while escaping in a missile tank?  Well you can't do that in this!  Enjoy fighting generic bug alien things while you have the most toned down destruction mechanics imaginable.  Sure they added some great guns like the magnet gun and the reconstructor, but it's so restricted and toned down that you go back to playing the old one.  tldr; go play red faction guerilla			",94,4,0,10,12,0,18

												Horible. Cliché story line, didn't fit in following on from Guerrilla. Feels like a console port.Gameplay wise, it is a step backwards for the series.  Much like Red Faction 2 was to the original.Why they stuck the camera in a locked 3rd person over the shoulder view I have no idea.  Would have been more appropriate to have it 1st person.Also, it crashes constantly.  Crashed about 5 times in the first 2 hours game play, tried to refund through steam but I was over the 2 hours.

												Wow this feels like such a let-down after Guerrilla. I adore RF Guerrilla but this does away with almost everything that made that game so good.- No open world, no exploration, no freedom at all from what I have played- No human enemies, or very few (apparently there are some a bit later on)- Tedious gameplay mechanics such as mobbing you with aliens- Worse destruction engine, I think. Just doesn't look as impressive as before.Upsides?- More atmospheric environments- Overall improved graphics- The aliens do look quite coolSo yeah... not recommended.

												I have played all the Red Faction games that are out there and I would say that this is the least lore friendly Red Faction title to have been made it does not follow the previous title flavor and style, what all Red Faction games have is a faction of resistance members fighting a much larger Earth military and cooperate force for the freedom of the Mar colonist, most of which are miners. Armageddon does seem to have, however this is a behind the scene plot. The story is this great; gameplay is somewhat boring compared to the previous Red Faction titles. Graphics are nice I would say that the lighting and shadows are its strong point but the levels are usually plain and the textures are usually hidden due to the darkness that is 90% of the time present; the weapons are pretty much the same as Guerilla’s with curvy models which makes it look futuristic which complement its 3rd shooting perspective. Controls are very responsive. Story (6/10), Graphics(7.5/10), Gameplay (4.9/10) over all the game is worth getting on a sale if you have the previous titles and no other game on your wishlist interest you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't played any of the Red faction games, you really should. There's nothing quite like them out there (although I haven't heard great things about RF2). There are so many ways to play - when you can destroy any structure in any way you want with any weapon, you suddenly have a lot of options.In Armageddon, there is a new weapon called the magnet gun that lets you pull objects together (violently) and once you figure it out, it can be a lot of fun to use. Armageddon isn't open world like guerilla was and is more linear, which was disappointing but I still liked it. I also like the multiplayer, and play local games (LAN) with a friend of mine. You can upgrade your character with ""salvage"" you earn - however the time you have to choose upgrades between rounds is short and often the round starts before I can choose (possibly because my friend started the round).All and all, a very worthy addition to your collection.

												This one was the first game of the series that I played, and definately it won't be the last. Most things I have to say about it are between good and great.Storyline is very good, gives you a brief awareness of what happened before the game, without spoiling the previous games, so you still feel like you must play them in order to fully understand the whole picture. Graphics are good, the destruction engine is awesome and opens a huge door for creativity. I mean, why waste ammo when you can crush a building down with your maul and let gravity kill your enemies for you? The Magnet Gun is in my personal top 3 of best video game weapons of all time. It's incredibly fun to use, and gives you an unlimited advantage over your enemy, with its unlimited ways to bring tangos down, from crushing them with one another to drag them next to you so you can be able to finish em with meele.On the other hand, I wouldn't say single player campaign is short, but it sure is a little easy, even in the insane difficulty. Sound is not extraordinary, I think it could be somewhat more intense, in order to match with the graphics and make you feel more inside of the action.In the end, I think it is a must have/play. 8/10Now let's get the rest of the series :P			",56,15,2,5,8,1,14

												I might be the only person who liked this more than RF Guerilla. It's an enjoyable, good looking corridor shooter that's well paced and has a nice variety  of  gameplay elements. I particularly enjoyed the gun that allows you to gravitationally tether entire sides of buildings and send them hurtling down on some poor alien sap. Lots and lots of destruction possiblities and diverse tools to do it with.  It's very fun and a wonderful sleeper that will surprise from time to time.			",221,39,21,23,23,0,41

												Red Faction: Armageddon is funtastic! The ability to destroy the environment and the mechanics used for the weapons made this game super fun to play. While short, only around 11  hours to complete the main story and the DLC, the game is a blast. Throwing things around the levels at enemies, throwing enemies and generally leveling the environment as you play through was satisfying. If you like different weapons, watching things explode and easy to play game mechanics this game is for you. Good times.			",95,4,1,8,4,1,16

												This is a typical case of developers not understanding what is good about their product. There is a way to play this game that is hugely entertaining. But there are also ways to make it incredibly boring.The right way to play this game is very simple: ignore everything that doesn't cause explosions.There's nothing satisfying about sniping jumpy aliens with a laser pistol. What is fun is blowing the alien and the building it was clinging on to shreds. Explosions are such a cliche that it is hard to explain how well it works here. We're not talking just about fancy animations and light effects. This game's destruction model makes a spectacle out of every single rocket, making holes into buildings and sending parts flying everywhere.The game tries to be more than its physics model, and it fails miserably. The story is actually so bad that it had me laughing all the way through. But you owe it to yourself to pick up a rocket launcher and blow something up. It's so good that it doesn't even get old for the 6 hours that the game lasts.			",108,17,3,9,13,2,42

												I went into this thinking it would be like the last Red Faction game - Open world sandbox... But this wasn't open anything.  This is Gears of War meets Red Faction.  Linear levels, lots of one liners, cocky action hero, and your standard fare of Mine-Cart rides, Mech battles, and things exploding.All and all - a well made, fun action game.  Its a third person shooter with a lot of fun weapons and most buildings break part in peices like the older Red Faction games.I recommend for those that like ""Movie"" style action games with low difficulty.  I had a lot of fun because I beat it in 8 hours going slow... trying to kill everything with just a hammer. :-)			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												I really enjoyed this game, and it's one of those games that just stuck with me after I've finished it. The story is not bad at all, and keeps you invested from the beginning to the end. The game is very linear and there's not many options other than whats presented to you. However I don't find that a bad thing, I actually think the game benefits from it. This is not a game that you walk around exploring your enviroment or wander off on some side quest, but rather sit back and enjoy as the story unfolds itself. It's decently long and can accomplish this without making the game feel repetitiv.Now let's talk about the best part, the destruction. A lot of stuff in your environment will break, and I mean a lot. You can bash through a wall with your sledgehammer and tear down pillars and buildings to their core. This means that you can destroy any cover that the enemy might try and hide behind, but so can they. You can repair stuff to quickly make cover for yourself or you can grab a piece of a wall and swing it on your enemies. It never gets boring and will make a huge difference in how you play the game.Aside from the single-player action you can team up with some friends and play coop missions. These center around fighting waves of enemies while trying to survive. I found this to be very fun and intense gameplay, but it falls short when it comes to veriety and exensivness.If you can find this game on a sale, I would highly recommend it.

												A fantastic game that has awesome gameplay and a great story to go with it. The single player is the perfect length to get it all done. There are special vehicle to drive that make the action more fun.The sounds in the game really make your surrounds seem more in depth, the monsters move alot. The online play with friends is great! There isn't alot of people that will come online if your trying to find a match but you can complete most of the online portion alone. There is a survival mode in online were you get waves of monsters. The graphics make you feel like your watching a movie. The guns are creative and well done. The over all game is an amazing adventure. Ive loved playing this and if your into shooters then dont hesitate when seeing this one in the price range that pleases you. Its diamond in the rough!

												RFA is another 3rd person shooter in the RF universe that features destructible (and rebuildable) environments. This time, an enemy thought dead came back, and unleashed hell hidden beneath Mars, and the only guy who can really do something about it... is Darius Mason... if he can survive the onslaught of multiple enemies... but he has a few friends. Will it be enough? There's a bit of auto-aim, and there are a lot of different weapons (but you can carry only 4 at a time). There's a bit of RPG element as you can choose different ""skills"" to enhance your combat and destructible environment such as buildings, walls, and others are pretty cool the first few times, but gets old a bit later. Still, this is an exciting shooter, if a bit repetitive.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

 Red Faction Armageddon - Review === RATING: 5.0 / 10 - Mars, Six Hundred Feet Under ===- Absolutely essential purchase- Recommended purchase- Purchase only if on sale- Purchase only if on heavy sale ->> Avoid purchasing === The Good - Environment destructiblity always gives good enjoyment in combat, in this also this Red Faction does not disappoint- Decent variety of weapons, skills and such- You can repair structures, which is a new mechanic as far as single-player campaign is concerned, in Red Faction series=== The Bad - Everything else apart weapon realization, which is decent, is MEDIOCRE at best.- There is no free-roaming: the game takes place in closed environment where you have to follow a straight path most of the time. You have freedom to destroy whatever you want, but in the end you will be on a pre-chosen path and that is what you follow. A big step back from the very good free-roaming of the previous episode, Guerrilla.- No side-quests or challenges: only one objective at a time, linear story, no chace of doing some other activity than main quest.- Storyline, which has never been a strong point in Red Faction, granted, is even more uninvolving and stereotyped than other chapters of the series, and that's something... something bad. The incipit which triggers the whole event that leads to the Armageddon is just ridiculous.=== The Ugly - Difficulty is really low if you know what you are doing: this is because the player has access to some ridiculously overpowered weapons. Most weapons you find are real crap, but one in particular, the Magnet Gun, is completely overpowered. If used correctly this weapon can just destroy any enemy in a short time, because it allows you to throw pieces of environment towards enemies to cause massive damage. It has UNLIMITED ammo and a very long range. You can also throw enemies with it, and most will be instantly killed by the impactsCombine this with some upgrades to health, armor and powers to get rid of close enemies, and there you have a really easy game. The ONLY sections with difficulty are those where you are forced to stay in tight spaces such as platforms moving and such.=== Conclusions This Red Faction is what really ruined the series in the end. Volition tried a combat-focused, alien mash up instead of doing another great red faction as Guerrilla has been, removed the key gameplay points that made the previous title great and instead of them put just a few innovations that just do not save the overall picture from being mediocre at best.This is a game i suggest only if you are a real fan of Red Faction and want to see how LOW it has gone, or also if you enjoy REALLY MUCH blasting aliens with overpowered stuff.

												If you haven't played any of the Red faction games, you really should. There's nothing quite like them out there (although I haven't heard great things about RF2). There are so many ways to play - when you can destroy any structure in any way you want with any weapon, you suddenly have a lot of options.In Armageddon, there is a new weapon called the magnet gun that lets you pull objects together (violently) and once you figure it out, it can be a lot of fun to use. Armageddon isn't open world like guerilla was and is more linear, which was disappointing but I still liked it. I also like the multiplayer, and play local games (LAN) with a friend of mine. You can upgrade your character with ""salvage"" you earn - however the time you have to choose upgrades between rounds is short and often the round starts before I can choose (possibly because my friend started the round).All and all, a very worthy addition to your collection.

												This one was the first game of the series that I played, and definately it won't be the last. Most things I have to say about it are between good and great.Storyline is very good, gives you a brief awareness of what happened before the game, without spoiling the previous games, so you still feel like you must play them in order to fully understand the whole picture. Graphics are good, the destruction engine is awesome and opens a huge door for creativity. I mean, why waste ammo when you can crush a building down with your maul and let gravity kill your enemies for you? The Magnet Gun is in my personal top 3 of best video game weapons of all time. It's incredibly fun to use, and gives you an unlimited advantage over your enemy, with its unlimited ways to bring tangos down, from crushing them with one another to drag them next to you so you can be able to finish em with meele.On the other hand, I wouldn't say single player campaign is short, but it sure is a little easy, even in the insane difficulty. Sound is not extraordinary, I think it could be somewhat more intense, in order to match with the graphics and make you feel more inside of the action.In the end, I think it is a must have/play. 8/10Now let's get the rest of the series :P			",56,15,2,5,8,1,14

												This is a typical case of developers not understanding what is good about their product. There is a way to play this game that is hugely entertaining. But there are also ways to make it incredibly boring.The right way to play this game is very simple: ignore everything that doesn't cause explosions.There's nothing satisfying about sniping jumpy aliens with a laser pistol. What is fun is blowing the alien and the building it was clinging on to shreds. Explosions are such a cliche that it is hard to explain how well it works here. We're not talking just about fancy animations and light effects. This game's destruction model makes a spectacle out of every single rocket, making holes into buildings and sending parts flying everywhere.The game tries to be more than its physics model, and it fails miserably. The story is actually so bad that it had me laughing all the way through. But you owe it to yourself to pick up a rocket launcher and blow something up. It's so good that it doesn't even get old for the 6 hours that the game lasts.			",108,17,3,9,13,2,42

												This game got a lot of heat from people for not being a sandbox game like it's predecessor. However, I think that it is better in a way. Instead of wandering around doing missions, you're guided through a more linear, richer story. Half-Life 2 wasn't a sandbox game, and people loved that...Graphically and audibly, this game is brilliant. The physics and destruction is the best I have ever seen in a game. Blowing everthing up and having the ability to repair stuff with the nanoforge is extremely fun. The gameplay actually takes advantage of both of these, so I think it meshes quite well, and it isn't just a gimmick.Story wise; it's okay. Better than Guerilla (personally) Should you buy it? YES. This is one of THQ's underrated games for sure. Don't listen to the haters. ",454,20,6,11,8,3,38

												[9/10] - When I bought Armageddon, I was hoping for the same open world experience I got from Guerilla. Unfortunately, what I got was a linear story progression that didn't have the same charm as its predecessor. However, that does not at all mean it's a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed the game just as much as, if not more than, the other one.The combat in Armageddon is fluid and well played. Swinging the hammer to destroy almost every piece of the world and then bringing it back to life by repairing it in an instant allows for total control over the battlefield. There are upgrades such as shockwave which pushes your enemies away, berserk which increases damage output, and creating a defensive shell that reflects bullets. These are all unlocked through progression and can be allocated to the enhancement of your choice,  giving a noticeable and substantial edge in combat. There is also a wide choice of weapons to choose from including dual pistols, machine guns, and a rocket launcher along with its own unique array of weapons like the magnet gun and rail driver. I never felt more powerful in a game bashing enemies as a single-hero-against-all-odds than I have in Armageddon.There is also a four player co-op mode where you fight waves of enemies or complete objectives (usually defending structures) that can be enjoyable with friends. There are 15 maps total and 30 waves each, leaving plenty of variety and content to satisfy this game mode for a while.On the downside, the game is a bit short and doesn't offer too much in terms of difficulty, at least for me. Though time has passed, and price has dropped and I would HIGHLY recommend giving this game a chance. It's a fun and exciting third person shooter that has not received the love it deserves.

												After the excellent Red Faction Guerrilla, this is quite the disappointment. Linear and little stuff to blow up. Graphics look pretty good, and, in comparison to Guerrilla, this is a great port; solid 60fps all the way and lots of options. There are a lot of fantastic weapons (<3 Mr. Toots) so the action is pretty good, but it's just an endless spawn of alien enemies in the end. I lost interest pretty quickly. And most of the time you have to kill them to continue. I really missed the freedom of Guerrilla, and using my sledgehammer to kill the enemies. Because of the small caves, you usually use one of yours guns, especially when you're being surrounded by 10+ enemies. So yes, it's more action packed than Guerrilla (the powers you can acquire are a plus actually), but blowing things up and the whole freedom aspect were two of the things that made the previous game so great. Remember the Dragon Age 2 criticism ? It's just like that all over again. Get it when it's cheap.[Rating: 82/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												While not open world like it's predecessor RFG, RFA brings more great tech to the pitch.  In fact the tech is more prominent due the closed nature of the level design.  Explicitly stated RFA is without doubt one of the most technically impressive works that I have ever interacted with. Volition proves themselves again that they are leaders in their field.  An additional effect aside from the destruction the series has become known for is reconstruction enabling you, for example, to completely destroy a bridge during combat that's needed for level progression and later allowing you to rebuild it.  On the downside, from a PC perspective the FOV is too close and I've never really adjusted.  To compensate I've moved to a couch/plasma/cont setup so that I'm farther back from the screen.  While this improves the expereince it's not optimal.  On the upside the DX11 visuals are great given the console nature of the game.  The story is good enough though it takes time to develop.

												Red Faction Armageddon may have been a failure according to critics, but I had a surprising amount of fun demolishing and restoring objects, blasting enemies, and upgrading my abilities to accomplish the aforementioned activities more effectively. The plot is cheesy and predictable, and gameplay can be repetitive at times, but it's easy to look past the flaws and enjoy the game as a whole for the most part. I also found the game to have more replay value than I expected, allowing you to carry your stats and upgrades over to a new playthrough. Pick it up while it's on sale.			",980,584,11,108,35,5,82

												I HAve to go against the popular opinion on this one... I like it! BUT! (And this is a HUUUUGE but) don NOT treat this like a Red Faction Game. Treat this as a fun 3rd person shooter. Very little geomodding, no sandbox, and it loses the realistic building destrcution that Guerilla had. But It holds up very well on it's own two feet. I think if they had released it as a new IP, I feel it would have done better. I think it was a great final hurrah from a pretty great company. pick it up if you can!			",52,3,0,9,2,0,2

												Review-in-ProgressBasically, this game would have done better as a new and seperate IP. It trades the oppressive military for generic alien bugs, trades wide open scenery for claustrophobic, linear cave systems, and large destructable structures for little shacks and nameless machinery that sort of fall apart with no real effort. The destruction that made Guerilla fun is now a hindrance, as the spaces are so small and linear that debris will just get in your way. Vehicles have all but been removed, which is probably a good thing in these enclosed spaces, in favor of a couple different exo-suits. These are great fun to mow down bugs in, but again, it doesnt fit a red faction game. There is some weapon variety, but there is rarely a need to switch up your loadout since there is little to no strategy required for most fights. Adding to this problem is the ""nano-forge"" which is a very loosely ""sci-fi"" way of giving your character (and only your character) abilities that basically amount to The Force. Also worth mentioning is the generic A.I voice-in-your-head, named SAM, like every generic A.I should be named, that conveniently gives you all relevant mission objectives.Visually, the game looks great, and runs smoothly even at max settings, including 4K (played using a GTX 1070). Lighting is very well done and provides a gloomy atmosphere with ominous glowing bug silhouettes dashing around and bright energy weapons flashiing across the screen. However, the majority of the time, the lighting is the only thing you'll get to appreciate, since the game is too dark to notice any other visual effects.However, If you can get this game on sale, need something to play in Steam Big Picture mode, and/or want to mow down generic alien bugs in exo-suits, this is a fairly good title. Just ignore the fact that it is supposed to be a red faction game, and dont bother listening to the ""story"". Just go shoot stuff.			",99,7,1,20,14,0,4

												The game was fun when I had it on PS3.  But there is a bug with the single player game.  You can however run the coop.   So the game works, but something is screwing up the single player new games.  I have tried the save point fix and it hasnt worked for me.  I would like to play this game.  The single player portin is important because your advancement is tracked thru both single and multi.  There isnt much of a multiplayer community(make sure you gift or get friends to buy) so single player is the funnest way to level up aside from grinding multi by yourself.  I wish someone would come up with a legit patch/mod to fix the issue.   This is why the recent ratings are ""mostly negative"".   The game concept is awesome.  Most things are not only destroyable, but also rebuildable. It make coop and multi very  interesting.   If you have hopes of it being fixed(I dont think developer exists anymore) then this is a great price. As of right now I cannot recommend this game in its current state.			",21,0,0,2,0,0,8

												I am giving this game a down vote, not because it is a bad game, but because if you want to play a good version of the game, play the previous installment. You still get to blow up buildings in marvelous ways, however this game plays liek a full on rail shooter(with a few parts being exactly that). the open world sandbox type feel of the last game is gone. any and all AI from the last game is gone. and worst of all, 90% of the environment from the last game is gone. If you want a linear game of ""walk forward, fire forward, kill aliens"" this is the game for you. if you are looking for a good follow up to the previous red faction game, this will leave you disappointed.

												Great game but not a great game. Ill be short with this and just put pros and cons and let you decide if its worth buying Note: i played the main ""campagn"" ""story"" only. no multiplayer or co-op and i dont see it affecting my reveiw anywaysPros:-The physics when blowing stuff up is beautiful. enough said-Compared to red faction geurilla it is more story driven but it is also its downfall-There is enough weapons to keep you happy-Explosions. Disintegrations. Nuff said.-Some parts are actually moving in the sense of you feel bad/sad/happy during the events of the game-visually appealing in my opinion, compared to guerilla everything is alot more detailed-there is a fix function so you can repair istuff you blew up on accidentCons:THE BIGGEST CON: The game had a 50/50 chance to crash at EVERY checkpoint. no way around it.-saving manually is irrelevant because when you load your save it just loads your autosave-After you hit 50% completion the enemies are more of a chore than a part of the game-There is four drivable vehicles in the game and you get to use them once-twice-You cant blow EVERYTHING up unlike guerilla-It felt like i was walking a straight set path the whole timeOverall: The game was fun. you bet your hiary grandmother it was. but it was NOT worth the price and not worth keeping after you finish the story (which was painful to push through the crashed). the constant. unfixable. crashes, is what utterly killed the game for me and urged me to get a refund.

												Pros:+Awesome destructive sandbox propertiesCons:-Drab and boring story mode; linear and ♥♥♥♥♥♥-Not enough content; when you beat it, you're done-No expansive use of it's own boons; blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up! - but don't do anything with itOverall: 5.0/10All this game does is give you the simple - and fun - mechanic of blowing everything up, and watching it crumble, and if you want, you can repair it, and do it all over again.Now, they take that, and do absolutely nothing worthy with it, they throw you into a boring linear storyline with nothing but gunfights with the atlernate objective of blowing a small thing up every now and again to give you the illusion that you can really tear stuff up, and get rewarded.Aside from the storymode, you're given two other game modes to mess around in; the first being Horde mode (Or whatever it is) is where you pit yourself up solo, or even with some friends, to fend out waves and waves of the main enemy of the game. But that's all you really do in it, there's not much else to it, and you're not given anything for accomplishing it. The second is Ruin mode, where your goal is to destroy as much as you can as fast and chaoticly as you can, and even if that sounds like what this game was trying to give you in the first place, it doesn't feel that nice.The weapon and fighting mechanics are just meh as the rest of it, get a few weapon slots for pre-defined weapons, and bang bang, hide to recover health, repeat. There's a few interesting weapon aresenals out there, but nothing that'll keep you hooked. The main enemy of the game is an alien race, but instead of clawing you to death with scythes or anything (which they have), they just shoot spikes at you all day. Again, another illusion of doing something unique, but it just masks the fact that they're all faceless soldier grunts.Even with all this, I never played Guerilla, which I heard was way way WAY better and cooler. Yeah, it probably was.			",189,21,1,37,13,1,34

												Fun enough in a sort of ""Halo"" knockoff sort of way. Very similar to Quake 4. Has crashed twice in twenty minutes. Definitely seems like a console video game (which is ok, I don't mind that). I'd say that it is worth playing through if sci-fi games are your favourite. This game is NOT intense or dark or anything like that, it is more 'teen' or 'youth' oriented (maybe more 'older teen,' i suppose). The crashes are a serious issue, however, & are kind of killing my motivation to play it more.			",56,1,0,5,0,0,3

												It's a shame that this game has so many things that would differentiate itself from an average shooter, yet it still is an average shooter. As soon as I found out Volition made this I kept thinking about how many things Saints Row managed to do better than this game (both this and SR4 have a black hole gun, yet SR4 does the same thing better?).The graphics are still pretty nice to this day, however you really end up looking at the same environments again and again, making it not very impressive. And some of the soundtrack (and general sound design) has some incredibly high pitched instrumentals and overall loud volume. This isn't a horror game by any means, yet the soundtrack sounds like it's from a lower budget Hannibal episode.			",219,54,4,21,13,2,16

												Do you love the huge open world, the exploration, the huge variety of things to do, the interesting buildings to tear down and blow up like the dirty space terrorist you are? Yes?! Well this game isn't for you, for some reason they decided to take everything that made the original reboot good and strip that away until you're left with a boring 3rd person corridor shooter. Seriously whoever came up with the idea to turn this game into what it is should be fired, I am baffled that anyone could be so impossibly brain dead to think it'd be a good idea to remove the thing that made the previous game so good.

												I actually like this game, the gameplay is great and the story is decent, if cliched. The reason I'm giving it a negative review is because it keeps crashing to desktop. On direct x 10 it crashes at EVERY checkpoint and cutscene, making it unplayable. on Direct x 9 it crashes about 20% of the time you hit a checkpoint or cutscene, making it playable if you're ok with relaunching about twice an hour and replaying from the last checkpoint, sometimes up to 10 minutes of gameplay.

												The game worked fine for me all the time.It is a bit linear shooter, with fun weapons and cool sections where you ride several diferent vehicles.The enemies get a bit boring, and starts to feel a bit of the same. I found me slogging for the last 3/4 part as the story was getting a bit boring and the enviroments looking the same (tunnels).The reconstruction mechanic is very cool and the destructability of everything, but the novelty wore of quickly.Totaly recomend this for anyone that likes a linear shooter.Sadly i dont strongly recomend it.

												This game is finally supported on Steam. The New Save Game button finally works. Steam Devs corrected the problem sometime in Late August. I played through this once over the course of 2 play sessions on Normal difficulty. Here is my review:This is your game if you want...Weak supporting characters.A dumb, pathetic main character.A laughable and forgettable plot.Cheap deaths when your cover is destroyed like tissue paper.One branching path through the game's 8 hour story mode.Enemies that often leap around the environment and don't attack you.Pew pew pew. Hide for 3 seconds. Lather Rinse Repeat.This is not your game if you want...A decently written storyA character you can identify with (He is literally 10x more insufferable than Alec Mason). Guns that you can upgrade. Open World environments.Rewards for fighting on higher difficulty.An explanation for why you're doing what you're doing.Fair challenge.This game tries to combine Borderlands with Half Life, and staples on some Descent for good measure. That might sound awesome, but it does none of these things better than the originals it's trying to emulate. The controls are okay. The mechanics...iffy. Seriously, why does this game give you toys like  two dissintigration rifles, and explosive munitions, then tell you to fight waves of enemies on a rickety catwalk over an INSTADEATH lava pit? Makes no sense AT ALL. It gives you restocking areas, but unless you have clairvoyance and know what kind of enemies you're going to be facing, choosing weapons is pointless. This is a downgrade from RF:G, where you knew what missions you were going to be choosing, and chose weapons to suit.I don't mind games that are challenging. At its core, though...RF:A is out to annoy you. If you manually save your game, you restart at the last checkpoint, so the feature is pointless. You have to reacquire everything you got between the checkpoint and the difficult zone. Things like skill upgrades. Ammo. Weapons. These swaps are not remembered if you die.Ammo balance is strange too. The large chests give you some of every ammo type, while the small boxes tend to give you nothing. Either they're for weapons you're not carrying--the game has way too many--or for weapons you're already full up on. So you either have too much ammo, or not enough.Also why must every female character in the RF universe be pretty much worthless at everything?I think Guerilla is much better. It wasn't trying to be other games. It feels like Armageddon is a missed opportunity. I didn't hate my 10 hours with the game. I just didn't feel like the challenge I was facing was fair or consistent. It was just dumb luck mostly, and grinding through. The story is terrible. Some of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I would recommend this game on a bargain, at 5.99 or below. Any more than that, don't waste your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely disappointing game. Didn't get into the first two red factions, but started at Guerilla and wanted to check out how its sequel was going.... I really wish I hadn't. AI hasn't improved since side-scrolling days, enemies standing upright until you walk around the corner then immediately blast your face off, so no element of sneak or suprise, you eventually get bored of peaking so just run around the corner already firing your gun. The difficulty is determined by how many enemies there are, not the skill used to take them down (oh look, there is no cover in this room, I wonder how long it will take for the player to die? Let's cram wave after wave of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥into that room, and to add some ""origionality"" lets make those waves get slightly harder each time.Also the bosses are freaking dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥and take no skill or brain to complete, it feels like I have a Navi over my shoulder pointing out the big freakin' glowy-ball-stuff that I need to shoot a certian number of times until the boss changes colour or something and I need to repeat the process again, except this time I need to avoid some other attack because he somehow transformed from you shooting his♥♥♥♥♥♥... *spoilers* The story is so unbelievably bland. It starts off fairly positively, which is what made me want to play, however it turned exxtremely quickly into a dumb panto written by a three year old and performed by Kirsten Stewart. THERE IS NO EMOTIONAL VALUE TO ANY OF THE CHARACTERS!!I have already mentioned there will be spoilers so here it is, Mason's girl (friend/acquaintance/random-person-he-just-meets??) dies near the end and all he says is ""NOOOO"" and carries on just as normal.The ENTIRE game is COMPLETELY RAILROADED, with little to gain from veering from the obvious paths, there is no free-world like its predecessor and I get that because you are in caves, but there is no varation from the story, no side-missions, no backstory, the only option after completing the campaign is to do it all again... And I would rather smash my face onto my keyboard repeatedly whilst listening to Skrillex than put myself through that again.So to conclude: DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF MONEYYou're welcome ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There never has been much consistency with the Red faction franchise. One second you're a honest working miner forced into a rebellion to stay a live, next you're a super soldier and then you're a terrorist insgurent on mars during the uprising...Now...Now you're a down on his luck outcast who accidentally always makes bad things happen and he just happens to be related to the previous games protagonist.... I love red faction for the first 7 or 8 hours I was actually enjoying Armageddon but it just started falling a part with choppy mission structure, abrupt cutscenes and a anti-climactic ending. Easily the worst in the franchise imo and thats hard for me to say given my thoughts on RF2.

												TL;DR: Overall, it's a farily decent game. You have the Red Faction feel with complete and utter environmental carnage, but the storyline seems out of place.Quick and Easy game, even on the highest difficulty.Would overall not recommend. _______Dry Humor on a Dry PlanetI will forever love the little bits of comedy that came around during cinematics/gameplay.Mason: SAM, show me where the bugs are.-SAM gives locations. Mason sees the hive colony-Mason: Buckle up, SAM. This may take a while.SAM: There is no ""buckle up"" directive in my drive.Mason: -sigh- Just shut up and show me where the bugs are.SAM: Affirmative.It's those little chuckles that get you through it all.However...The story feels wrong (it was half-decent though).- First off, this feels nothing like a Red Faction game. You fought the Ultor Corporation in the first one, Sopot's military in the second, and finally the EDF (military/corporation) in the third. This one just suddenly jumps to aliens. What the hell?There were no hints that I recall in the previous 3 games that even remotely stated aliens were here. They just suddenly exist. I suppose you could say those mutants you fought in RF 1 were a hint, but even then...They were mutants. Animals/humans Kapek experimented on with his nano-tech.Not even (some of) the  journals which tell of events prior/during/post RF 1 still felt right. They seemed out of place, what with their recordings being about aliens and Kapek, rather than something more believable (like Kapek and experimentation on humans/animals they brought (see/play RF 1 for animal/animutant encouters)).__The Destruction is awesomeWhat more can be said? This engine knows how to supply the demand for endless carnage.Whether you use a Magnet, a Hammer or a Rocket, just about everything can and will be blown to bits.It's all so satisfying to see those explosions consume the aliens that won't stay the f**k still.My only gripe is..Oh holy ****, I cant' progress because the place keeps falling apart!Long story short, you will be constantly repairing the entire level you just destroyed. If you don't, you're likely to blow up the bridge you needed to cross to get through the campaign. There's as much repairing as there is destruction, which can get annoying.A variety of abilities to complement the weapons.This game really made me want to use my abilities. I wasn't just firing my weapon, I actually felt encouraged to use my nanoforge's attacks to help maximize my damage, destruction, and survivabilityThe $20 price is around the right area, although getting it for less never hurts. Compared to the other games in the RF Franchise, this was a disappointment for me. That aside, it is a decent playthrough, though not as good as it could have been.All in all, I can't recommend this game, especially if you've played Red Faction: Geurilla.			",87,3,0,3,3,0,6

												The Red Faction franchise has always been about the one gimmick that made the game so noteworthy; the impressive ""Geomod"" technology that lets you rework the levels around you. Its odd then that in the latest title of the series Volition seems so reluctant to let me play with this gimmick in any meaningful way. Oh sure, I can bash down buildings and then instantly rebuild them with my ""nano-forge"" but the structures I take apart are all cosmetic frippery. The core of the game revolves instead around the stock weapons and the endless horde of generic aliens it throws at you. Bereft of the Geomod technology, Red Faction Armageddon is an below-average shooter, with the usual bevy of cliche characters and the standard nonsensical plot (the latter doubtlessly assisted by the fine writers of the SyFy channel, who underwrote this sequel). The graphics - horribly shuttered by a 45 degree FOV - were surprisingly unimpressive for a DirectX 11 game. The only time the game rose from the abyss of mediocrity were in the handful of instances when it opened up a little bit and let me truly experience the effectiveness of the Geomod tech. But these were too infrequent to save the game from its fear of its own uniqueness and by the end of the game I was overwhelmed by overwhelming ennui.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a damned waste.Here's an idea for following up on our brilliantly-chaotic open-world game with a focus on environmental physics-based destruction.  Let's make a generic linear third-person shooter!What set Red Faction apart was always the interactivity with the world.  Terrain deformation when such things were unheard of in Red Faction 1 and 2, and some amazing building destruction physics in Red Faction Guerilla.  That last one still stands as an amazing open-world game.This one's Gears of War.  You can still break all kinds of stuff in the world, but since it's ludicrously linear, they have to give you a giant undo gun so you don't strand yourself.  Instead of an open battle for supremacy on the surface of Mars against a paramilitary government, you're shooting spiders in dark caves.Did the developers even PLAY the previous games?

												This is a very solid action game with excellent gameplay, high quality visuals, a large variety of satisfying weapons and destructible environments. Yes, it is linear. No, it is not epically long. If those are big issues for you, then don't get it. Most of the complaints I have read about Armageddon are that it is different from Guerilla. Well, it is. Guerilla is open world, Armageddon is not. Guerilla has lots of driving and combat with vehicles, Armageddon does not. Guerilla also has its share of flaws, and they are different from Armageddon's flaws. In Armageddon, I would have liked more outdoor areas, more human enemies, vehicular enemies, and more large structures to destroy. But despite those shortcomings, it is still a good game.

												You know I don't know why people sometimes hate on Red Faction games. I watched a review of this game at some point and the reviewer reflected on the fact that every second RF game is, apparently, a load of hooey.Earlier today I reviewed Red Faction 2, and as I praised the title in that review then what I feel about this game should become clear: I like this game.It has great graphics, fun gameplay with the mag gun sorta thing, great combat against aliens and some good challenges. I wasn't really looking for much more than what I got - interesting, utterly destructible environments, good graphics that ran smoothly, big booms and crashes and lots of enemies that presented a hazard but also went splat rather nicely. The story isn't all that bad either, even if it takes a back seat to the action, and of course it doesn't pay much attention to the Red Faction storyline of the first or third games but who gives a crap? It's a good game.			",75,6,0,24,6,0,27

												TL;DR: Overall, it's a farily decent game. You have the Red Faction feel with complete and utter environmental carnage, but the storyline seems out of place.Quick and Easy game, even on the highest difficulty.Would overall not recommend. _______Dry Humor on a Dry PlanetI will forever love the little bits of comedy that came around during cinematics/gameplay.Mason: SAM, show me where the bugs are.-SAM gives locations. Mason sees the hive colony-Mason: Buckle up, SAM. This may take a while.SAM: There is no ""buckle up"" directive in my drive.Mason: -sigh- Just shut up and show me where the bugs are.SAM: Affirmative.It's those little chuckles that get you through it all.However...The story feels wrong (it was half-decent though).- First off, this feels nothing like a Red Faction game. You fought the Ultor Corporation in the first one, Sopot's military in the second, and finally the EDF (military/corporation) in the third. This one just suddenly jumps to aliens. What the hell?There were no hints that I recall in the previous 3 games that even remotely stated aliens were here. They just suddenly exist. I suppose you could say those mutants you fought in RF 1 were a hint, but even then...They were mutants. Animals/humans Kapek experimented on with his nano-tech.Not even (some of) the  journals which tell of events prior/during/post RF 1 still felt right. They seemed out of place, what with their recordings being about aliens and Kapek, rather than something more believable (like Kapek and experimentation on humans/animals they brought (see/play RF 1 for animal/animutant encouters)).__The Destruction is awesomeWhat more can be said? This engine knows how to supply the demand for endless carnage.Whether you use a Magnet, a Hammer or a Rocket, just about everything can and will be blown to bits.It's all so satisfying to see those explosions consume the aliens that won't stay the f**k still.My only gripe is..Oh holy ****, I cant' progress because the place keeps falling apart!Long story short, you will be constantly repairing the entire level you just destroyed. If you don't, you're likely to blow up the bridge you needed to cross to get through the campaign. There's as much repairing as there is destruction, which can get annoying.A variety of abilities to complement the weapons.This game really made me want to use my abilities. I wasn't just firing my weapon, I actually felt encouraged to use my nanoforge's attacks to help maximize my damage, destruction, and survivabilityThe $20 price is around the right area, although getting it for less never hurts. Compared to the other games in the RF Franchise, this was a disappointment for me. That aside, it is a decent playthrough, though not as good as it could have been.All in all, I can't recommend this game, especially if you've played Red Faction: Geurilla.			",87,3,0,3,3,0,6

												Playing this game after playing Red Faction: Guerilla is unfair to Armageddon.  Just about eveything awesome about Guerilla has been handicapped or taken away here.  Instead of a non-linear, open world sandbox of destructible awesomeness, you're given a liner corridor shooter with some destructible things here and there.  The story isn't anything to write home about either.  Essentially it's ""oops, I did something: Monsters!"" for the 7 to 10 hours you suffer, er I mean play, through it.  This is definitely one of those games I only got because it was part of a Humble Bundle. and only bothered to finish because I don't like to leave games unfinished, nor do I like to uninstall them when I haven't completed them.  Do yourself a favor and get red Faction: Guerilla instead.  <---- perhaps I should have led with this.			",163,36,0,30,12,2,30

												What a damned waste.Here's an idea for following up on our brilliantly-chaotic open-world game with a focus on environmental physics-based destruction.  Let's make a generic linear third-person shooter!What set Red Faction apart was always the interactivity with the world.  Terrain deformation when such things were unheard of in Red Faction 1 and 2, and some amazing building destruction physics in Red Faction Guerilla.  That last one still stands as an amazing open-world game.This one's Gears of War.  You can still break all kinds of stuff in the world, but since it's ludicrously linear, they have to give you a giant undo gun so you don't strand yourself.  Instead of an open battle for supremacy on the surface of Mars against a paramilitary government, you're shooting spiders in dark caves.Did the developers even PLAY the previous games?

												The Red Faction franchise has always been about the one gimmick that made the game so noteworthy; the impressive ""Geomod"" technology that lets you rework the levels around you. Its odd then that in the latest title of the series Volition seems so reluctant to let me play with this gimmick in any meaningful way. Oh sure, I can bash down buildings and then instantly rebuild them with my ""nano-forge"" but the structures I take apart are all cosmetic frippery. The core of the game revolves instead around the stock weapons and the endless horde of generic aliens it throws at you. Bereft of the Geomod technology, Red Faction Armageddon is an below-average shooter, with the usual bevy of cliche characters and the standard nonsensical plot (the latter doubtlessly assisted by the fine writers of the SyFy channel, who underwrote this sequel). The graphics - horribly shuttered by a 45 degree FOV - were surprisingly unimpressive for a DirectX 11 game. The only time the game rose from the abyss of mediocrity were in the handful of instances when it opened up a little bit and let me truly experience the effectiveness of the Geomod tech. But these were too infrequent to save the game from its fear of its own uniqueness and by the end of the game I was overwhelmed by overwhelming ennui.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hopes for Armageddon weren't high, which is why it’s taken me so long to actually play the game. I was pleasantly surprised though :)The game is very well made, the environment design, the lighting, the animations and weapon effects. It’s all made to a very high standard, similar to the previous game, Red Faction: Guerrilla. Unlike Guerrilla though, this is a corridor shooter but with some seriously innovative features. Returning from the previous games is the geo-mod technology that allows the player to destroy the environment. I’m so happy they've brought this back and even enhanced it! The new features include a  magnet gun, which allows objects to be pulled into other objects with great force. This creates a gameplay style I’ve never experienced before! Using a house to crush your enemies never gets old! The new nano forge ability allows the player to regenerate the environment after you have destroyed it. This I found particularly cool, destroying the environment and then rebuilding to create cover or access new areas. Clearly a lot of thought has been put into new gameplay features for this game. The story is probably the weakest point here. There are many links to previous Red Faction games (which is always great to see), but the characters are somewhat stale and the story feels as though it’s moving too fast at times. The low res cut scenes don’t help either.But overall, a very good game. It’s always great to experience new and interesting gameplay mechanics, which Armageddon pulls off very well.

												This is a short review. I might write a full review sometime later.Anyway, this game is fun and has full destructible/repairable environments. What's not to like? Sure, it's not open world like Red Faction: Guerilla, and it definetly would be better if it was, but it's still heck of a lot of fun. It took me 16 hours to complete the full campaign, which is longer than your average shooter. This game could also do with a bit of variety. Most of the levels look way too similar and throughout the game I was really hoping for more sections on actual land and not underground. The story isn't perfect and does suffer from some cliches, but it's still good and is better than most of what we get from shooters nowadays.When I finished the game (which was about 10-20 minutes ago as of writing this review) I felt a bit disappointed and it did feel lackluster. I expected a bit more of an ending. The game doesn't necessarily end in a cliff hanger, but I felt that the ending could have been more conlcusive.Overall, I enjoyed Guerilla and Armageddon thoroughly and equally (I also remember playing the original Red Faction on the Nokia N-Gage... I know), I honestly really want to see a Red Faction 5. The IP currently belongs to Nordic Games, so Volition, the developers of Red Faction 1-Armageddon (fun fact: also the developers of the Saints Row franchise) will not be working on RF5. Now we can only hope that Nordic Games know what they're doing and will deliver a solid next instalment in the franchise. It would be great if they would try to co-operate with Volition (Volition stated they will not do work on RF anymore, but hey, they could still help). So, good luck, Nordic.			",163,16,2,23,12,1,30

												Underneath this seemingly by-the-numbers corridor shooter, lies an outrageously fun and inventive 3rd person shooter.A game extremely ahead of its time in terms of destruction and reconstruction, you not only get to destroy everything you see, including entire vertical levels, you often need to reconstruct what you have destroyed (in an astonishingly fascinating way, using the nano forge) in order to continue on.The graphics start plain, but are increasingly amped up with amazing particle effects and explosions.AI is impressive and works in team effort utilizing the 3d environment to its fullest.The enemies are bugs, and this has been done before (lost planet like), but are graphically done well.Weaponry in the game is some of the most fun I can recall in recent gaming.The Singularity gun is an incredible and gorgeously animated black hole firing weapon.The game even has weapon that is a unicorn that fires rainbow particle beams, anally.  Not kidding, its spectacular and it is real.GPS is well designed and much needed in this maze of level design, albeit very fun and well layed out.The story is well fleshed out, but takes a lot from Bioshock/Borderlands using Audio Logs.Overall this is a far meatier game than Red Faction Guerilla (even if it doesnt have a jet pack... hey its got a spaceship!) and a worthy successor to an already great game.Many people missed this game, probably quitting after the first couple levels, but I assure you, if you salvage, buy weaponry and powerups, you will be waiting for more bugs to pummel with your overpowered weapon rack!8/10, I would have paid more for this one.

And it keeps dragging me along this plot thing I don't care about.

I couldn't shake the feeling of boredom and not wanting to play this. I wondered off in the wrong direction on the first mission and encountered an out of bounds area that started the typical 'return to battle"" warning message and count down. After seeing this i cursed at the game and immediately alt+f4'd and uninstalled this pile of console♥♥♥♥♥♥cant change fov. controls feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥if i change the resolution to anything but default. typical console port garbage.I had my eye of this game for a while.

												I'll keep this short, cuz this game really doesn't deserve all that much of my time.The shooting is by far some of the worst I've seen.Health regens like crazy. As long as you don't die you'll be full health in a few seconds, even on hard.The only thing in this game stupider than the plot is the main character.Breaking stuff is a lot of fun, but they manage to ruin that too by making it so the gamemode where you actually get to break stuff basically takes place in a box where you get to shoot stuff on the outside.Don't buy this. Get any other Red Faction game.			",405,82,5,53,19,2,37

												After playing this game, I have played all the RF games, and I can now tell you which one is the worst. It's NOT Red Faction: Armageddon. The worst RF game goes to Red Faction II. Seriously, Armageddon is better than I thought it would be. The story is ok somewhat, but it's better than in RF:G. You play as Darius Mason, grandson of Alec Mason from RF:G, and he has more personality than his grandfather. He can be hilarious at times, especially when interacting with his S.A.M. (Situational Awareness Module) A.I. The theme of revolution is still here, although not as it was in previous games, you'll see what I mean. The campaign last for roughly 15 hours.As for gameplay, it's really fun. Geo-Mod is still here. My main gripe is the removal of open-world. That's really a step back. It could easily have been implemented here. An underground open-world? That would have been great. But I like the new weapons such as the Magnet Gun. It allows you to latch magnets between two objects making one move towards the other. Upgrades are nice too. Taking out the baddies is really fun. What I really didn't like is how the game holds your hand. Not only do you have an objective marker, but also an arrowed path telling you where to go, leaving no room to find where to go on your own. And during boss fights, there is an icon telling you where you shoot, such as weak spots. Too-much hand-holding! As for Infestation mode, I haven't really played it yet, but it's a Horde mode, where you fight endless waves of enemies. Sounds fun.In the end, RF:A isn't bad, but it could have been better. Back when it was released, it would be worth a rental, but buying it now wouldn't be a bad idea, since it's relatively cheap nowadays. Now, Nordic games has control of the franchise, and they have promised a new game. Well, let us see how that turns out...			",60,0,1,1,6,0,5

The storyline is pretty involving, you'll enjoy the game when you play the campaign.But once you have beaten the campaign, there is pretty much nothing left. Some infestation and ruin modes would allow you to kill some time, but there is nothing more to it than the campaign.If you are thinking of grabbing this in an offer, then by all means, go for it.

Boasting a destruction system that soaks the panties of anarchists everywhere, magical powers that grant both life and death, and so many nanomachines that MGS4 seems tame by comparison, the boring characters and silly plot are easy to forget when you can just jump into a mech suit and box aliens.

												now it says 0 hours for this game but i played it on console while i had PC repairs done and the only reason i have this game in my library is that it came in a humble bundle and all the other titles were decent but getting to the point ....just ...wow... to date this has to be not the worst game i have ever played but definitely the worst sequel. i mean it was never going to be an easy task living up to the standards set by the games predecessor Red Faction: Guerrilla but whoever was leading the Dev team for this game had clearly either never played the first game or was doing so blindfolded and with noise cancelling earphones on. the list of issues i have with this game makes it difficult to know where to begin.okay so Armageddon is a linear third person shooter set in the Red Faction universe. the game follows the great grandson of Alex Mason (the Hero of the first game) named Darius Mason. Darius is a soldier in the Red Faction army who now rule mars after the events of the first game but after a monumental screw up on his part humanity is left living underground unable to survive on the surface of mars. the story to this game is many things and none of them good, its generic, poorly paced, poorly written and has a penchant for making scenes appear dramatic when you can blatantly see them coming. it even has a love interest side story to it (totally not trying to copy and paste from the first game) which gets a fittingly poor ending to it. its not the worst writing i have ever laid eyes on but its damn close to it. they say if you gave a thousand monkeys type writers and left them alone they would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare.. this game is what the monkeys typed out.down to the core of this game, the mechanics .. now despite my disliking for this game the mechanics are one of the few things that this game actually got correct. gun mechanics work perfectly as expected, movement is smooth with no issues and in general the games mechanics are as solid as Armageddons (there is a god after all). this is a rare redeeming feature in a sea of disaster. the only real issues you could have with the mechanics would be during the flight mission when the ship does control a bit like you are having a seizure at the wheel but  other than this instance they are fine. the best part of this game which i very much believe they just copied over from the first game is the destruction engine (i shudder to imagine if they had redone this aspect as well) the engine is great providing seamless destruction of cover and environments. this is the best part of this game just being able to blow up or disintegrate the cover preventing you from slaying the enemy (be warned this works both ways) and i did quite enjoy this diamond among the rough feature after the hours of endless fun you get from it in the first game.back to whats wrong with this game then. its a LINEAR sequel to a SANDBOX game ... how hard did the games developers hit each other over the head with a hammer to think this would work. look at any successful sandbox game such as Grand Theft Auto or Saints row ... imagine they had a linear sequel ... it just doesn't work .. this kind of game is meant to be played as a sandbox. this very story driven linear progression also hampers the range of missions the player has access to. in the first game the player conducted a wide range of mission in order to advance, now though the levels can be summarized by starting each mission and being told .. follow this line and kill everything in your path. there is no diversity it is just a repeated slog of go here run this way and kill this thing. there is also NOTHING but story in this game, no side missions except for collecting a few audio logs left in blatantly obvious places throughout the game. the first game had a wide variety missions and activities set aside from the main campaign. why would you develop a game and then remove all the content for the sequel? its just stupid really. the linear environments also have a negative affect on combat. no more flanking the enemy or sniping from afar no for this game you just have to slug it out in toe to toe combat 90% of the time unless that specific part of the game requires the use of a sniper or other specialist weapon. because we totally hated having the diverse arsenal of weapons available at any point in the previous game .. thanks THQ you are a real star .. NOTand now we have the multiplayer.. what can i say for this other than DON'T!!.. the multiplayer for this game is almost as terrible as the single player with majority of the issues from the core game crossing over into the multiplayer. to simplify it you have two modes a mode for destruction where player stake it in turn to see who can cause the most destruction in a map and a kind of horde mode where the player stares down waves of aliens hoping not to become E.Ts Dinner. the destruction mode is pretty fun to begin with but there is again not much diversity to it and it gets pretty boring pretty quickly. the horde mode lasts a bit longer with more maps and a better experience if your playing with other players but again its just the same thing over and over and over .. the maps are okay but the AI for the aliens is shoddy at best. sometimes they wont even notice you when you stand in front of them or on the flip side they will spot you from a mile away and bring all their little buddies to tear your martian nads right off (funny when watching it happen.... not so funny when it happened to me :( ). its a great laugh if you are playing it every now and again or in split screen but it doesn't last. the hype for this game actually quite excited me at the time and i (regrettably) pre-ordered this game thinking it would be as awesome as the first game ... i was wrong. in short this game is a less than enjoyable experience. the linear, poorly written generic story and tedious gameplay coupled with the poor multiplayer experience and community make this a game i wouldn't be in a hurry to play again. despite the redeeming features of the amazing destruction engine and all around good mechanics for this game they are twinkling plus points in the sea of disaster that is this game. in short .. if you buy this game after reading this you probably have a power drill or some other sharp object jammed in the side of your head O_o in which case you probably loved the ending to RAGE and live on the moon..

												Despite the fact that I have never played any of the other Red Faction games, I love this title. The story is very captivating and I love the large array of weapons that you can choose from. This game seems to always keep me on my feet, shooting aliens here, one there, it is constantly making me energetic. I have only put 2 hours into the game and I have only reached 20% of the entire story mode, which means that there is a fairly long story. Even after I get done with the single player campaign, there is 2 OTHER multi-player modes that I can play. The graphics look very crisp and nice. I like how (most) the world is fully destructable, using my Maul I can tear down walls or any various obsticles that stand in my way. I will probably find myself playing this game when I complete it again because this is a very nice title. I am concidering playing the other Red Faction games because people have said that this was the game that ruined the entire series. I don't know what made this game so much worse for the Red Faction series. I like to play shooters and adventure titles, this was a very nice game for me to pick up, it is a 3rd person action adventure shooter title that takes place in the future years. I am not extremely far in the story yet so I don't exactly have a really good standpoint as to what's going on in the game's storyline. I would reccomend this to someone who hasn't played any other Red Faction titles because it seems to me that Red Faction players seem to hate this game. The game really doesn't seem that repetative to me, but sometimes it can be. It's not as bad as Dead Island but it can get that way sometimes. I don't die normally, I have only died once and that was on accident. I have the difficutly at Normal setting so if it were me, I'd set it to hard or something above Normal for someone looking for a little harder AI to fight against. I'd give this game a rough 8.9/10 it's a great title if you want a 3rd person shooter kind of like Gears of War.			",146,26,9,12,5,4,7

												The 1 multiplayer mode is fun (horde mode) but it doesn't compare to Red Faction Guerilla. On that note however, don't buy that either. The community is more or less dead and there aren't anymore publishers working on the franchise.If it's less than $3 then yes its a really good price but in the long run its just a library filler and not an actual game worth playing for more than an hour. Pick up a destruction game with an active community, I don't know if they're still making those though :/			",85,17,1,14,16,0,19

												Despite the fact that I have never played any of the other Red Faction games, I love this title. The story is very captivating and I love the large array of weapons that you can choose from.

												This Red Faction has more toys, which should make it more fun, right? Not so much. Somehow your higher damage weapons take longer to kill enemies, enemies have an easier time slaughtering you, even when you pick the easiest setting, they kill you many times faster than iin the previous game.TLDR?If you liked Red Faction Guirrila, dont buy Red Faction Armageddon.

												It's not a bad game, it's just that everything in it is somewhat underwhelming. The combat can be fun, but only when you're surrounded by heaps of small enemies, which doesn't happen as much as you'd like to. Fighting big enemies is a chore but that's what you do more and more the more you play. The destructable enviroment is mildly amusing at first, but it comes with its ups and downs. The story is probably the worst part of the game. It's embarrassingly clumsy and has plot holes the size of Mars itself.6/10			",334,114,13,20,21,4,33

												I don't understand how this game can be so boring when its predecessor was so much fun. Aside from the fact that his game was almost unplayable with its glitches ( It gave me a black screen at startup, which left me spending hours trying to patch whatever was wrong with it) the game is also just so linear. Red faction guerrilla (The first game) was an open world destruction  sandbox, the best I've ever played! But this game is so limited, there's no side missions, only a limited amout of things are destuctable, (which was the games selling point) and the enemies are too cliche it's like any other alein shooter.I'm not against them for trying something new but it being a stereotypical third person shooter isn't why I wanted to play this, I would have enjoyed it if they kept it an open world like its previous title.

The storyline is pretty involving, you'll enjoy the game when you play the campaign.But once you have beaten the campaign, there is pretty much nothing left. Some infestation and ruin modes would allow you to kill some time, but there is nothing more to it than the campaign.If you are thinking of grabbing this in an offer, then by all means, go for it. It will not have any replay value whatsoever.			",467,167,23,44,41,1,42

												Differnt from Guerilla, but still a good shooter with the destructable enviorments that you would expect from the series. The main complaint that some people have is that it isnt opne world like Guerilla and turned into a gears of war rip off to which i say look at the diversity of weapons and abilities. The story is passable and teh gameplay is great. All in all Id' say that its a good game adn if your nervous about buying it wait for it to go on sale.			",33,2,0,6,0,0,14

												Takes everything enjoyable about Red Faction: Guerrilla, throws it out the window and makes you fight aliens instead.  What is the point of a Red Faction fighting for settler's rights against ALIENS?  You turned a legitamate battle of colonists versus a foreign government (read: The Revolutionary War) and turned it into a battle of human colonists against indigenous aliens (read: The atrocities visited upon Native Americans AFTER the Revolutionary War).  Nice job, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			",175,27,1,17,10,3,8

												Underwhelming is what can best be used to describe this game. There's nothing wrong with it save for some optimization issues. The only things ""wrong"" I found were the aesthetics and that is, of course, debatable. The Red Faction just looks wrong, to me. They look silly all shaved bald and running around in capes. Their technology looks just plain wrong. It looks terrible and boring. Even the vaunted destruction physics are utilized poorly. Driving a tank through a wall never felt so boilerplate. And the enemies are even worst. Who honestly thought that using monsters would be a good idea? The Religious zealots you fight look ridiculous. They look like rejects from a GI Joe cartoon and act like it, too. It all looks like they were made to market a toy line.But, is there anything wrong with it other than that? Not really, it's solid, sure. It's just so unimpressive. Sure, there's fun to be had bashing down walls to kill enemies, that's definitely a high point. But, really? That's it. A forgettable plot, boring weapon mechanics and an underutilized destruction engine.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												I had gotten this on a sale along with the rest of the Red Faction series and I have to be honest, this is the worst one in my opinion. The first 2 aren't all that great either, but considering you can still destroy walls in them even though it's a 10+ year old game, it's pretty freaking amazing. But after Red Faction: Guerrilla, it seems that nothing can really compete with it. And Armageddon isn't really strong as Guerrilla is, which definitely shows. For one: The destruction is actually worse. Objects constantly disappear into the ground, like when something as simple as a giant pipe crashes to the ground.Two: The story sucks, enough said.All in all if you like linear story and small maps instead of open world like in Guerrilla, and don't really care for good destruction but instead fancy cutscenes, then this one might be for you.

												The sales of Red Faction: Armageddon were poor and the game was considered a commercial failure by THQ. Because of this, on June 27, 2011, THQ announced that plans for future installments had been cancelled. The disappointing sales of Armageddon, along with other factors, had led THQ to lose $38.4 million in a fiscal year. While no actual sales figures are revealed, after THQ declared bankruptcy in December 2012, developer Volition, who was purchased by Deep Silver in an auction, revealed that the development of both Red Faction Guerrilla and Red Faction: Armageddon had ""lost quite a bit"" of money"" for THQ.

												This is a 10-hour long game, which feels like it has about 5 hours of truly enjoyable content to it. The latter half of the campaign is a boring slog. Unless you got the game in a bundle, or otherwise can get it very cheap, feel free to ignore it. You won't lose much, though a few things are cool about it (the destruction physics and walker/mech sections are cool).			",232,86,1,21,15,0,45

												The only downfall of this title is the fact that it claims to be a ""Red Faction"" game.Red Faction Armageddon is actually a very good game.It would probably be better if they didn't use the ""Red Faction"" franchize name.There is very little Faction work.I've heard people complain about how Darius (the protagonist) isn't a likeable character, and that he is just a generic shooter hero.  Well this is true, He is just generic. A hero who falls in love, takes her on his journey, she is killed by the alien queen, Darius goes head first into the hive, and kills every last one of them.Now, the Aresonal is uninspired bull feces (aside from mister toots).There are only a few carry-over weapons from Red Faction Guerilla.Just to name a few, we have The Arc Welder, The Nano Rifle, and The Enforcer.The rest of the weapons are uninspired reduxes from other games and boring reskins from older entries in the series.Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game, but it isn't Red Faction.With that being said, this game is very fun.There isn't an overbearing narative to weigh down an alien-head smashing party.You can destroy entire buidings, and then repair them in a blink of the eye.You can kill so many aliens, even with other aliens (refering to the magnet gun).Well, I can't reccomend this game if you want a Red Faction game, but if you want a high-action alien killing,building destroying sandbox game, this is the game for you.With Love,FaustOh, just a personal note, You Matter...Unless you multiply yourself by the speed of light squared, then you energy.

												There's only two reasons to play this, three if you're a nostalgist: The Magnet Gun and because it's a masterclass on videogame writing, notably what not to do. The third is because one of the levels is a proof-of-concept of a Descent remake, which would make a far superior game than this pile of garbage.

												I was really hoping that this game would further explore the avenues opened by Red Faction Guerrilla, a game I have come back to over and over just because of the fun and lively open world setting, combined with the absolute joy of destroying stuff. Armageddon still has the wonderful knocking down of buildings, and the magnet gun is incredibly fun to play with, but it just feels like puttering around with little point, compared to the fun of kicking over a UEF hornets nest, trying to desperately knock down a barracks before you are overwhelmed by soldiers or are forced to make a desperate getaway. It was too much of a feeling of being a corridor shooter, after having gotten used to the open and large scale of the previous game. I enjoyed it a little at first, but I quickly got bored and never finished it. Maybe it gets better?			",201,36,2,66,39,2,76

												You gotta be kidding me. I played the first couple of levels thinking, ""Okay, eventually we are going to hit the open world like in Red Faction Guerilla and THEN blow a few buildings up."" Instead, this game is a hallway shooter and mostly underground, no less. Sure, you get to destroy      some equipment with a couple rather nifty weapons (and repair them in case you're a drunken idiot and dissolved that one catwalk you needed to cross) but its all within the confines of a dank, uninteresting atmosphere. You'd have more fun going down into your grandmother's cellar and knocking a shelf over. There is what's known as Ruin Mode where you can run around and turn the map into a parking lot but that becomes a snorefest eventually. The story is borderline laughable. Not cringeworthy but it's like the vice president of the company's son wrote it for his drama class. This isn't a horrible game. Get it if it's on sale. If you have a choice, get the very first Red Faction and Guerilla. Skip the 2nd.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not really into singleplayer games, I mostly prefer playing with a friend or agasint a friend, but this singleplayer is pretty great I must say, it's unlike most games when it comes to destruction however it's not free as the first game where you could just keep drilling and drilling to the end which was crazy but fun. Mulitplayer swarm mode is where I've had my best fun with this, with intelligent enemeries that keep the gameplay mixed up, a perk tree(circle) that keeps you comming back ""gotta catch em all"" It's a blast.Graphics still hold up well considering how much destruction you have on screen it's impressive and never suffers slow down.7.9/10			",189,16,20,16,35,2,12

												Hey guys, we have the best destructible enviroments made in a game. We also have an interesting setting and driveable vehicles and an open world enviroment and a great multiplayer. Sadly, that was our last game, Red Faction Guerilla. This is not Guerilla. We thought outside the box on this one, and put everything inside a box. That's right, all that destructible envoriment, inside caves where there are barely any buildings to destroy. No more driveable vehicles, apart from one or two mechs. All enemies replaced with aliens which make no sense and are terribly programmed. Multiplayer is also practically dead... But the best part? Oh yes, this game is not even open worlded like Guerilla was.We took everything good about Guerilla, removed it, and here's your game.I ♥♥♥♥ing hate you.			",252,19,8,14,23,2,54

												Pinnacle of current console/casual focus designs /sarcasm. Its just another meh console focus third person game that is boring as hell. Stupid upgrades that make an easy game easier, typical slow console mechanics, terrible FOV(thankfully can be fixed on PC. by default its insanely close to the character), lame story in an attempt to bring life to a dying franchise(hurrrrrrrrrr just add aliens),  an entire planet littered with ammo boxes every 50 feet, stupid easy boss fight, etc. On the upside though, like all THQ games before it went bankrupt, its a solid game that doesnt try to do anything different or amazing. I only forced myself through it because the facial animation was good :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Armageddon is the best part of Red Faction franchise. The game is all about detruction (as one of my friends said: Destruction is good :D) while fighting against aliens and completing objectives. The gamer steers Mason member of military who has the job to stop aliens and save the Mars. Our hero remains alone during the epic fightm but sometimes he gets some help and is allowed to drive very powerful vehicles and robots that makes easier to wipe out tons of alien bugs. Weapons are diverse from light pistol trough plasma cannon to singularity gun, but the most funniest is the magnet gun. As you proceed in the story more and more upgrades are becoming available helping Mason to survive the alien invasion. At the end of the game you will need the upgrades in case you want to survive the Queen. An expansion to the game is Path to War dlc which contains 4 new maps and new weapons and achievements. I recommend them everyone.Nagyon fain játék, csak a pusztításról szól.			",244,15,3,28,3,1,6

												Went into this without expecting anything, and ended up enjoying a fun (if simplistic) shooter with a few neat twists, certainly worth the pennies they ask.I Can't see it will have much replay value for me, but I've had enough play time to say it was worth it.My only real criticism is that the controls were often not as fluid / responsive as I'd like them to have been, often causing a few blue words as my character was respawning.I think the various review scores you can find are pretty much on the mark, a solid game at around 7/10 but nothing truely amaizing.

When the massive Terraformer that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and weather is destroyed, the atmosphere turns to chaos, super-tornados and lightning storms engulf the planet. To survive, the Colonists flee to the underground mines and build a network of habitable caves. Five years later, Darius Mason, grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya, runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist activity. Mining, scavenging, mercenary work--if the job is dangerous, Darius is your man. Few sane people now venture to the ravaged surface, aside from contractors like Darius and the smugglers who run goods between the settlements. When Darius is tricked into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old Marauder temple, he releases a long-dormant evil and unleashes Armageddon on Mars. As Colonist and Marauder settlements are torn asunder, only Darius and the Red Faction can save mankind. The battle will take them across the storm-blasted planet--and below it, to the very heart of the unspeakable threat. Red Faction®: Armageddon™ expands on the critically acclaimed, best-selling franchise with new, groundbreaking challenges. You are humanity’s last hope for survival. - Highly Recommended!

												Awsome game. Throw bugs at other bugs to kill bugs or throw buildings at bugs to kill bugs or throw bugs at buildings to kill buildings or do it all at once!The magnet gun is the best gun in any game ever.The level destruction is the star of the game and it is very good. It is limited to manmade structures and crystals.The main campaign is a little short at just under 6 hours long and even that felt a little dragged out towards the end. It suffers from very repetetive gameplay in the second half of the game. It is occasionally eased a little when you are given a mech or vehicle but those are too few and far between.There is a bit of replayability where you unlock a whole set of new weapons and ""cheats"" to use in new game+ unlocked with salvage the same way as abilities.You have 4 active abilities seperate from weapons, a force push, an aoe stun/damage/lifesteal, a shield and a beserk mode. Because the conventional weapons are boring and you rarely fight enmies with guns the beserk and shield are pretty much useless unless your going full mele. The AOE lifesteal upgrade is pretty much required as there isnt really a way to avoid most attacks as they are either to fast, AOE or mele.There are two other modes outside of the campaign:Infestation is a 1-4 player co-op wave defense. You and your allies must defend against increasingly difficult waves of bugs, nothing special there. You will not find anyone else online unless its a free weekend or somthing, be sure to bring friends if you want to play this mode.(I forgot what this is called, lets call it destruction) Destruction puts in a small map with goal of causing as much destruction as possible within the time limit. You have all your weapons and ulocked upgrades from the campaign. There is also a freeplay mode that removes the time limit and lets you use cheats and the op weapons unocked for completing the campaign.Overall this is a fun little game with awsome mechanics i wish other games picked up. I cannot reccomend it at full price with such little content, but definetly pick it up on a sale or free weekend.			",165,21,1,25,26,0,23

												Did you like the previous one? Well here's a bunch of caves to run through and minimal destruction... so ♥♥♥♥ you. They tried to improve on what Gurellia did so well, destruction, and added ""anti-destruction"" basically you have a gun that restores buildings to their original state but it also takes away your open world and replaces it with linear levels in an underground network so you're basically just moving foward and down most of the time.

												Although it differs from the open-world format that its predecessor had, it's still a great story driven game, with lots of stuff to blow up, and beautiful graphics to showcase its technical prowess.Certainly worth the $20 price tag.			",211,61,8,44,61,3,19

												A word of warning for the fans of Red Faction: Guerrilla. (Like me.)This game is a linear corridor run. There is no open world. There is little destruction. The style of this game is nothing like Guerrilla.Do you research before getting this game!----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 3.5/5Gameplay: 3/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 2/5Aesthetics: 1.5/5Visuals: 4/5Atmosphere: 1.5/5Music: 3.5/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												Nearly the entire game is destructible which is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It controls really great and looks amazing and is a blast to play. Overall it is solid in every area, especially in weapon variety and effects. Also, I will break into your house via a well placed kick to the front door, bringing it from its hinges entirely, come in and punch your wife, impregnate your daughter, steal change from your dresser, spray paint your dog white, punch you in the stomach, eat doritos in your recliner and wipe my fingers on it, and steal the last beer from your fridge and pour it out in the carpet right next to your face as you ly helpless, gasping for air from the stomach punch I gave you minutes earlier. When you seek revenge, I will be waiting.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Red Faction: Armageddon is a game developed by Volition Studios and originally published by the now defunct company THQ, now published by THQ Nordic (or Nordic Games) and is also the fourth game in the Red Faction series Red Faction: Armageddon is an action packed third person shooter which follows up from the previous Red Faction: Guerrilla game and continues the Red Faction story line. However, this time the game sticks with the third person view from Red Faction: Guerrilla and also drops the open world concept and is linear like the first original two gamesThe storyline and missions are still fun as ever and works out well even though the amazing open world from Red Faction: Guerrilla is gone. The gameplay is pretty standard, but lots of fun and you also have a new nifty magnet gun and some powers with the Nano ForgeOnce again the highlight of the Red Faction series is blowing stuff up, and you can blow up all the structures and also repair things since enemies will often be attacking you and stairs and other things you need to access will be gone. Lastly, there's an Infestion (Horde) mode which is tons of fun where you have to stay alive and fend off all of the enemiesOverall, this game is a lot of fun and is not like the previous game, however for what it is - you'll have a blast playing by blowing things up and fighting off evil cultist and aliens RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love the destruction physics, and the magnet gun. I love destroying buildings and taking out enemies with large flying explosive barrels.  However, the story is predictable and cliche, the characters are par, and the game outstays its welcome. Plus, and this is the big problem, the game is bugged completely and keeps crashing right before every checkpoint.  I played for aggrivating hours trying to get to the end and gave up right before I got there.  I'm bored, angry, and annoyed so that is where I stop.			",148,23,2,8,7,2,24

												This is the weakest title Volitin ever but out and easily one of the least enjoyable games I have ever played.  It's a very limited almost on the rails 3rd person shooter where the gimmick gun doesn't even merit giving this game some pluses because there's just so little freedom and variety. That's not to say that On a Rail is a bad map or anything because it's the best part of HL, I'm just saying that this game sucks is all.  Lastly, it's also short in comparison to the other story based shooters like Shogo or Doom3. I don't recommend.			",224,42,3,10,8,2,11

												If you liked the original Red Faction titles because of their open worlds, faction system, and replayability; skip this at all costs!!RF:Armageddon is merely an on-rails console port that has nothing in common with the original games in the franchise except detailed destruction, a few of the original weapons, and the Red Faction name.The story is very uninteresting, and the dialog is just horrid. Everything smells of console trash; from the magic floating arrows over anything of interest, to the designated checkpoints, to the on-rails approach of each mission (i.e. cunscene after cutscene). There are NO factions - 99% of the game is fighting aliens, not the EDF or any other factions. There is no free-roam; with very small corridors and caves that have the all too familliar checkpoint system that makes you reload over and over and over until you finish it.In the spirit of the earlier RF titles, I can't recommend this game at all, unless you just want another mediocre console shoot-em-up.5/10			",135,30,4,9,8,1,8

												Since its release, THQ and Volition have done everything in their power to try and bring people back to the Red Faction series with very little avail. When you make a game that is a smash success it has to be hard to replicate that success in the form of sequels, which were obviously created, but were a major bust in the eyes of people who actually followed the games since day one including myself.Volition's fourth attempt in the series is coined Red Faction: Armageddon. Now the subtitle may be a reference to where the story intends to go within the game, but it would also be a good way to describe the game itself. The story begins on Mars in the distant future; just like all others have before it. You play as Darius Mason; a Red Faction member and the grandson of Alec Mason who was the protagonist in Red Faction: Guerrilla in the year 2120. 50 years have passed since the liberation of colonies from the Earth Defense Force. As Darius, you must face off against a new enemy who is trying to destroy stability on the planet and make it uninhabitable to humans. By using terrorist attacks on the Terraformer which provides oxygen and atmosphere to the planet, he is slowly succeeding. The man responsible for all of this is known as Adam Hale. Adam is a cultist leader for the Marauders. This group of mercenaries was converted by him into his own personal army.After the attack on the Terraformer, you are led to believe that Adam was killed during the explosion which brought the Terraformer crumbling to the ground. Everyone with common sense or awareness of the cliches which are in nearly all movies and games can already tell exactly where this is headed within the first 10 minutes of play. Everyone has been forced underground as a result of these events, which have made the surface of the planet a wasteland. Violent storms, lack of oxygen and mega tornados are what greet people at the surface so obviously a great deal of this game will take place in a linear underground environment. While all the population of Mars is being forced under the surface, a deadly plague strikes which is killing everyone. It is your job to find out what has caused this and who is responsible.In terms of the story, it is hardly anything riveting or interesting for that fact; and leaves you wondering why you are even playing the game at all. From the beginning, you know exactly where things are going, no suspense, no mystery, just destroy everything and kill everyone until it ends. If you have played the original Red Faction, you will find yourself again questioning this game. What does this really have to do with the first game? Why are people still on Mars if everything has been so terrible three times before? The last but not least; why is everyone trying to either destroy the planet or control it in a totalitarian fashion? Obviously it has worked out so great three previous times why not give it another shot; 4th times a charm right? This series has become a joke. They took something pure and perfect then ruined it by changing the formula until nearly every identifiable shred of the original game no longer existed.These problems started mainly with Guerrilla, carry over into Armageddon, which added a few more to boot. For the love of god choose a camera and stick to it. The series went from First Person, to a Third Person 360° viewable camera to now a Third Person shoulder locked camera; like I said earlier, formula destroyed. Geo-Mod 2.0-2.5 are again a step in the wrong direction, in the original game you could destroy practically everything, including terrain to make your own paths or find ways around obstacles. This has been severely dialed back, and I am not even sure how it can be dignified with a version 2.0 or 2.5 branding aside from it being the engine name. The only things which can be destroyed are man-made objects, no terrain. While the destruction is impressive, it is all ruined by shooting a wall and not even a scratch showing up.Hold onto your pants because the bad does not stop there. Where are all the vehicles you could pilot in all previous games? There are vehicles all over this game but none you can drive? Really? It's kind of a slap in the face to be honest, but this comes back to changing the formula. However, they did make a wise decision and reverted back to the roots of the game being linear. The whole Red Faction/Grand Theft Auto open world concept that Guerrilla attempted to do was just too weird and turned a lot of people off; that would explain their logic for Armageddon.After reading all that is wrong with it let's get to some things which are good and alright. The game looks fantastic in nearly every way, crisp textures, DirectX 11 effects and amazing use of physics on the destruction, the presentation is overall great. With the nice boost in visuals you will also notice some new modes, features and an updated arsenal of weapons. There are two new modes, and they are incorporated very well. The first mode is Ruin. You have a set time to destroy the most structures possible and must obtain a certain score to achieve the next level. There is some replayability to this, but it is stunted by the lack of total levels. The second mode which has been incorporated is Infestation, it is similar to Nazi zombies in CoD and Killing Floor.You must kill wave after wave of enemies on each level. Some are purely survival and others are defense so you must protect structures from being destroyed. Each level has up to 30 waves to survive. This works out great and is a fun way for friends to play whether it be through the Internet or Lan; there is a lot of replayability here. Conventional multiplayer is something that has been scraped completely, for how this game is I think that was a smart move. If it were still a first-person shooter it would need this to compete with the others; but as it stands it's not something necessary.The game play is fun in its own right. Very standard Third Person Shooter combat mixed with a Gears of War type cover system. What it does, it does fairly well but the mediocrity of it makes you feel as if you have played this game before. The mix of weapons keeps things pretty interesting. You have a choice of about 10 weapons ranging from just your standard shotgun all the way up to a singularity cannon which creates black holes and engulfs nearby structures. Using the varied weapons can be fun and finding new ways to kill or destroy with them is mainly what the game is about.Probably the biggest highlight to the entire game is the Path to War DLC. This takes place hours before the events which bring down the Terraformer. The great thing about this is it allows you to actually use the vehicles and play as both sides. It definitely gives a fresh perspective to the game. I would recommend playing this before starting the campaign. With about 45 minutes of game play this makes for an overall nice addition to the game, but I don't think it is exactly worth the money.All in all, Red Faction: Armageddon is not a terrible game on its own. I hope that is not something I conveyed here. It is a terrible game in terms of it living up to the original which can be said about Red Faction 2 & Guerrilla also, but for what they all do, comparisons aside, they are interesting gaming experiences on their own. If you are looking for a game with deep story, gameplay which is enthralling from beginning to end or something that you will have fond memories of as you get older; this game is not for you. If you want a game which is fun to jump into and blow things up periodically for 20 to 30 minutes at a time without paying attention to what is really going on; this is absolutely for you. Consider it a destruction simulator with a cliched and somewhat boring story to go with it, and you will have the time of your life.			",370,38,24,28,41,7,51

I hear that there is a lot of technical problems but I believe it's because the reviewers are using Windows 10 and I played this on 7 and now I use Windows 10 but I won't check because I don't want to play this again.TL;DR It's♥♥♥♥♥♥			",100,4,1,17,6,0,2

												I'll make this short. I played Guerilla, and i loved it. The open world was great, i hate tons of fun destroyed buildings and all of that, right?Then they decided that an open world is just too much work. So they made another linear game. It just doesn't fly anymore. the one reason as to why their previous games worked was the fact that you could destroy things. Other games does that now and they  do it better as well. Guerillas open world was the one factor that made it stand above the others, right? The fact that they didn't bother with an open world just says a couple things:They just didn't bother because this game was just supposed to milk money out of the people that loved guerilla. They don't care about their fans, the ones that has been there since the very first Red Faction game. The game just fails all around, really. You can get a game that does everything that this game does, only better.Would not recommend you buy this game, you can spend your money elsewhere and get more value.			",122,27,1,11,12,0,9

Playing RFG will bring you up to speed  with the Geomod building destruction and darius' Grandfather, thats it.

												I wish there was a middle ground for the recommending selection,  i would not reccomond this game unless it is on sale by at least %90 percent, it crashes all the time and is very limiting when it comes to options. The story is very generic, with generic settings, the only redeeming quality is the destructive enviorment, that is restrictive to say the least, and the gun selection, there are some cool ones. All in all this game is a modern TPS with a generic plot and characters i could care less about, as a fan of red faction 1 and II i am dissapointed but expected worse to be honest. Its the previous installment but instead of open world its inside dark caves and ghetto/shantytown enviorments.tl;drA generic console port (that crashes all the time) that is only worth buying at 90% off its original cost. Only redeeming factors are the physics, guns, and destruction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game from one of the HBs and all I knew about it is ""You get to destroy a lot of stuff"". So one day I decided to download it because I wanted to play something different and of course wreck things. The game looks really good, the physics are awesome and what is in my opinion the best thing about the game - it really understands when to deliver new content to you as a player. Small interjection - you have a huge maul to kill people and destroy buildings, so in case you are not convinced imagine yourself jumping around Mars (gravity is way lower than on Earth!) delivering head smashes to your enemies. The game features variety of weapons, enemies and upgrades. The story is logical and well-tied together, it is funny and maybe not greatly engaging or original but it can defend itself good enough. All in all I recommend this game for everyone who a) wants to destroy stuff for the sake of destroying stuff b) wants to be surprised about what the game lets you do c) is looking for a non-open world game d) wants to play the game like he wants with the tools he is given, not boxed in with two alternatives Game says I spend 6 hours 37 minutes in campaign mode on Hard. I thought it was a lot more (steam says so as well) so I guess the game sucked me in pretty hard.			",71,6,0,4,6,1,14

Gameplay is great if you like shooting and blowing stuff up and wow the mechs are amazing!. The mech gameplay really makes you feel all powerful. Then theres the destruction, you really can bring down the house then rebuild it and bring it down all over again. The inclusion of the magnet gun just makes the destruction a little more enticing.

												I found this third person shooter a lot of fun. I've never played any of the other Red Factions, and am told that some of them (if not all) had a more open world feel compared to this much more linear adventure. However, I think its average metacritic score of 70 odd suffers from these sorts of comparisons, as it's a pretty enjoyable game in its own right without any previous experience with the rest of the franchise.There are a decent range of weapons that can float different people's boats, but I settled into my favourite four pretty quickly - the magnet gun, sniper rifle, mace (for up close and personal squishing), & a heavy damage weapon (which was the plasma cannon for a long time, rocket launcher, and then finally the singularity cannon). The best thing about the game however, is how much of the environment is destructable. It can break from enemy attack, your own attack, or you can even use it to harm enemies (particularly with the magnet gun). It's honestly one of the best features of the game, and using your particle repairer, you can build up most of the destroyed environment to destroy or throw at enemies again!Replayability may be a little sticking point however. Like I mentioned the single player is quite linear though can obviously be replayed. However, there are another two gamemodes, one of which can be multiplayer. The first is ruin which is essentially using all your best skills at destroying as much of the destructible environment in the map you're put on. There's a short time limit and points are earned on how much damage you do and at what efficiency. You essentially need to destroy X amount of points to complete the few different maps they have and can continue to try set bigger scores. However, it feels like just the addon it is rather than a completely different game mode. The second is Infestation, which is essentially defeating waves of enemies which get progressively harder (up to 20 waves per map). You can solo this or play with other people, with some similarities to that game mode in Gears of War. I'm not sure about whether or not you spawn more enemies when you play with other people compared to solo though (as I haven't played multiplayer), but I'd hope so given I was able to handle most things solo with just the magnet gun and a decent position on the map playing it smart. The better of the two additional gamemodes for sure, but only extends replayability a little bit more.Well worth the money I paid for it in a humble bundle. The entire red faction collection (which this game is included with) is still available both from the Humble store and here on steam (I think).			",357,78,12,46,44,10,57

It's not like Guerilla, it's a classic FPS. That'd be forgivable if it were a good once, but it's only mediocre, with a character who's a bit too much of a blockhead to actually like.

												I didn't purchase this game when it first came out due to the not-so-great reviews.  Not to mention, many other games were coming out at the time so I was worried about my time being spread too thin between games.  Unfortunately THQ decided  to can the Red Faction series and move Volition Inc. onto a different project.  This was mainly due to the fact that the sales for the game were abyssmal.  Personally, I was part of the crowd that didn't get the game and I will say that anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre needs to give this game a try.  Most people say that this whole series ran on a gimmick but honestly, which game doesn't in some fashion?  At least Volition tried something different in terms of destructible enviornments.  Maybe they will revisit that decision later.  For now, this game is fun and blowing things up is even better.  The game is fluid and has decent graphics and story, which is a plus.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish there was a middle ground for the recommending selection,  i would not reccomond this game unless it is on sale by at least %90 percent, it crashes all the time and is very limiting when it comes to options. The story is very generic, with generic settings, the only redeeming quality is the destructive enviorment, that is restrictive to say the least, and the gun selection, there are some cool ones. All in all this game is a modern TPS with a generic plot and characters i could care less about, as a fan of red faction 1 and II i am dissapointed but expected worse to be honest. Its the previous installment but instead of open world its inside dark caves and ghetto/shantytown enviorments.tl;drA generic console port (that crashes all the time) that is only worth buying at 90% off its original cost. Only redeeming factors are the physics, guns, and destruction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game from one of the HBs and all I knew about it is ""You get to destroy a lot of stuff"". So one day I decided to download it because I wanted to play something different and of course wreck things. The game looks really good, the physics are awesome and what is in my opinion the best thing about the game - it really understands when to deliver new content to you as a player. Small interjection - you have a huge maul to kill people and destroy buildings, so in case you are not convinced imagine yourself jumping around Mars (gravity is way lower than on Earth!) delivering head smashes to your enemies. The game features variety of weapons, enemies and upgrades. The story is logical and well-tied together, it is funny and maybe not greatly engaging or original but it can defend itself good enough. All in all I recommend this game for everyone who a) wants to destroy stuff for the sake of destroying stuff b) wants to be surprised about what the game lets you do c) is looking for a non-open world game d) wants to play the game like he wants with the tools he is given, not boxed in with two alternatives Game says I spend 6 hours 37 minutes in campaign mode on Hard. I thought it was a lot more (steam says so as well) so I guess the game sucked me in pretty hard.			",71,6,0,4,6,1,14

I hate not recommending this game, because the previous Red Faction game, Guerilla, was really a gem. This game takes the combat and environmental destruction of Guerilla and throws it into linear sequences (I much prefer open world Mars). The most enjoyable sections of this game are its beginning and conclusion, as soon as I could safely retire this entry on my library. Vehicle combat really is the highlight of the game, which is compounded by the vehicle-based dlc missions.

												This game started out promising, it looks fairly good, there's a great magnet gun that is fun to use, everything can be destoryed and reparied, and the lighting was good.  And for the first few hours everything seemed good, but after that it all starts to fall apart.  The story starts to become boring, with little to keep you interested, the characters are not memorable, and by the end of the game you just don't care what happens.  Halfway through the campaign everything starts to feel drawn out and some objectives fell like they were put in just to add extra play time, you actually reach a point where it would make sense for the game to end and wrap things up, but the game pushes on, and it does that 3 or 4 times in the closing stages.  The last 2 hours of the game had me fustrated that it hadn't ended, it was annoying to continue playing, and don't think you're rewarded with a brilliant ending.  The combat also takes its toll the longer you play, the destructable items and terrain become a pain, occasionally you get stuck on areas and have to rely on random jumping to get you out of situations, you end up constantly reparing the way you need to go as AI seems to shoot at that more that you.  The magnet gun which pulls terrain from one point to another is fun to use at first and probably the most effective gun in the game, but no othe weapon brings anything different to the table, which means using those make this anothe generic shooter.Overall this game is boring as hell.

												It seemed like a generic shooter at first but I WAS VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENT. Plus you can magically repair all the damage with the Nano Forge so you can destroy everything all over again. The weapons are unique and fun to play with, the story's alright but linear, the locations and aliens can feel pretty eerie at times almost like Dead Space, and you can use the magnet gun to propel giant explosive structures at enemies. What more could you want?I got it really cheap from the THQ Humble Bundle way back when, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale since there's not much to do after you beat the campaign.The PC port is terrible though and I had to Google around and eventually run the game in compatibility mode for Windows 7 to prevent the frequent crashes.

												It takes me a couple of months to finish it. Not because it long but because i kinda lost interest during the earlier part.... but when i got my time around to play it again, the gameplay kinda pickup. It's fun again... Summary, it's the THQ version of Gears of War. I never get to play the Red Faction before this one, so to me, this suit me well for TPS level by level gameplay. Rating: 7/10			",342,61,17,39,67,5,61

												As a big fan of the previous game, this was a huge disappointment. The story seemed rushed and was very poorly written. At least in my opinion. The main thing I loved about the last game was the open world aspect. This game had none, just mission after mission until the very long and annoying ending. Visually it was nice? Honestly, this isn't a game I'd return to and would trade for another if possible.4/10.			",168,13,2,13,18,2,19

												Red Faction: Armageddon is a pretty good game but sadly not recommended. With an uninteresting story line and a typical third person shooter, there's pretty much nothing else do in the game. Sure you can upgrade your weapons and your super awesome wristband fixer♥♥♥♥♥♥and also you can break stuff around you with Volition's awesome Geo Mod 2.5 physics engine and see things break and explode to pieces and then fixing it all up, but other then that the characters are just not interesting enough to even care about them. It's just over the top action pack, one man army against an alien hoard to save his people from being eaten and to kill the men who started all this, that's pretty much story. But it has some memorable parts like a Red Faction 1 references like there's this one time the main character will talk about some Martian Revolution or the Miner Uprising and Ultor the head of the mining complex and some other♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, bring back some pretty good memories. But you just can't beat the first Red Faction not even Red Faction Gurilla or Red Faction 2 can beat the first Red Faction but Red Faction 2 ain't all that bad but still can't beat Red Faction 1. I suggest getting it when it's really cheap it's just not worth paying $20 for this  game.			",187,15,2,21,12,0,12

												Actually, I don't recommend this game.  FPSs with checkpoints♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  Story is muddy, boring, didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the characters or setting.  Protagonist is the same generic, square-jawed, tough-as-nails spare-me-the-nerd-talk-lets-just-kick-some♥♥♥♥♥machoman that has been the norm for these kinds of games for the last ten years.  Game encourages you to explore and find goodies, but then slaps you if you wander too far with popups such as, ""WARNING: YOU ARE LEAVING MISSION AREA RETURN IN 3..2..""  Expect myself to eventually just turn on all cheats and then run around blowing everything up until I get bored and shelve the game or beat it, whichever comes first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Destructable enviorment is an amazing concept but they lost some steam with swapping from streamlined story in the first two then sandbox in guerilla then back to streamline in armageddon.

												The game itself is decent, but taking free-roam out of the equation has ruined the fun in this game almost completely. The best thing about Guerilla (apart from the destruction itself), was the freedom that I can run around in an open world and destroy whatever I like. This has been taken out of the game, and it really feels empty now. Besides, the story isn't even that great, and I'm sick of shooting bugs off of a wall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That mode alone makes this game well worth the money. Seriously its awesome, just a shame not many people play it online. If you can get a group of people together to play it you'll have a great time. It's better than warhammer: space marine, so if you liked that, definatley give this a try. My 2p.			",78,0,0,2,0,0,1

The games got a nice array of weapons, some very chaotic scenes and a nice use of the magnet gun to really use the terrain to your advantage (basically dropping everything on the enemy). Stories a little reliant on previous playthroughs of the other two games but its not very neccessary. Give it a go, its cheap by now and the game plus modes are pretty good. Especially Mr Toots, (whos a good boy, yes you are yes, now blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that building).

http://www.gonemadgaming.com/2015/12/30/review-red-faction-armageddon/Red Faction continues to follow the Mason family as he battles for freedom for the people of Mars!This game is much more fast paced than the prior game, Red Faction: Guerrilla, with an almost entirely different play style. While Guerrilla was more of a free roaming game, with missions that had to be activated, Armageddon is more like your standard play through game. The weapon choices where pretty amazing with my favorite being the Singularity Cannon. There where several spots in the game where my skills where put to the test, yet several of the “boss” battles where fairly simple. The game has the GPS unit which is essentially your built in walkthrough, making it very easy to find where you are going.The best parts about the Red Faction games to me is the story as well as the sheer destruction you cause throughout the game! I am definitely hoping for a new game in the series sometime in the near future!I rate this game a 8/10			",47,4,1,5,6,0,8

												Do not pay attention to all the negatives on this game. It's just a bunch of fan boys mad over the direction of the Red Faction series. The game itself is awesome, with tight controls, good gun play, and the most destructible enviorment of any game I have ever played past or present. The only Con I can really think of for this game is that it does not have some super in depth story. In saying that, the story it does deliver, does just enough to keep you engrossed and if it had just a little more added to it I think this game would be a near 10. If you love action games this is a must have, I got it on sale for about 4 dollars american and to me one of the better titles I've come across on steam in awhile.PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS GAME:For me and many others there is an issue where the game just crashes on launch for no reason. When you install this game, make sure you install it to the same HDD as your OS. i.e. I have my steam client on one HDD than my OS on another. INSTALL THE GAME TO THE HDD WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM ON IT. Not saying this is some big issue, but this happened to me and could not find much help anywhere out there.   ",43,3,0,8,9,0,7

												Although this game was fairly linear it was still an action packed romp.  Good story, decent visuals, a host of weapons to use, and a variety of ways to play.  This is *nothing* like RF:Guerrilla with the open world.  This whole story is on tracks, but that's not entirely a bad thing.  There's some exploration to be done to find things, but you always have to ""get back on the rails"" to get the story moving again.  You can upgrade weapons and abilities using the ever familiar scrap which makes for some progression.  As you play, after you've unlocked your core upgrades (or before), you can unlock features using scrap that can be used on future playthroughs.  Many would consider these cheats (super weapons, unlimited ammo, etc), but if you've played through the game and story already, some of the features are great fun (like Mr. Toots) and you can choose what you want to use and not use.

												The game itself is decent, but taking free-roam out of the equation has ruined the fun in this game almost completely. The best thing about Guerilla (apart from the destruction itself), was the freedom that I can run around in an open world and destroy whatever I like. This has been taken out of the game, and it really feels empty now. Besides, the story isn't even that great, and I'm sick of shooting bugs off of a wall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction: Guerrilla was my favorite game the year of its release, but I was waaay late to the party on RF:A. Armageddon goes back to the linear TPS format of the previous games and relies less on destroying structures, but the gunplay is much more satisfying.The magnet gun is one of the best weapons ever in a game.  Even though the game was too easy, even on Hard (I wish I would have started on Brutal), I had a good time. BTW, this is one of the worst stereoscopic 3D disasters I have ever seen.  Even models and environmental geometry render at the wrong depth, which is an anomaly I have never seen before.			",175,31,2,29,13,0,23

												Simply amazing game, especially for its age. There's not much to say about this except for its amazing physics engine awesome weaponry neat skillsets to evolve and simply dynamic, destructive and downright ridiculous enemies you face. From simply taking on the cultists to fighting a massive ever expanding army of mutating bugs from deep underground. I played this game in its entirety in one go because I just couldn't put it down. The controls are simple and easy to get used to. Not to mention once beating the game you unlock Mr. Toots a unicorn that shoots vaporizing rainbows from its posterior. I am going to play through this game on a harder difficulty just to enjoy it a second time because not very many other games you play offer such great playthrough value like this game with destructive powers and weaponry you can just smash everything just to rebuild it and smash it again. Along with all that you get to operate several awesome ""walkers"" that allow you to mow down enemies with homing rockets, giant lasers, some kind of electricity weapon, and crushing them with your sheer size and smash ability. I give this game a 10/10 and couldn't find a way to make it better than it already is besides making another one.			",56,3,4,5,3,0,3

												A fun game that finishes the Red Faction franchaise.Storyline isn't the most solid but the voice acting the plot are decent enough.Sound design is excellent with impressive graphics (for it's time) that hold up well enough.Lacks the open world of Red Faction 3 but is a fun enough single player campaign.It's a shame the achievements are also based on a multi-player mod that barely anyone plays anymore is a bit annoying.Overall totally worth it if you liked the previous Red Faction Games and ends with a decent enough way that when they reboot this franchaise it won't be too annoying.Highlight - Being able to destroy pretty much anything and if it stops your progress you can rebuilt your path with nano-tech.

												I found this game to be enjoyable until about the a quarter of the way through the game. After that I realized I only needed to use one gun and the game got tedious and repetitive. The last few missions felt a little overwhelming and left me wondering if I had missed something. I couldn't figure out if I had walked past a tank I could have used to kill the hordes of giant bugs or if I was supposed to just run past them since the arsenal given to me would have taken much longer than wanted to get through the bugs. The story left a bit to be desired. The only character I cared about in the slightest at the end of the game was the dumb bracelet that didn't quite understand sarcasm. The rest of the characters only had brief roles and hardly any backstory. To be fair, the magnet gun and the repair tool were fun to use to destroy things, but after that there wasn't much else.

												The game has a good UI, good weapons management system, good skills system, highly satisfiying weapons, new game plus, multiplayer mode, quite a few different enemies, but the most important thing is: Destructible scenarios. I've had lots of fun destroying everything and dropping bridges on the heads of the enemies. The magnetic gun may not be the best weapon (the firing ratio leaves it a bit behind of more powerful weapons), but tearing towers apart is certainly a refreshing experience.The story is standard, but the characters are better than in many other games. Overall, a game very well worth the money.			",747,184,19,65,52,12,82

												Give a man a massive enviroment filled with beauty and he will admire it. Give him an arsenal of weapons with creative ways and he will destroy it. This utilizes the concept of if it isn't nailed into the floor it can be obliterated, though if it is nailed down you can magnitize it out and then destroy it. This is the first ever RF game I played and I totally enjoyed every second of it. It has a intelligent way of knowing when too much is enough; throwing you into new enviroments with new obstacles before you have a chance of getting bored. It does lack the major politcal undertone that the series is supposedly known for, unless I missed it, aswell as the Free Roaming objectives that I was told was present in the predecessors. It reminded me a lot fo Jak and Daxter which made the gameplay more enjoyable, though at times it seemed like a drag between point A and B with constant repeative objectives instead of plot. The creativeness of the weapons and power you have makes this game worth whatever the asking price is.			",371,83,3,38,15,3,20

												This game is underrated... The single biggest complaint from other people is that it's ""not enough like the older games because of the aliens. Why'd they add aliens?"" Really, that complaint just shows that the people criticizing it for that haven't actually played anything but Red Faction Guerrilla (which itself was a great game, btw). Red Faction 1 had aliens, and in fact many of the aliens in RFA look like modernized versions of the RF1 aliens. Additionally, RF1 was linear, just like this game. Like it or hate it, RFA is more like the older games in the series, not less, and it's not some sort of betrayal or unfounded design design.On another note, the game is well optimized, good looking (I find the screenshots actually undersell it in most places), and has responsive gameplay. The series' signature destruction is also intact, so the switch back to linear gameplay hasn't changed much in that regard.It does get tedious after a while, and may not hold up to a second playthrough (keep that in mind when you're deciding how much you're willing to pay), but it's worth the current price of $20 to people who've played other Red Faction Games.

												Tighter controls than RF:G, the shooter mechanics feel a lot more fun. However, this game isn't open world, and is in fact one of the most linear games I've played in years. Linear would be ok if it was due to the fantastic story, but the story is pretty average. Also, the story may leave you a bit confused if you've played RF:G but haven't watched the movie (which was terrible). You may want to read up on the movie summary on the Wiki before playing this game.Decent game though.			",233,33,2,16,27,1,28

												It's pretty much blandly okay-enough.  If it's on sale for a couple of bucks it might be worth picking up or if you happened to end up with it in a bundle it'd be worth trying out but for twenty it's just not worth it.  The big gimmick is the destroyable environmental objects... and it can be kind of fun, but it's equally likely to just get in your way and make you waste time using the repair tool.  It's super-easy on normal so unless you want to just mindlessly coast through without any challenge I'd recommend playing on hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.Wreak death and havoc! Red Faction: Armageddon gives players so many different weapons and abilities to play with, wide variety of enemies, powerful vehicles and destructible landscapes of Mars. The plot is rather average, but the possibility to interact with almost every object in the game makes up for it, at least to me. The Infestation mode allows up to four players to have fun together while killing aliens wave after wave. Also, after beating the game, there is a legal way to use cheats which can greatly amplify the entertainment. There is also a mode created for someone like me, who gets ecstatic every time he blows something up called the Ruin mode, in which you destroy everything around you to unlock more maps. Highly recommended!			",266,67,3,53,21,6,63

												Much better than its reputation. The aesthetics and writing are B-tier, but the destruction, the weapons, the powers, and the reconstruction ability are really good, better than anything of the sort I have seen in a shooter before. (I'm not counting RF:G as a shooter).  My only complaints are that the saving checkpoints are too scant in places and the game drags on too long with several obvious potential ending points. (Some people consider the game short but it lasted about 13 hours for me, playing on insane after the first level. I died plenty.)Some people really exaggerate how much the destruction is reduced in this game from RF:G. It's ever-present and much more integrated into combat. It's just that destruction is not often an end in itself. The first level gives you a misleading impression because you don't have weapons or abilities suited to destruction yet.

												This is a completely different game than Guerrilla.  In fact, with the exception of the main character's last name, and the destructible environments, you can't even tell it's in the same series.  Basically, Red Faction tried to be Dead Space, except it's completely linear.  It's a short game, with reasonably good production value, but the story, dialogue, absolutely everything smacks of stunningly average.  Fun, but nothing really stands out.  There are a couple of references from other games in the series, but otherwise it's entirely standalone.  If you're in the mood to kill aliens on Mars, alone or with friends in survival mode, pick this up when it's on sale.			",203,15,1,24,18,0,26

												                This game has the best destruction that I have ever seen in a video game. Very unique weapons, graphics are very nice....better than 90% of games I played on my Xbox One.                 It is a linear game, but I believe that doesn't take away too much of the gameplay.                 You get one of the coolest weapon unlocks to use in NewGame+!                 All in all, a very reccomended game that will last you roughly 8 hours to beat on Normal, atleast that's what it took me.                                        Only cons I would have are:-Too much time spent in tunnels. I loved the look of Mars, but you spend 95% of the game underground!-The story was lacking and I didn't connect with one of the characters the entire game.Buy this game if your looking to blow **** up			",65,4,1,3,3,0,6

												It's not Guerrilla, but that's not a pro or con, just a difference. Armageddon is a very linear game, void of any of the usual little side missions found in sandbox games. I happen to prefer this, but that's obviously just a personal opinion.There is far less focus on demolition, as combat in this game is more fleshed out. Guns feel much better, and unlocking the enemy healthy indicator really adds to the weight of the shots. You also now have abilities that you can unlock and upgrade from your nano forge.  The game also introduces a repair mechanic, which is neat, if not a little underused. I thought the humor in this game was great. Definitely something I liked over Guerrilla, where the intended humorous dialogue was one-sided and overall more serious.All in all, Armageddon was enjoyable, if not a little short. The difficulty is certainly a step up from Guerrilla, but I didn’t find it very difficult to overcome, and thought it was a good choice to make to go along with the linear path.

												Intro:I got intruduced to the red faction series with RF: 3 and was inpressed woth the open world dynamic. Going into Armegeddon I was worried that the games more linear level structure would be a hard sell.Negatives: I was unfortunately proved right on this, the plot is decidedly shallow and straightforward. It incorperated many of the tropes included in a zombie game, and mixes them into the red faction stew to produce a game that is untimatley dissapointing. The linear structure of the game makes the destruction engine less relivant, and the plot struccles to hold attention. You could feasable play through the entire game without knocking a building down, except where you are requred to destroy something. Levels fell long and often fell clostraphobic, with many redundant fights that struggle to contribute anything new. Certan bugs have to be killed in specific ways, while others are effectively bullet sponges whose soul peopose is to maul you before you can empty enough rounds into the target. Vehicle combat is almost non existant, there are only three vehicles that are useable in the base campign, and all two are used on levels that dont let you get in or out. While you get involved in large spaces within the campign, they can be tedious to cross and ultimately become boring. The in games sound bites you recover do enrich the experience, and they imply a grand conspiracy as to why the world was allowed to collapse in game. The conspiracy narrative never really gets flushed out, and there are entire levels that could be cut out without having any effect on the plot. For example, the level where you fight the bug queen fells like filler once you actually beat the game and discover that fight (and the death of your girlfriend) was not even nessary because you could have repaired the terraformer and killed the bugs and any point before the point where the game allows you to do so. Replayability is encouraged by the salvage mechanisim, which carries your upgrades over to multiplayer. Of course, the campign struggles after one playthrough, and it makes other playthroughs feel like a real grind, especally when you have to trade large amounts of salvage to unlock the games array of cheats. The disadvantage  to the salvage system is that you have to play through the campign to stand a chance in multiplayer, because the base player stats are pathetic in comparision. You hold less ammo, reload slower, have ferer hit points, and no nano abilites. Veteran players will steamroll you, then scrape you off the street and beat you into a fine pulp before tbagging you all the way into the respawn que.Positives:The repair mechanic is a cool idea, and was desparately needed in this games prequel, since that envirnment never regenerates. The nano powers you can accumulate through collecting salvage add a fun dynamic that becomes critical in later levels, it struggles to overcome the eventual grind that later levels become though. Griphics have been tuned up, though not by much. Building destruction is smoother thatn in the previous game, but its hard to notice because most weapons make the pillers and colums you hit vanish rather than get blown off. However, when you do get the chance to conventally blow up a building it looks awesome. Multiplayer can keep you interested, but its a personl intrest thing.At its current price I dont recommend it, I managed to get it as part of the RF pack over the thanksgiving sale and so paid a lot less. The game was worth waht I paid for at its sale price, but I would recommend waiting for the price of the game to come down under five dollars before diving into this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Highly, no criminally underatted game IMO.  This game taken by itself as just a super fun campaign is fantastic.  I never play through games twice but this one I have re-installed 3 times now and went through it.  I never do that.   It is so satisfying to destroy buildings and take out enemies in this game it should be sold as relaxation technique.  Got a buidling full of bad guys up in that fortified tower?  No problem, take out the supports and watch the tower collapse on top of them or just grab each one and fling them at the wall opposite.  Or use one of the many other interesting weapons in all sorts of devious ways.  Bottom line more games need this level of destruction because what are video games but fantasy worlds so why not go all out?  One of the last in the old school definition of fun games in that it's trying something new and trying to first and foremost be enjoyable beyond anything else.  Then on top of that for a 2011 game it still looks great as well, specially considering you can bust through most of what your looking at.Easily recommended for $20 even today in 2015 no problem.  Don't listen to people crying about this or that, if you want to put a smile on your face then buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On its own and in comparison to Guerrilla, this game's good, neutral, and bad points:Better:+Runs smoother+More graphics options+Better Graphics+More weapons+Insane difficulty is unlocked by default+There's an actual named villan this time, instead of just ""the EDF""+Managed to make me chuckle a few times+Destruction physics are even better+Less floaty; feels like everything has a bit more weight to it.+The Nanoforge has special abilities now, like the attack-boosting Beserk, and can also be used to repair anything that has been destroyed.+Don't have to carry around a sledgehammer in one of your weapon slots; you can have any 4 weapons at a time.+Awesome magnet gun that tears thing apartNeutral:~Completely linear (personally, I don't mind)~Most of the time, enemies aren't humans~Story is decent~Voice acting is okay~Characters are okayWorse:-Previously mentioned villian is kinda lame. IMO, ""The EDF"" was somewhat better.I really do recommend this game, especially if you liked the destruction aspect of Guerrilla. Keep in mind it is linear, so if you liked Guerrilla's open world-ness, that may come as a bit of a disappointment.			",364,105,3,40,42,4,29

												A good game overall. But it takes away what most of us loved from the previous game Guerilla.It takes away all exploration and Free roam. How ever it still gives you a linear game with destructible objects weere you mostly fight some weird alien creatures. If I hadn't played its predecessor I could rate it  8/10 cause it still is a solid game. However I recommend that you pickup Red Faction Guerilla insteed.6/10			",361,46,8,36,30,4,57

												Despite being something of a black sheep of the series, I enjoyed Red Faction Armageddon. Unlike other Guerrila or the first game, this game doesn't really offer anything new or unique. What it does do, generic 3rd person shooting and mass effect inspired power-ups, it does surprisingly well. Graphics are good, controls work well and there's even a hoarde mode type thing. The campaign is, however, short and mostly forgetable. To conclude, Red Faction Armageddon is alright, I guess.			",184,49,3,21,13,1,26

												If you played Guerrilla, you're probably here for another taste of Martian destructive chaos. Armegeddon is a very mixed bag when it comes to pleasing fans of its predecessor, but all in all I think it's *just* worth the money.Yes, you shoot things in this game, but let's ignore that trivial matter and get to what we're all interested in: blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Armegeddon's destruction engine is noticably different to Guerrilla's, in that destroying things is much easier. The internal supports in buildings smash as soon as something hits them, so everything breaks with ease. Smashing things in Armageddon is fast, simple, and satisfying.The weapons. Whoever designed the weapons in this game is a god. We are talking nanite grenades, disintegration rays, plasma flamethrowers and the famous wall-weaponising Magnet Gun. And remember the almighty Singularity Bomb from Guerrilla? The one that was so powerful they didn't let you select it from a safehouse? That's a cannon now. You can shoot black holes at people. That is how amazing the guns in this game are. If someone wants to port these to every other Red Faction game ever made, that'll be fine by me.The game also gives you the ability to repair structures at any time, and as you see fit. It is MUCH faster than Guerrilla's Reconstructor, and it allows you to shoot repair grenades later on. I find repairing things relaxing and cathartic, and this title lets me do it whenever I please.The fact this is a linear shooter offputs a lot of people, and I can see why. The focus of the game is regrettably not these glorious modes of mayhem, but shooting aliens! Original! While the gunplay is fun enough, the levels can be very restrictive as far as getting to the breakables is concerned, but just going along for the ride, and the somewhat cheesy story, will have you annihilating plenty. Anyway, you can always manually save the good bits for later smashing. Don't worry though, Wrecking Crew makes a return in the form of Ruin Mode. It's pretty basic - five maps, no settings except a time trial mode or free play - but marked improvements are infinite ammo, four weapon wheel, changing guns at any time, resetting the map without leaving and the aforementioned repair function. There's also a co-op survival mode. 'Sgood. The one giant, monolithic problem with this game is that it crashes. A lot. Like, really a ♥♥♥♥ing lot. At random times when reaching a checkpoint, the game will crash. You will not activate the checkpoint before it crashes, which means doing the whole section again. It destroys the flow of the game like no bug has ever done before. Nordic, please fix this. Now. Overall, it's alright. It's not Guerrilla, but its improved destruction, pleasing graphics, and outrageously fun weapons just about offset the linear format, terrible port and predictable story. Grab this - on sale if you can - if you want to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and don't care what it takes to get to blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up.			",45,7,2,1,10,2,2

The story is not breathtaking, but still good enough to keep you going. Game design and balancing is also pretty good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NOTDeadSpace: Armageddon is the story of bald space marine miner Darrius ""I'm actually white"" Mason, Mars' biggest ♥♥♥♥up and #1 exterminator. After bringing about an apocalyptic calamity for the SECOND time do to sheer stupidity you decide you should probably try and fix it this time. Long Story Short the game is pretty OK. A forgettable story and bland cast of characters combined with overly-linear level design keep this game from being considered anything but a mindless shooter. Luckily there are a wonderful variety of interesting weapons to choose from and while the enemy types are lacking the game throws enough of them at you to make for fun shooting. Also there are MECHS! The game is pretty easy with plenty of ammo, regen health and all kinds of passive and active upgrades. The destruction from Guerilla is back and even more impressive, or it would be if you weren't so ♥♥♥♥ing limited in using it. Seriously, other than some walker sections where you get to run through buildings the game is way too cramped for any of the beautiful moments you could make in the previous entry. Basically this game suffers from suffers from sequel disease: the developers (or more likely publishers) completey lost sight of what made their game unique and fun and instead tried to match some commitee's idead of what a kind of game them there whippersnappers would buy			",270,61,1,43,22,1,37

												Not bad but not great.This is one of the more ""video-gamey"" 3rd person shooters i've played. It's very linear compared to it's predecessor RFG, but it maintains much of the destructibility of the scenery, with even more awesome guns like plasma cannons, lasers, and even a black hole generator.The plot is simple and predictable. Approximately 0 feels were felt throughout any of the story, and just as many craps were given as to what would happen next.Sometimes you need to play a game that involves getting in a massive alien walker and going on a destructive rampage across an alien planet.The aliens are hardly innovative, with little Zerglings rushing you, Hydralisks throwing spines from far away, Nydus Worms sending hordes of monsters at you until you kill them, Ultralisks that rush you and smack you around until they blow up, and Spore Cannons that spread Creep that buffs all the aliens while shooting giant balls of Kool-Aid at you. Not to mention the Queen who has several weak points that you have to hit while dodging adds, fire breath, and grabbing ammo from all the guns that just happen to be lying around.Graphics? Pretty damn amazing.Replayability? Nah, you unlock pretty much everything one time through.I recommend this game, but I'm absolutely on the fence. I got it on sale with the Red Faction pack, so it was definitely worth all the hours i got out of Guerilla, but as for Armageddon, don't buy it unless it's on sale. Overally it was kinda boring, but still worth the play.5/10 would pay 25cents to play an arcade game again			",53,9,1,9,6,0,10

												Red Faction without the Open World, complete freedom to blow everything up,  & a generic story that brings you down generic set pieces to fight generic waves of enemies with the same voice actorOnly thing i can give this game is the terraforming mechanic was really cool.....till you discover they do nothing with it & is only used to fix there generic level design should you by any chance blow up the only staircase there is to proceed through the level! (why introduce an awesome power & do nothing with it?!?!?!)This game killed the series & thankfully killed the puke of a Publisher called THQHopefully one day we get a real Red Faction game but for now avoid this at all cost (i cant even bring myself to finish this garbage!)

 Curator-esque Review  More claustrophobic and linear than Red Faction: Guerrilla but still a fun game to play through solo.  Great effects, destruction, and cool tech make the short campaign enjoyable.  Red Faction: Armageddon Review (Spoiler Free)  Story A mysterious cult destroys the Terraformer, thus destabilizing Mars' atmosphere and driving most inhabitants on the planet underground.  Five years after these events, protagonist Darius finds mining work anyway he can, having left the Red Faction after their failed attempt to retake the Terraformer.  He accepts a contract from a group of shady Marauders and unwittingly releases an entombed alien race.  He is eventually ousted as the the one responsible and forced on the run.  Darius encounters old allies though as he runs and eventually begins the laborius task of driving the aliens back and finding the true identity of those who tricked him. Gameplay Armageddon is played in third-person similar to Guerrilla.  The campaign is single player only, but there is also an online co-op ""horde mode"" for up to four players and a sandbox/score attack destruction mode for you to fool around with solo.  Environmental destruction is one of the game's attractions.  At the start of the game, you are given a special tool that allows you to rebuild destroyed structures and objects.  Whereas a broken staircase in another game would prevent you from moving forward, in Armageddon you can literally rebuild the stairs.  Enemies can also make a mess of the environment.  A hulking alien can smash through every wall you put between you and it.  Tentacles will snatch fallen debris and throw it at you.  Destroying buildings is really fun just to watch them crumble.There is a a good variety of different weapons to use that destroy the environment in different ways.  Most of the time you will use these weapons to fight various classes of aliens.  Aliens frequently swarm you so your build tool also has some AOE attacks (such as a shield, anti-grav, and force-like push) to create some breathing room.  You will also get to pilot some pretty awesome vehicles.  The story plays out as you would expect it but what you'll be doing in each mission is highly varied.  The campaign never got dull for me and I was excited to play through it again on a harder difficulty.  Co-op is sparsely populated.  Although you can play it alone, it really is not as fun as the campaign. Design The aliens in Armageddon look amazing.  Their are multiple varieties of creepy crawlies each with their own color scheme, behavior, and on-screen effects.  All of them are very well animated.  Sound and lighting are also very nice, giving you the claustrophobic dread of being trapped in the dark underground.  All of the environments look nice too, whether they be vast caves, undeground towns, or surface camps in the middle of a lightning/sand storm.  Voice acting and cutscenes are great and the cast is alright for what the game is.  Music choice is appropriate though nothings really stood out to me. Final Thoughts Red Faction: Armageddon is a fun game to play through on your own a couple of times.  Fun gameplay, straightforward story, quality design, and environmental destruction are the reason to get this game.  Try to get it on sale if the short campaign and lack of multiplayer options deters you.  Can you find Mr. Toots?			",114,8,1,6,3,1,8

												I played through this game years ago. I remember it being enjoyable, but a little repetitive near the end. It's still a recommend, if you find it on sale it can be a decent way to spend 8-9 hours. But, I will say this I remember nothing specific about this game. It is completely forgettable. I remember no detail about the plot, I don't remember the enemires, I barely remember the building things nano gun, I don't remember the villian, nothing. Completely forgettable. Conclusion: Not terrible at a bargain, but even if you disagree with me, you'll probably forget why after a while. It's just meh. Not good or even bad enough to be memorable.			",203,71,2,15,12,4,16

												People like to complain about red faction armageddon because its a linear game. Red Faction Guerrilla  was not, it was very open worldish. Well, this game once again pushes the bar on what we thought was possible in a physics/real time damage engine. Your jaw will hit the floor, many times. This game isn't long, but it is the standard length for an FPS. This game is fantastic and deserves to be played. Due to the physics engine make sure you have a beefy GPU. This game will need it. Seriously. Enjoy blowing S*** up! :D			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												I'm totally amazed with this game. I mean, this is seriously one of the best games i have played in 2011. I loved the new direction they took with this game, it's more linear but the storyline is much more detailed and interesting. Something i really liked about this game is the weapon arsenal, it's simply fantastic. Especially the magnet gun and the black hole gun. The level of destruction is huge and spectacular.You also have a free mode with no time limit where you can destroy stuff and rebuild it again.Infestation mode, team up with 1, 2 or 3 friends in a battle against bugs and other creepy crawlies where you have to protect structures from damage, or survival mode.This game is so well made that it allows you to change a lot of graphical settings. Port or not, it runs so perfect and smooth without a single problem.I'm running it fully maxed out + DX10/11 and god, it looks beautiful!!Another contender for game of the Year 2011..Thanks for such amazing game.My Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has a good UI, good weapons management system, good skills system, highly satisfiying weapons, new game plus, multiplayer mode, quite a few different enemies, but the most important thing is: Destructible scenarios. I've had lots of fun destroying everything and dropping bridges on the heads of the enemies. The magnetic gun may not be the best weapon (the firing ratio leaves it a bit behind of more powerful weapons), but tearing towers apart is certainly a refreshing experience.The story is standard, but the characters are better than in many other games. Overall, a game very well worth the money.			",747,184,19,65,52,12,82

												This is a mixed game for me. On one hand, the gun handling, gun preformance, and overall story line are better the Red Faction: Guerilla, which was already good, but this game has no online multiplayer and a very repetitive co-op/single player side campain where you just kill bugs, increasing in difficulty, in 2-3 different places. Over and over again for something like 40-50 levels. Much like Guerilla, it has a great story line but lacking co-op/multiplayer. Also unlike guerrilla this game is not a free roaming game but rather a linear game. I'm still going to reccommend this game though because this game had such an awesome story line (although it is only about 25 hours of gameplay)			",37,0,0,1,3,1,2

												This game is about as generic a shooter one can get. While it's unique features are the ability to destroy and recreate some parts of the environment, much of it cannot be destroyed and this mechanic holds only some relevance. The writers seem to have lost sight of what the Red Faction series is about because this whole game is about fighting aliens while occasionally fighting cultists with no explanation of their irrationality, instead of fighting an oppressive force using what little you have.. The sub plot love story is very generic, cheesy, and obvious from the start. All of the characters are very forgettable, including the protaganist himself. Most of the jokes are midly amusing at their best, and evoke no reaction often times. The hardest difficulty is not hard at all and provides little challenge throughout.If you want a mindlessly easy generic shooter game with a plot one will not care about, this is the game for you.

												If you came to blow stuff up, you will be rewarded.  This game is at its best when allowing the player free reign to blow up bad guys and aliens at will.  The environments are delightfully destructable and the weapons provide you with a variety of ways to do it.Unfortunately, the environments are not varied enough, nor are the mission objective particularly interesting.  The enemies are interesting enough but dispatching them becomes tedious more often than I'd like.In regards to the single player campaign, the characters and story are all cliche almost (but not quite) to the point of parody.  We are frequently told to like in game characters as they snarkily imply some archetype we're meant to immediately identify.  There are a couple of gaping plot holes as well.  In a game where the main focus is to blow stuff up, this would usually be easily ignored provided the characters were likeable.  Unfortunately, none fit the bill.Your 8 hours could best be spent elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very interesting game because we can destroy and rebuild most part of the buildings. Pros+ Several weapons that allow different game play style;+ Interactive scenario, destroy and reload the previous construction;+ Interesting story.Cons- Limited interaction with buildings, while some we can destroy, rocks, terrain or even some constructions can't change;- Some weapons are not so effective as others;- The game play is very oriented / guided to the same path;Enjoy.

												I'm a little confused by why the metacritic score is fairly low. This is a really fun game, the destruction physics are so much better in this one, and you can turn almost everything into shrapnel, using it as a primary damage source. Granted, there isn't much in the way of gravity physics; floating objects for days. The story is linear, so that would be the main complaint, if I had to guess. If you're okay with no open world/ a linear storyline, I'd highly recommend this game. I'm having as much fun with it as I did with Guerilla.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just finished my first run through the story.  It's a decent FPS with a twist: you can destroy most of the objects in the world.  Grab your magnet gun, tag a building then tag a group of bad guys and watch at the building is shredded into pieces and flies at the enemy!  Or tag an enemy and then tag a wall and watch them smash into the wall and die.One of the best parts of the original Red Faction was that everything was destructible, including the world.  Althought RF: Armageddon doesn't let you destroy the world, you can destroy pretty much everything in it.  You are also equipped with a nice tool called the Nanoforge which allows you to rebuild anything you busted up too (very useful for getting across those bridges you ""accidentally"" blew up)I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun FPS with interesting weapons.

												I have to say that this is one of the best FPS's I've played in a long time.  It’s probably one of the best that I own.  However since I was looking for a game that improved upon Guerrilla, I was very disappointed.  The first few RF's had been decent FPS's and the move to make Guerrilla open world had been a vast improvement to the RF franchise.  If RF had of stayed a FPS format for Guerrilla, then I would had thought that Armageddon was a huge success.  Bottom line the game feels like its lacking something.  Is it just my disappointment that it's now open world?  Probably...But what if Saints Row or Gran Theft Auto moved to a strictly FPS?  Disappointment would be evident and voiced loudly.  Granted RF isn't as big as those two titles, but I loved the story and world behind RF and with this step backward in the series I just cannot find myself approving of this sequel.

												Mr. Mason, here's your gun and there're the bugs. Kill'em all and wipe out a few humans while you are at it. Cheers!That sums up what Red Faction: Armageddon is all about. It is an FPS-RPG game, with the FPS being very well done and the RPG complementing the game with power-ups, character abilities, and an excellent story. It is not an open-ended game, with a linear story and 'corridor' levels; in the sense that you can't just leave the main plot and go about exploring the world, ducking down this passage and that, rummaging in every nook and corner for hidden gems. Regardless, the story of the game is excellent and the action has been guided well by the developers. Every second has you desiring to know the next bit of the story. Your finger is always on the trigger, waiting to snap off a few rounds when the next alien appears from the shadows.Red Faction: Armageddon is fun and gripping. I would recommend it to all FPS lovers. On a final note, you can blow the environment to shreds. Cheers! God bless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So Red Faction Armageddon. This game's alright and as fun as it is it's really toned down in terms of destruction and open world fun compared to Red Faction Guerilla. But if Guerilla didn't exist this game would actually be pretty decent. The gameplay's solid, the destruction can get in the way but is at least some fun when you can get destroying, the story's still not too good but it somewhat fits the game, the co-op's decent and overall not too bad. But compared to Guerilla it's not good. It seems really toned down and constricting and just isn't good in comparison. But if you buy it without Guerilla in mind then you should be fine. I recommend picking it up on sale though.			",169,27,5,17,9,0,5

												This game is quality. As a nostalgia gamer, I remember when the first Red Faction blew me away back in 2000 or so. After buying, installing, and forgetting about this game, I came back to it to be pleasantly surprised.Excellent physics, clever gameplay and a nice mix and match of weaponry gives you all sorts of fun ways to blow your enemy (and their bases) to bits.If you like to collect solid games for cheap and play them on rainy days, them buy `em all! I am glad to have compelted my collection on the latest sale.			",159,35,1,52,33,0,41

												I found this third person shooter a lot of fun. I've never played any of the other Red Factions, and am told that some of them (if not all) had a more open world feel compared to this much more linear adventure. However, I think its average metacritic score of 70 odd suffers from these sorts of comparisons, as it's a pretty enjoyable game in its own right without any previous experience with the rest of the franchise.There are a decent range of weapons that can float different people's boats, but I settled into my favourite four pretty quickly - the magnet gun, sniper rifle, mace (for up close and personal squishing), & a heavy damage weapon (which was the plasma cannon for a long time, rocket launcher, and then finally the singularity cannon). The best thing about the game however, is how much of the environment is destructable. It can break from enemy attack, your own attack, or you can even use it to harm enemies (particularly with the magnet gun). It's honestly one of the best features of the game, and using your particle repairer, you can build up most of the destroyed environment to destroy or throw at enemies again!Replayability may be a little sticking point however. Like I mentioned the single player is quite linear though can obviously be replayed. However, there are another two gamemodes, one of which can be multiplayer. The first is ruin which is essentially using all your best skills at destroying as much of the destructible environment in the map you're put on. There's a short time limit and points are earned on how much damage you do and at what efficiency. You essentially need to destroy X amount of points to complete the few different maps they have and can continue to try set bigger scores. However, it feels like just the addon it is rather than a completely different game mode. The second is Infestation, which is essentially defeating waves of enemies which get progressively harder (up to 20 waves per map). You can solo this or play with other people, with some similarities to that game mode in Gears of War. I'm not sure about whether or not you spawn more enemies when you play with other people compared to solo though (as I haven't played multiplayer), but I'd hope so given I was able to handle most things solo with just the magnet gun and a decent position on the map playing it smart. The better of the two additional gamemodes for sure, but only extends replayability a little bit more.Well worth the money I paid for it in a humble bundle. The entire red faction collection (which this game is included with) is still available both from the Humble store and here on steam (I think).			",357,78,12,46,44,10,57

												This game is a series of linear paths from one firefight to the next, smashing up structures and shooting aliens. The combat is good, but repetitive. The destruction mechanic is extremely satisfying and I found myself pulling out my sledgehammer to demolish buildings and bridges for no reason other than to smash things to bits. This is a game best taken in small doses so you don't become bored by too much of the same thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Playing RFG will bring you up to speed  with the Geomod building destruction and darius' Grandfather, thats it.

												I say I would recommend this game with a hint of reluctance. It's a good game, storyline is good (but not great). The only thing that pisses me off is the combat system. I prefer an FPS in which everything dies more quickly, like Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (now THAT's a great game). I don't mean make the game easier, as I always like playing games on hardest mode. What I mean is, shooting the same god damn thing for ages waiting for it to dies gets boring after a while. Headshots don't seem to make much difference either. They could have made it so that enemies take much fewer hits to kill, and the protagonist is much easier to kill too (less health). Granted, you do get the sniper rifle which (when upgraded) gives you one shot kills, which is great. BUT you don't get the sniper until quite late on in the game. Also, because each enemy takes so many shots to kill, you often find yourself running out of ammo. Sure, there are ammo crates all over the place, but you can't hold that much ammo so I find myself running out of ammo whenever I'm faced with a big enemy that takes a lot of shots to kill.All in all, the fact that enemies take a lot of shots to kill, and that they usually quite fast and move around a lot, make the combat system a little bit annoying. Otherwise, not a bad game at all. I have tons of other FPS games to recommend instead of this one though.			",103,5,2,3,2,0,6

												Red Faction Armageddon is a linear, repetitive shooter.They've greatly improved the destruction on it and made it more realistic but you don't really require it compared to Red Faction Guerrilla due to you being underground 90% of the time and the loss of free roam and sabotage style missions.The weapons are also more interesting and with a wider variance but the trademark Mallet/Pickaxe is no longer required since destruction isn't really required and you don't have to worry about resulting to it after running out of ammo since ammo is everywhere.Vehicles are still available in selected missions but they don't feel as fun compared to the previous gamesThe flow of the game was also constantly ruined by the needless videos after every 100 metres. This made the first 2 or 3 hours irritating because half of the time the videos weren't even required and made it feel more like I was watching a film rather than playing a gameIf you enjoy the Red Faction franchise then maybe buy this when discounted but it's definitely the worst thus far			",283,33,4,17,25,2,49

												Not as good as Guerilla, and yes, the focus on killing alien bug enemies was a terrible design choice.....however, the trademakk physics destruction of the series remains very impressive and unsurpassed.Overall, I enjoyed it. I really hope the demise of THQ doesn't mean there will be no more RF games, as they do offer something special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not know, previous part was nice and here there's nothing new, the same the best crush-smash sandbox. But i think it's better to kill all enemies first  and then play with all buidings, walls and other big breakable things... Yeah, if you want to crush this world... Go on, it's all in your hands(i mean magnetic-gravity gun in your hands;) ).			",148,9,2,3,7,3,4

												I was doubtful when I acquired this game through a one-time offer for 4.99$. I'm a fan of shoot'em-ups and specially sci-fi-based ones, but the comments I could read about the game were a mix of ups and downs.Now having reached 50% of the main campaign, I must say that technically the game's a beast. Gorgeous DX11 graphics, detailed characters and surroundings, awesome effects and explosions, impressive physics engine. The bugs are so detailed they'll scare you at times. I can't raise a single complain in this respect.However the designers screwd it up in one point: the difficulty level. Even in the highest difficulty level it's ridiculously easy to finish most stages, which combined with the strictly linear structure of the game turn what could be an awesome experience into a routine job. Switching weapons makes no sense due to this, since any weapon will do the job. When things could get a bit tougher you always find an armored battle suit or other mechanized help around. Moving from stage to stage is then a question of time and unless things change a lot in the second part of the game I think you can easily finish it within 20h of gameplay.This said, I think for 4.99$ it's a good buy. I really enjoy blowing away bugs and cultists at the same rate, tearing stuff apart, and of course the magnet gun. I think I might try to run through the game a second time limiting myself to flesh&bone and using just the magnet gun to make it more of a challenge. ",22,0,0,0,1,0,7

												After beating the game on normal difficulty these are my conclusions:Pros:- nice graphics- nice (skippable) cinematics- weapon and vehicle variety (especially magnet gun and mallet)- special abilities- weapon and ability upgrades- environment destruction (and restoration)- pretty designed woman character :)- achievementsCons:- shallow and predictable storyline- meaningless dialogues- small variety of enemies- third person view- unsympathetic main character- linearity- achievements- the game crushes approx once in 2,5 hoursThis game is the fourth instalment of Red Faction series. I just played all of them for the first time and watched the movie in the last half a year. I was pretty amazed by the first one and was hoping the Armageddon would be like it with better graphics. But it wasn't! If you are younger or just this is the first game from the series you are going to play, you can end up with no interest in the series which would be a shame.I did not play a modern shooter in some years so I was pretty amazed by the graphics and cinematics (I just love the female character :)). The cinems are not disturbing and can be skipped. The linearity of the game is excessive. Places with different routes are common as rain on Sahara. It wouldn’t bother me so much if the environment variety would be higher. After 7 hours of play I was pretty bored and the idiotic main character was not helping. He is just a type of a superhero without a whit of intelligence. Just a stupid killing machine. I don't know how you, but I like a lot more first person shooters because you can feel much more immersed in the action. In difference with a sight on a mussle-idiot blocking my view.The weapons an abilities are good, maybe even the best things of the game not counting my beloved destruction :). For achievement hunters there are 58 achievs from which more than 60% can be done without trying on the first run but others are just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I am not interested in multiplayer and have no idea for now what the DLC is about, so no rating there.As a whole it is a pretty mediocre game and is not worth playing standalone and for the full price. Nothing spectacular here but a modern shooter with some fun guns and nice graphics. If you don't mind the old looks play the first Red Faction or the GTA styled Guerrilla destruction madness :).

												""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should.""No. this game. this. this. why.4 years ago i discovered a great but sadly underrated game called Red Faction: Guerilla.The story was good enough but what really defined it was the battlefield-like building destruction, physics and a really great open world experience. (Srsly, i spent loads of hours on that game, the gameplay is hella fun, i mean, causing open world mayhem with a sledgehammer and explosives, rekin enemy buildings with random A.I., destroying bridges, the vehicle controls, gore, great building physics etc. maaaaan.)Those 2 features really made that game one of my favorite pre-2010 games.a couple of years later, they announce a sequel to the game.i was more into the Assassin's Creed games at that time, but still, there was something in me that made me want to get it. (Yeah, the most exciting thing about it was the Nano thing, and i was expecting better physics)...in the end i ended up getting Assassin's Creed Revelations and totally forgot about buying this game :D...fast forward to Xmas sale 2013 where i completely remembered about this series and totally bought the sequel since it was 3 bucks...And man, what a waste of 3 bucks.I mean, i know that this game isnt famous for its stories butif you were going to focus on the story, it shouldve atleast been a decent one it was horrible ;n;andIT. ISNT. OPEN. WORLD.why would you remove the only thing that makes this game fun?i mean i know you guys sticked to how the first games worked butim pretty sure Guerilla was the game that stood out from the rest ;n;and you guys shouldve sticked with Guerilla, OPEN WORLD DESTRUCTION FESTi mean so many new elements but no open world to play it on ;n;its sad ;n;but yeah.i dont really like it, its not open world,i dont like the story, its pretty hassle to play it.its pretty repetitive and somewhat basic (idk)buuut yeah.maybe they need a cash cowsince they were near bankruptcy.THQ i mean.but yeaaah.idk. does this make sense? what makes sense? idk anymore. moo.welp, missed chances.

 Tell me what you are not and I will tell you what you are	Before getting into this you should be aware of what RF: Amrageddon is not.It is not an open world game. If you are looking for a continuation of RF: Guerilla than this is definitely not it. Armageddon is completely linear. Make sure you get this clear or else that's going ot be 2 hours of ""I wonder when the map is going to open up"" feelings.It is not open at all in fact. Pretty much the entire game happens in caves. Just caves caves and more caves. The environments are well crafted but way too same-ish to appeal to the eyes.It is not demolition paradise. Now whilst there are a few spectacular buildings to demolish, and the demolition physics are really sweet as usual with Red Faction, you can only fit that many types of building inside caves. No demolition derbys and challenges.So once you take all these things that made Red Faction games away from Armageddon, what is left?The answer is a pretty damn good shooter. The levels are (mostly) well balanced, enemy AI is effective, and most of all there are a ton of varied, whacky, or overpowered weapons to use. Flinging parts of buildings into giant insects with a magnet gun or detonating the (too few) buildings in the game with your remote charges is nothing short of awesome fun.  There are some short, but sweet, vehicle sections which add variety. The challenge level is just about right and outside a very annoying rail shooter bit near the start, I pretty enjoyed the whole thing from beginning to end without getting bored.Unfortunately the game is not bug-free. I encountered a few random crashes, could not alt tab without crashing, and most annoyingly the difficulty changed itself from hard to normal at some point during my campaign without me noticing.If you can overlook these shortcomings and know to expect something very different from the previous series, Armageddon is still worth playing to this date.

												This is a criminally underrated game. Again, because of the B-level of the Red Faction franchise as a whole, I suspect players and reviewers went into Armageddon already thinking it was going to suck. Well, that's the wrong expectation to have if you want to enjoy something, and, quite frankly, it doesn't suck. It just doesn't measure up to Guerilla, due to it being a linear Third Person Shooter that takes you to the opressive caverns beneath the surface of Mars. So, no, it's not better then Guerilla. It is, however, much better then Red Factions 1 and 2, and if you were engaged in Guerilla's plot and have seen the Origins film that ties these two games together, you will have sympathy for the Mason family and their plight, and will enjoy the game that much more. At a basic level, it has an array of satisfyingly destructive weaponry and even allows you to reconstruct destroyed buildings with the NanoForge device- so you can blow them up all over again. There's also co-op survival.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

Though a bit more linear and less open it fits in the context of the game's plot: this guy has had the worst string of luck.

												Who ever though a linner shooter with detrction emelents was a good idea. You either have to constrain the player from buldozing your level or simply dont put any effot into level design. RFA breaks the mold by doing the latter while still setting 90% of the game in indestructable caves. the only use of the destruction physics is to ensure you will have to rebuild the starwell you blew up so you can proceed with the level. The shooting can at be best described as passable and the plot laughable. A dumb idea executed poorly. Minecraft did destruction physics better.			",220,31,2,34,28,3,45

												To start, I greatly enjoyed the previous game Guerilla playing it twice through. Going into this game I expected a similiar fun experience with being able to demolish entire cities. That was my mistake. While I found this game extremely fun in itself, any fan or person thinking this is like the old ones, just hold the phone there and read what I have to say.Red Faction: Armageddon takes place almost entirely undergound, and unlike the very first Red Faction game, you cannot destroy the tunnel walls. This dispenses an atomosphere of restriction and lack of freedom, which compared to its' predecessors this game is restrictive. There are only a couple city-like places in the begginning that you can demolish and from there, you go undergound where there are just some structures you are allowed to destroy. Any old fan will be dissapointed. On top of that, the developers brought in a whole new aspect of aliens that you are fighting to save your existence. Personally, this doesn't bother me, but others may find this a turn off.Having said that, looking at this game as if it was its own series, it would be very fun. The destruction/rebuilding engine is still awesome in the limited amount you can use it, and it is just as fun as ever to clear your enemies using with the environment, like caving the roof of a shack in on a horde of aliens charging you. The upgrade system for your weapons and abilities was definitely one of my favorite parts. I felt the upgrades were noticable, which made me feel accomplished when I could afford them. They greatly change gamplay, making each players fighting style a bit different depending on how they go about upgrading. To wrap this up short and sweet:--Pros--The game is fun, featuring a moderately decent story. The mayham and methods of killing are where this game shines, allowing you to use your environment in fun and destructive ways, then rebuilding it (with the nano forge) and starting all over for the next wave of enemies, who you are already devising cunning new ways to splatter and break--cons -- I would not even bother comparing this to the old series, and many fans will be dissapointed if they buy this. IMPORTANT: This game does not allow for the free-roam that guerilla did, this was where most of my dissapoinment stems from.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: It's fun to blow up buildings.Unlike the original Red Faction, the terrain isn't fully destructible. Buildings, however, are. So still pretty fun to smash a truck into something and take out a wall, then blow up the truck for even more mayhem.  Not huge on realism, as you can take a sledgehammer to the four corners of a building and tear the whole thing down in a couple mins, but games are supposed to be more fun than real life, eh?This game is a good fun physics playground with some good story if you pay attention to anything beyond shooting bad guys and blowing up buildings and such.  Seriously it's pretty fun.  ",86,12,0,22,7,0,11

Although you can still destroy pieces of the environment with your weapons, this game feels a lot more restrictive. The thing I hate the most is when they lock you in a room where you have to fight against waves of enemies. It totally negate the advantages of having a destructable environment.

												One of the most boring games I've played in a while. You know there's trouble when you find yourself in a big exposed environment, which is 90% of the game (of what I've played). A million aliens start appearing out of nowhere, and you gotta kill them all (most of the time), over and over and over again, that's pretty much all the game. Different aliens will appear gradually but the atack patterns are not that different and I personally didn't find it enjoyable. I though critics were being harsh, but now I know they are not, it's a pretty predictable, linear, and repetititve game, go for RF Guerilla or something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a big fan of the Red Faction series since the original Red Faction.  This reboot of the franchise has disappointed me.  I liked the linear game play in Doom.  I expected it there.  In Red Faction it was linear without being linear as you could take different ways to get to different places through the walls.  The last game was also sandboxish.  This rendition reminds me of Doom 3.  Sure you can blow *almost* everything up, but you can't go through the walls unless it is scripted.  I'm about half way through the game and while it has been enjoyable it is no wehre near as fun as the original Red Faction or even Red Fracion Guerrilla.  It's worth the money but do not expect open sandbox with non-linear game play.  Go into this game expected Doom 3 and you will be more than pleasantly pleased.			",628,135,22,96,75,4,168

												This game seems to go back to the orginal red faction with a linear levels instead of an open world of the 3rd game.  it still a 3rd person shooter. and it does have Geo mod so you can destory things and rebuild them to you can destory them again, but since it a linear game not every thing can be distoryed, so theres that. The story was interesting but not good. it not terrible just okIt has interesting new and old guns, and suprisingly it made me like one of the guns that i hated in the 3rd one which is the gun that shoots lighting. in the 3rd one, it felt weak and i didn't use it that much., but in this game, its over powering (against NPC). just like 3rd game it stuns the enemy, but in this one, you can easily clear the room with it and leave no damage to bridge that you are using over a large drop that will kill you if you fall into it.gameplay is just like the 3rd only with some changes here and there, such as the aim will auto snap to an enemy or exsposive if looking down the scope, Now some may find this annoying and turn it off, but it does help finding enemys in the dark without boosting the brightness.I reccommend this game to anyone who like Red faction games, like blowing stuff up, and have fun doing it			",129,12,3,15,6,1,2

												This game is about as generic a shooter one can get. While it's unique features are the ability to destroy and recreate some parts of the environment, much of it cannot be destroyed and this mechanic holds only some relevance. The writers seem to have lost sight of what the Red Faction series is about because this whole game is about fighting aliens while occasionally fighting cultists with no explanation of their irrationality, instead of fighting an oppressive force using what little you have.. The sub plot love story is very generic, cheesy, and obvious from the start. All of the characters are very forgettable, including the protaganist himself. Most of the jokes are midly amusing at their best, and evoke no reaction often times. The hardest difficulty is not hard at all and provides little challenge throughout.If you want a mindlessly easy generic shooter game with a plot one will not care about, this is the game for you.

												I don't have any prior experience to the other Red Faction games, however, as a stand-alone game it can keep you somewhat entertained to a certain point. The story of Red Faction: Armageddon is substantial , it's servicing enough to make you progress through the story and the mission that you've been given. The physics and being able to destroy almost anything in the game is one of the greater highlights of this game. It's pretty entertaining to wreck things, to see how far you can go.However, in what this game lacks is how the levels and the gameplay is designed, it works but it's not too great. The levels are very linear as most of it is you going from going point A to point B, and nothing more to it. If you play this in normal, the gravity gun can basically take cares of any enemy that is thrown at you 70% into the campaign. I'd also note that the FoV in this game is pretty bad considering and takes time to get used to it. And the melee in this game is very OP.It's okay, just get it when it's dirt cheap.

												Great game, but lacks the freedom of the other RF games.If you liked running around in an open world demolishing random things for fun in RF this game probably will get your back up. It has a very liniar based storyline. You are not able to move around much other than to do the campaign. However this game still incorporates the physics and the shear destruction of the RF series.New weapons and items give you different ways to bring structures to their knees but i feel this game is more focused on using the physics to kill enemies Ie. Slamming parts of buildings in to monsters, great fun but if you feel like just randomly destroying places to watch how they crumble your options are limited as most of the time you will be preocupied by NPCs trying to eat your soul.

												It seemed like a generic shooter at first but I WAS VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENT. Plus you can magically repair all the damage with the Nano Forge so you can destroy everything all over again. The weapons are unique and fun to play with, the story's alright but linear, the locations and aliens can feel pretty eerie at times almost like Dead Space, and you can use the magnet gun to propel giant explosive structures at enemies. What more could you want?I got it really cheap from the THQ Humble Bundle way back when, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale since there's not much to do after you beat the campaign.The PC port is terrible though and I had to Google around and eventually run the game in compatibility mode for Windows 7 to prevent the frequent crashes.

												I've just finished playing this and wow. I bought this as a retail boxset of THQ games and this game is just fantastic. I haven't played any other Red Faction games, so I can't say how it fits with the story. But as an independent story its pretty neat - nothing too out of the ordinary however.The graphics are great, although you may become overwhelmed with particle effects at some of the more intense sections of the game. The voice acting and script are both convincing and help add a layer of immersion.The game handles fantastic - for those who played Saints Row The Third then RFA has exactly the same gun combat.There is a good variety of weapons including my favourite the magnet gun which allows you to kill the enemies using parts of the landscape. The repair tool that they give you also makes for an interesting gameplay mechanic requiring you to fix items in real time (difficult if you are faced with a few dozen enemies). You also get a selection of vehicles to use - which mixes things up.The only issues I have with this game is that it is quite short. It has the tendency to randomly quit the game for no reason. Enemies can spawn a few feet in front of you (not cool).			",275,49,22,36,23,4,28

												The 4th in the Red Faction series, Armageddon seems to fall very short from what was just established a game before it. most of the terrain is destructable as you have come to expect from this series, but after a few chapters in the game even that becomes less than entertaining. Armageddon uses an over-the-shoulder view like it's predecessor, but takes away much of the reason to break things as salvage does not exist and you might be lucky to find some ammo for the guns that actually do damage to enemies in the rubble. While recreating broken items with your nanos is enjoyable, the level designs are regurgitated over and over and the enemy AI seems a bit off at times. This game features extra modes and difficulties to try and squeeze more interest from gamers, but over all other than fairly decent graphics and the ability to break everything in sight with a magnet gun or a rainbow farting pony, there isn't much to this game of monotomy. Worth a play if you are a fan, but not if this if your first romp on Mars.			",319,44,6,45,23,4,44

												I'll let someone else write a positive review and include reasons why this is game is great. Here's a simple summary of why I stopped playing: I was bored.This is a very typical modern third person shooter, and the game's strongest point is the destruction physics. If you're looking for multiplayer fun, the destruction mode is great... except that it's local only. If you're looking for an engaging single player experience... look elsewhere.This game held me by the hand. Crushing basic enemies with amazingly powerful weapons got boring too quickly.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, because I loved Guerilla so much. It manages to dissapoint completly. The gimmick of the Red Faction games has always beed destruction physics, and it is present in Armageddon as well. The problem is that Armageddon isnt about the destruction, unlike Guerilla. Armageddon is about shooting bugs, for the most part, there are some humans with bug helmets scattered around. The main issue i have with Armageddon is that the core gameplay is about shooting, whitch hasent gotten any better since Guerillas iffy gunplay, while the gimmick of destruction just demands as much attention as possible. I tried to make the most out of blowing things up to make buildings fall with enemies inside, or fall onto other buildings, but everything seems to be too far away or too short to do that with. In the first level I tried the hardest to do this, and sucssesfully knocked down one building. as the levels move forward, you will get a very strong sense of being pushed into a funnel, thats because they moved away from the open world to caves where your destroyed buildings will either get in the way or fall pitifully, making you remember that one time in Guerilla that you blew up a building and it covered the entire counrty. The nano forge is an interesting addition to the game, but isnt really something I think we needed. the nano forge is something that you can use to repair broken things in a radius around you, so you can remake cover, bridges, and other things. it could have an interesting use, but Ive never seen it. The nano forge seems to only be in the game so the designers could make stairs destructable without having to find a way to still get to the objective.I strongly reccomend giving this game a pass. If you want to get into the series, pick up Guerilla for the same price.If you wanted more of Guerilla, find a few friends to play the old multiplayer with, since its been put on steamworks now. If you were looking for more of Guerillas shooting in corridors, then this will be for you.			",107,17,1,9,3,3,12

												So I did not play any of the previous games before this one. I personally found it to be a lot of fun wrecking everything around and slaughtering all the aliens. I felt the graphics were good and the game play flowed well for me. Then the fact that you can play thru with all the stuff you unlocked just makes for a whole bunch of carnage. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves running around killing everything that moves. Oh, and see if you can get creative with the magnet gun.... he he.			",214,78,0,50,12,2,34

												Red Faction: Armageddon is a good game.But the problem is, Red Faction: Guerrilla was a GREAT game. Therefore everyone expected this to be either better or as good as that title, it is not. Not even close.However, if you judge the game on it's own right you'll end up having a plenty of fun and realize that it's not even close to as terrible as people make it sound like.

												You are Johnny McHammer, certified bald man who has an ancestor that was one of the CoD protagonists. Your awesome DNA is why the Space council entrusts you with the only crazy hammer on Mars, and a Magic wrist-mounted 3D printer that can print fireballs and all the houses you spent 5 minutes knocking down instead of fighting the alien cultists. Oh yeah, you also have to fight alien cultists who just want to kill everyone and everything on Mars because some old obscure Marvel supervillain/sithlord said they should.I think this game is very good, it is a refreshing take on 3rd person shooters in that your only weapon is the patented crazy hammer and 3D printer fireballs. It plays on this by sometimes giving you guns and you can't hit anything with them because you are in a 3rd person perspective and it would be really hard to aim a gun in real life if you saw everything like that. It is satire, ha ha, get it? The crazy hammer is crazy because you can destroy anything you want to with it, like there are houses with an enemy in it? Hit with hammer. This truly is a hidden gem in the 3rd person house-and-sometimes-skulls-obliterating-with-a-hammer genre.You don't even need to buy this game because it's already in your inventory and you won't even remember why.

												So this game is your bog standard fps and, honestly, I can't always tell the difference between most of the male characters, including the protag, because they're all bald white guys. This game shouldn't be fun but it really is. (I suspect that you can completely destroy and rebuild your surroundings at will helps). I'm not hugely sure what's going on (someone's trying to destroy the colony on mars?) but I do know it involves killing a lot of bugs and I'm okay with that. Definitely worth a go if you like shooting things.			",91,29,2,12,4,0,8

												This was an alright game, nothing really that spectacular.  The gameplay is linear once again, breaking away from the open world of Guerrilla.  The destruction element is still there, but less so than any other Red Faction game I remember. You still get to tear down buildings, but now it seems that many of them are mission objectives that are placed intentionally. The weapons are fairly creative and fun to use, I really liked the gravity gun.  Storywise, I didn't feel like it tied into any of the other releases in the franchise, like they could have easily taken all the Red Faction names and characters out of the game and it wouldn't have changed things at all.   Amusing for a playthrough, but not really memorable. 5/10			",69,4,0,9,3,0,0

												I love the last game, and this game is a disappointment to me. The open world sandbox is gone. Although you can still destroy pieces of the environment with your weapons, this game feels a lot more restrictive. The thing I hate the most is when they lock you in a room where you have to fight against waves of enemies. It totally negate the advantages of having a destructable environment.

The graphics are great and the destruction is awesome. I'll rate this game 7/10. Gameplay is pretty linear and I wish it was more of a sandbox type of game. On a side note, there is no option to select levels. However, driving vehicles is fun.			",457,47,15,41,27,3,67

Ultimately this was a short game, and I found my self wishing it was an open world game like Red Faction Guerilla was. This had a stronger plot that Guerilla.

												Red Faction. This game isn't the same as the first two Red Faction games. Those were great games for their time, though they still are but the newer ones, Guerrilla and this one weren't all that good. They turn to TPS and the same feel is not the same. Guerrilla was too open world. This game went back to the linear shooting, which is good but the game has many aspects I didn't like. Cheesy and cliche dialogues, aliens, bugs, fighting, not my cup of tea. The best thing though is the geomod engine, destroy the enviornment all you want! Good thing they retain it! This game is fun, but alien shooting is annoying. And there are too many for you to survive. They swarm on you. Great combat, weapons keep this game fun. And love the main voice actor, he's from FSW game! :) Nonetheless, this is a fun, explosive, destructive and did I mention blow up stuff?! 7.5/10 for the destruction and not alien fighting. This is a good decent game.			",156,6,3,3,12,1,19

												This is a 3rd person console shooter with a gimmick where you can destroy AND repair your environment. You destroyed that vital staircase? No problem you can repair it. Also you can collect scrap and upgrade your weapons and abilities. Weapons are standard from guns to rocket launchers and abilities are your throw and shield that protects you from monsters for a short time. And other than that you go shoot the same 5-6 types of monsters the entire game. Somewhere by the 1000th wave of the same 5-6 monsters you get quite bored and realize that this game doesn't have anything to it other than the repair gimmick. By the end of the game I was running past swarms of monsters just to get to the end I was so awfully bored. 6/10 (P.S. if you want to play a Red Faction game that is more fun - try playing Red Faction Guerilla).

Gameplay is great if you like shooting and blowing stuff up and wow the mechs are amazing!. The mech gameplay really makes you feel all powerful. Then theres the destruction, you really can bring down the house then rebuild it and bring it down all over again. The inclusion of the magnet gun just makes the destruction a little more enticing.

												not at all like red faction Guerrilla and is instead a single plot line closed world shooter. Disappointing. Did like the guns and destruction of buildings, reconsruction  was good as well. i would give it a 7 out of 10 but then i went to play it one day and found it had lost all my save game files. reaserched on internet and found it is quite common. 1 out of 10. not stable after many years			",74,5,5,12,4,1,22

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, because I loved Guerilla so much. It manages to dissapoint completly. The gimmick of the Red Faction games has always beed destruction physics, and it is present in Armageddon as well. The problem is that Armageddon isnt about the destruction, unlike Guerilla. Armageddon is about shooting bugs, for the most part, there are some humans with bug helmets scattered around. The main issue i have with Armageddon is that the core gameplay is about shooting, whitch hasent gotten any better since Guerillas iffy gunplay, while the gimmick of destruction just demands as much attention as possible. I tried to make the most out of blowing things up to make buildings fall with enemies inside, or fall onto other buildings, but everything seems to be too far away or too short to do that with. In the first level I tried the hardest to do this, and sucssesfully knocked down one building. as the levels move forward, you will get a very strong sense of being pushed into a funnel, thats because they moved away from the open world to caves where your destroyed buildings will either get in the way or fall pitifully, making you remember that one time in Guerilla that you blew up a building and it covered the entire counrty. The nano forge is an interesting addition to the game, but isnt really something I think we needed. the nano forge is something that you can use to repair broken things in a radius around you, so you can remake cover, bridges, and other things. it could have an interesting use, but Ive never seen it. The nano forge seems to only be in the game so the designers could make stairs destructable without having to find a way to still get to the objective.I strongly reccomend giving this game a pass. If you want to get into the series, pick up Guerilla for the same price.If you wanted more of Guerilla, find a few friends to play the old multiplayer with, since its been put on steamworks now. If you were looking for more of Guerillas shooting in corridors, then this will be for you.			",107,17,1,9,3,3,12

												Not open world like it predecessor nor a FPS like the 1st two games in the series, this game is still a great game that lives up to the Red Faction name.The story isn't really anything new but works well for what it is, slaughtering waves of bugs. Plenty of new and interesting weapons make that happen. Stomping around in a suit of power armor is just pure fun.Fans of the earlier games will find plenty of callbacks, especially to the 1st game. The alien bugs especially look awfully familiar to creatures found in a certain insane scientist's zoo. Not really any connection to the much unfairly maligned 2nd game but then that game was a big of an odd one out. This will unfortunately probably be the last Red Faction game we will get for awhile, thanks to poor sells and THQ going belly up, but still if you are a fan of the series its a worthy ending to it.Highly recommended.

												This somehow reminds me more of the original Red Faction game, I only vaguely remember that at this point, but I think the pacing must be similar. Ultimately this was a short game, and I found my self wishing it was an open world game like Red Faction Guerilla was. This had a stronger plot that Guerilla. All in all I think it's a good game, and it gets a B, here's hoping we'll get another Red Faction in the next 5 years.			",81,4,0,13,5,0,23

												Red Faction: Bug Hunt is more in line with the original games than Guerilla was.  It's a linear story-focused experience that I found much more enjoyable than Guerilla.  It doesn't suffer from any of the drawbacks of that bland open world and has a much larger variety of gameplay experiences.The game has a wide variety of weapons, and they're all far more useful than anything in Guerilla.  The addition of the magnet gun is also fantastic, giving you another way to tear down buildings rather than burning through precious explosive ammo or slowly chipping away with a hammer.  There's even a gun that collects nearby debris and shoots it towards your enemies (in the DLC.)  This time around, only certain objects drop scrap when destroyed, but the upgrade systyem is much more robust allowing you to acquire and upgrade special nanoforge powers along with general upgrades.The destruction system is great fun like always, and feels improved since Guerilla, with buildings more realistically falling down when supports are destroyed rather than hanging in the air supported by one lone pillar.  In addition, you also have the ability to reconstruct destroyed objects.  Some people think this cheapens the destruction but I find it gives the level designers more options so they don't have to worry about whether you'll be able to continue after a structure is destroyed and also gives you more tactical options, being able to construct cover during combat.The graphics are quite good, and the game even has full DX11 support.  It even manages to run well even when buildings are exploding all around you.  Unfortunately the game uses an extremely low FOV, though it can be fixed by editing some game files as with all Volition games.The multiplayer is pretty fun, though I doubt you'll find anyone playing public games so it's best to bring friends.  There is a set of 8 survival maps, where you fight of waves of enemies to either survive, or defend key structures.  It shares upgrades with the single player so you'll have an easier time if you play the single player first.Overall a fantastic game and I hope Volition keeps working on Red Faction at their new home with Deep Silver.

												Great game, get it on sale. Note: All upgrades are permament, so even if you start a new game, all your upgrades will still be there. Campaign takes 6 hours to accomplish on Normal. The graphics are great and the destruction is awesome. I'll rate this game 7/10. Gameplay is pretty linear and I wish it was more of a sandbox type of game. On a side note, there is no option to select levels. However, driving vehicles is fun.			",457,47,15,41,27,3,67

												Mr. Mason, here's your gun and there're the bugs. Kill'em all and wipe out a few humans while you are at it. Cheers!That sums up what Red Faction: Armageddon is all about. It is an FPS-RPG game, with the FPS being very well done and the RPG complementing the game with power-ups, character abilities, and an excellent story. It is not an open-ended game, with a linear story and 'corridor' levels; in the sense that you can't just leave the main plot and go about exploring the world, ducking down this passage and that, rummaging in every nook and corner for hidden gems. Regardless, the story of the game is excellent and the action has been guided well by the developers. Every second has you desiring to know the next bit of the story. Your finger is always on the trigger, waiting to snap off a few rounds when the next alien appears from the shadows.Red Faction: Armageddon is fun and gripping. I would recommend it to all FPS lovers. On a final note, you can blow the environment to shreds. Cheers! God bless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So Red Faction Armageddon. This game's alright and as fun as it is it's really toned down in terms of destruction and open world fun compared to Red Faction Guerilla. But if Guerilla didn't exist this game would actually be pretty decent. The gameplay's solid, the destruction can get in the way but is at least some fun when you can get destroying, the story's still not too good but it somewhat fits the game, the co-op's decent and overall not too bad. But compared to Guerilla it's not good. It seems really toned down and constricting and just isn't good in comparison. But if you buy it without Guerilla in mind then you should be fine. I recommend picking it up on sale though.			",169,27,5,17,9,0,5

												First I have to say that I've played this game twice, and it was such a good overall experience I eventually plan to play it again.Red Faction : Armageddon separates itself from the previous Red Faction titles by moving from a first person shooter perspective to a third person shooter one. Otherwise, the game stays true to legacy of destructable environment that somewhat defined the franchise.The game includes nice additions, like the hammer and the power gauntlet, that allows you to feel like a techno-barbarian along with the cosy and warming feeling of being a futuristic soldier. It's really nice to mix close range battles with enemies you can shock, and your regular shotgun-rifle-sniper-rocket launcher cycle.The levels are varied and crafted enougth to deliver a good-to-great experience.Your character has some kind of a skill / buff tree in shape of several rings, so you can fine tune him to fit your play style. Anyhow, you'll end up with every one of them, so don't fear to make a mistake or forgot something crucial.The storyline is decent, and credible enougth to justify that level of rampage. Even if Red Faction : Armageddon will not blow your mind, it's a very good game that gives you a licence to blow every piece of man-made environment to the ground, and rebuild it with your nanobots if you feel it's the right thing to do.

												This game started out promising, it looks fairly good, there's a great magnet gun that is fun to use, everything can be destoryed and reparied, and the lighting was good.  And for the first few hours everything seemed good, but after that it all starts to fall apart.  The story starts to become boring, with little to keep you interested, the characters are not memorable, and by the end of the game you just don't care what happens.  Halfway through the campaign everything starts to feel drawn out and some objectives fell like they were put in just to add extra play time, you actually reach a point where it would make sense for the game to end and wrap things up, but the game pushes on, and it does that 3 or 4 times in the closing stages.  The last 2 hours of the game had me fustrated that it hadn't ended, it was annoying to continue playing, and don't think you're rewarded with a brilliant ending.  The combat also takes its toll the longer you play, the destructable items and terrain become a pain, occasionally you get stuck on areas and have to rely on random jumping to get you out of situations, you end up constantly reparing the way you need to go as AI seems to shoot at that more that you.  The magnet gun which pulls terrain from one point to another is fun to use at first and probably the most effective gun in the game, but no othe weapon brings anything different to the table, which means using those make this anothe generic shooter.Overall this game is boring as hell.

												It has been a little bit since I last played this game (busy doing other things) so certain details may be a bit unspecific.Gameplay: 7/10The gameplay in this game is pretty standard for a third person shooter, however it adds an extra layer with a single feature. Near the beginning of the game, you are given a weapon that fires a magnet to one thing, then you can attach another magnet to something else and bring them together. This ""Magnet Gun"" is where the game shines the most (and lags the most depending on your computer). In Red Faction: Armageddon, the environments are almost completely destructible. There are some things you can't destroy, but it's amazing fun finding out what you can destory. Attach a magnet to a building and launch it towards a wall, squishing enemies along the way. Launch an enemy towards a wall and watch them go splat! The amount of destruction you can cause is amazing and satisfying. There are several guns you can pick up throughout the game, but I rarely used anything but magnets. Enemy around the corner? Magnet something in their direction and let physics take care of it. Enemy standing comedically close to a fall? Just thinking about those poor saps gives me vertigo. The best part about this destruction though is that so long as the destruction is not story required, you can use a machine to reverse time to build it again! Did I mention that the Magnet Gun has infinite ammo? Because it does! Unfortunately, as the Magnet Gun is possibly the best thing in the game, it's also why I have to dock a few point off of gameplay because of how all the other guns pale in comparison (especially the non-explosive ones). The game can be completed without picking up a single gun outside of the Magnet Gun and anything story-required.Story- 5/10I can't say too much about the story. As mentioned above ""Gameplay"", there are many details I do not remember as it's a been a while since I last played it. However, I feel I am somewhat good at remembering characters so long as I find them interesting. I found nearly nothing interesting about any of the characters. Your main character (whose name I can't even remember!) is very one-dimensional. He's the typical ""I screwed up, life sucks for me, I screw up AGAIN and now I can redeem myself"". There are nearly no plot twists I did not see coming and none of the moment I assume were meant to be sad really made me the least bit sad. I'm going to give a quick run down of how things set in motion, but if you feel like you want everything to be a surprise, consider this a ""Spoiler Warning"". Your character is part of the military on Mars I think (not sure) and are going to stop a bad dude who wants to ruin the civilizations that humans have built there. You learn about the game and move in to stop the bad guy. You find a wounded soldier who tells you where the bad guy went, where you then run into your commanding officer or whatever, but surprise! You and officer bro were the only ones in there! The wounded soldier WAS the bad guy and your character is an idiot. Bad guy wins and life goes downhill for people on Mars. Your character is now working in excavation for some reason and there's some chick (who I don't remember being mentioned beforehand) that knows your character and there is obvious lovey dovey stuff. Your character gets a job that pays well and all he has to do is break something! Sounds simple enough, right? Well it was! Destroy some stuff and go explore where this new hole in the floor you made goes, but surprise! The bad guy was sealed under the thing that anyone could've destroyed and now aliens are everywhere and your character is an idiot. I think he's even tried to redeem himself to his assumed girlfriend by saying ""it payed well"". Did it protagonist? I don't think they paid you a cent and I think your actually paying for this in guilt and ammunition. Unless you use the MAGNET GUN and it's INFINITE AMMO!Graphics-7/10I won't spend too much time here as I don't spend much time thinking about graphics (I'm more a Gameplay watcher) but from what I remember, the Graphics aren't too shabby. However, most of the game is dark which is very annoying in segments where you have to kill all the enemies in the area but it's too dark to see them. You have a radar that gives you a general location, but it isn't as helpful as you may think. In this game you fight against aliens, but the aliens, for the most part, are very agile and hard to hit as they jump around. Your radar could say you're right on top of them, but in reality, it is they who are on top of you. The darkness in this game makes for some frustrating moments when you want to find that one enemy you need to kill, but they're in the shadows above you and decide that if they shot you, you'd know where they are, which would give you a chance of winning.Enemies-5/10The enemies are very unoriginal and bland. None of enemies even talk save the bad guy from the beginning. You fight so many of the same enemies over and over again you start to figure out how far away the magnets would have to be to one-hit kill them. I played on Easy, but even so, the enemies were all easy to predict. Enemies only really ever got a hit on me when I was lagging from a building I launched at them. You have all the typical enemy types as well. You have the big bruisers that never flinch, the small bug things that are really only there to feel satisfying when you squish them under a rock you threw with you magnets, the fast and annoying ones, the ones that mess up your vision, the ones that spawn enemies and so on. Even the bad guy is very unoriginal and I can't even remember why. I think it had something to do with his people but I wasn't really interested in anything he said. At first, seeing new enemy types is exciting and you get to try out new tactics, but in the end, it loses the ""Wow!"" factor rather quickly and it seems more like a chore. The AI isn't much better either. As mentioned in Graphics, the AI and darkness make for a terrible combination because it's difficult to see enemies and they refuse to shoot you for reasons unknown. Have they had a change of heart? Are they planning on catching you off guard as you slowly go insane trying to find them? Did they run out of ammunition and are now to scared to come at you because they know they'll die? CAN they run out of ammo? No matter the reason, this usually boils down to using the magnets to launch anything and everything until they realize you've gone insane trying to find them, then go for the kill, only to be squished in your onlsauaght of rocks. The ragdoll physics are pretty hilarious though!Sense of Progression-6/10This game doesn't really feel like it gives you much in the way of feeling like you are actually doing something. There aren't very many guns in the game, character reveals don't really feel amazing, the plot twists couldn't even wring a towel and even the upgrade system is lacking! I don't remember how to upgrade, but I never even used it! I think there are items you collect like in Dead Space that you can use, but they are very generic upgrades that aren't even all that necessary! You have some kind of Force Push move that you can upgrade to make stun enemies, but the enemies are so stupid, they don't need to be stunned! They'll just stand still on their own! The game feels like it repeats itself and rarely mixes things up! You have very basic mission types that never actually add a twist and when you finally face something that isn't one of those bugs, you've already lost all sense of worry because of the AI!Overall-7/10The way I described the game may seem like it deserves less than a '7', but I still enjoyed the game quite a bit! I'm not one to ever hate a game and I find something appealing about the destructible environments. I can't say this is a game for everybody, but if you like Mass Effect, you may enjoy this game.

												After many years of sitting on my  steam account  I finally gave the game a try and after a complete near one sit through marathon I really quite liked it. The games got a nice array of weapons, some very chaotic scenes and a nice use of the magnet gun to really use the terrain to your advantage (basically dropping everything on the enemy). Stories a little reliant on previous playthroughs of the other two games but its not very neccessary. Give it a go, its cheap by now and the game plus modes are pretty good. Especially Mr Toots, (whos a good boy, yes you are yes, now blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that building). Oh and ti comes with an additional story after one playthrough from the enemies point of view (however I havent played that fully yet).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has a good UI, good weapons management system, good skills system, highly satisfiying weapons, new game plus, multiplayer mode, quite a few different enemies, but the most important thing is: Destructible scenarios. I've had lots of fun destroying everything and dropping bridges on the heads of the enemies. The magnetic gun may not be the best weapon (the firing ratio leaves it a bit behind of more powerful weapons), but tearing towers apart is certainly a refreshing experience.The story is standard, but the characters are better than in many other games. Overall, a game very well worth the money.			",748,184,19,65,52,12,82

												Comparing to Red Faction Guerrilla: The story is of Armageddon is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, beyond the obvious clichés of it's antecessor; the characters are dumb; you play in some underground/cave ambient all the time - forget that open world Mars; much less destruction; the enemies are boring and there's low variety; the game can be completed in 8 hours; there's no replayability; this game sucks, killed the franchise and you shouldn't buy it.

												You won't find this in any review but I very much thought this game was the peak of the series. It took them 4 games to create the engaging, visceral, destructive experience they were going for here and with the culmination of all of the lessons they have learnt, Violition has managed to create the most empowering third person shooter ever. Stasis in this game makes Isaac Clarke look like a noob, it not just stops enemies but drains their health and replenishes yours. The Mechs from F.E.A.R. were awesome? Nope, they cant quite charge through a wall, crush all the enemies in the way and cause the building they just went through to collapse. What's a gravity gun again? The Magnet gun is my favourite gun ever (along side the Portal Gun). This is the power-fantasy any crazy like me has been waiting for. Sniper shooting at you? Shoot a magnet at the base and another at the roof. The base flies upwards into the roof and the whole thing implodes and then collapses. Survive that! Boss fights consist of throwing the boss around the enviroment or pieces of the environment at them until they are impaled by debris and their body parts scatter with a gratifying splat. The campaign does get tedious towards the end though, with one long mission underground with no destructible environments and the story takes itself more seriously than I can. But Horde mode and a free form destroy everything 'Ruin Mode' provides some online fun. Valve better start working on Half Life 3 or everyone is just gonna rip off the old games and forget about them. R.I.P. Gravity Gun.			",127,10,0,7,6,0,2

												The linear level design is kind of a let down after the open world from Guerrila, but it would be ok if it contributed to the general experience. It does not. The aiming feels stiff, the enemies feel like sponges and the story... Is there.That being said, there are some weapons that are awesome to use and some of the levels look nice... Then they all become underground caves.Honestly? Buy Red Faction Guerrila, you'll have way more fun and last longer.			",136,23,1,14,4,0,12

												They added a magnet gun. You fire it at something, then fire it at something else and it pulls the first item to the second. You can magnet onto anything in the game, it's amazing. Boss battles are epic. You are dodging the boss while pulling down anything and everything on top of them. This is by far the best Red Faction game yet. They ditched the sandbox crap in favor of a pretty descent linear game that takes you through multiple environments. BUY THIS!			",323,57,2,68,39,1,73

												I played this right after finishing Red Faction Guerilla which might have been a mistake. Comparing it to Guerilla isn't a very good idea, but in my situation I can't help it.The graphics and weapons are much better/more interesting. The magnet gun is absolutely amazing.The problem I had was that all the time I just wanted to play Guerilla instead. It is absolutely not a open world game where you drive around with vehicles and terrorize the EDF. It's a linear third person shooter.If you're thinking about buying this I can only say this:If you played Red Faction Guerilla and are looking for more, you won't find it here.If you plan to play both, I suggest you play this first because in a direct comparison it will probably look a better to you. The story plays such a long time after Guerilla that it doesn't really matter.If you like linear, good shooters with very interesting mechanics like destruction, the magnet gun and repair spray/blasts which results in dynamic cover and physics based combat you will absolutely be happy with this game.

												 Armagedon actully feels more like an actual Red Faction game then Guerrilla since it's linear and majority of the game is underground (just like in Red Faction 1) but Guerrilla is much more fun and of course longer, Armagedon is only 6 hours long and because of it's linear design it lack alot of the fun aspects from Guerrilla.The game also has survival co-op mode ,it's  pretty good but sadly i wasn't able to enjoy it much since almost no one has the game on my friends list. The design of Armagedon  feels very old school, not many cutscenes and the levels actully give you a bit freedom to explore areas  unlike in most games nowaday, it also features a great variaty of weapons, from guns that shoot mini black holes to giant laser rifles which can burn an entire building down. All in all, it's a fun game but just to short and because of that it's only worth picking up if it drops to 5 Euros or lower.			",226,21,2,15,9,2,22

												(This review is just concerning the campaign and overall gameplay- not the multiplayer. I might also come back to edit this later)Honestly, this is a pretty mediocre game in my opinion. (Minor spoilers in second section)The presentation is good in places- though overall it lacks impact. Gameplay is linear; a 3rd person linear walk through dull and drab corridors. The color scheme is even more dull than Guerilla- having a lot of shades of gray and black. The art direction is awesome, and some of the designs are super, but all of the other aspects of the game, especially the color scheme, makes many of the designs unappealing. Some mechanics are cool, like the magnet gun, the nanoforge abilities + reconstructions, and using the mech (for the whole 2 or 3 times you can use it). The dynamic cover system from Guerilla is gone- though the havok engine is still there from Guerilla, which is cool. Aliens are there- but they are pretty meh. The third person camera sucks; it's so close to the character it becomes an eyesore less than halfway through the game- reducing awareness and reducing my interest in the game. Music is dull and is washed out- drowned in the incessant sounds of aliens, your own weaons, and the general cacaphony of overwhelming sound design. Horde mode is also there, which is an alright improvement. There are a few other modes- but the gameplay made me unintersted in playing these modes. The campaign is pretty cool though- fighting against crazy cultists is cool, and exploring the marauder cavern is cool. Fighting cultists in the storm was pretty cool. The bulk of the game is spent fighting aliens, but that is actually pretty dull- compared to the cultist sections. The main character is unappealing, and so are most of the other characters- their personalities being completely interchangable. Look, the point is: Buy Red Faction Guerilla. It's the same price, though it is more fun, and just overall more satisfying.Jeez dude, why do so many games insist on becoming dull and serious? Why can't we have nice things? Like another Red Faction Guerilla? ",314,46,4,48,11,2,20

												This is not a sandbox game like red faction guerrilla. This game is more linear but still really fun (using a mech suit and just crushing enemies or being creative with the magnet gun). The weapons and powers all feel great. Audio and visuals are also very good. The story is a bit predictable but still good (maybe a little short). The game also has a new game+ mode which adds replayability (getting all the weapons/powers/cheats).Conclusion: a very fun game that deserves my recommendation.			",68,9,0,10,4,0,11

												Admittedly the storyline and your missions dont really shine by diversity - basically you just have to shoot many, many aliens. But on your way you get hands on very cool vehicles like walkers, jets and tanks that are very fun to kill bugs with.Generally its more the number of miscellaneous weapons and cool abilities that grant you different ways to approach and so much fun.Also the destroy/repair feature was a big plus to me.It took me around 14h to complete both main and DLC campaigns and i usually take my time and explore everything. Therefore its not that much of playtime though the (online) survival mode offers another load of content.To sum it up the thin storyline didnt bother me much, so its a solid shooter with some creative mechanics i enjoyed a lot. In numbers 8/10.			",72,7,4,7,6,0,14

												I liked this Red Faction game the best other than the original Red Faction. The storyline integrates the original game's history and builds off of it to produce a compelling and interesting single player that kept me engaged all the way through the game. I liked the combat mechanics as well. In my view, this game was much better than Red Faction Guerrilla because in Guerrilla I always felt lost, and didn't really know what I was doing or for what reason. I also got the cartoony feeling of ""bam-bam"" because of all the destruction, especially with the hammer and super human strength. This game has that aspect too, but you are more guided and feel like you know what you are doing and why. That being said, Guerrilla was somewhat of a free-world-exploration game while Armageddon was more limited to the current path game. In Guerrilla, I had to force myself to engage the storyline while in Armageddon I was enthralled by the storyline and had a lot more fun with Armageddon. If you're looking for a game with a good storyline that is very smooth in terms of mechanics and gameplay to keep you entertained for a couple of hours, Armageddon is a good game to grab on sale.

												""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should.""No. this game. this. this. why.4 years ago i discovered a great but sadly underrated game called Red Faction: Guerilla.The story was good enough but what really defined it was the battlefield-like building destruction, physics and a really great open world experience. (Srsly, i spent loads of hours on that game, the gameplay is hella fun, i mean, causing open world mayhem with a sledgehammer and explosives, rekin enemy buildings with random A.I., destroying bridges, the vehicle controls, gore, great building physics etc. maaaaan.)Those 2 features really made that game one of my favorite pre-2010 games.a couple of years later, they announce a sequel to the game.i was more into the Assassin's Creed games at that time, but still, there was something in me that made me want to get it. (Yeah, the most exciting thing about it was the Nano thing, and i was expecting better physics)...in the end i ended up getting Assassin's Creed Revelations and totally forgot about buying this game :D...fast forward to Xmas sale 2013 where i completely remembered about this series and totally bought the sequel since it was 3 bucks...And man, what a waste of 3 bucks.I mean, i know that this game isnt famous for its stories butif you were going to focus on the story, it shouldve atleast been a decent one it was horrible ;n;andIT. ISNT. OPEN. WORLD.why would you remove the only thing that makes this game fun?i mean i know you guys sticked to how the first games worked butim pretty sure Guerilla was the game that stood out from the rest ;n;and you guys shouldve sticked with Guerilla, OPEN WORLD DESTRUCTION FESTi mean so many new elements but no open world to play it on ;n;its sad ;n;but yeah.i dont really like it, its not open world,i dont like the story, its pretty hassle to play it.its pretty repetitive and somewhat basic (idk)buuut yeah.maybe they need a cash cowsince they were near bankruptcy.THQ i mean.but yeaaah.idk. does this make sense? what makes sense? idk anymore. moo.welp, missed chances.

												I was doubtful when I acquired this game through a one-time offer for 4.99$. I'm a fan of shoot'em-ups and specially sci-fi-based ones, but the comments I could read about the game were a mix of ups and downs.Now having reached 50% of the main campaign, I must say that technically the game's a beast. Gorgeous DX11 graphics, detailed characters and surroundings, awesome effects and explosions, impressive physics engine. The bugs are so detailed they'll scare you at times. I can't raise a single complain in this respect.However the designers screwd it up in one point: the difficulty level. Even in the highest difficulty level it's ridiculously easy to finish most stages, which combined with the strictly linear structure of the game turn what could be an awesome experience into a routine job. Switching weapons makes no sense due to this, since any weapon will do the job. When things could get a bit tougher you always find an armored battle suit or other mechanized help around. Moving from stage to stage is then a question of time and unless things change a lot in the second part of the game I think you can easily finish it within 20h of gameplay.This said, I think for 4.99$ it's a good buy. I really enjoy blowing away bugs and cultists at the same rate, tearing stuff apart, and of course the magnet gun. I think I might try to run through the game a second time limiting myself to flesh&bone and using just the magnet gun to make it more of a challenge. ",22,0,0,0,1,0,7

												After beating the game on normal difficulty these are my conclusions:Pros:- nice graphics- nice (skippable) cinematics- weapon and vehicle variety (especially magnet gun and mallet)- special abilities- weapon and ability upgrades- environment destruction (and restoration)- pretty designed woman character :)- achievementsCons:- shallow and predictable storyline- meaningless dialogues- small variety of enemies- third person view- unsympathetic main character- linearity- achievements- the game crushes approx once in 2,5 hoursThis game is the fourth instalment of Red Faction series. I just played all of them for the first time and watched the movie in the last half a year. I was pretty amazed by the first one and was hoping the Armageddon would be like it with better graphics. But it wasn't! If you are younger or just this is the first game from the series you are going to play, you can end up with no interest in the series which would be a shame.I did not play a modern shooter in some years so I was pretty amazed by the graphics and cinematics (I just love the female character :)). The cinems are not disturbing and can be skipped. The linearity of the game is excessive. Places with different routes are common as rain on Sahara. It wouldn’t bother me so much if the environment variety would be higher. After 7 hours of play I was pretty bored and the idiotic main character was not helping. He is just a type of a superhero without a whit of intelligence. Just a stupid killing machine. I don't know how you, but I like a lot more first person shooters because you can feel much more immersed in the action. In difference with a sight on a mussle-idiot blocking my view.The weapons an abilities are good, maybe even the best things of the game not counting my beloved destruction :). For achievement hunters there are 58 achievs from which more than 60% can be done without trying on the first run but others are just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I am not interested in multiplayer and have no idea for now what the DLC is about, so no rating there.As a whole it is a pretty mediocre game and is not worth playing standalone and for the full price. Nothing spectacular here but a modern shooter with some fun guns and nice graphics. If you don't mind the old looks play the first Red Faction or the GTA styled Guerrilla destruction madness :).

												I do not know, previous part was nice and here there's nothing new, the same the best crush-smash sandbox. But i think it's better to kill all enemies first  and then play with all buidings, walls and other big breakable things... Yeah, if you want to crush this world... Go on, it's all in your hands(i mean magnetic-gravity gun in your hands;) ).			",148,9,2,3,7,3,4

												This series gets better with every iteration.  The incredible destruction mechanics from Guerilla are back, plus now you can reconstruct everything.  The open world elements in Guerilla are gone which is unfortunate, but in its place there is a superior, streamlined narrative.  Any FPS fan should try this one out			",188,27,1,41,11,0,34

												It's a solid 3rd-person shooter.Everything else about it is a concise encyclopedia of what NOT to do when writing and developing a game. The story is silly and contrived (and aliens in red faction is the worst thing), the writing is just outright bad (but it was written by syfy so what do you really expect), and the characters are all boilerplate and unlikable.Don't even pay $5 for it. It's not worth any money, really, unless you HAVE to have more Red Faction.			",278,52,7,60,26,2,59

												Taking inspiration from the mythos of many profound cultures, Red Faction: Armageddon uses the traditional ""wheel"" storytelling device as our hero ambles around mars for years until he returns to the source and brings enlightenment to his people. It is a triumph of moral thought and employs great use of cinematography and chiaroscuro lighting both in story and game. You have a gravity gun but it's bigger now and you can repair stuff, bringing peace and calm to the environment. There's 1 lady but she dies so it's okay. 9/10			",181,31,4,10,9,1,6

												Red Faction Armageddon looks great in DX11, and I had little to no performance issues whatsoever. I did however have audio problems (had to switch to stereo over surround) and occasionally at cutscenes the game would crash. Other than that this game is great. One downfall of this game is that it relies too heavily on drowning the player in aliens, making it near impossible to shoot everything. Luckily when playing on normal mode you're nearly indestructable, so the hordes you face aren't so daunting.This game has just the right amount of upgrades and the menus are simple and straightforward. When you beat the game you also unlock one of the most badass weapons possible, Mr. Toots.Overall I'd give this game an 8/10, the only bad part was the immense audio problems - maybe its not really worth 50$ though, so wait for a sale ;)			",650,141,15,51,36,6,102

												I've just finished playing this and wow. I bought this as a retail boxset of THQ games and this game is just fantastic. I haven't played any other Red Faction games, so I can't say how it fits with the story. But as an independent story its pretty neat - nothing too out of the ordinary however.The graphics are great, although you may become overwhelmed with particle effects at some of the more intense sections of the game. The voice acting and script are both convincing and help add a layer of immersion.The game handles fantastic - for those who played Saints Row The Third then RFA has exactly the same gun combat.There is a good variety of weapons including my favourite the magnet gun which allows you to kill the enemies using parts of the landscape. The repair tool that they give you also makes for an interesting gameplay mechanic requiring you to fix items in real time (difficult if you are faced with a few dozen enemies). You also get a selection of vehicles to use - which mixes things up.The only issues I have with this game is that it is quite short. It has the tendency to randomly quit the game for no reason. Enemies can spawn a few feet in front of you (not cool).			",275,49,22,36,23,4,28

												Few years ago, I bought myself a copy of Red Faction: Guerrilla, mainly because I liked the concept - GTA where instead of kicking everyone's butt all the time you pulverize everyone's property all the time. After I've finished it, I felt both happy and sad - happy because the money was worth the millions of dollars of property damage I've so carelessly caused, and sad because half of my play time was just trying to get from point A to point B to start a really short mission, aand after that spending the same time trying to get to the next mission. And honestly, that was sooo boring.So, after I've seen a review saying really nice things about this game, I couldn't resist and I spent yet another ten bucks on this game. And the first thing I realised was that this was GTA no more. No, the game presents us pretty linear, straight (but nice) levels. And the change is perfect. This game is swift, action-packed, and mostly much more hillarious. I don't remember a single moment from RF: Guerrilla that was somehow funny, which is something I like about games (being funny). And this game? At one particular joke, I fell off my chair, choking of laughter. No really, aside from a lot better gameplay, this game is so much fun to play that can't stop doing so.Verdict? 9,5/10, I just miss the freedom that I had in RF: Guerrilla (but then again, here the freedom was changed fo a lot better game, and a destruction-bringing Unicorn).

												The story is merely there to give the player a setting and a reason. The fun is in the seriously impressive amounts of damage the player can inflict on foes and the destructable environment. You didn't quite like the way you tore down that tower? Rebuild it and do it again. And again. And again. Then throw a chunk of a bridge at it and crush your foes in the crumbling debris. Point made. 9/10			",368,63,10,27,46,7,22

												This game was so much fun. A lot of action, a lot of shooting, a lot of blowing things up, and some reparing :P. Vehicle combat was so much fun as well and there was never a dull moment in this game. Unlike the previous one this one was more of a tight corner FPS. Still... The story was awesome and the DLC was also a lot of fun and anyone who likes shooting can really go for this game. 10/10.			",171,16,7,12,5,1,6

												Red Faction Armageddon is a game you may find yourself loving and hating both.  I like Volution games, ( have purchased all but Saints Row 1 , no pc port of it.  )  This is not my favorite but if you can catch it on sale and  have patience you  should have a lot of fun.  It is a challenge to finish it.  I did have the game crash on me about 7 times up to about half way through the game. Requiring a restart of the game, but after about mid game that stopped , no more crashes.  Catch it on sale is always good advice but I myself would wait for sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
