												Roboblitz has a lot of nice ideas. The ability to pick up, carry, and swing around objects is a unique mechanic, and you'll use it often and to great amusement throughout the game. Everything is affected by physics, which can lead some some really fun and dynamic gameplay.One of the most notable things that sets this game apart is the fact that each set of levels has its own distinct theme, and will have you performing wildly different objectives from the others; the result is that each feels like its own smaller game. This is a really interesting way of keeping things fresh throughout the adventure.Roboblitz also features great visuals, and good sound design. The game isn't necessarily without its flaws (some weird physics occasionally, a couple of the bosses are really difficult), but it's definitely worth playing through. Fun little game.I should note that, particularly in boss encounters, this game can present quite a number of bugs, which can lead to some very frustrating repetition.  If this isn't for you, you may want to stay away (or take advantage of some sneaky console commands to help you get past buggy bosses).			",802,239,27,63,64,8,118

												Heyyo, the frist Retail game to come out on the Unreal Engine 3, this is one fun action / puzzle game. It's not uber-graphics, but the physics and sound effects are fantastic. :)			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

												I just bought this game only to write a review on Steam. I finished it years ago and I still remember how fun, addicting and joyful experience it was. A game full of humor, action, and puzzle solving. If there only were achievements... I would have got 'em all for sure!I remember I cried when I finished it. Just don't remember was that because of fun or drama... You know what, I gonna replay this gem title once again just to find that out.Ten stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a terrible game. Decent puzzle mechanics. Bugs kill the game though. Fighting the same boss a couple dozen times because it won't properly follow its script or getting stuck in a wall for some reason. If you pick up an object at the wrong angle, you literally move at a snail's pace. Recommend only if part of an indie bundle.			",332,96,9,61,49,2,104

												Ok, I will not lie, this game IS short, very very short, but its mechanics are very nice, and even not being long and hard it can give you tons of fun, about 5 Hours of gameplay only, what is pretty sad =/, but even those 5 hours are very enjoyable, also, it comes with a level editor what makes it even more enjoyable, I dont know if you can download and play user made levels but you probrably can.Even with all the bad aspects such as short and kinda easy I certainly recommend that game. =)			",278,73,3,7,8,2,19

												Hello ppls!!I am Ronzzon and I'm here to write a review that you might want to read.I am a very old (not in age but in experience) and experienced played of this game, I've played this game more times than anyone can imagine. Now I got a little story to tell you.StoryI was away from my country to visit a few friends of mine that lived in Ukraine. While exploring some of the Ukrainian shops I found a game named Roboblitz. I was very interested in this game, and so I bought it, went to my apartment and started playing. It was the first game that gave me an unbelievible amount of stress and strugle to play the game, this game was very hard as I was a begginer. After a few 10 to 20 times playing the game, I then was able to master it! Now note that this game was abought in Ukraine so everything in it was in russian, no english no nothing no Steam.While playing the game I had lots of questions about it. I had found strange things happen in boss levels, but they were very fun to watch. I really liked the mechanics of this game.Pros:- Good Graphics- Good Puzzles- Fun Boss Glitches- Great Upgrade Mechanics- Long Gameplay- Level Editor (can be used if you're an experienced person with the kind of modeling software they use)- Language SelectorCons:- Very hard for begginers- Very easy for prosFAQQuestionIn one of the boss levels, when I try to hit NOED with the stun rod and he gets hit, just when I get to attack him he gets up straight away. Is this a bug?AnswerThere is a chance for him to get up straight away after he falls, and if you had hit him with the stun rod and he gets back up straight away, then you need to get a better hit on him.QuestionThere are a few boss glitches in almost each lvl, why isn't this in your list of cons?AnswerI had lots of fun watching the glitches happen so I don't have any negatives about that.QuestionThe game says that there is a dash, when I attempt to dash it doesn't work. Help pls?AnswerThat took me a while to fiqure out, it seems that you have to tap in the same direction very fast, not just ordinary ""fast"". Try being Sanic and double tap as fast as you can. Basicly try spamming.QuestionI'm bored with the ordinary attacks and abilities. Got any tips to make combat more fun?AnswerYes yes, there are loads of attack combos that can be mastered.1. Pick a weapon, equip the super high double jump upgrade, then double jump press Q to spin, and while spinning in slowly in mid air, try spamming the Q button to spin and hold attack, this is a very awesome combo.2. Use the surrounding objects that you can pick up. Remember that sticky gun? Where you shoot a glowy orb at anything then it floats? Use it on one of the sides of the long crate, then grab hold on the other end, then volia! Spin around while holding it and all that, very good long ranged weapon.3. Try using that magnet thingy that magnets you to areas that you shoot it at, use it and swing as Tarzan while shooting from the air.Final QuestionThe level where I have to go to the top of the tower to where is the Antena is very high. I just fell down and now I don't know what to do and the pathway back up is too long. Got any ideas? Final AnswerUsing that ""magnet"" thingy that I mentioned earlier in this review. Use it to climb your way back to the top, or maybe even higher!K. Sorry for such a long review, this is my fav game after all! 10/Potato 2016 would play again. Recommended, BUY IT!!!

												This was the game that made me wish we could post negative reviews on Steam instead of just positive ones.  Well, now I can!I enjoyed this at first, as it did take me back to the earlier days of 3D puzzle platforming.  The freedom to sort of hop anywhere without hitting invisible walls and just play around a little bit is nice.  The levels are fairly well made.  You get a decent array of tools that allowed for some ingenuitive thinking.  However, once you reach the boss fights, this is all for nothing.The boss fight are an absolute mess.  They don't work.  They really don't work.  Try as you might, the boss encounters are bugged in numerous ways that will make it horribly frustrating if not outright impossible to win.  Not because the fights are so hard or challenging.  The fights themselves are just faulty in design and don't work the way they were intended.  I made a thread on the Steam forum talking about how wretched are, so feel free to go check that out if you're curious as to how broken the boss fights really are.I actually emailed the development studio about this, suggesting they patch it.  The response I received was this, ""unfortunately we're far past the point of being able to update the game[.]""  This person is a damn liar.  Roboblitz is self-published for computers.  This is an actual case of the developer just not giving a crap about fixing their messed up game.  Do not even consider buying Roboblitz unless Naked Sky Entertainment actually decides to patch these horrible boss encounters to make them work.  Should they ever do so, I will gladly re-evauluate the game and revise this review.			",379,67,2,18,8,1,17

												TLDR: DO NOT GET THIS GAME ON PC. GET IT ON THE Xbox360 INSTEAD BECAUSE THE PC PORT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO FINISH BECAUSE OF THE BOSS FIGHTS THAT DON'T WORK.This was the first game I'd ever bought on XBLA as a kid, and it's still one of my all-time favs. As soon as I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it, and I was VERY dissapointed with the PC port.Here's the good things about the PC port.-Make your own levels-Play the game with headphones (And be amazed by the fantastic soundtrack)-Turn up the graphics to the max which makes the game look better than on the Xbox360-Play the game with a MUCH higher framerate so the controls feel much tighter and more responsiveBut, then there's all the problems with the PC port. (These problems are not on the XBLA edition which I recommend you get instead)-Dashing doesn't work quite right.-Buggy boss fights. Here's some examples of them:One boss got stuck and I had to nudge him out in order for him to get to where he needed to go in order for the final stage of the fight to start.Another boss isn't even possible to finish (And therefor making the game impossible to finish) You're supposed to get it to charge at you and smash into the gears you're standing above, but it doesn't charge, it just slowly hovers towards you instead, meaning that it doesn't get the impact on the gears needed to finish that stage of the boss fight.The rest of the bosses are just as frustratingly buggy making the boss fights completely unplayable.0/5 - Impossible to finish. Get it on XBLA for the Xbox360 instead			",188,29,3,10,9,0,8

												Quick review:Short Verdict: This game is an action-puzzle platformer where you control a robot trying to ready a cannon at a space station. While potentially good, this game has so many problems and bugs (random crashes included) that I just can't recommend it. I wouldn't even recommend you play it even if you already have it. Unless you somehow enjoy getting frustrated.Pros: Cute robotic/tech graphics Nice BGM A lot of nice ideas and unique concepts (that fall short) Exploring for upgrade points adds fun and replay value to the stages Nice in-game hint system if you don't know what to do Different tools and weapons for you to use in different situationsCons: Very clumsy controls I couldn't play it with a controller because it exchanged the right X axis for the Y axis (in other words, moving the stick up would turn the camera left and tilting it right would make the camera go up) It made me downgrade PhysX in order to play The game crashes from time to time without warning Boring action/shooting part Puzzles are way too easy The stuff you're carrying often gets stuck on walls or on the floor A lot of other bugs, like a shuttle door not opening when enemies try to force their way out Poor upgrade system with very little information The boss battle I tried didn't work as should (it should break grates, but didn't), even after watching a video and reading the in-game hints to make sure I was doing the right thing Health bar is really hard to see in the heat of battleBought on / for: Monday Bundle 30 by Indie Gala Weekly for and average of US$ 0.34 (R$ 0,85). And that's about US$ 0.34 more than what I'd pay for it.Similar games: None that I remember right now. Please, tell me if you have any suggestions, because I'd really like to play a conceptually similar game that's actually playable.			",2593,1146,60,256,279,22,324

												RoboBlitz started off being a pretty cute puzzle based game with occasional shooter elements, then it flipped 180 into a crazed action frenzy challenged by 6 different enemy NOEDs. They didn't bother to make them easy to kill, nor did they make it obvious how to go about killing them. Beyond that subtle difficulty, the game holds interest with its basic story, handful of weapons, lasers, a spin move, barrel throws, tractor beam, levitation gun, and a few additional power ups. The game play is very consistent making it a tolerable game, but nothing stood out that would make me recommend buying it.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114
