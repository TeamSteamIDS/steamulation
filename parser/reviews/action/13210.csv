												The best multiplayer shooter I've ever played. There are hundreds of things to learn. The game is divided into different game modes (like Warfare, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel, Capture The Flag, Vehicle Capture The Flag, ...), and the community is constantly creating new mutators and new maps, so it never gets boring.UT3 is a very fast paced thrilling game and you have special movements like dodging and wall dodging which are hard to master but it makes you moving even quicker and much harder to hit. It doesn't matter how tired you are before the game: As soon you're in the game you feel like on adrenaline with eyes wide open and an alert mind. You will hardly experience a boring moment. So if you are looking for a comfy boring game to call it a day and make yourself ready for sleep --- then you are completely wrong with UT3. In the first few weeks UT3 felt kind of ridiculous fast. However, after a while my brain adapted and I got used to it. Since then, whenever I try to play another shooter  the new shooter feels slow like sneaking and without dodge and wall dodge movement like beeing an immobile target.In other words: It takes you a while to get accustomed with UT3. But once you mastered it you are like edicted and it's hard to go back playing other shooters.I've played it more than 10.000 hours, first without Steam, now with Steam, still playing almost every dayPlease recommend my review if it gave you an impression of the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't played Unreal Tournament, just get the game straight away. If you've played the older versions, check out my observations:Pros:- Very balanced vehicles. Now manta is not immortal and scorpion and hellbender are formidable rather than useless.- Hoverboards. Being able to get a speed boost is one of the greatest additions to UT.- Orbs for Warfare (Onslaught). These allow lots of strategic defense/offense in Warfare.- Characters move with more gravity. I know this is subjective, but honestly I prefer the feel of the UT3 controls to the previous ones.Cons:- Campaign story is not really finished.- No Assault.TLDR: If this had Assault, it would be the best UT game out there. As it is, it is still awesome and worth playing!PS: I played the game for a year before activating it on steam too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This....This is.... The only game I can compare to the HL universe. I own UT1999 GOTY, UT2004 on discs. UT3 was also on disc but I registered it on Steam...Now on the actual game:Graphics: 9/10For 2008 these graphics are perfect so Epic did their job very well on this part:I take 1 point away because it was really hard to run the game on max settings in 2008...Gameplay: 10/10It doesnt matter if you are against bots, doing the campaign, playing multiplayer. Its perfect. Action is everywhere!Soundtrack: 10/10 Ive always loved to listen the soundtrack of the Unreal Tournament games. The fit perfectly for the maps.Map Design: 69/10 OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! ♥♥♥♥♥ please! We are talking about EPIC here.+ You can easily learn to map. Learn in 30 minutes. Start creating maps like a fokken machine!Overall: 10/10I really cant hate on this game. Dont look on my Steam hour plays. Before Steam I have hundreds of hours on this one.On UT2004 I am even sure I have thousands....*nostalgia attack*There is still lovely comunity to play with multiplayer so I definitely recomend THIS EPICness.

												After putting over 100 hours on UT3, I still like UT2K4 more, but I do feel it has one thing going for it. That's the Vehicle Capture-The-Flag gamemode. It is the perfect combination of teamwork and individual skill. There needs to be someone who can snatch the enemies flag and move it effectively while being gimped (Flag carriers cannot use vehicles). The rest of the team needs to simultaneously support the carrier as well as protect their own flag.All of this is made more complex by a diverse array of vehicles and this is further complicated by the fact that one team may not have the same vehicles available to them as the opposition. And somehow the game maintains balance! It is an incredible feat of game and map design.This game has other merits worth mentioning. It's still gorgeous after all this time. Soundtrack lives up to the brand. The Godlike AI is still intelligent as hell (aggravatingly so on vanillla CTF).Definitely worth your money and the time your minced bits will layer the walls like a grisly fresco.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it's not as accessible or as popular as its predecessors, UT3 is still a fun arena shooter with loads of colorful characters and maps to go around. The campaign has an actual story rather than being just another single-player tournament, although for the most part it's just multiplayer with humans against computer-controlled characters once again. Still, all the weapons and gamemodes you know and love are there (except for Assault, which is disappointing).Good luck finding a active server, though; everyone else has already flocked off to play the upcoming UT alpha (which I recommend you try out, by the way), and what's left of the game's community has less life than a Necris assassin.

												Before Battlefield and CoD there was Unreal and there was Quake. I've always been an ""Unreal is better than Quake"" sort of gamer and this iteration of UT is a strong example of why.The core deathmatch gameplay is refined to near perfection, lots of game modes, with great weapons, vehicles and maps. Some achievements are challenging, but all can be attained by a dedicated player with several helpful guides available online. I played primarily against the AI Bots, which offer a decent enough challenge to make this a viable single player game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Originally posted on August 21, 2009 Unreal Tournament 3 was an easy purchase after the incredible UT2004, at least for me. It promised more of the same awesome gameplay with a brand new engine that looks gorgeous. For the most part, UT3 lives up to the brand name, despite some minor quibbles.Visually speaking, the game is phenomenal, with an engine that may not be so new as of 2009, but still looks absolutely great. it really shines in UT3's very meticulously crafted beautiful maps, which is where you can see the full potential of the engine. The lighting and particle effects especially are very pretty, from and artistic standpoint, and they stay true to UT's unique art design and feel. I have no complaints on this front.The sound effects in the game are for the most part quite good, with the timeless beacons of success like ""monster kill!"" and ""dominating!"" making a glorious return. The macho voice acting is of course completely over the top, but this is really to be expected, and as far as I'm concerned, it comes with the territory.The gameplay is good, for the most part. DM, TDM, CTF, and every combination of vehicles in battlefield style flag capping and vehicle CTF make an appearance, along with a few more bizarre game modes, and of course good old fashioned duel. There are a plethora of maps, character models, and mutators to suit your particular fancy, and the weapons look, sound, and feel really satisfying and true to the series, with the rocket launcher and flak cannon making particularly gruesome returns. Puzzling, however, is the lack of objective based attack and defend game modes like in UT2004, which saw sides attacking objectives and progressing ultimately towards a final target with a time limit, and then teams would switch sides and try to do better. But wait, you say, UT3 has exactly that in the form of warfare. This is technically true, but UT2004 had some very map specific objectives in very creative scenarios that as far as I can tell are missing from UT3. Where is the space station assault mission? or the tram attack? Oh well, minor quibbles, all in all the gameplay is quite good.As far as bang for your buck, UT3 is quite impressive, with 40 plus hours of gameplay at least, and theoretically much more. While the campaign isn't to interesting, these games have never been about single player, although the bots are quite adept if you choose that route. With the new Titan pack and the possibility of more free content, UT3 will last me a for a long time to come.I can heartily recommend it as a purchase well worth the investment to any fan of shooters, especially those from an older generation, or previous fans of the series.

-Quick Review-Unreal Tournament 3 is a First person shooter developed by Epic Games, Inc. and released in 2007. I'm not sure what else I should include in my Quick Review Section... There's tons of content, the single player is pretty solid, there are still plenty of servers with small clusters of people playing multi-player, and getting Co-Op to work over steam was a pain in the butt (we used Hamachi).-Detailed breakdown review-Just a heads up:This is the first Unreal Tournament Game I've ever played. Once I beat the game, and then re watched all the cutsenes I realized I had NO idea why the game was called ""Unreal Tournament"". There was no Tournament, there wasn't anything unreal about it, unless we're talking about respawning...For those in the dark about it, earlier Unreal Tournament games actually did take place in a tournament. The ""Unreal"" part of the name is probably because the whole Unreal franchise uses the Unreal Game Engine.Oh wait, I get it, the main driving feature for this game is area-shooting (I normally think of the Campaign as the primary selling factor), so there we go, mystery solved while writing this review. I feel silly.


Footage from a cut-scene in Unreal Tournament 3. 
A Screenshot of Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition
By: Atratzu




Story: There are 5 factions in Unreal Tournament 3: Iron Guard (mercenaries), The Ronin (which is the faction you are part of in the story, you may play as the others in multiplayer though. The Ronin are survivors from a Krall attack), The Krall (I like to think of them as Orcs and Orgres, so naturally I would prefer to be playing as them), The Liandri (Basically Robots), and lastly the Necris (sounds like Necromancer? Basically they're the Borg, or undead. They're pretty Metal.)In all honesty I barely noticed the difference between Humanoids and factions, Red is Dead in my book. The most distinct Faction was the Krall, and I don't feel like I really fought against them all that much. (which is odd... seeing as they massacred the Ronin's Village...?)The story is made up of 5 Acts, each Act starts out with a Cut scene, and before you jump into a mission you're given a short description or background for why you're attacking and what your mission is.Oh, by the way the protagonist's name is ""Reaper"", whom is not nearly as Edge lord as we're used to from Overwatch, but as far as deep voiced rough protagonists go, he's pretty standard.Incase this is spoiler territory for people:Act 1) The Ronin's Village is sacked by the Krall, the Ronin hook up with the Iron Guard and they all go to war against the Axon. Wait, who are the Axon? I'm glad you asked, they're apparently not an offical faction, they're the primary vehicle developers and the Iron Guards leader ""Malcolm"" is an idiot (actually he's an opportunist, but the game paints him as a fool)Act 2, 3, and 4 just kind of blurr together as ""more the same"" Act 5 is when stuff gets serious and the Ronin are like ""Screw this, we're going to go fight the Necris Lady who attacked our village our self"". And I won't risk saying anything more in detail on that, because THAT would be way more spoilery then I do.All-in-all, the campaign felt like playing a bunch of different online pvp games but with bots, all strung together with dialogue before playing the mission and every 10 missions a cut scene.Gameplay: The Gameplay is where Unreal tournament 3: Black Edition Shines! First... The core of every FPS: Which kinds of guns do you get?1) A hammer gun you will probably never use again, 2) a pistol you only use if you're out of ammo or respawned, 3) a poison bio weapon which leaves green death bubles on the ground walls and ceiling, 4) a Laser rifle which I don't think has a distance limit, 5) Your standard ""rifle"" type gun, it fires a lot of little energy bullets at a typical rate (visible and dodge-able however!), 6) Good 'ol Gatling gun, 7) Shot gun, careful with this one kids, the bullets ricochet and I have killed myself with it more times then I'd care to admit, 8) Rocket Launcher (it's death. highest damage, moderate speed rockets, splash damage, or nail 'em in the rib cage to watch 'em explode), 9) Sniper rifle.There are a number of special weapons you can pick up and find, and in multiplayer games they may even mod the weapons to behave differently, but generally speaking the aforementioned guns are your standard staple in the campaign.I should also mention that some weapons have an alternative shot by clicking the right mouse button, the one that sticks out in my mind is the rocket launcher will charge up 3 rockets and fire them at once, and the shot gun fires a round shot which explodes into tons of smaller shots.)Next Vehicles... I'm not going to list them, but there are a lot of them, each has a pretty unique feel to it, getting used to controlling them takes some time, especially Necris vehicles (Two vehicle manufacturers: Axon, and Necris)There are 3 options on the main menu if you want to jump into the game. Campaign, Instant Action, and Multiplayer. Campaign is for the ""story"", Instant Action is for offline play, and Multiplayer is for online play.


Pro-tip to anyone starting: The + in the bottom right is your health, the object on the ground is a health kit. - I wish I had known earlier

Health pickups, power ups, Armor, jump boosters, and more!Game types: Deathmatch (Free for all), Team Death match (Industry Standard), Capture the Flag (Same as when we were kids, only with guns), Vehicle CTF (Same as normal CTF except you can run your friends over), Warfare (A long game of capture the control point, ended by blowing up the core in the enemy's base), Greed (Kill people, pick up skulls, try to reach it to the enemy spawn room to score), Betrayal (really really REALLY weird, you kill enemies until you're assigned to a team, then you right click to fire off a blue shot which will kill people on your team, then you hide and you keep your score), Duel (1v1 me bro).


I joined this server which played ""I Believe In Father Christmas"" by Greg Lake on loop. Very festive, until the 10th loop. haha

There are a total of 60 maps... SIXTY! That's crazy.Conclusion: I must be getting long winded in my old age, I didn't think I had this much to say about Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition. I had a lot of fun playing it, I don't think I'll be sticking around with it much longer though... the achievements are a bit too tedious for my tastes and there are other games to review!Someday down the line I might come back to this game, but as far as FPS's Go, this one is pretty good. You could definitely sink a fair amount of time into the game if you're looking to experience the whole game.The fact that there are still a lot of servers up is a good sign. (At least there was a whole page of them around 1900 CST, with most of them having people in them!)Thank you for taking the time to read my review, Atratzu signing off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is.... just AMAZING.Back In time when I was umm a kid I didn't care about the campaign since I only wanted to play and kill and blow up enemies and etc now I played the campaign and I really like it. The graphics are just amazing since it shows you the sweet beauty of Unreal Engine so what're you waiting? If you're a fan from unreal's series like me you must get this game and If you don't give it a try its worth the money(?(Really Thanks to SlipSlot for giving me this game for my B-day love you man)PS: Sorry for my bad englando			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game made me go back 10 years ago, I had a Pentium 4 at that time, Barely was able to handle the game because I had a really bad GPU at that time, But it was enough to make this game playable for me, So many memories in such small simple game, For its age the graphics are stunning and even better than some of the more new generation games like Call of Duty, Personally I didn't buy the game back then (I was a stincky pirate) But it gave me such a good feeling seeing this game on steam, That I just had to buy itIts always refreshing to play this classicMemories\10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Unreal Anthology was the first PC game pack I picked up as a kid. This game is the next installment and it came along when I was a young teen. I couldn't be more happy about it! The graphics and gameplay still hold up today in 2015.The online multiplayer still has matches on it to this day, you just have to be patient and search.The game itself is gold.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament 3 is another great UT game. Graphics and sounds are amazing as always, gameplay is quick and engaging, there are a lot of interesting and varied weapons, vehicles and maps. However, when compared to the older games in the series it doesn't seem to be the best. When it comes to Warfare/Onslaught (same mode, differently called in UT3 and UT2004), then UT2004 seems to be the best as the gameplay is better thought-through and generally maps seem to be better too. It also feels like the developers went too far with vehicles in this mode in UT3, and in consequence there is just too many kinds of them where some don't even seem very useful. When it comes to Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag, then the first Unreal Tournament still remains the best up to this day, in my opinion. It has the most solid gameplay in DM/TDM/CtF and no other game in the series ever came close to it. Do I recommend UT3? Sure, it's a great game in itself, however, even more I would recommend the first UT or UT2004 (depending on what game modes you want to play). Still, even if you own the older games in the series you still might want to get UT3 on a sale just to check it out, at least to play on some different maps than you usually do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is like the dumbed down version of Unreal Tournament 2004. Improved graphics, but less game modes, less weapons, less everything. It's more of a tech demo than a proper game, but it's cheap as chips to purchase so it's not the worst deal out there, it just should've been much more.Full video review:

												I bought a boxed copy of this game from Amazon on the day it was released around 9 years ago. Since then I've played literally thousands of hours of UT3 and have just over 4 million kills to my name. For sure there are better UT players than me out there, but few have as much experience.In many ways UT3 was and is the purest on-line 'traditional' (i.e. not a military game like Battlefield or ARMA) FPS experience ever brought to the PC. The graphics, sound and general game play still look good today and hold up relatively well against the likes of the recently released Doom and other such games.UT3 features a decent number of game modes, a good pile of maps and all your favourite staple Unreal weapons, some of which date all the way back to the original Unreal circa 1998. All in all plenty of content to play with. All that being said I find it difficult to recommend this game. Why? Since GameSpy closed their doors the on-line community has collapsed and it's now nearly impossible to find and take part in anything other than LAN games.The second issue is that due to the age of the game, the nearly limitless number of mods, maps and mutators that were common and easily available for UT3 are now becoming very difficult to find as various hosting sites have long since gone off-line.I'd absolutely recommend this game for solo play as the AI is decent and there's even a passable single player campaign. If however you purchase UT3 thinking you'll easily be able to jump in to on-line games you'll be in for an unpleasant shock as this has now become nearly impossible.So a guarded recommendation. If you enjoyed past UT games and somehow missed out on UT3, or if you had a non-steam version and want to add it to your collection then I'd unhesitatingly recommend it as it's so much fun. As a pure on-line experience (there really isn't one any more) it's difficult to recommend by now.For anyone who doesn't know, there is now a free to play UT4 available directly from Epic Games, though personally I dislike it intensely as they've completely borked the weapons balance, but that's another discussion for another time...

												This game is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made (besides UT2004 of course). UT3 is very fast paced compared to other first person shooters. Players have the ability to dodge and wall dodge in order to move even more faster & to avoid being hit by enemies. Players don't have to worry about reloading their weapon either. Some servers may require you to pick up more ammo or weapons & some just have an unlimited ammo supply, but there is no need for hitting a reload key like in other first person shooters.Servers & mods- Different servers have a variety of mods and maps. If mods aren't your thing you can join one of the official servers and play there instead. I personally love the mods though since it makes the experience more worthwhile with better weapons & being able to level up weapon damage and health. Game type- I appreciate Greed which makes UT3 different from other Unreal games in a way. It may be said that Greed is similar to Bombing Run due to the ""hoop"" that one has to go through in order to score but they obviously aren't the exact same. In Greed, there are two teams (red and blue), the objective is to capture as many skulls as possible by killing enemies and score them at the enemy base. Even though not many people play anymore this will still be one of my favorites and I will keep going back to it just for fun. I really can't stop playing because it brings back good memories with my old clan members and the game nights we use to have every few weekends. Some of the best people I ever met were from UT! (My time in game on here isn't even close to how much time I've actually played since I used the CD version for years before the steam version.) I've been playing the Unreal series since 2004.

												This game was my chillhood (2010-2016). On January 2010 I got it for my birthday from my classmate and I was so happy to have it. Before this game I played UT2004 or UT1999, another two awesome games. When I first saw trailer in 2008 I was so shocked how this game was improved and the new dark side added Necris, also the Necris Darkwalker reminded me of that machine from War Of The Worlds 2005 called Tripod, it was similiar but not the same and it was and it still is my favorite first vehicle from UT3. I had so much cheats, mods, mutators, maps... even I think I had more than 6,000 hours on it. But one day I lost my CD/DVD which was UT3 on. So after half of year later I found it here on Steam. And I instantly bought Unreal Deal Pack with all UT games on it. Even now its like old times when I first started to play it. I play it today too but not quite a lot since I found new games which are better but I heard that a new Unreal Tournament is in development and I think you can play since its still early alpha game on Epic Games site but in the future it will evolve making it the best Unreal Tournament ever created :)If you played UT2004 or Ut1999 then you must have UT3 right now, if you have it then nice :D ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun first person shooter. Lots of weapons, vehicles, gametypes, and maps will keep you busy for a long time.Unfortunately, as the game came out in 2007 there isn't much of a multiplayer community left.The single player game pits you against bots. One of the main complaints about previous Unreal Tournament games is that there was basically no story or plot. So this time the developers came up with a plot complete with flashy cutscenes about how the Necris destroyed your colony and you're out for revenge. Some of it was a bit contrived -- Capture the Flag in a warzone? Yep, they have a technobabble explanation for it! But overall the addition of a storyline was appreciated and helped to elevate this game's single player mode over its predecessors.My main complaint about the bots is they have trouble with vehicle pathfinding sometimes. You'll see them stuck in traffic jams from time to time.And there's one mission in particular I should warn you about.  At the end of Chapter 2 there's a mission where the enemy team has a bunch of vehicles but you only have one. The catch is that one vehicle is a Leviathon, the most powerful vehicle in the game. The obvious idea is that you take the Leviathon and wreck the other team's vehicles.The execution of that idea fails because your bot teammates will hop into the Leviathon, which is the hardest to drive out of all the vehicles, and immediately get stuck inside your base. So not only do you not have your super vehicle, you don't have most of your team either, making this mission by far the hardest in the game (and it happens fairly early in the game too). I was eventually able to beat it by using my best card, which is like pre-mission buff you can earn.The game may have come out in 2007 but the graphics are still good by the standards of 2016. The music was unobtrusive and mostly forgettable.The gunplay is fantastic. The various mutators you can use with the maps add a lot of fun. For example, there's a ""Titan"" mutator that can make your character grow to the size of a giant if you're successful. This gives you extra health and firepower, but slows down your speed and possibly restricts you to certain areas of the map.In my opinion, this is the best game out of the Unreal Tournament series. If you like first person shooters you'll like Unreal Tournament 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a person like myself who prefers to only play your games in singleplayer mode but have always wanted a honest multiplayer experience then look no further you have found the perfect game.1.Everybot on the team is in it for themselves2.Everytime they die they have a rage fit3.Your own bot team mocks you4.The enemy bot team mocks you5.The bots state how great they are then they die from not paying attention6.When teamwork is required you can give them orders all you want they wont listen and they will blame you for their loss7.Everytime you depend on a bot team member they will always be the first one shot8.Your team members find it more entertaining to ride vehicles then providing you covering fire9.They dont know the concept of ""useful"" reinforcements10.If you turn on friendly fire your own team will start a civil war11.Somehow the other team knows how to systematically win on every warfare map (sometimes)12.The bots will state that my number 11. tip is your fault XD13.Apparently every bot on your team breaks their leg no matter what kind of death/injury it isSeriously this game is great and incredibly comical fun and a almost unbelivable multiplayer feeling the only thing its missing is recorded audio files of people cussing at you in russian and young kids saying that they have sexual entercourse with your mother and you wouldnt even know your playing singleplayer10/10 Will scream at my uncooperative team of virtual bots again for not following my pro orders			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UT3 is a brilliant game with plenty of reply value. The variety of game options and maps can be tailored to your pleasure. The Unreal graphics engine is reliable for smooth gameplay and crisp graphics. The game has a great selection of weapons and vehicles are available at your disposal. The main single player campaign may be overshadowed by the Multiplayer or Singleplayer w/bots as it can be considered more competitive. There are plenty of difficulty modes and the A.I is exceptionally challenging on the higher modes.

												What a blast! Excellent fun.I played UT2004 a lot back in the day and this is a decent modern overhaul of UT overall even though the combat system is a bit clunkier. Some great new vehicles and map ideas. This game deserves to be a lot more supported than it is. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having been immensly dissapointed with the DOOM Open Beta, I felt the need to quench my arena shooter thirst, and good God did I pick the right game to do so. Unreal Torny 3 has some SERIOUSLY jaw dropping visuals, that have aged AMAZINGLY. On top of that, it's fast paced, well balanced gameplay, with TONS of fantastic weapons and pickups, make this one of the best multiplayer shooting values ever. The number of maps, weapons, options, modifers, and user mods kinda took me aback. Modern titles would NEVER provide this much gameplay variation without the ol ""DLC"" train blowing its horn. One of my favorite part of ANY Unreal game is the announcer, and he delivers! The Unreal announcer is bigger and better than ever, with lines like ""headshot"" still getting me AMPED the hell up to this day.To be honest, $20 is a bit steep for a game this old, but it's honestly worth EVERY penny! Get some friends on board, and get ready for an ABSOLUTE blast!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably one of the best games I have ever purchased, on any platform, ever. I'm a die-hard UT fan from the original (1999) and this one knocks it out of the park for me.I can't claim to fully understand all of the game as of yet, I'm only getting into the campaigns, but from what I can tell, it's a winner all around. The graphics are very nicely done, it's super fast (in UT fashion, of course, UT has always been fast), the audio is great.This game may be several years old and lots of other games have a bigger following than this, but you can't go wrong with this one. Especially if you have ever enjoyed a UT game in the past. Two huge thumbs up here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game still holds its own after all this time.Lightning fast gameplay, modest system resource requirements and not-so-bad graphics with a decent arsenal of weaponry makes for a fairly fun game. Steam achievements are available (obviously) for those whom value the service and pretty good community support adds up to a fairly justifiable $5 purchase.Ultimately, it's fun and that's enough when you want an FPS arena kill joy fix because puzzles and racers have knawed your brains to fray.

												The problem with this game is that the game is good, and it's just dead. It has an amazing engine, awesome gameplay, I came from having 2k+ hours in UT99 messed around with 2k3, 2k4 a little bit but all and all this game felt more like the original in the short time I've played it. The community however is dead, it's literally like 20 people spread out over 10k servers at peak hours. Which is crazy considering this is so much better than 2k4 on basically every single level. The perfect example of a game that should have got more love than it did but just didn't. What's worse now is that the creators are going to aim for more of a 2k4 experience  with UT4 when they should be aiming for more of a UT3 experience because they actually got it right. The player base is just clearly mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not switching over to the blatantly superior game. I don't even know weather or not to recommend this game because it's actually an amazing game, or to not recommend it because of it's sheer lack of players. Game is dead, but it's amazing.

												As a massive fan of the unreal franchise I found this to be a great sequel. Still never beats the classics but the graphics and weapons are amazing! the different characters designs are also pretty awesome. It reminds me a lot of ut2004 in the gameplay and weapon designs are very similar. One thing I miss from the original 1999 or GOTY edition is the addition to customize the bots to your content. But the bots are a lot more detailed. So far I've only been playing insant action so I'm not 100% sure about the campaign. However, for someone like myself who prefers to get straight into the gameplay I would reccomend instant action. This game is pretty cheap for the graphics and details. I would reccomend this to anyone that likes sci-fi fps's and some amazing maps. Also Vehicle CTF is pretty cool too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came to UT3 after being a big fan of the original, 16-year old UT. Never really played UT 2003/2004 aside from the demos which I didn't really like.Let's face it, UT3 is fun. It keeps the feel of the original UT but with a boatload of fun new stuff, such as vehicle combat which I don't really do very much, but I might in the future. And they remade some of my old favorite maps, which is another large plus.Another thing that's nice about this is that my mediocre GT440 video card and 1 gig of RAM seem to run it at a perfectly playable 30+ FPS at high settings, so you get nice graphics on a relatively low end setup.7/10 because I miss the original Facing Worlds. I'm sure there's a mod for that though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played this to death, and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in a futuristic FPS in single-player mode. My favourite experience was shooting someone in the air with a rocket while I was jumping under a bridge, and then having their giblets fall around me on either side of the bridge. Can't do that in Counterstrike!Sadly, setting up multiplayer is hard and buggy, the gameplay is amateurish (as in, not tuned for competitive play), the story is almost non-existent, and the game was never a community success, so it's mostly playing against bots.

												UT3 by Epic Games is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eigth Unreal game. It runs on their Unreal 3 engine (hence the name) and it looks stunning. The gameplay is tight, the graphics are beautiful and the physics and particle (and gore) effects are amazing. Even though it's five years old the graphics can be tweaked to insane amounts and although it runs at a good framerate on my mid-range hardware if I were to max this baby out it would really push my system to the limits. If you're a fan of Unreal Tournament you'll probably enjoy this game for what it is but it does a few things differently than its predecessors that may annoy you. For one, UT3 focuses heavily on vehicle based combat. Now, I'm a big UT'99 fan and I felt it was possibly the most pure shooter experience I've ever had the joy of playing and it didn't need gimicks like fancy ships, hoverboards (seriously, you get a hoverboard to fly around on on bigger maps), and giant maps to be a great arena shooter. All you needed was running, and gunning. Now, that's not saying that UT3 lacks this, it certainly has smaller maps without hoverboards where you fly around and blast people to bloody bits just like the older games but it does have new mechanics you may like or dislike, such as the ability to ""play dead"" and fall down, which I found to be distracting, and a handy floating arrow that shows you where to go in CTF and Warfare modes (it's not obtrusive, trust me). The level design is also incredibly well done, with fun things to play with like different physics and rainfall and hazards and difficult to reach powerups. Unfortunately, this game lacks the assault game type which I found to be a lot of fun in UT'99, and the emphasis that UT3 places on the Warfare gametype during the campaign I found to be draining as the maps were just too large. I felt like I was playing Battlefield or something, with everyone flying or driving something accross a huge distance to complete some type of objective. But I digress. Basically what I'm trying to say that although this game has its merits and can stand on them, it's not as good or as fun to play as the games that preceeded it. It's a lot of fun and is good for LAN and online play and even though the graphics are amazing I think I'd still rather play UT'99. Your mileage may vary, however, and I'd still recommend this game as it's a fun shooter and is a member of a series that I think is at the front of the pack in the arena combat scene. Oh, and it comes with the UDK and Unreal Tournament 3 Editor and has great MOD support, so there's hours of fun outside of what comes in the box.Pros:Stunning VisualsTight GameplayGreat Music/AudioMOD SupportHas the Sniper Rifle! (Lightning Gun sucks.)Cons:A lot of focus on vehicular combatSome detrimental changes to UT gameplay and stylingGame felt more like a showroom for the Unreal 3 engine than a UT series gameNo Assault game typeSo-So Controller Support (I don't know what the ""E"" button is on my control pad)It's hard to enhance on near perfection and any changes you make to a beloved series is going to have some fallout and I appreciate the effort here. It wasn't a colossal failure like Diablo 3 was but it just didn't wow me like the previous UT games did. It was fun and it wasn't bad but if I'm playing some UT Deathmatch I'm probably not playing this game over the others. I'd say give it a shot and play it to see if it's your thing because the larger maps and new focus on vehicular combat may be something you enjoy a lot. Oh yeah, there also was a story (it didn't focus on the ""tournament"" though). I didn't really talk about it as it's not super important in a UT game but it was mediocre and had some cool moments. Good effort team, it certainly didn't detract anything from the game, I just didn't really care about it much. TL;DR nothing gets your heart pumping like Unreal Tournament - although it's not my favorite of the series it scratched an itch that hadn't been touched in years. B+			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I’ve been playing Unreal Tournament since the 1st edition. The good old classic UT99GOTY later was UT2003 then UT2004. In this edition some features were removed that existed in the older UT series like Assault, which was very popular and interesting game type. However there was an improved on the Onslaught game type idea that was introduced in UT2004 and transformed it to game type called Warfare in UT3, also added some sort of single player campaign which is not too bad, the single player campaign was also available in the old UT99GOTY but was presented in a more simplistic manner.The downfalls are that the game isn’t supported much by modding community anymore especially if you compare it to the old UT99GOTY.  The other thing is lack of players. However, you can still make your own server and play with bots or have a LAN party with friends. If to speak about UT3 Black Edition as a whole is defiantly something worth trying.I personally would recommend any UT series to try, because this is not a game it’s a legend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If the game is on sale, 75% or more, and you got no one who owns the game to play with, purchase 2 or more copies and gift it to some friends and go have a blast!This game is one of the most entertaining Arcade FPS shooters around and has a fun and interesting campain. If you like LAN gaming, this is one of those games which will keep you hooked, coming back for more and more.One of the coolest features of this game is the ability for adding community based content. I recall long ago downloading a Samus Aran module and shooting the heck out of other players online. Ah---- the memories.To this day I still play this off/on - mostly offline since it is so fun in LAN mode.Again, go snag the game and buy some for your friends if they refuse to dish out one meal's worth of cash on this game. This game lasts a lot longer than paying for thieir dinners anyways - and at least you can be sure they'll thank you for this ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So much hate for this game! It makes me cri evertim!. This game is amazing on PC and console!, Replayability wise and graphic wise. I dont even care about online multiplayer because Godlike mode with bots is a massive challenge, its like playing against real players with aimbot (their aim is insanly accurate), Perfect for hardcore players who want a challenge. Also the bots are VERY smart probably the smartest AI i have played against in any game.This game is perfect for you people with capped net out there like me LOL.

												Years and years of satisfaction with this one.I was addicted on the Unreal Tournament 99 GOTY, but when the Unreal Tournament 3 came out, I did nothing but playing it over and over again.Pros:Engine, obviously, the best FPS engine in my opinion.Game modes that can be really fun on single player mode too.Instant Action mode. Are you looking for some adrenaline and can't wait for the cutscenes and all the story of the game show up until you can finally shoot some heads off? That's your game mode then!The Bots are really fast if you want it. Very smart if you want it. They make you feel like a little baby trying to play the game if you want it! But they can be very stupid if you want it too. [There's a big variety of configurations that you can apply to the game before entering the action.]The graphics are very good. Not to argue about. And looks pretty modern even after so many years.Sound effects and music not so addictive like the UT99 ones, but close enough to make you feel fine.Cons:The Campaign looks boring if you don't like some of the game modes. But you can always go to the Instant Action mode. It gives the game the replay factor that every FPS should give.The Multiplayer mode is dead. (It's not because there are no people playing this game anymore, but Epic Games just has unplugged the servers after years and years of service. There are a mod somewhere that allows you to play in that mode if you want to search for it) But back in time, when you could play this mode, the number of custom servers with tons of custom maps and mods to download were so big that the wait until all the stuff to be downloaded and you finally enter the server was so absurd that you were disencouraged to play there anyway.It's a game that came out before the Steam, so there are more players with versions of the game out of here than the Steam players (but if you really want to play with friends in multiplayer mode, the mod that allow this, allows you to enjoy the game with all the people around the world too ;) )9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All I really have to say is that when you're going for mod content, UT3 has a fraction of the material other games in the series has. Avoid Skaa3w models, because they're pretty bad ports that have horrible readmes and look like they're slathered in crisco. The Aviana and Demonus models are really high quality, although they don't match the game's visual style much. The Community Bonus content is alright. Classic Maps Megapack is a must--lots of them are better than the default maps. If you like Runestorm's work (they're the ones who did all of the official Ballistic Weapons content for 2k4 before the community took over) you should check out their Crucible weapon pack, although lots of people complain about game-breaking bugs.That's pretty much it. I wish there were more content, but I guess that's why model rip software exists.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story of campain sucks, its a kind excuse to make a presentation of game modes and gameplay.This game its kind focus on multiplayer but the bots do also a nice job they are pretty challanging.

												Unreal Tournament 3 is one of if not the best Deathmatch games i ever played.For me a good deathmatch game is all about the gunplay and games. Unreal Tournament is a master of both!The guns are balanced in a way that they are not overpowered in any way (Especially with the no super weapons mutator). A highly skilled player could easily take someone out with a better gun if they lack in skill.Gamemode wise there is a variety of fun modes for everyone from the big Warfare where you destroy the other teams nodes and that includes vehicles from classics such as CTF to my personal favorite betrayal. It is mainly betrayal that makes this game stand out for me above the older unreal games (UT2004 has a Betrayal mod by the community if your intrested). It is a (T)DM hybrid with InstaGib (1HitKill) weapons. You frag others to gain points and also raise the team pot. Kill your oponent to still this pot and he has a limited time to get back to you. This brings for very fun balanced and also pleasently frustrating moments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though with vastly different visuals from previous installments, Unreal continues to deliver the sweet, fast-paced and gibby goodness in Unreal Tournament 3. Menus are a bit clunky and character customization drags, but when you get past these inconveniences there's a fantastic game waiting for you. Being a Flak Monkey never looked so good...

												Introduction: This has been one of mine favorite video game franchises ever since I played Unreal Tournament 2004! And coming to this one I wouldn't say everything is great about this as compared to UT2K4 especially the movement and gravity though it can be fixed with mods but besides that there are many new games modes like Greed, Betrayal and the improved Onslaught mode from UT2K4 called Warfare which is my favorite as its relatively more balanced now. I didn't like the Titan mutator much but then again it can be turned off.The amount of community made mods, maps and other stuff is big though not as big as UT2K4.Weapons: The shield gun has been replaced with the Impact Hammer from the original UT and all other weapons have been modified in some way or the other which is a mixed bag in my opinion. Translocator is also still there for non vehicular combat game modes.Vehicles: With the inclusion of the new Necris faction in to the Unreal Tournament universe there are several new vehicles on top of those which already existed in UT2K4 so I can't describe all of them in detail here because I initially wanted to as each and every vehicle is fun to use! So if you get the game just jump in to Vehicle Capture The Flag or Warfare and try them out yourself! Besides this a new Translocator alternative called the Hoverboard has been added for vehicular combat game modes.Campaign: Even though I have played all the Unreal Tournament games I'm not a that big fan of its storyline so I didn't expect much from this ones Campaign either as its boring with only a few cutscenes. Though if you have a friend then I would suggest playing Co Op on the Insane difficulty mode! You can add me as well if you want to play Co Op!Multiplayer: Since the new Unreal Tournament has been in development which is currently in Beta as of now the Multiplayer community has been mostly dead so at this point of time it is a little hard even for a big fan of this series like me to blindly recommend this for Multiplayer which is one of the strongest point of this game. Mostly you will find bots on the servers though you can find some dedicated players occassionally. Conclusion: Overall in short you can consider this game during a sale if you haven't played a fast paced First Person Shooter in a while which relies on a lot of things like skills, reflexes, strategy and team work depending on the game mode. There aren't any locked content except character visual customization so you have everything available from the start for an instant action!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If fast-paced first person shooting of the old school variety, combined with ruthless godlike bot AI and addictive adrenaline rushes are your thing: This game is a must-have.  Heck, even lighter difficulty will give you a good run for your money.  If you have friends to go multiplayer with, then even better.  Don't be fooled by its age, the entire series remains a classic.Best part? Even the campaign is fun, that is something you don't see everyday.  10/10, would Manta again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is alive in Europe, but I wish there were more duels. If you live elsewhere, I would look at UT2004 or 99 instead. Good to hold you over until UT4 is out. One thing to note, if you use the in-game server browser, you'll find a lot of bots. Look at the list at https://www.gametracker.com/search/ut3/ and add the active servers to your favourites in the game. This list doesn't count bots as players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Re-doing my review since my last one really sucked since I wrote it at 3AM tired lol)Unreal Tournament 3 is a solid game, with great graphics and gameplay. I recommend this if you don't think about the older Unreal games, because to me this game doesn't feel like an Unreal sequel. I'm of course basing this opinion off of a bias of nostalgia because whenever I play UT3 or 2004, I always think about happy memories and the feel of the original Unreal Tournament; which I really try not to, but do. It's a real mix in between, there is an element of the game feeling like Unreal with it's fast pace gameplay, and original weapons and lines being in there, but it still is difficult to enjoy for me personally.

												As a fan of slow paced tactical shooters, I have to say this game can appeal to a lot of people. The gameplay is straight forward, and all weapons are easy to use.The art style matches the gameplay, as a super action sci-fi style movie setting. Any other setting for it is stupid. The characters are joking and colorful... most of them, anyway. Bishop's lines are the best. So if you're that kind of person who pays attention to atmosphere, it doesn't fail here.When it comes to gameplay, imagine the gunplay of Quake combined with the vehicles of Halo. Nothing much to say here. There are basic Source-inspired movement techniques, such as jumping with weapons and bunny hopping. There are many ways to play, but I categorize them based off their representatives from the Campaign. For example, as I'm used to games where headshots are important, I would be Bishop. Vehicles are of the standard selection: buggies, hover planes, tanks, and a heavier buggy. However, all these vehicles differ from their standard Halo inspirations. For example, the buggy has fold-out blades on the front bumper. Yeah. There are no overpowered weapons or vehicles, but I have to say that the Bio Rifle does a bit too much damage for a gun found right outside of spawn.The creator tool is a creator tool using the same engine as the game. Not much to say.TL;DR, It's a good arena game that tops even Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Gameplay is fluid, art style actually makes sense, so get it if you don't suck at shooters. EDIT: The Free To Play Unreal Tournament currently outclasses this game in the modes it has, however, it doesn't have vehicles or hoverboards yet. Also no Warfare. So get this if you need to catch up on the series or are extremely impatient.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When playing by yourself, i would be advise about the friendly AI. IMO they are horrible :/. When giving a order, they will say ""Acknowledge"" and in your mind they are not going to follow that order. They will KOS enemies very good.

												While it's certainly not the best in the series, Unreal Tournament 3 is certainly a worthy member of it. It has a sort of back-to-basics approach in the weapon selection and non-vehicle game modes, and the vehicles themselves are actually well-implemented and fun to play with. The maps are well designed, the gameplay's definitely still Unreal Tournament, and the graphics are outstanding (especially considering the great performance!). Only major problem is the singleplayer campaign, which replaced the Tournament with a war... in other words, the campaign's simply stupid. Apart from that, it's a fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in 2007 Unreal Tournament 3 used to be what put 'Epic"" in the ""Epic Games"". Explosive mixture of powerful weapons, lots of maps and vehicles with an amazing game pace as a topping. Perhaps the looks do not shine anymore as they did on game's release but for a 9 year old game it still looks extremely well. In regards to gameplay UT 3 is a nearly perfect experience. Starting from a wide choice of weapons most of them having secondary fire mode completely different from the basic one. Some of them even having a tretiary one. Lasers, bullets, plasma and rockets and a personal nuke launcher. This game has it all. Or rather used to have.Vast array of vehicles deserves similar recognition. Divided into two factions: Necris and Izanagi they offer unique approach both in design and function in each vehicle ""class"". Thus making them balanced while being much different in playstyle. Despite the fact that there were plenty maps on the game release there is an option to upload custom maps and mods to each server. There were also plenty of game modes avialable. From shooting classics like Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag there is a twist of Vehicle Capture Flag and Warfare - the biggest game mode utilizing both infantry and vehicles to the full extent. Many of the maps including unique mechanics and side goals to aid defeat of the enemy. As if things weren't exciting enough already every game mode possesed mutators allowing to differ the gameplay even further. All of the above got a finishing touch in 2009's Titan Pack update adding content unreleased in base game as well as classic game modes - Greed and Betrayal.This heavily mutiplayer-oriented title comes with a really long campaign although it's basically a series of bot matches with a pinch of lore divided into 5 acts. Each finished with a nice cinematic. Single is a good opportunity to get a feel of map roster before leaping into mutiplayer but nothing else. Unless played on highest diffculty - bots there are barely fair forcing the player to push their skill to the limits.For such a gem it's somewhat sad how empty the game is today. This is the reason why I would only reccomend the Unreal Tournament 3 to the franchise fans - there is simply hardly anyone left to play with. Meaning you will either face bots (even in few mutiplayer servers left) or battle-hardned veterans. It's nice to experience the ridiculous pace of the game that is hardly matched by any modern title.

												Ignore what the play time says... it's been erased some how... about 5 times over the years. I'm probably at over 1000 hours on this. That's really all you need to know. It's too bad there's like nobody playing online anymore, but the game is still fantastic. And it's especially amazing using vorpx and vr :3 Too bad the 3d system isn't supported. But the head tracking and 360 view is super fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its honestly a great game, built on a great engine. Its fun, and enjoyable. Personally, its better than UT2004, in many ways.  Especially since it comes with maps and the titan pack you'd have to download for the disc UT3. Its worth owning on steam.Don't let my play time fool you, I have played this game on disc (off steam) dozens of times. And on steam offline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game for more than a thousand hours pre steam, many all-nighters and still play regularly many years later. It's always a good time, and you can't go wrong. My first PC build was to get better graphics from this game, and it still looks great today IMO. There are many mods and maps, and I've even made some maps with the toolkit which makes it an even better experience. I wasn't really excited about the story aspect, at first. Traditionally the Unreal series is a story game like unreal, or unreal 2, and in between those the Unreal Tournament games. There wasn't any tournament in UTIII, but it still stands out as one of my all time favorite games. All modern FPS owe their lives to the Unreal series, and if you haven't experienced them you should. I would recommend buying the Unreal Deal and playing Unreal, UT99, Unreal 2, UT2004, Then UT III.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong i actually do like this game. I remember playing this online back in day on ps3 like 2008 or so. I had tons of fun with it back then. So why do i not recommend it? In short near dead community.its so dead, the  ps3 version (before online shutdown of gamespy) had more life  than this game today. hell UT2004 today even has more of community than UT3. So today, this game can now only fall back on single player which even back then i didn't really like. found it pretty boring. Even at occasional sale price of $10 its not worth it. If you could get as cheap like i did($3) go for it, you can occasionally find online matches and could mess around with bot matches. But for $10 price range you can find games on steam with lot more content than this game nowadays. Do yourself a favor and get either UT2004 or try free pre-alpha for next unreal game UT4 which is shaping to be pretty good from my experience with it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												{This review will be based on the singleplayer mode of this game.}Unreal Tournament 3. Hmm what to say, what to say... Most of the fans were for strange reasons disappointed of this game. But in my sight (That just for some reason is in love of underated stuffs,) I enjoy this game. 'Tis sad it got a low amount of users playing online, but in there the game is quite intense, unlike with bots. And by the way: Speaking of bots, some of them may be strangely made. Especially in Campaign, which is mostly just made out of low-skilled bots with the constant 'warfare' mode. And this review will be mostly, based on that.---Unlike the single players of the previous Unreal Tournament games, there is a special story in it, with (I think) the whole campaign being played with you and your teammates, bots, in missions. There are no actual tournaments and this feeling of arena that was from previous games, but constant war. Without any spoilers, I will just describe the game inside it;From the start you play on with flags with your small team and the enemy team, that actually know how to use 'translocators' pretty well. But of course, too novice. Sadly the whole continuity of the single player is made out of novice bots. Even your teammates achieve no skill in progress, seriously. Only enemies get to...evolve. But by a little bit. I was disappointed that the parody-race of Skaarj were not as monstrous as they looked.The gameplay itself with the story goes on solid. Through the missions with flags you then get to complete them in more complex maps, then to the cores with vehicles and prime nodes, and so on for a long time. Sometimes you may get an extra mission, however. It is truly a good feeling when you get back to the deathmatches from these time-consuming warfares.And later of the game, of course, gets strangely hard. I say strangely because even your epic skills in gaming may not always help your stubborn teammates that cannot even protect the nodes correctly. But thankfully, you got a fuction close to the 'Taunt' and 'Status' section called 'Orders,' since you are a leader and all. It does benefit you a little. Most of the time just do 'Defend' for all the teammates not to get molested by the incoming horde of smarter attacking bots.But overall...I played this campaign when my internet was out. For some reason I was just, entertained by it. Even with slightly funny way of this game being made, I was digged in a little. Because of my boredom and because of my love to the look of this game, and the whole love to the UT series. Not to look at the negatives of the game, when you imagine it all, more lively of a game, like a movie, it is enjoyable. Though not for the users who seek for an excellent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is, without a doubt, amazing! I could rattle on about it, so instead, here's a list of rpos and cons:Pros-- Game pace is fast and brilliant-- The AI (bots) are well programmed but, as usual, teamwork is a lot harder (if not impossible) with bots, so sometimes you have to work around them to get something done. This isn't always a bad thing because it can make the game very interesting.-- The variety of weapons is good and, in my experience, aren't quite as easy to learn to use well as you might expect. This is not CoD, so becoming proficient with a weapon actually takes practice.-- The vehicles are fun and well done. The only one I have a problem with is the tank because if you have someone with have a brain operating the turrent, you really do need your whole team to be able to kill it. But this is probably me being too picky.--The way all the elements of the game fit together forms a game which is truely amazing.Cons-- Even though there is a story, playing the maps (at least the first few) doesn't really make it feel like there is. All the objectives I've played so far are all TDM, CTF, CTF with vehicles, etc and it doesn't feel very story-like.-- It may be the comuter me and my mates have, it might not, but we did run into a few issues when joining each others games on lane. But we'd still be able to join 6 or 7 times out of 10, so it's not enough to be bothered by, but enough to annoy you a little.Other Comments-- This game is very reminiscent of Gears of War in the way things look. This is neither a pro nor con, but is cool if you loved and played any of the Gears of War franchise.Overall, this game is bloody amazing and would highly recommend!My score : 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very lazy entry to a godlike series, was the very reason why we are not currently enjoying UT4. The developers put minimal new content into it, basically updated the graphics engine and said to the modding community ""you do the rest"". Epic's dropping of the multiplayer batton is the reason why we are cursed with COD remake after remake...Whilst fun, this game crushed my hopes and dreams of a UT4 and Unreal 3.... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first real FPS shooter I ever picked up was the original ""Unreal Tournament"", and its legacy of violence and fast-paced gameplay lives in ""Unreal Tournament 3"". The developers took the best bits from the intervening titles like ""Unreal Tournament 2004"", and added some new content like Vehicle Warfare that completely changes the battlefield. One of the few games where the AI not only keeps up with the player, but actually surpasses them, which means that you can't get lazy and have to develop real hand-eye coordination to play at advanced difficulties.

												Ah, the good old days of arena shooters...A blast from the semi-recent past.My only complaints are that 1) My favorite weapon from UT99 was still sadly absent (RIP the Ripper) and 2) That Epic focuses on Gears of War, when I think that this game would be a better use of their time. That's strictly my opinion, though. I don't knock GOW, because it is a good franchise, but....but...Some have waited 9 years for another installment in this franchise. I myself, playing UT99 for the first time a year ago, can now roll with some of the people who haven't seen the light in fifteen years because they've been in their basement playing this game. Okay, I'm not a pro, but that doesn't stop me from wanting another one of these games. Not a whole lot of people play this game anymore… but that doesn’t stop it from being a great game. Unless the Halo games are rereleased for PC, this is probably what I'll be waiting for.Try turning the safety off. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's cons unfortunately outweigh the pros; it's impossible to find an unmodded game online, there is a lack of characters and levels, and the campaign is a massive waste of time. They also didn't include the beloved ""Assault"" game mode. The campaign's story is remarkably boring, and the worst part is they force you to play the ridiculous ""Onslaught"" levels which is a gimmicky mode in the first place, and the bot's AI is completely unreliable, making it almost impossible for me to progress on higher difficulties simply because my bots were not doing their jobs.In the original Unreal Tournament, playing the single player was fun because you could choose whichever game mode you felt like playing and work your way up the ladder, getting familiar with every single level so when you go online you're ready. There is a sense of completion as you go for nothing more than tournament glory. But in Unreal Tournament III you have to slog through a terrible and cliche story that isn't related to any tournament at all and you aren't given any choice which modes you want to train in. Even more frustrating is that the online mode is almost entirely unsupported. You have no stats, no functional matchmaking, and it's impossible to get you and your friends into the same game. They completely dropped the ball here. Other than that, the original core game is actually really fun. It's got that dark gritty Unreal feel, and it's super-gory so it's really satisfying when you get a kill. The best game mode is Deathmatch because it's the only one that actually represents what the game is supposed to be about in the first place: gladiatorial arena killing. But instead of adding the ""Assault"" game mode or supporting the ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Capture The Flag"" modes with functional match-making, they did nothing here and just kept the ""Onslaught"" mode with the ridiculous vehicle combat that doesn't even feel like a tournament fighter anymore. It's just some vehicle gimmick they added ever since Halo came out.Just skip this one. The original Unreal Tournament is better in every single way except for the graphics, which are the only good thing I can say about this game. Don't get me wrong -- it's extremely fun to play for ten or fifteen minutes if you just want to kill some bots when you're bored, but beyond that I can say with confidence that this game offers nothing else worthwhile.

												Epic released a statistic that said 70% of the people who bought Unreal Tournament 2004 never played it online. Given how often I played offline with bots, I'd believe that. Unfortunately, UT3 introduces a laughably stupid singleplayer campaign that is more repetitive than it is fun or interesting. By trying to make a legitimate ""story mode"" for the game, they've sort of spoiled the fun of the original, because there's a lot of story stuff that gets in the way. There's still ways to do regular bot skirmishes, though, so it's not such a big problem.What is a big problem is that it's just not especially fun to play. The smaller maps feel too cramped and the larger maps get to be a little too large. Onslaught mode from UT2004 has been remade here as a retooled ""Warfare"" mode, and it's been changed for the worst. Players can now carry an orb around that lets them capture control points instantly without waiting, but instead of speeding the game up, all it does is make long, drawn out, tedious stalemates the norm, as teams fight over one or two nodes and instantly revert any progress made by the opposing team, over and over and over again. I've had Warfare matches go on for hours without much progress from either side, and enabling a time limit for rounds does little to alleviate the issue, as sudden death doesn't really mean anything when neither team's core is ever exposed.Plus, the guns just don't feel good. They feel meaty, sure, but something about them is... ""off"" in a way that's hard to describe.All this really made me do was re-install UT2004 and play that instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to love Unreal Tournament 3, I really do. I want to love every Unreal game, but I can't.Epic dropped the ball when they made this smeary, bloom and brown, messy-looking sequel to one of the greatest deathmatch games of all time.The game feels like a console port, and Epic rewrote its narrative and visual style to be more like Gears of War than previous Unreal titles, and as such, it no longer feels unreal. It feels like just another dark and murky shooter, all style and no substance, and style is not a good thing to rely on in game that's supposed to be a competitive arena.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite this beaing a great game I'd not recommend it, as it's really only worthwhile as a multiplayer game, yet the online service it installs with no longer exists, so you need to patch and do various other stuff just to get an online game, and to avoid the errors whilst trying to join a game - all this stuff should be included as standard, and it should all work from the Steam installation, otherwise Steam are just selling a disfunctional product and selling it on false pretences, apparently because they're too eager to take people's money and don't give a crap if their customers end up disappointed.Go to Epic games website and check out the currently free, modern version of the game, which is a work in progress, but at least you can get a multiplayer game withough any headaches.

												Team Death match is near empty.... SnipersCampaign is okkkkkayyyyy without snipers snipersThe orb match thing is where most of the players snipers play.Do you like sniper rifles?Because this game has sniper rifles. It has other guns, but youd never know it.Snipers everywhere.Think COD, TF2 and Sniper elite with Gears of War and you have Sniper Tournement 3.Just dont forget, the snipers are needed in teams of 10-15.SnipersIts true though. A lot of snipers. Not unplayable, just a lot of snipers, with sniper rifles. My flak cannon is garbage against them. I still like it though, just need to get better.UPATE****** 2/2/2015Since I have picked this game back up my mind has changed. There are still very populated servers and tons of game modes. I'm enjoying the hell out of it now. Amazing graphics, gibby fun and it runs extremely well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's very good and very fantastical like good Unreal stuff always is and it seems to be lacking the support and community the previous UT games had. The game and software is very good but the online multiplayer as I remember had too long of wait times between tournaments, there was this never ending need to wait and reaffirm stuff and there was the repeating requests to join in again. That killed the spirit and killed the fun. Don't do that again Unreal! I hope the next Unreal does away with that rubbish and returns to the elements that made Unreal so successful and have such a massively huge and dedicated following online for multiplayer, mapping and modding. The game is awesome, the software stable and the online multiplayer worked great but that nagging and waiting killed all of it. Great game though and when you finally do get into a online multiplayer and have the patience to stay there through the constant waits and requests to rejoin you'll see the game and graphics are sweet as can be :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've just started playing through the campaign which is fun enough, although a little repetitive. I'm coming straight from playing UT:GOTYE from 2000, so I'm disappointed to see a loss of the Assault game type, but the new introduced game types including vehicles do add extra variety. My reaction to vehicles is mixed.

												I've been playing this game franchise since I was very young, and even before that I use to watch my father play it. I didnt get really into it untill UT3 came out. It is by far my favorite, not just because it is easier that its predecessors. The maps have expanded so much, and the user interface for the game has come a long way. The game missions as well as multiplayer remains capture the flag, and deathmatch/team deathmatch centered. They have also integrated new gamemodes which are refreshingly challenging. While the weapons have stayed the same name wise, they've gotten technologically better. Legendary guns like the Flak Cannon, still pack a punch, but look way more futuristic and alien like. I cant say as to wether a lot of people will feel the same about it as I do. It is a first person shooter, but the alien technology isnt for everyone. I've always described it similar to halo, but better in my opinion. Only way of finding out is giving it a go yourself!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Epic games, you are my favourite gaming company, i hope i'll work with you guys in the future. My childhood game was UT99 and i didnt regret having it, and when UT3 came in, i litterally excited, now, UT4 is comming in, and I AM PSYCHED TO DEATH for it! Epic games, keep up the good work, you have my support as a fan of the Unreal Tournament series!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Big fan of the UT series! I have all of them. UT3 is much more difficult on PC than xbox 360 (I have played both)So be prepared for hard difficulty, graphics are 10/10 for a game released in 2007OIne major issue is the online hosting, its a huge bug where everyone is having trouble hosting multiplayer games, so be on the lookout for that. There is a way to bypass this however, you need to download stunserver files in order to host.Overall 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I STRONGLY recommend this game, its even more action packed than UT99 and UT2004, with awesome graphics and action packed first person shooting action that deeply immerses you inside the game, it is worth buying it! Epic games, you are my favourite gaming company, i hope i'll work with you guys in the future. My childhood game was UT99 and i didnt regret having it, and when UT3 came in, i litterally excited, now, UT4 is comming in, and I AM PSYCHED TO DEATH for it! Epic games, keep up the good work, you have my support as a fan of the Unreal Tournament series!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice FPS that clings true to the classic arena-style shmups.

Cool campaign coop mode, cooperative, flag, point defense, pure deathmatch, team deathmatch, objectives... have them all. And the mods? The incredible mods, especially those sponsored by Unreal 1 million dollar award contest :P Just awesome seperate games for free, with quality higher than commercial products...

												Funny thing: I bought this game way back near to the time it came out, as I was super hyped for it. Unreal Tournament has always been my favourite FPS series. Anyway, I got my copy as the regular edition of the game from a retail store. I never bothered registering the key on Steam until years later, as I think I tried it once, and, it didn't work. Then I tried it again, and... it did. Not only that, it gave me the Black Edition. I'm okay with this.Anyway. The game itself is pretty good. It's like a shinier, prettier UT 2004. I... don't really like it that much. The guns just feel all wrong. It's not a BAD game by anyone's standards. UT3 (which is a very stupid, VERY very stupid title, I mean, it's not the third Unreal game, it's not the third Unreal Tournament game, where did they get the number 3 from... just wtf) is a fantastic game in fact. It's just that I think UT 2004 is a bit better. UT3 doesn't really have many issues I don't think. It just doesn't feel right.Pick it up on sale, I guess, if you're really devoted to the series. I'm not sure the multiplayer isn't dead.Also, to address the title situation in more detail... lets see here. Unreal, then Unreal Tournament, then Unreal Tournament 2003, then Unreal II: The Awakening, then Unreal Tournament 2004, then Unreal Tournament 3.So... where do they get the 3 from? The third Unreal Tournament game was 2004. If it were Unreal 3, that would make it the third Unreal game. But it's not called that. It's called Unreal Tournament 3. What were they thinking? Seriously, I guess the fact this game actually has a campaign of sorts makes it a bit more of an Unreal 3, but at the same time... what?In Unreal, you're a prisoner who ends up crashed on a planet, you escape the dead vessel, and then you go out into the world to find a way off the planet, and in the process, rack up an insanely huge body count, tear through an alien temple, and destroy the mother of an evil alien race. Among other things. It's awesome, and crazy.In Unreal 2, you're a space marshal guy who does objective based missions in space. I don't really have much more to say about it. You hang out with your spaceship pals, learn some tragic pasts, get a whole pile of awesome guns, and massacre hundreds of mercs and aliens. Great stuff.Then... what, you're telling me this is meant to be Unreal 3? Is it? Maybe it is. The campaign feels tacked on, and as is usual with the Unreal Tournament series, it's still basically just Unreal Tournament matches, but the game puts tidbits of story in with things so it feels like an actual game.This ended up taking like half the review, but, hey, it needs to be asked, why? Is this Unreal 3, or Unreal Tournament 4? It can't be 3, that was done already. There wasn't even an Unreal Tournament 2, if you're not counting the two yearly games, 2003 and 2004. Which would make this Unreal Tournament 2. But that's nonsensical. I just don't see where they got 3 from. On top of this, Epic Games DID have a hand in all three of the previous games... I don't get it.But yeah, get Unreal Tournament... uh... 3. It's good!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Killed a great franchise. Graphics are great, but number of maps, number of weapons, overall gameplay and number of game modes have all been reduced greatly from UT2004. Also, UT3 was given a proper storyline, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it was a poor effort that doesn't really make sense in the context of a tournament-style game. Sadly all the game modes that would have been sensible with the story such as assault (personal favourite) and bombing run have been ditched for this version. The thing that really killed it for me is that the main characters are clearly recycled from 'Gears of War 2' which was released around the same time. The graphical improvements made in UT3 are outweighed by the content lost, so I recommend not buying this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the best UT game so far. Installed UT4 two days ago to feel the difference, here's the comparison:UT4 is a cut version of UT3, looks worse, plays worse (9 years passed since the UT3 release). I think devs try to do exactly the same thing ID software did to Quake 3 and Quake Live.Ok, you can say it's because of alpha/pre-alpha/etc but who gives a ♥♥♥♥? It won't change much anyway.- no vehicles and hoverboards, that supposed to be better? Lol. They could just add an option to turn them off;- weapon design is worse (just look at the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle, who designed this♥♥♥♥♥♥);- weapons don's shake while you fire them (hello Quake Live);- player models are MUCH worse (the only better part is the face) with thin and small arms and hands;- voice acting - ♥♥♥♥ing terrible (ok, you can say pre-alpha placeholders);- perfomance is much worse with almost the same graphics;- less game modes;Literally the only good thing about UT4 is the UT99 Facing Worlds map remake. I do not understand why people overrate it. Good thing EpicGames decided to publish UT4 only in their platform, it would be a ♥♥♥♥ing shame to publish it in Steam. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite some hate from Epic towards PC gamers and a bit too much of eyecandy, UT3 is a great addition to series (well, minus the Bombing run mode). Marvelous level design and smooth gameplay were always the trademark of Unreal Tournament series  and, by all means, you should give this one a go even if you're not the fan of anything post-UT99.Two minor flaws - AI in onslaught mode is very dumb and FOV is somewhat narrow. Everything else is just what you would expect from an Unreal game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another game I hate to see fall, Its a fun game but at the end of the day once you look at it after all of the hype has come to an end, its not that great. I really want to like this game, but I just can't. And I can't stand the blind Unreal Tournament fanbase saying that this is the best Unreal of all time, when in reality its probably one of the worst. To sum it all up, its a first person shooter multiplayer version of Gears of War (In my opinion one of the most overrated video game series in gaming) Unreal Tournament 3 is fun, don't get me wrong, but compared to Unreal Tournament 2003/2004 or the first Unreal Tournament, its no comparison. The single player is mixed bag, at times its great fun and addicting, and at other times is just frustrating. I really appreciate the attempt to add a story to the campaign, but this is also again where it falls flat. They tried to give you options on which battle you choose and said it would impact how you played the next match and they also added something called player cards you can collect to even or add an advantage, almost like an RPG. However choosing a certain battle over another never seem to do anything of importance in the next match, and the player cards to me are stupid addition. The whole point of the arena FPS was so everyone was on an even playing field and the fact that you need player cards to make the battle even or that can give yourself an advantage, goes against everything the Arena FPS stood for, an even playing field. But after all that it begins to get very repetative, the graphics are what most people complain about because they have a strange tinge of Brown in every map (even in cave and ice themed maps) and I can't believe no one has criticized the AI, THE AI IS ♥♥♥♥ING BRAIN DEAD!!!!! Why does Epic insist on using the same AI from 1999? and why do the Unreal Tournament fans choose to turn a blind eye to it every time? The AI are by far the most frustrating part of the whole game, Especially the friendly AI, because you can't give them orders, there were so many times in Vehicle CTF or Warfare maps when allies would pile into a Leviathan, (for those that don't know, has a very powerful secondary cannon on it, but to use it you have to anchor it to the ground and so it can't move) They will pile into it and just sit there and fire at enemies, leaving you and 1 other friendly AI to complete the whole mission, which is impossible since the other team have more players, because you don't have a player card to even the teams. My advice to Epic in the future Unreal Tournament games is simple, FIX THE DAMN AI!!!! Another strange addition is the Ord in Warfare. (What it does is, it capture nods instantly, and if you stand next to a already captured nod, it protects it from damage or capture) Now sometimes it works very well especially on maps with secondary points that hold a certain purpose, like the countdown nod in the mine map, that does damage to the enemy core without them needing to be linked or ones that can create heavy vehicles giving you a stronger push, however on other maps its frustrating and just makes some games go longer than they really need to.Multiplayer is also a mixed bag as well, at times its great, but most of the times its frustrating. This really pisses me off more than anything, because Unreal Tournament is known for its multiplayer, and in this game the single player campaign is more fun than playing multiplayer. Most of the multiplayer fanbase is populated by Unreal Tournament veterans, that essentially wipe the floor with all new players. Not to mention, finding a match in general is frustrating, sometimes you will look for a server and it says that it has 11/32 players on it, but when you finally get to play after it takes 10 minutes to load all of the stupid mods, you find that its completely populated by bots, and you completely wasted your time. The Shock Rifle is probably the worst weapon by far, for those that don't know you can fire the secondary fire, then shoot the ord you just fired with primary and it creates an huge explosion, this has been in unreal since the beginning, however in Unreal Tournament 3 the explosion is ever bigger than before, so now you die so easily, even if you have max armor and health, its even worse on small confined maps, most of the time you die from behind.At the end of the day Unreal Tournament 3 is not the best Epic could do, I hope that in the future Unreal Tournament games these problems do not persist, because Unreal is a great franchise. But in my opinion this game is not worth 19 dollars, don't buy this game unless you are an unreal addict			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't recommend this game, only in comparison to the previews entries to the series. This game attempts to bring the Unreal Tournament universe onto the war field, using ""Tournament rules"" in awkwards ways. You will find yourself 'Capturing the Flag' and 'Dominationing' in a futuristic war setting, which in my oppinion takes too much away from what used to make the game feel fun.Previous Unreal Tournaments were colorful, light hearted death tournaments with an exciting 'gameshow' feel, and although this game takes the manditory steps forward in the mud-like gritty ""realistic"" graphics, it takes too much away from what made the previous games so great.

												So, heads up, this game is a downer. If you've played the previous installments of UT and then decided to look at some reviews for it, HEAD MY WARNINGS. This is nothing like the previous installments just because it slaps a sticker that says that ""I'm legit! Buy Me!""Firstly, the game itself is a selling point. If you've played the series before and wanted something to look back to, this is not something you want. This is the rejected siamese brother to what this series is based on. Sure it has shooty shooty bang bang, but it also has a story that nobody really asked for... I don't see why this was necessary in the first place but whatever. It isn't really that good either. They looked like they were trying to go for something mixed between the Hot Wheels Acceleracers 'Big Foot' thing and CoD.Secondly, the weapons were completely revamped and not in the good way. Take my advice, the Flak Cannon shouldn't be used anymore. It's a load of crap. A few of the weapons were just nerfed to make it more ""Level for all weapons to deal correct damage"". That's not how it was meant to be played, some weapons were DESIGNED to be overkill, like the Flak Cannon or the Rocket Launcher. They decided to nerf them, sure there's blood and gore, but I believe there are mods to revamp damage to ""exposive"" levels again.Thirdly, the A.I. is bull. Now before you ask specifics, lemme explain. Either your team is as useless if not more than a steamy pile of bile mixed with burnt rubber, or the opposing team is as smart as a rocket scientist to know exactly where you are at all times. This is both good and bad. Good because it shows the A.I. is dedicating itself to taking out the most advanced player (i.e. you) and Bad because, again, your team is just useless. I wouldn't have them on my team anywhere... Not even a science project, lord knows they'd let me down there too. Aside from those points, they're just annoying overall. They now use voice actors to display what they're saying instead of typing or, y'know, shutting up and doing it. It's like they want the enemy to know ""HEY! GUESS WHAT?! WE'RE GONNA GO FOR THE EXPLOSVES! JUST LETTING YOU KNOW! OH AND GG MATES!""Finally, this game was the final game in the series. Disappointing as it may seem, the series took one faulty game and ended up dishing out this undeniable turn of events. Being as it's probably the only real disappointment in the Unreal Tournament series, you'd think they'd have made another one to make up for this error, sadly not. Both a gift and a curse if you think about it in the context of ""They won't make another game, but they won't make another craptastic Unreal Tournament"".So that pretty much sums up all I have to say about this game really.TL/DR: This game is like going to see Metallica live in concert and getting falsely advertised into a Justin Bieber marathon with the volume cranked to 11.

												(even though it says just a few minutes on record, I actually played much more, but it was retail non-Steam version)If you like old school online FPS, gameplay will likely suit you. It's pretty great. Never play campaign, though. The game is online shooter, I don't really know why they included campaign in the first place. Every UT game included one, though.Some people argue that UT2004 is better in terms of gameplay, but I believe it's a matter of taste. I have played and enjoyed both games.There's large assortiment of maps (both official and community-made, everything for free, no stupid DLCs), characters, and other mods. Some people even find enjoyment in trying various maps and mods with bots offline. As for me, playing offline is largely useless, but YMMV. It's pretty easy to mod the game, though it's the case for other UT games as well.Graphics is largely outdated, but so many years have passed since the release, and who cares, anyway? What I don't like is the style. It's dark, gloomy and overdetailed. I liked UT2004 more. Community-made HOLP map pack for this game has maps that better suit my taste.The soundtrack is great, but so-called dynamic music wasted it, in my opinion. I play with in-game music turned off, but sometimes listen to OST separately. What really ruined the game is lack of developer support. Although several patches were released that had addressed outright bugs (honestly, Valve games like TF2 faced much more disgraceful bugs during their lifetime), Epic Games never seemed to really care about this game. It's hard to tell what's exactly should've done about this, but for some reason TF2 is still alive and well, despite being released roughly at the same time and failing into the same niche of old school shooters. There's a lot of small issues that aren't exactly game-breaking, but still prevent from enjoying the game fully. Like fragile replay support (try to play a demo recorded on server with mods on), buggy dedicated server on Linux (and no client whatsoever), frequent issues with GameSpy middleware, technical issues with with custom gametypes (to be precise, cooking map made for custom gametype causes trouble if gametype is ever updated), lack of proper custom crosshair support, inability to switch to spectator from player, and a lot of other problems that were certainly mentioned on Epic Games forums multitude of times.As of now, game is almost dead. I do play it occasionally, you can find some players online, but still. If you like playing custom maps with bots, though, you still might enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a huge Unreal tournament fan and, don't get me wrong, even in disappointment I still love UT3. However, I believe that the older versions (UT2004, mostly) way better than this one.

												I want to like this game, I really do, but I just can't.Having bought this game 3 times now (PS3, PC collectors' ed. and now Steam) and playing well over 100 hours across, as an arena shooter this game has some things going for it, but as a UT sequel and in light of the plethora of good team-arena shooters out there falls painfully short. First of all, one staple objective-driven gametype (assault) and another innovative football-like gametype introduced in UT2K4 (bombing run) have been axed entirely. Warfare (formerly onslaught) has undergone a number of questionable design choices (insta-capture orbs) which altar game flow dramatically. Many of the movement options which made UT2K4 a hit with the competitive scence as well as 'adrenaline' combos (admittedly a controversial addition in the first place) are no longer.However perhaps the most glaring design failure was the direction Epic decided to steer this game. Hot on the heels of Gears of Wars' success and with plenty of unused art assets, Epic tossed out the Tournament canon in favor of an extremely lackluster filler campaign akin to those that ship with the yearly COD releases. Furthermore, many prominent and loved tourney combatants were either removed or attached to an unrecognizable body. Graphically these bodies have been disfigured and hyper-muscularized and the lush arenas of previous titles have been tossed out in favor of the muddy, bloom and postprocessing-heavy urban jungles so characteristic of its generation. It's also worth noting that unlike its namesake, this game came out on console first and shipped to PC with a (since partially fixed) console UI. This disrespect for canon and shoddy presentation make clear one thing: on release, Epic simply valued money over their fan base.Sure, Epic didn't completely abandon the title, to their credit releasing several solid maps, patches and the Titan bonus pack, as well as sponsoring tournaments and the Make Something Unreal contest, but it was still only a band-aid over the aforementioned lacerating flaws of this title. Note that this support (long-since ended) came and went 3-years-ago, the community having dwindled to, at the time of this writing, one-to-three scantly populated servers per game mode (compared to 10-20 near-capacity in UT99/UT2K4).Did Epic release a few interesting new features for this game? Sure, the hoverboard/grapple is invaluable over larger maps and Warfare's bonus nodes bring variety to the mode; several of the new maps are also well-designed. However, it's a big loss compared to what you are giving up from the previous titles and I'd recommend that if you're into the larger-scale or competitive aspects look into UT2K4, quake-like team-arena modes UT99. Viewed apart from the series, it's a mediocre team-arena shooter with a weak community, and even Tribes: Ascend will serve you better.ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do own a retail PC copy of UT3, you can save yourself the expense and redeem the key for a free Steam copy.

												Beware, this game not only require you to surrender you e-mail address for spam, it require you to sign in another account (gamespyid) just to save your single player progress (private server)I forgot my profile password and tried to retrive it with my mail, then I am directed to this gamespy website that firefox warned that it is unsave. I proceed anyhow and wait for the website to load, but after some time the website did not load and I just cancel it.I go back guessing what is my password and thankfuly got the right password.That is the hassle of a game using a third party account, and should be avoided like the pledge. One day the third party is not  available to support it and there goes your game.I had invested like $100 before in magic the gathering that use third party services and I get the following message; my money is wasted like that.""""""""""""Today we announced with our partner, Wizards of the Coast, that we will discontinue game services for Magic: The Gathering – Tactics on M‌arch 28, 2014. We are honored to have been a part of bringing you the magic of the Multiverse over the last few years.

												This game has less customization than 2004. You can't really get into the game, feeling like you are the one playing. You can't really customise your team to the degree you could in 2004 unreal tournament. You can't choose your own hero, and you don't have many characters to choose from and all of them look stupid and on steroids, except for bishop who is white and bald. This was a really stupid mistake by Unreal franchise. You also don't have more skins to choose from with weapons and the multiplayer is not as full and hasn't got accurate numbers of players that are in the lobby (+7 - turns out there are none or 2 and it turns out again none). In addition they don't have assault and there is no choice for adranaline. Compared to 2004 this was a failure and a waste of money. The focus is on graphics and not really quality. If you liked 2004 UT don't buy this game. It's a stupid mistake by Unreal, they actually didn't listen to players what they liked about 2004.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Has anybody ever heard of the Mandel effect?Remember when comedian Howie Mandel died in the late 80's? So do most people.Despite this, many are surprised to find that he is alive and well today, and hosts the hit TV show ""Deal or No Deal""The leading theory is that some people have shifted realities to one where Mandel never died, or else that some powerful entity is capable of manipulating our collective memories.

												What have I done?I didn't realize the version I -err- found online was stripped of all nonsense, Oh Dear, Oh My. Savegames don't save unless you make a new account, campaign progress randomly resets, it doesn't remember ANY SETTINGS, AT ALL, not keys, not resolution, video settings, anything. And the crappiest thing is, the INI files are written TODAY so it DOES write them, it KNOWS where the settings are, it just chooses to not save anything. This isn't a misunderstanding, lost permissions or a read only checkbox.What are you doing on Steam, asses? That's why I carry an entire platform on my back, so I don't have to make new accounts on every game, so I don't have to be online to play, and so I can have my progress saved.What were you thinking, not saving my campaign? What were you thinking, not saving key bindings? And what on Earth were you thinking when you decided to scr.w me over for not giving you my game to hold hostage? Since when do you dictate when i can load up a save or not? Asses.This is what happens when you don't get refunds. Screwed over.Here's another lovely thing: not only torrented version saves campaign, it's how it saves it that's funny. There are workarounds online in which if you mark the file read only while playing and then exit, it does save. So it's not an unavailable feature, it's a brave and screen centered FU.November 2007, Epic releases UT3. Little ""bug"", it doesn't save settings for offline users. ANY setting, including key bindings, graphics, saved weapon orders, etc.11-14-2007 - EpicForums[...] when i play off line my player name is just 'player' and none of my keyboard settings or graphic setup is remembered, even if i adjust the .ini. settings. win xp pro, and i do have admin rights.08-29-2008 - EpicForumsHowever, the game settings and campaign progress still aren't being saved. 04-05-2009 - EpicForumsHave you noticed that UT3 patch version 2.0 doesn't save settings for profile offline?08-10-2010 (meimeiriver) - SteamForumsHow do I get my Unreal Tournament 3 install to remember my settings?03-22-2011 - (Plumb_Drumb) BeyondUnrealForumsOkay, I went to play my Steam copy of UT3 toaday and noticed EVERYTHING has been reset to default.This is not a bug. This is a middle finger to every user who has bought your game and wishes to play offline. You can take this game and shove it.Originally posted by Beckizzle, epic forums, 2007:(quote) It might work after you submit your email, etc. Didn't ask me again after I did that.(/quote)No.Thats dumb.Good boy, beckizzle.

												The unreal tournament series is full of pedigree, when I first playing the original UT I was ecstatic with the awesome fast paced twitch focused firefights, so of course when Epic released UT 2003 and 2004 subsequently I did not hesitate and they were both masterpieces.Sadly this is not the case for UT 3, while the game in itself is awesome (albeit not as good as past interations, nostalgia much?), it suffers from some annoying bugs, one of which has made this game unplayable for me from the first 5 minutes of being owner and it hasn't let up, forcing me to peruse forums and whatnot to find a fix (hence the laughable amount of invested time in game, although I played it extensively with a friend before I bough my own copy).This annoying bug, for what I've found out, has been around since the game was released with no viable solution in sight, at first people blamed it on gamespy (RIP) and even though GS is long gone it still plagues the multiplayer throwing off the game servers with the message ""a duplicate login has been detected"".tl;dr: Good game but bad support renders it unplayable as intended (online)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the worst installment in the Unreal Tournament franchise (at least for single player). The campaign is supremely disappointing considering how terribly made the AI is. Opponent team AI seems to have been made more adept than the player's team AI. I realize how ridiculous sounds but you'll realize what I'm talking about when you have to single-handedly capture the flag, capture points, do objectives, etc. while they're busy running into a corner (like a lagger) or standing out in the open getting shot to smithereens.

												A once great game left damaged by the depature of Gamespy. The multiplayer feature is a shadow of its former self with broken mechanics and dodgey menus. It is a struggle to host and play with just friends. You have to mess around with ports and ip's and stuff which would be fine for anyone with knowledge of these things. However me and my friends don't so were left unable to play with one another. Needless to say we walked away from the game after trying for a bit and thoroughly would not recommend this game to anyone hoping to play privately with friends (this includes co-op campaign, 1v1's etc) unless you have the relevant know-how.

												Bad. Game is made via several shades of brown. New maps are bad, they took out the best game modes, changes to the old weapons are awful. This has contributed nothing at all to the series. The community is very dead these days, even Unreal 1999 has more players than this does. The new vehicles are pretty stupid and over powered. The combat doesn't feel smooth anymore and the modding community is pretty low and abandoned. They removed 80% of the player models from UT04. The new map editor is horrible and barely usable. If you really want to try this game, think twice. If you want to try the Unreal series, get the original one. 2k4 was okay as well. The only thing they possibly changed in a positive way was the campaign, they tried adding a story which was still a flop and not as good as 2k4. 5.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're a big fan of UT Classic and 2003/2004, then my suggestion is to not get this game. After finally playing through it's campaign, I can finally say that. It's just not good. At all.The storyline was bland, the characters stiff and fake, and a lot of old UT charm is just gone. If before it was about a TOURNAMENT, then this time that word isn't even said once. It's just Gears of Warish type of plotline, that's very, very boring. And the missions are incredibly repetitive.Gameplay is just not the same as in previous UT games. In UT3, shooting and moving feels a lot more....Quake 3 like than UT/2004 like.But yeah, just.....don't. Don't get this game, it's pretty bad, k?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've only played the single-player campaign in UT3 and cannot recommend it when there are so many other compelling games out there.I loved UT2004, so I was disappointed that the bots on your team are so frustratingly stupid when it comes to vehicles.  Half of the UT3 single-player campaign levels seem to feature vehicles.  It is not uncommon for 3 teammate bots to run straight for one of the vehicles, get it stuck in your base, and then sit there inactive for the rest of the game.Otherwise, the graphics are nice and everything else is reminicent of UT2004.

												Bought this game because it was for sale, very glad it was only 4 bucks, otherwise I would've returned it immediately after the first level. The controls suck and aren't very customizable like in UT2004. Ex. Can't use tab key to hotkey a weapon, in my case I used the tab key to quickly switch to the flak cannon, now I cannot even bind anything to it. Ex2. Using the translocator has become cumbersome whereas in the past it was easy to quickly switch back and forth between weapons by pressing the right and left mouse button in quick sucession, that was removed in this case. Also there is no more translocator camera where you could hit Q a second time to view exactly where the translocator was landing, which would give more of a flow. Ex3. Double jumping and wall dodges seem useless now, you don't cover a large distance as fast as you could in UT2004. I played UT2004 religiously in the past and got really really good at it to a point where I'd be accused of aimbotting and banned from multiple servers. This game was created for the casual FPS gamer whose used to slower arena fights like Halo and COD (I like those games but seriously just watch a Quakecon tournament and you'll see what ""real"" FPS shooters are)4/10 graphics are nice but the music and map selection also suck			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only reason you'd be looking for a game like UT3 is to harken back to the Quake/UT shooter days.  This isn't that.  The bleak graphics (pretty as they are), limited maps and plain laughable single-player made for an insult toward previous entries.C			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately it's nowhere near UT2k4. They should've create the 2k4 experience with up-to-date graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay here's an honest review:I gotta give this one a big ""NO"". Not because I think it's a bad game. It looks good. And I'm sure the UT purists out there hate it for it's lousy Console-to-PC port. I can't say I blame them. But it's definitely not an unplayable game, as far as multiplayer mode goes. The big problem with UT3 is there are no players playing it. So what you're left with is a morsel of servers, with a few players here or there. But no real community behind it. It's a sad thing to see.Aside from that mess, the singleplayer experience is dreadful. A very boring campaign mode. It's lack luster at best, I always felt the single player modes in the UT series were unnecessary to begin with. I always skip right over them to play the multiplayer game.Anyways, it's quite unforunate to see what happened to this series. Here's hoping Epic fixes things for UT4. I just can't reccommend this game to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty meh compared to the earlier games. I suggest getting the original or UT2004 instead.The environments are all bland and gray/brown now. Your character feels a lot heavier. Onslaught has been replaced with Warfare. It's generally the same, but it has this strange system where you can instacap a node using a special power orb. It completely ruins the mechanics of whittling down a node until it falls, and then rebuild it for your own team. It's all about rushing the orb ASAP. Campaign is not as good as the typical tournaments were. The new lore about respawners and them being powered by flags (CTF) is just stupid.Overall, it's kinda fun, but also kinda dead. Get UT2004 instead, you will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nearly piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Single player campaign sucks. Above all, multiplayer is dead. Buy first Unreal Tournament or UT 2004.And UT99's single player campaign not that bad. That's simple, ok, but its story is more reasonable than UT3's story: ""...Crush your enemies to win the tournament!"" And UT99's multiplayer is still alive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
