												One of the ""Founding Fathers"" Of PC FPS. Hell, maybe all FPS, it's so damn good. Facing Worlds is a reknown map to most gamers, and there's a reason for it.Let's get down to the basics of gameplay, what does it NEED to be a good game?Scroll to the bottom for final verdict!Graphics - This game is old. 1999 old. That's really ♥♥♥♥ing old. And yet... I still find some of these textures pleasing to the eye. The color scheme works well, and the environmental effects on some maps are pretty decent, for when this game was released, these graphics were revolutionary, just like Half-Life's. Some of the skins for characters even look pretty cool. The only issue I have with the graphics is that if you're trapped in a small box, like an elevator, it gets REALLY confusing. Combat - HAHAHAHAHA, Wow, if there's one thing you CAN'T insult about Unreal Tournament without being a complete ♥♥♥♥ing MORON, it's the COMBAT. I.... I've never played a game that can replicate how intense Unreal's combat is, aside from Counter-Strike. And it's a slightly different style, so even i'm not sure if CS can apply to compete with Unreal. Like I said, it is INTENSE. Even with easy bots, EVERYTHING moves at hyperspeed. Not just that, but things actually take a few seconds to kill. You have to take your shots wisely, and quickly. Most any weapon in the game will give your opponent the chance to turn around and fire back. Rocket Launcher, Sniper, and if you can manage it, Impact Hammers are the only exception. Maybe the flak cannon, but you have to get lucky with the spread. It isn't Call of Duty where you can knife a camper, or kill him with 3 bullets from an Assault Rifle....Speaking of camping, good luck with that. Standing still is just about the worst thing you can do in the game, not to mention there's barely any spots to do it. (Pillboxes on some of the maps excluded)Weapons - Unique as all hell! Lemme give you a run down of what weapons there are:-Impact Hammer: Your only melee. It sucks. Hold down your primary fire to charge it up and then slam it into someone to turn them into a meaty pile of flesh. Alternate Fire if they're at low health and you have nothing else.-Enforcer: Your pistol. Low in damage, and it also sucks. Primary fire does accurate shots, low fire-rate, alternate fire does highly inaccurate, high fire-rate shots. -GES biogun (or whatever it's called): A ""Sortof"" pistol, more like an SMG. It fires hazardous, glowing waste at your enemies, which procedes to melt them into a fine goo. Goo sticks to walls, and bursts after an amount of time, hurting any enemies nearby. Primary fire sprays it like a monkey throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥while on cocaine. Alternate fire charges a shot to make a giant, insta-kill ball of goo. ""Insta-kill is over-powered, don't you think?"" Nope. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit somebody with the giant goo balls, the projectile is too slow, and the range is too short. You'd have to be hitting someone standing still, or get a lucky/skillfully aimed shot.-ASMD Shock Rifle: OH BOY A RAILGUN. Primary fire shoots a decently-powered bolt of blue energy, at instantanious speed. It is 100% accurate, no spread. Alternate fire shoots a ball of the same type of blue energy, at a slow speed. If you shoot the ball with another ball, or the primary fire bolt, it explodes into an electric explosion thingy that is sure to pastilize anyone nearby. In Unreal Tournament 3, the ball implodes, sucking any unlucky persons into a temporary black hole. THE MORE YOU KNOW!-Plasma Rifle: You can see the naming of this gun was just as unique as the previous ones /s. Primary fire shoots slow-moving tiny balls of green plasma ( that don't implode/explode D: ) which deal some.... pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good damage. Good for usage in tiny spaces like tunnels. Bad in outer areas. Like outside. Don't use it outside. Alternate fire shoots- ZOMG IT'S A♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LAZOR BEAM!!!1! The laser beam has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage, but if you're accurate, you'll slice'n'dice your target in a second or two.-The Ripper: One of the nastiest ideas of a weapon i've heard of, The Ripper shoots giant mother-♥♥♥♥ing razor blades at your target. Some explode. We're getting emo on these ♥♥♥♥♥es. Primary fire shoots a highly volatile razor disc that ricochets like a bullet in a safe, and it doesn't stop until a while. WARNING: THERE IS A 75% CHANCE THESE BLADES WILL KILL YOU INSTEAD OF YOUR TARGET. DO NOT USE IN TIGHT QUARTERS. Alternate fire shoots an EXPLODING ♥♥♥♥ING RAZOR BLADE. WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP?!-Minigun: ....You know damn well what this gun does. Primary fire for semi-accurate, decent-speed minigun fire. Alternate for BBBBBBUUUUUULLLEEEEEETTTTT SSSSSSPPPPPAAAAAAAAMMMMM and extreme inaccuracy.-Flak Cannon: By far, my favorite gun. Essentially, it's a shotgun attached to a ""Thumper"" (grenade launcher). Primary fire shoots super-heated flak, which CAN bounce off of walls and kill you. Alternate fire shoots a grenade that explodes into flak.-Rocket Launcher: Primary fire for very slow rockets. Hold it down to prep up to 6 rockets, good for choke points. Alternate fire shoots ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pipe-bombs that hardly work. Hold down to prep up to 6 of them to launch.-Sniper Rifle: Primary shoots. Alternate scopes.-Redeemer: Primary fire destroys the universe. Alternate let's you find where you want to begin the destruction of the universe.They all feel good and fun, a generally enjoyable experience. The biggest complaint I have is with bots and Rocket Launchers, they aim a bit too good with those things in tight quarters.Maps: Some of the best map designs i've ever seen, I mean this game is doing better then CoD by a mile. There's hidden power-up rooms, treacherous hazards, risk-and-reward areas, seperate routes spread everywhere, and unique usage of the environment. Mother Nature(Property of Liandri Corp.) wants dat♥♥♥♥♥ boi.Story (for campaign): Ehhhh. This game didn't really have much. It gives you a starter intro, and some pretty good filler, as you can read up on your enemy's backstory as you prepare for battle. It even tells you their fighting styles. But the ""story"" is just some slapped on entertainment, the polish to the fancy sports car. Bosses/end battles: There is one, and ONLY one.Xan Kriegor.The whole game is you fighting your way to the top of the ranks of the Unreal Tournament to hopefully beat him and become the true champion. Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ, even on the easiest difficulty, this guy can be difficult. I'm still trying to beat him on one of the harder difficulties (I'm dreading the God-Like difficulty when I reach it). Essentially, Xan is the Shao Kahn (Mortal Kombat's final boss) of Unreal Tournament.Bonus Points: Terrific AI, and a ♥♥♥♥♥ON of difficulty settings. The options menu is also well-made, and the music is mindblowing.Final verdict: TENOUTTATEN. I'm serious, full 10/10. I can't give it less. I have yet to find a bug (aside from a bot getting stuck in a window a few times. Heh.) or issue with the game I do not like. It is one of the most well-programmed games ever made, the music is action-packed or sometimes relaxing, the maps, omfg the maps... This game is just awesome extract.HOWEVER,Despite the 10/10 rating, I do NOT suggest this game for all gamers. It is EXTREMELY fast-paced, you need fast reactions and fast hands (huehue) to get through it as a pro. Is the price right? Yes and no. Yes, it's worth it for the game, I URGE you to buy it. But no, as the game is pretty old by now, it should be lowered to atleast $7.50, though I believe $5.00 would be more appropriate.DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ♥♥♥♥WITS GIVING IT BAD RATINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T INSTALL IT. The game was made in 1999, and it's Window's fault if anything at all that they aren't compatible. Dual drivers have issues with the game's framerate, and more issues. The technical support page hasn't been updated in forever (Because this game was made in 1999, damnit).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my --------------->>> FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME <<<-----------------Nothing else even comes close.Absolutely gorgeous aesthetic, brilliant weapon design, fast-paced and satisfying action.The BOTS in this game are GENUINELY INTELLIGENT!  And you can let their difficulty AUTO-ADJUST to fit EXACTLY at your skill level!  Bots should be standard in FPS imo.  ESPECIALLY MULTIPLAYER!  The player should NEVER be slave to what others want to play.  No players, no game in multiplayer gaming.  This is why I can still play Unreal Tournament when and how I want FOREVER!  And I have done exactly that so far.Other than brilliant base gameplay, you have TONS of amazing mods for this game that are most often COMBINABLE AND CUSTOMIZABLE!  Tailor the experience to EXACTLY what you want!  I love it.Fantastic map designs and creative weapons with MORE functionality than most shooters.  Two fire modes such as the Flak Cannon the fires a shotgun-blast of bouncing flak pellets OR an impact grenade that sprays some flak pellets on impact!  Maps in space and space stations, maps in medieval castles, so much variety in map choices and a few extremely unique ones!  Not to mention the variety of game modes which include team deathmatch, free-for-all, capture-the-flag, domination (point capture-and-hold mode), and best of all ASSAULT!Assault game mode still belongs to Unreal Tournament.  This is the originator of that mode.  Accomplish one objective after another as a team and with such variety in maps and objectives to do it!  Like some brilliant combination of linear, singleplayer shooters and competitive multiplayer!  Cooperative and competitive at the same time!I wish I could play this with friends to share the joy, but bots keep the experience alive forever!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In 2291, in an attempt to control violence among deep space miners, the New Earth Government legalized no-holds-bared fighting. Liandri Mining Corporation, working with the NEG, established a series of leagues and bloody public exhibitions. The fights' popularity grew with their brutality. Soon, Liandri discovered that the public matches were their most profitable enterprise. The professional league was formed; a cabal of the most violent and skilled warriors in known space, selected to fight in a Grand Tournament.Now it is 2341. 50 years have passed since founding of DeathMatch. Profits from the Tournament number in the hundreds of billions. You have been selected to fight in the professional league by the Liandri Rules Board. Your strength and brutality are legendary. The time has come to prove you are the best. To crush your enemies; to win the Tournament.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament goes toe to toe with the legendary Quake franchise, and manages to more than hold it's own with this iteration. This game makes me wonder why bots aren't standard in multiplayer shooters nowadays. Unlike some first person shooters from this same time, Unreal holds up incredibly well and is still an absolute blast. It's single player is just an arena tournament, but that's what it should be. + Bots are very coherent and organized+ Arsenal is a joy with variety + Maps are pure brilliance+ Art style is still very stylized+ Graphics still hold upUnreal Tournament is easily one of the best first person shooters ever assembled.

												Greatest multiplayer game of all time, masterpiece level design, fun gameplay and an awesome over-the-top arsenal of weaponary at your disposal confirm this!! Unreal Tournament's design is meticulously crafted and the mechanics pretty much flawless. This was made back when games were created by people who actually liked playing them and had a passion for them, not by corporate scum who probably don't even play video games and just push out the same garbage over and over again to milk consumers.Unreal Tournament is visually breath-taking with an awesome art direction, abstract architecture and textures that don't consist only of bland shades of brown and grey as seen in modern games, particulary in shooters such as CoD.I'd recommend Unreal Tournament 99' to any who enjoy non-casual (yup FPS games weren't always dumbed down, bland, time sinks with gimmicks such as 'leveling up', 'unlocks' and 'drops' to keep players occupied) multiplayer fun which is still to this day the only game that leaves me shaking with adrenaline after each session!!

Grandpaw is Still Packing Heat and Taking Names !!!I have bought this game 3 times it seems over a span of 20 years or so lol The game still holds up today as one of the best FPS games EVER!! Man all the memorys that flood back in from this game from Mplayer to Gamespy lol The game has held its own over the years and has aged nice and with some mods and editing can add DX 10 support and can add hi rez textures,so can look pretty nice for being a pretty old game (not that it looks to bad as is).If you love  FPS games or just braking in the genre and want to see what we played back in the day. This is one of the grandpaws in the biz that started the FPS genre and this grandpaw is still packing heat and taking names !!! I say if its on sale or not pick this game up if you have a love for the FPS genre !! I give this one 2 thumbs up and 2 feet up ,being thats were you will be after i get done with you in this game :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic and still my favorite Unreal title, the original Unreal Tournament is a marvel of gaming excellence and is a benchmark other deathmatch shooters should strive to meet.  My first encounter with this game was on the PS2 and this GotY Steam version is only better, so if you've ever played this game you should definitely pick up this improved version.  The gameplay is just as good as it always has been and hasn't added any unnecessary complexity with the GotY tag.  Its simplicity is what makes it so awesome, and this version is a prime example of that.  I could add that Mod support is built into the engine, the settings are excellent for such an old title, the gameplay is crisp, clean, and fast, the sound quality is superb...I could go on and on, but there shouldn't be any reason to.  If you like Multiplayer / Arena FPS you know what Unreal Tournament is and if you haven't played the original you're missing out on the game that defined the genre.  There are Quake fans, there are Unreal fans, there are Halo fans, and even Call of Duty fans, but all gamers can appreciate the history of the medium and the titles that laid the groundwork for the future, and Unreal Tournament is undeniably THE title that brought these types of games to the forefront of gaming culture. Pick it up for nostalgia's sake or even pick it up because it's still the best arena shooter created to date, Unreal Tournament is a game no FPS (or gaming) fan should lack and is just as fun today as when it hit the shelves all those years ago.A+, do not miss.

												The game that defined the FPS genre for me, Unreal Tournament is still a well-played powerhouse of deadly weaponry and hyper-speed action.

												Unreal Tournament (a.k.a. UT99, or ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the memories!"") is one of the most popular games in the FPS Arena genre. Even though released in 1999, it still holds up pretty well nowadays, and still works on modern systems with some minor tweakings.+ UT is very competitive, fast-paced, frenetic, and technically impressive for its time. It rewards players with decent accuracy, awareness and coordination. It offers a good amount of maps (each having different areas and layouts) and a good range of guns that are pretty unique from each other, with each having both primary and secondary firing modes. + Apart from the usual Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes, there are also more different gamemodes such as the objective-based Assault gamemode, Capture the Flag, Domination and Last Man Standing.+ Obviously not graphically impressive nowadays, but the high-quality sound effects and soundtrack help shape the overall atmosphere of the game, making it darker but more life-like at the same time.+ While UT is mainly a multiplayer-centered game, it can still certainly be enjoyable offline thanks to the smart, challenging and customizable AI bots, with also the ability to host private listen servers for your friends.Heck, when I'm struggling to find any cons, that means a lot... wether you're an online or offline player, it's well worth the purchase.

												28/10/2015:IMPORTANT :  An extra section has been added which can be found at the very bottom of this review. I would advise all people who have never experianced UT or UT99 before to read that rather than the information just below this line. Thank you.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Old review (Original Review) :I started to play this game back in 1999. I've been on and off for roughly 6-7 years and to this day i still play it everynow and then in my spare time or when i'm trying to kill time. To me, this is the best FPS to ever exist in history and i think a large amount of old school players will say the same. I don't think an FPS game has came even close to knocking this off its throne, hands down this game deserves to be the king of FPS games for a VERY long time.Now you're probably asking.. ""Why do you rate it so highly?"" Well, apart from trusting what im saying - its a game you simply need to purchase and test for yourself to understand why. This may be old and outdated compared to everything you see today but despite that, it still has ONE of the BEST if not THE BEST gameplay and feel that you would expect every FPS to have. If you're new to UT99 this game also features a ""Campaign"" if you would like to call it that where you can test your skills against bots on any difficulty you set as well as any gametype you desire. You can play all the gametypes offline and online. You have Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag (My personal favourite), Domination, Last man standing and finally Assault.  Positives / + to this game (The good) : ✓ Best FPS to exist.✓ Alot of gametypes.✓ A nice amount of players.✓ Unique maps.✓ Gore & taunts (Alot of BM = Instawin)✓ Doesn't need a powerful computer to play it.Negatives / - to this game (The bad) :x Cruel to new players, 90% of the servers are filled with experianced UT players.x Very fast paced.x A tiny amount of errors.x Nearly every server requires a plugin/mod that has to be downloaded in order for you to play on that server. -----------------------------------------------------------------------28/10/2015 : There is no other way to word it apart from the game being pretty much dead, if you're looking to play Unreal Tournament online and against other opponents then you are going to be restricted. If you do manage to find players they will be highly experianced players, old school veterans. The only people who i personally suggest to invest in UT99 are ones who are well aware of its current state OR people who have previously played this before on disc and are looking to restore the feeling and passion they once had.If you're new to the Unreal Tournament series then i would suggest playing the latest one released, it hurts me to say this because UT99 will always be the game i fell in love with as a child, the best Unreal Tournament as well as the best FPS in the world. UT4 Pre-Alpha is available on https://www.unrealtournament.com/ do not worry, this game is free. Yes you heard me, you do not have to pay anything. Anyone and everyone can download and start playing.This review will not be updated or changed from this point on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How many games now a days do you see made by ""Unreal Technology""? Because this was the first that started it all, not only is it recomended by Curators nor the Metacritic didn't rate it 9.2 out of 10 for no reason. How many games you seen with that rating? Call of Duty ain't got nothin' on Unreal. A must have for gamers of true FPS classics.""Experience the game that co-defined the genre."" -Official PC Master Race-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to thank the DOOM 2016 open beta for introducing me to Unreal Tournament. I used to play DOOM 2 deathmatch over dialup when I was younger, and I was part of the Quake Alpha/Beta deathmatch trials back in the day. I loved online deathmatch, but went away from it for many years as FPS maps grew and gameplay slowed down. Playing DOOM 2016 deathmatch didn’t feel “right”, and the STEAM comments kept referring to Unreal as a much better online shooter experience. So I grabbed UT GOTY and the rest of the UT series. How right these commenters were….Unreal Tournament GOTY is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is action packed – so fast and adrenaline pumping. It is a pure Arena FPS, and in my opinion Unreal perfected the formula with UT GOTY. I’ve played the later games, which are fun in their own way – but this is just perfection. I loved the Mortal Kombat style voice over as the match went on…”Killing Spree….MULTI KILL” – and the tirade of smartass one liners from the bots, full of personality each one of them. The science fiction theme allows so much variety in levels, which are all full of colour and life…no brown and drab here. Musically, the tracks are all pumping electronica, that capture the essence of each level and the thrill of combat. The story, thin as it is, is all it needs to be – a couple of lines introducing the character or level, and the fact you are in an interstellar deathmatch tourney run by an evil corporation (cool!). The levels are awe inspiring, and I’d have to say the Facing World CTF map is up there with icons such as the Colosseum and Pyramids in its grandeur and online community reverence. No wonder it appears in all the sequels! Even if the online community dies off for this game (I can still get a match online today (2016) through the game which was released in 1999!) – I could always play with the bots, which are powered by the amazing Reaper technology which kept me hooked on Quake when I was younger. Thankfully I discovered this game late in life, otherwise I probably would have been hooked and not able to study or work or find a relationship. A masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best classic FPS to me.    People give Halo and other FPS games credit for stuff that was truly innovated in Unreal Tournament, and that is rather unfortunate.    Halo, Call of Duty, Titanfall, Destiny: these are names of pretenders to the throne that truly belongs to UT, in my opinion.   Quake was/is a great gaming series in its own right, but to me Unreal Tournament is the superior game overall.   The game modes are amazing in UT, as I wish some games would come out these days with a mode on par with Assault.   The number and quality of maps puts the games of today to shame.   We get DLC these days instead.    Remember when the online FPS genre had an amazing modding community?    I do, and that is why the great games of that era for the most part♥♥♥♥♥♥violently all over today's DLC infused garbage.   Lets pay through the nose for some maps though, instead of being able to create them ourselves as a community through awesome tools.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has been around for the better part of 20 years and it's still taking every other FPS to school, even Epic themselves can't seem  to improve on this in any meaningful way. If you're looking for a way to train your 'raw' FPS skills such as accuracy, positioning, movement and mastering every weapon type: this is it. Just set up a practice deathmatch on Deck 16, Hyperblast, Morbias, Morpheus or Phobos, make sure you're on hardcore mode, 25 frags, uncheck 'auto-adjust skill' and start working your way up from the 'skilled' bot-level. Once you hit 'godlike' with 16 bots you will be a machine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The review is written strictly from single-player perspective!Short version: 90%Unreal Tournament is one of the granddaddies of online team-based first-person shooters. It may have aged, but only in graphics, because the gameplay is still fast and exciting. And with its many game modes and high quality maps, it’s a game that you’ll never get bored of.Long version:First-person shooters weren’t always the on-rails, self-healing, cover-to-cover interactive movies they are today. This genre was a scene of highly competitive players who were constantly searching for the next game to test their limits. And in 1999 they got two of them, one being Unreal Tournament.The game featured a bundle of innovative weapons with two fire modes; memorable map design that is copied even today; game modes that finally showed something innovative beyond the same old death matches; and finally, bots which may feel a little dumb and predictable today, but back then they were topped only by Half-Life 1.UT may have been designed as a multiplayer game, but it is also enjoyable in single player. It has an actual campaign mode, where the “plot” may be simple as a doornail (you play in a futuristic gladiator tournament) and most participants only have a single-paragraph story, but it is still enough to build the foundation of a world you can immerse yourself in and make you care about your team. Because despite the popularity of free-for-all death matches, this game is all about team play.With the ever-increasing issues with the game engine (which was one of the best of its time) and the even more successful sequel, UT2004, UT ’99 faded into obscurity, but if you ever want some really old-school FPS action, you can always rely on it.

												I just revisited this game because I had such good memories of it. The variety of game types, the variety of weapons, the beauty of the maps, and the bot AI makes it the ultimate competitive FPS. It's all about the Tournament. And there are so many different kinds of tournament games to play, against real people or bots.What's also very nice is the ability to set up your own favourite kind of practice session, with bots of your choosing, on whatever map you want. So, for example, you can play capture the flag, you alone against a large army of stupid bots, or a single insanely good bot. Or you can have a bot team, and give them commands. Or you can just set up a bots-only competition, and just watch them go at it.Unreal Tournament has no need for a story. It's no-fuss interface allows the game-player to immediately launch themselves into the 'Unreal Tournament'- a futuristic fight-to-the-death, and as more scenarios are completed, four other game formats are introduced. There's 'capture the flag', in which you lead a team of fighters in an attempt to capture the opposing team's flag, all while defending your own. Following that, there's 'domination', a somewhat boring format that has your team controlling as many 'point scorers' as possible in order to amass your growing total to a winning score. The most exciting format is 'assault', whereby your team infiltrates either a submarine or a moving train, or whatever, in order to satisfy a number of mission objectives, all under a given time period. And don't forget that the game screams on today's machines -- smooth as silk, and very pretty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Timeless king of FPS games.Although it passed 17 years since the release of the game, Unreal Tournament grows old with dignity. Graphics in 1999 was literally phenomenal, carefully constructed models of opponents, weapons and well-designed maps did a great impression. Despite the fact that today visuals seem too angular, they do not reject from the screen. Music skillfully raises blood pressure. Dynamic compositions combining electronic music with a symphony leave no illusions - this is the swift action, in which the life of a player is being counted in seconds and watchfully keeping finger on a trigger is the best way to survive. UT1999 will remain in players memory forever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the true father of all FPS games. I spent tons of hours in this game, I was playing with bots a lot because we had weak dial-up internet connection so I decided to buy this masterpiece on Steam, even when I am not playing it much now. If you want to know, how skill looks like, join server with DM-Deck16 or CTF-Face maps. Also if you want to try some more ""Unreal"" experience I suggest to buy UT 2004 or try out new Unreal Tournament (4). It is still in early stage but it's free and awesome already. This is the moment where Unreal Tournament is getting better than Quake.10/10 would return to years 1999 - 2003 and enjoy the same experience like I did.#15YearsOfFragging #Godlike #GameOfDecade			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Listen, chances are you're an FPS player you've heard of Unreal Tournament at some point. UT99 is my ABSOLUTE favourite, and always will be. It's fast paced, it's fun, the music is incredible, the map design is fantastic, the voice acting is cheesy and just BRILLIANT. I see no reason why any self respecting player is missing this from their library.I'm reinstalling this for like the 50th time.Also ♥♥♥♥ you follow up games for getting rid of the Ripper.

												This is, in my opinion. The best multiplayer online FPS ever made.One of the reasons for that is simply the amount of content you get with your purchase. This game comes with 36 maps straight out from the box. Yes, you heard right, 36. These days with stuff like Overwatch and Call of Duty you get barely 10 in the best case scenario. More than that and you'll have to pay for map packs etc.There is so much to say about this game but i'd rather just leave it short. It's a game you have to experience by yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games of all time, not even a silver of doubt about it.No quickscopes. No camping. No 10 year old kids. No weapon skins. No DLC. No cliche storyline about the military. No ranking, or unlocks, or any of that garbage. This is pure, unadultered FPS (and FPS at it's finest, mind you). No game comes close to the amount of memories and action Unreal Tournament brought to me as a kid.Some of the best A.I I have ever seen. Amazing weapon design (and weapons). Astounding maps that blew me away at the time (same goes for the graphics). Fast-paced and brutal gameplay filled with adrenaline that made my heart race with action. Multiplayer was, and still is, Unreal Tournament's most standup feature. It was an absolute blast, and I'd do anything to play it again with my mates. One of the best soundtracks ever made. Unreal Tournament is a classic that must never be forgotten.Die, ♥♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is one of the first games I ever played. And it has never let me down. Even though it's graphics and gameplay are terrible compared to today's standards, it sure is a lot of fun.

												This is a prime example of a well-made, all skill FPS game.The controls feel perfect and fluid. Controls are perfectly responsive, and feel nice.Classic style graphics that will run on any PC.Camping: You can't camp. You gotta keep moving in UT.Great variety of weapons.Well designed maps that are based completely on skill.Enjoyable shooting.Multiplayer matches are very intense, and require true FPS skill in order to win.I would recommend it to anybody who likes skill based FPS games.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the one, the eternal classic that refuses to die. I've been playing this game for well over 10 years and it never gets old. Its as good a candidate as any for the best FPS ever released, up there with the untouchable greats such as Doom. There's never a dull moment in this game: a classic selection of weapons, some unbeatable level design, and a fantastic soundtrack (the music really must be praised) all adds up to create a definitive gaming experience that is still going strong today. As much as I also absoluely love 2K4, this is the original and will probably always be the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh the GLORIOUS NOSTALGIA!I am a 90's kid, sounds so hipsterish it is annoying, I HATE HIPSTERS (gotta make that clear)To the point though, i was RAISED as a kid, most 'gamers' these days play call of duty and they class it as their classic First Person Shooter.Let me tell you Call of Poopy lives up to it's poopy name of being poopy compared to this, THIS GAME IS A TRUE FPS.Now back once more and i'll try not to bash call of poop anymore... try...i was raised on this game, and i am also going to raise my kids on this game, i'd used to play a LAN match with my dad every single night after eatting my spaghetti hoops / alphabetti spaghetti for lunch, and he would always kick my butt at it, i remember having this magical green corded cable that'd connect my computer with his, known as the MIGHTY ethernet cable! i'm getting nostalgia just typing this ahah though seeing as we would always do 1v1 and he would use funny cheap tactics i was trained on this game the hard way, and no other way would do as i really enjoyed it, i'd sometimes resort to saying if you don't kill me i won't kill you... Though my six year old self would do hip thrusting for a minuite or so, and try to kill him with a flak cannon, that didn't normally work as he was a very 'jumpy' UT player and he'd always jump over my head as i'd run up stairs, or camp the flag room just round the corner and bait me to go in by shooting flak shells out the door, him hoping the aoe's would hurt me enough, though i also remember i tried to use my translocator to get into the flag room, but as per usual, he is nifty with quick thinking as he'd shoot it on sight as we were doing that 1v1, and it wasn't exactly stealthy as he could see the red trail behind it so he'd know to shoot it, he would always choose blue and i'd be left with the reds! i cannot quite remember tha map name, but i remember on the map we used to always do capture the flag on, on the red side of the map, there would be a little room with a flak cannon (which was my favorite weapon, still is!) and some other pick ups, if you go south from that room there would be water to your left from the walkway down to the mid-point of the map, on this map his favorite thing to do was camp his own flag room, and try make progress up the map while i was stuck waiting on the respawn timer!AMAZING memories of this game, this no doubt was the best childhood i could ask for!Ah and Xan, what a pain in the butt he was for me as a kid trying to unlock him, the 'story' mode so to speak is very nice, not very story driven, though still a very nice addition to the Unreal Tournament franchise.Being myself i would HIGHLY recomend you buy this and Unreal Tournament 2004, as the online isn't support anymore as far as i am aware though you could host a dedicated server if you'd please :) there is alot more online action on UT2004 though, what are you waiting for, go out there and get that announcer saying how much of a ""FLAK MASTER"" you are :) ENJOY EVERYONE!

												This was probably my favorite game growing up. I was going to order the discs off of Amazon but I purchased it on Steam since it was an immediate download and the same price. (I was never a Steam user until I found the game on the store.) It's the same game known and loved! I still play this with regularity. The only thing that was disappointing was that the second disc, the Chaos UT, is not on this download of the game. I was pretty bummed. In the practice modes, you can still find the relics, but that second disc really made the game GOTY, you know? Just made things a little changed so it was even more fun to play. If you're looking for that extra Chaos UT package, buy the original copies of the discs and do not download it from Steam. Other than that, this is 100/100. Worth every penny!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh my lord the umpteen hours that I have played this game. I've got the original (twice - both base and GOTY), the GOG version and now purely because I can, the Steam version (as well as all the subsequent iterations).NEVER in my life have I enjoyed a game as much as I enjoyed (still enjoy) this.VERY few games have ever come close to the gladiatorial, visceral magnificence of this game but this did it properly first.Weapons are still the very best in any game ever. The twin firing dynamic is used to utter perfection.Graphics are now of course dated but still more than do the job and everything else still feels as fluid and fresh as the day it was released 16 years ago. The subsequent UT's are also nothing short of superb but this, this is just gaming PERFECTION and holds a place in my heart that nothing will ever replace. AI is great (very challenging on latter difficulties) and multiplayer is still the best experience ever created.I have NEVER played a game that has held my attention for so long (apart from the c64 version of Paradroid and Mike Singletons Lords of Midnight and Doomdarks Revenge). It is a peerless FPS, it is magnificent, it is perfection.There was always a dispute between which was better, this or Quake 3. I love both and my gaming life would not have been what it was without either but UT takes it because of the multitude of superb mods and maps created by the amazing gaming community. These add immeasurably to what is already a work of genius.11 out of 10. Utterly, utterly superb in every way that a game can be. As I said the later iterations are also brilliant but this gift from the gods is and always will be my favourite PC game of all time.A game that my life has been enriched by through it's very existence. How many games (things generally) can you say that about ?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It doesn't rely on gimmicks or try to hold your hand. When you get a frag in this baby, you know you earned it. Best of all, it will run well on any old potato pc you might have.I would recommend picking up this and the old Quake games if you want a taste of gaming history.

												Even 17 years after being released to the public, this game is my go-to when I get bored of modern games and can come back to an older time, a better time.

A.I in this game is amazing, with a plethora of A.I difficulty you will never be a complete MLG master.

												Not playing UT 99 is a crime to gamers everywhere. UT 99 is arguably the most competitive multiplayer FPS game right next to Counter Strike. This is not a friendly game, don't expect to come in and start whoopin'♥♥♥♥♥instantly...no, no...expect to come in and start getting YOUR♥♥♥♥♥whooped instantly. Fast paced, gory, frag fest action at its finest. UT 99 is a game that is simple, you grab a gun (My personal fav being the Flak Cannon) and go find some meat! The graphics of course may not be all that amazing, but graphics don't make a game, gameplay does and man does UT 99 offer that. With an arsenal of weaponry at your command and over a 100 maps, both by the dev, and the community, this is a game that I think will never get old, and the best part is after all these years, UT multiplayer is still going strong, just make sure you join a game with actual players and NOT bots. Trust me, you'll know if you are playing with bots or not. Single player is simple, you play in a tournament against bots, but personally, I skipped the campaign and went straight for the real deal multiplayer since I find fighting against bots...well boring. The soundtrack is foot-tappin awesomeness with fast techno tunes that go perfect with the sounds of rocket launchers and screams in the distance followed by the sound of body parts hitting the floor.There is a ton of gore in this game so be prepared. I think UT can stand up to any game today and still win, yes, even Battlefield 4. I like UT a lot more than Quake III for many reasons. It seems what Quake III was flawed at, UT 99 was improved in. Now don't get me wrong, I like UT 2004, but there is something about UT 99 that I like a lot more than 2004. I'm not sure but 99 is just wayyy more fun and awesome for me that 2004 ever was. What else is there to say, it's fast, it's action-packed, it's gruesome, it's frantic, it's insane, it's intense, it's UT 99! And no need to worry about specs, any modern CPU can run this game perfectly smooth with no lag at all, believe me, I have a 1.0 GHZ processor laptop with AMD c-50 dual core. This is essential if you call yourself a PC gamer, and for the price of a book, you'd be silly NOT to buy this game! Don't let the difficulty of this game turn you off at first, UT is a game that is fun to play, but hard to master, it just takes time and patience to finally start getting into the swing of things and starting to get kills. So play UT 99 today! I'm sure you'll enjoy seeing your avatar die in an explosion of blood and limbs...:3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament is another absolute classic and was a worthy contender against other online First Person Shooters such as Quake 3 Arena. The game was a spinoff title to Unreal. However unlike Unreal (which focused on single player), the game was instead an arena shooter with online multiplayer in mind. Despite this the game does have a single player campaign. The story for this game is as follows, 100 years has passed since the events within Unreal, a mining corporation known as Liandri is hosting a no-holds-barred fighting tournament. You have entered the Tournament to become the next champion, by competing in 4 different leagues which have their own game modes and unlock the fifth league in order to beat the previous tournament champion Xan. There really isn’t much to the story and whilst there is more information within the single player campaign explaining the lore, character motivations and certain events within the Unreal Universe, it really doesn’t add that much to the overall story.  The graphics weren’t a huge improvement over Unreal, the reason for this was to increase performance when playing the game and maintain a high framerate with its fast pace gameplay. Despite this the game was still good looking for its time and the locations, level design, ascetics and environments in some maps is absolutely jaw dropping. A lot of the maps where set in different locations such as inside a spaceship, on an asteroid floating in space, inside an old medieval castle etc. It made each map feel more different and unique from each other. The soundtrack is also to the same quality as Unreal and is extremely good with some standouts like Foregone Destruction and Mechanism Eight.  In terms of gameplay you are given 6 different game modes, deathmatch which is a free for all, team deathmatch where two teams battle each other and the team with the most kills usually wins, capture the flag where two teams have to get the enemies team flag and bring it back to their own flag without the enemy taking theirs, domination where two teams have to take and keep control of key locations across the map, last man standing which is similar to deathmatch only players are given a full arsenal of weapons and have to stay alive as long as possible and assault which was a brand new game mode for its time. This is where players where broken up into two teams.(offensive and defensive)The offensive team have to complete key objectives in order to advance and win, the defenders have to prevent the other team from completing these objectives for as long as possible or until the timer ran out, both teams alternate and whichever team defends the longest wins. The weapons in this game vary from familiar favourites such as the Flak Cannon and the Minigun and some new weapons like the Pulse Gun which replaces the Stinger. Each returning weapon has been given a minor tweak, such as having a faster rate of fire. The standout weapon among all of these is the newly added Redeemer a one use weapon which fires a rocket with a powerful area of effect annihilating anything within its radius. The bot’s in this game are extremely good and highly intelligent offering up a challenge when the player needs it. Overall Unreal Tournament is a fantastic game and is still fun to play today. The bots are a good enough challenge to play with and even though it isn’t played as much online today you can still find a game with a few people to fill in the server or if you’re setting up a LAN event any time soon then this game should be on your list.

												I remember back in the day when i brought this game to school and we put it on all the computers in the computer lab and just played deathmatch against each other all day during class without the teacher knowing. It brings back so many memories. All the modern military FPS are so pathetic compared to this. This is what FPS were ment to be, and its sad that they have gone away from this formula.If you're unsure, then grab it when its on sale, It is well worth $ 1.99			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have never played this before, brace yourself for the most epic, fast paced, and brutal ride of your life. A few notable points about this game:This is a game based on reflexes and speed, with unparalleled bot AI, even to this day. With the console you can add literally thousands of additional bots. Call of Duty, Halo and the likes have all attempted to copy the fluidity and difficulty of this game to no avail.You can also set up a dedicated server for this game on extremely old hardware, allowing you to play together with as many other people as you choose.The mods for this game are virtually endless, allowing you to play the game how you want. There is also a convenient speed slider allowing for upto 1000% faster play speed and comes with many of the famous mutators.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing Unreal games since 2004, and for me, this is the REAL UT. Pity that I lost the original CD recently :/P.S. There are some big flaws under Win7+, and these are the stock DirectX and OpenGL renderers.The DX one does not support widescreen resolutions higher than 1600*900, and the OpenGL one have a support but it makes the gameplay be like 10X faster which makes it very unplayable. So, if you want to make the game playable, search for DX9 or DX10 custom renderers. Also search for high resulotion S3TC textures if you want a more decent look!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that made Epic Games. Unreal Tournament worked further on the groundwork that the original Unreal's graphical prowess and instant action modes churned out and turned it into a tour de force for the company. Game modes like Assault, Domination and Capture the Flag are classics, due in part, to what this game enveloped into. And maps like Facing Worlds and November are regarded the best of their kind. Although UT '99 clearly shows it's age, especially online, it is still a LAN favourite to many even today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If your a fan of arcade style or online shooters or maybe you just wanna relive the glory days then this really is a steal! It runs smoothly on really any computer, it has good AI, a good story and outstanding gameplay, this is truly one of the greatest FPS ever made along with the rest of the Unreal Tournament games!

												UT99 is an arena shooter. It favours players with good aim, awareness and map knowledge.The game could run on pretty well on most computers even before 2000, so you will likely have no problems running it.UT99 has a generous selection of maps and weapons, decent visuals and a great soundtrack.The community is still quite active.Apart from the awkward UI scaling at higher resolutions and some minor issues with running it at a 16:9 ratio, I have encountered no major problems.

												Unreal Tournament is my favorite game of alltime with years of playing prior to steam, over the years since its 2000 release ive proably clocked over 4000 hours of arena based combat with the sheir number and veriety of maps in the tournament alone not to mention the additional maps that are just left for you to play on or off line with bots, it really puts modern games into perspective with their minimal number of maps that come with them.Mechanically this game will run butter smooth on any computer (even my POS i.3 laptop with intergrated graphics). allowing yout to perform satisfing jumping headshots on Xan gregor in custom bot matches. Furthermore the Addtion of mutators to bot matches allows for some fun quirckie gamplay e.g. instagib fatboys.Not to mention the Chaos UT Dlc which adds countless new guns and maps to the mix including crossbows, new mega weapons and chainsaws to name a few.    Its fair to say that i always played unreal over Quake however i recoment any of the arena games or live as they also capture the same spark that unreal had as one of the truly best dynamic FPS arena shooters of alltime.

												I am usually quite ambiguous when it comes to evaluating games; even the most critically acclaimed game may fall down into the mire from the right perspective (looking at you FO4). However there are a select few games which I would consider ""Must Plays"". Games so important and timeless that - provided you have any interest in the genre what-so-ever - you have to own. Oblivion would be such a game for the open-world genre, Dawn of War for the RTS genre. Why? Neither game is perfect by any means, but they are landmarks, marking turning points and signifying a leap forwards.The FPS genre could have a number of games put forwards for this presitgious honour, but for reasons which shall soon become apparent, the only real contender is Unreal Tournament.UT99 as it shall be referred to from here on, marked the modernisation of a format which had been in the making for several years. Quake 3 Arena was a popular alternative but play Quake 3 now, and while it is still thoroughly enjoyable, it feels old. It still has the terrible animations, the clinically un-atmospheric environments, the soapy aftertaste of a game lacking in passion and excitement.UT99 put all of this right. The levels were beautifully designed and characterful, with each and every square inch dripping with details and offering a plethora of combat options. Every weapon had its own personality, there was no progression or advancement from one to the next; just a change in options. Even the characters each had sparks of life in their eyes. But what really set it apart from the rest of the pack was the music. Without the music, UT99 would have been a great game. But the soundtrack elevated it up to the prestigious podium of mastercrafted perfection.UT99 set new standard for combat, level design, graphic capability, combat scale and bot intelligence. However it's use of  musical scores changed the way games would be designed forever. UT99's stablemates in its year of release almost uniformly did away with soundtracks, save for the occasional musical score. In the year following its release, soundtracks became more common, especially noticable in games like No One Lives Forever and Hitman. Go forwards just one more year, and games such as Halo and Serious Sam join the fray. Both very different games, but what do they have in common? Iconic soundtracks.UT99 is a fundementally vital game for the advancement of the FPS and the arena shooter, and it deserves its place in the halls of fame (and your library) for that alone. However the next time you notice the musical atmosphere in a game, remember that you have this game to thank.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can remember when I first bought this game years ago. It was one of the best times of my life (Partially because of this game). This is one of the best Arena Shooters ever. If you ever played a good Halo game (Multiplayer) you can thank games like Unreal Tournament and Quake for that enjoyment. Because Halo is also an Arena shooter but these games brought the genre to the light. This game had gameplay beyond any other shooter in its time. Its a lot of fun, the bots in this game are amazing, and its probably one of the most bug free games I've ever played. The maps are mostly symmetrical (Caters towards fun and even gameplay so the only thing that seperates players is skill) and very easy to learn. If you want to get really good at games like this you're going to want to learn where the weapons spawn and how long it takes them to respawn. The movement mechanics in games like this are essentials to learn. You can learn to use the dodge feature, Rocket jumping and many other mechanics. Overall this game is one of the best shooters I've ever played. I recommend this game to everyone. The devekopers are making another new Unreal Tournament and you should check it out, just look up Unreal Tournament (Its free and in its Alpha state currentely)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short: A must-have classics of videogaming. Still totally worth playing today. Why to buy it: Historical masterpiece. Perfect for relaxation. It helps to find peace and emptiness after a hard day at work. More efficient than meditation, sauna, or sport. Long version:Unreal Tournament has something magical. It has been years since its original release, and still, it's amazingly good and definitely worth playing. For those who do not know this ultimate legend of FPS, let me introduce it in a few lines :Most FPS have tried to find a neat story to keep the player into the game. Then someone came and said: ""Hey, guys, why do we care with a story? Don't we play only to shoot and have fun, after all?"" And so came Unreal Tournament. The idea is that you are a gladiator in a futuristic universe, with some interesting background with appreciable ties with the Unreal universe. So you are in an arena with guns spread everywhere, and if you are killed, you just instantly respawn and continue the fight. It means there is no break, no searching for the way forward, for stupid opening buttons. You just fight and fight and fight endlessly, until you win the match. The experience was, and still remains, an extremely intense one. Videogame here is at its greater height, even if it's shear violence and barbarousness. Now, is it still worth today? The graphics have aged, for sure, but the level design was so good, that it doesn't matter a lot. They did not try to build magnificent open spaces areas in a luxurious nature: Most arenas are confined basements, and this is the kind of decor which cannot be much prettier today than it was seventeen years ago. Gameplay is still pretty much perfect. Weapons are sufficiently hidden so that you have to find out where they are while trying not being killed by those who already have them, and there is a good diversity of them. Everything was well-balanced then, and it has remained so up to now, as equilibrium never ages. What feels like the twentieth century, however, is the AI if you play solo, especially in Assault mode, where your team keeps following you, backing you up in the most useless manner. That means that if you are almost at the objective, and you die, you return to the starting point, and your team, instead of finishing what you were up to, just left the enemy base to greet you in pack at your respawn place. To end this review, I will tell you some personal story I have with this game. In my youth years I was often bullied by a big tough guy; but one day we spoke and, I don't know really how, we ended up by him lending me his Unreal Tournament game. I enjoyed it a lot, and now that we had a common enthralling to share, we became good lads and he never bullied me again. Peace among people can be achieved through cathartic  videogaming, it would seem.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 17, 2015
												Full Disclosure: I am a long-time consumer of the Unreal series, and a nearly life-long fan of both the Unreal series and Epic Games, the developer of said series. As such, I may be VERY biased, and my word might not be completely reliable, though I will try as usual to be as fair as possible.Unreal Tournament is an Arena FPS whom is THE grandfather of the entire genre, of games which are entirely based upon combat in planned stages designed solely for combat, not story. It has fallen into obscurity since Unreal Tournament 2004's release, so allow me to try and show you how this game became such a staple of gaming.These days, you've got games that run natively at 60fps, support resolutions for 4K monitors and ultra-wide monitors, and you've got games now which are nearly realistic for appearance. Unreal Tournament, came a bit late, but used it's engine well, Unreal Engine 1, which originated in the first Unreal game, which is an Engine that, even in the 90s, was the cutting edge of graphic fidelity and quality. It stands up even now, despite using polygons, lacking facial animations, but each weapon, and each character looks great even still. Levels still look gorgeous and cool, and almost falling into space still makes me very antsy even after 12 years later.The game has only three modes. The Singleplayer Campaign, Multiplayer, and an offline skirmish-style mode titled Instant Action. The Campaign is of you, a new combatant in the newest deathsport known as the Unreal Tournament, where convicts have been turned into gladiators whom kill one another and win with the goal of becoming The Tournament Champion, effectively attaining a sort of celebrity-status. Multiplayer is smooth and reliable. There are no problems with the game itself that I've found, even with this re-release. Modes for it, are identical to Instant Action, only some maps function with people, as you don't need AI pathing with human players.Instant Action's modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Capture The Flag, Assault and Domination.The only ones which aren't obvious and in other games, are Domination and Assault, so I will describe them.Assault, is by far my favorite mode in virtually any game and it is a team-based mode with two teams. One team attacks a base, completing preset objectives and eventually aiming to complete them all, while the other team's objective is to stop the attacking team from completing objectives by any means.Once the attacking team completes their objectives, they win the match, should they do all objectives and both teams switch sides, the defensive team becomes the new attacker, and vice-versa. At this point, the newly attacking team must match the completion time of the other team, or they will suffer a loss of the match. Though the sides switch even if the first attackers don't succeed, allowing both teams to attack and defend each match.Domination, on the other hand, is a sort of variant of traditional King of The Hill gamemodes. Only there are multiple Hills, or Points, which either team (up to 4 teams, unlike other modes, save for TDM) must hold to win the match. Holding a point wil generate one score point for the team every 3 seconds or so, and holding more points will generate more.It also has something no non-Unreal title has ever really adopted whole-heartedly; Mutators. Think of a mod, imagine how annoying it is that you can't just tick it on or off, or combine it with others witohut conflict for the most part. Mutators allow you to change parts of the game, like Low Gravity, and entirely different set of weapons, or powerful relics that change the game's strategies, or even classics like Volatile Ammo (ammo that is shot will discharge, resulting in hilarity from shooting ammo than the enemy) and Fatboy (Where your character model gets more ""fat"" or just wider, with obvious texture stretching, based on how well you're doing. Whoever wins, usually ends up being the fattest, while the one who did the worst, ends up like a skinny stick figure).Due to the game being made in the 90s, the options menu isn't TOO varied, but it sort of gets hte job done.It's got Video Driver settings, Resolution, graphics quality, texture quality (32 bit and 16 bit), A minimum FPS setting for video settings. It has the usual for audio, which technically hasn't changed for many games in years. You can alter the in-game auto-swap priority for different weapons, I personally have dual enforcers at the top above the sniper rifle. Input options are fairly varied with two different forms of sensitivity, and different mouse-based look options.The game is difficult... if you want it to be. It has quite literally 12 different difficulties, from Novice to Godlike, there's almost no way anybody is too awful to play any difficulty of this game. With Novice, AI are painfully stupid, maybe even intentionally avoiding powerups in at least early singleplayer levels, whereas in Godlike, the AI become Kung-Fu gun masters, constantly know where you are and instinctually know when items respawn and always try to hog powerups aswell as having almost perfect aim and reaction, even mimicking players by spastically jumping around.This game's soundtrack holds up today. In Unreal Tournament 3, most of hte songs are simply remixes of classic songs from this game, there's almost no single song that hasn't made it, and the music in this game are great for listenning when working out, writing, or even playing other games with.The announcer is also very well voiced. It's dominantly used for custom content quite often, mostly in Gmod, though it's confused for the Announcer in Quake 3 Arena... which is actually more of a knock-off with 90% less recorded dialogue and announcements.The game has barely any Story. IN the campaign, you are a newly brought-in convict in charge of your own team. Your goal? To climb the ladder of this tournament deathsport (which is canon as a sort of reality show to the human race) and to become the Tournament Champion by defeating it's first champion, Xan Kreigor... who is really hard to kill in-game. That's it though. You gain trophies though, and they still look cool!The game comes with a decent amount of content, but given how some still play multiplayer, and that if you look in the right places, you can find over 10 GBs worth of custome content. Given how I once had only 2 gbs of content on my copy of the game in the past, that was over 500 maps, 7 game modes, 4 mods, and many mutators.Some of these maps have neutral AI players which are super-powerful and are remixed versions of other official maps, using a different theme, or maps of such quality, you'd thinkSome of these custom gamemodes is the wonderful Monster Hunt, like Assault, but the defending team is always the monsters, and the players are always attacking to get to the end before losing all their lives, or the chaotic 4-Team Capture The Flag. My second favorite is Jailbreak, bbasically Team Deathmatch meets Capture The Flag. Two teams aiming to kill one another and jail them, then watch them get executed, sometimes able to have prisoners of either team pit against one another in a 1v1 where the winner goes free, and it's possible to release your team by going into enemy territory.This game is simply one of my favorites. It's always been one of my favorite as I can't remember a time it wasn't installed on my computer. Even just to play the Campaign, I've never forgotten this game, and I always have had a copy of it since I first played it when I was 10. If you like FPS games, or the idea of a gladiatorial arena-style game tickles your fancy, then pick this game up. There's more custom content than what I suggested like voice packs, models, even Total Conversions and far more.I recommend this due to it simply being one of the best Arena FPS' to ever appear on the market. I don't think you'll regret your purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is - in my honest opinion - the best multiplayer game of all time. The gameplay is perfect, the weapons are fantastic, unique and really fun to use. In the singleplayer the A.I. is challenging in a way that it will punish you many times, especially on the higher difficulties. All the game modes are awesome. There's plenty of value and a huge variety of maps. Overall, the game has zero issues and it's a must-have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game, I really enjoy playing with the impressive AI bots. This goes to show that every FPS game with deathmatches should have impressive AI bots. What if there's an old game that nobody ever plays anymore and you can't play online anymore? What if the servers are shut down? Unreal Tournament still has online deathmatches, but I prefer playing online. Games like Counter-Strike and Quake needed AI bots like this.FINAL RATING: 96 out of 100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is it. The best online multiplayer first person shooter of all time where the best of the best of all time first person shooters slayed each other and battled everyday for years till they honed their skills and reactions so fine that mere mortals could barely survive a fraction of a second before being fragged, embarrassed, with bruised egos and some even tearing up at the realization they could not even get in the game ;) The community support was incredible and there's HUGE amounts of add on software available. Not sure of the online multiplayer community anymore but the last time I checked there was hundreds of die-hards still slaying waste to all comers. Awesome game with low graphics power requirements by 2014 standards. ZsZ clan is still hurting and puckering from the hurt I wreaked upon them as I decimated all their best and made them cry foul pings and unfair advantage because I had a cable modem. They eventually created situations, developed a fictitious slander and banned me from the server because I was sniping them down their own server rankings and they could not have that on their clan's server. Shameful stuff for sure and very not sportsmanlike too. I was in global top 50 for less than a week at one time long before the ZsZ clan debacle and it was fun but when I got around to the ZsZ clan I was just a home hobbyist having some clean fun ;) The game is lotsa fun and there's lotsa MODs and add-ons and for a inexpensive PC this is a very good buy. beware the online requests to install small files for server connection and security needs. Don't let them load anything into your pooder .... nasty stuff for sure but the game is awesome ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												During the whole Quake<->Unreal split, players to the twitch generation of FPS gaming either went Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament. Personally I took the Quake route but I have played my fair share of the Unreal games. What I like about UT is the balance of the weapons, every weapon (including the melee) has a 1 hit kill chance if used properly. The difficulty of the AI range from easy to Godlike so anyone can pickup the game and play if no multiplayer servers are available. If you can handle playing twitch fps or were active during the Q3/UT days then Godlike will fit your needs. However if you're only good at CoD/realistic shooters then welcome to Tier 0.

What are you waiting for? no FPS has come even close to the perfection that this game is since it's release.Fast, tight controls, graphics that aged really well for a 1999 game, satisfying weapons, creative level design, no microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no DLC scams, no season pass garbage, just straight up FPS goodness as it should be.Buy it!

												This is probably my favorite online game ever made. IMO the graphics hold up fine today and even if you don't like them the huge modding community this game had has provided texture packs and replacements for items. This game holds up fantastically today gameplay wise, there really hasn't been another arena shooter that captured UT99's gameplay, not even the later games. This, along with Quake 3, were the shooters that kept busy for years until call of duty came along. Everyone should give it a try once. Even if it's with bots. The online community is still somewhat alive though. If I had to rate it by my experience of playing it today, I'd probably give it around a 8.8/10, but with my nostalgia, I think this was the game of my childhood and I still enjoy it today. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even though it's old it still stands up as an ideal for other FPS games to strive for, and a painful number of them fall flacidly short in comparison to the maniacal girth of UT99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Curator-esque Review Only your skills and map knowledge will save you here.  The AI of the bots is brutal, the soundtrack thumping, and the arenas are classics that hold up despite their age.  Online multiplayer is dead and gone so realize you are buying this game for its singleplayer experience. Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition Review  Story In 2291, the New Earth Government (NEG) legalizes ""consentual murder"" as a form of entertainment.  Due to an increase in reports of violence among deep space miners, the NEG sees the organization of gladitorial tournaments as a means of redirecting unrest among the working class for profit.  The largest mining corporation, Liandri Mining Corp. (LMC) begins providing arenas for the Tournament as well as broadcasting the event throughout the known galaxy.  LMC's profits soar as athletes, condemned criminals, mercenaries, soldiers, and regular citizens travel across the universe to compete.The game takes place fifty years after the NEG's unprecedented decision.  As one character from a diverse roster of participants, the player competes in the Tournament's various events for unique reasons.  The ultimate goal?  Depose Xan Kriegor, the undefeated Tournament champion, and claim universal renown. Gameplay A first person shooter (FPS) in the truest sense, Unreal Tournament 1999 (UT99) sees players compete against AI and/or human opponents in a variety of game modes.  Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch have players racing to be the first to get a set amount of kills alone or as a team respectively.  Domination sees two teams fighting over control points, with every point controlled adding to the respective team's total; the first team to accrue a set amount of points wins.  Capture the Flag has the teams capture the enemy flag for points while defending their own at the same time.  Finally, Assault has one team in an offensive role while the opposite team plays a defensive role.  Maps that assualt take place on require the attacking team to complete a series of objectives while the defending team prevents them from doing so.  At the end of a round of Assault, the teams switch roles and the now attackers must either complete more of the assualt than the former attackers or complete the map in less than the time it took the former attackers to complete.  The singleplayer portion of the game involves playing through a certain amount of a particular gametype until the next Tournament rung is unlocked.  Each time you start a new rung, there is an optional tutorial level explaining how to play that particular gamemode.  Singleplayer is essentially matches against AI opponents who can be set to various difficulty levels.  The bot AI is one of the great things about UT99 because bots behave in a challenging, almost adaptive manner. Each game mode features maps designed solely for that gamemode with the exception of a few overlapping arenas.  Assault maps are the most linear whereas Deathmatch maps are more open. Some arenas are symmetric while others asymetric and complicated.  A few arenas even feature a special condition, such as ""Morpheus"" which takes place atop a stratospheric skyscraper and features low gravity for huge jumps.  Filling these outlandish arenas is a plethora of futuristic and conventional weaponry.  Take the plasma rifle for example: primary fire is a straight beam, secondary fire is a slower moving orb, but if you shoot the secondary projectile with the primary fire, it detonates causing a small explosion.  Most weapons feature an alternate fire mode and can only be reloaded by picking up ammo scattered around the arena.  Steady aim is important as most weapons chew through ammo fairly quick.  Health vials and various armor pieces can be picked up to increase your longevity although respawning is instantaneous, giving gameplay a brisk and hectic pace.  There are also items scattered around arenas to pick up like the anti-grav boots for huge jumps and scuba gear for underwater breathing.  Finally, modifiers can be found in somewhat hard to reach places that can boost your damage with weapons, health, or even make you invisble.  Knowing arena layouts, the limitations of each weapon, and where modifiers spawn is essential to victory.Unfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer as there are not many games to be found online.  Although sold as UT99: Game of the Year Edition, this version on Steam does not in fact include the game of the year content.  Ambitious players can attempt to track the extra content down however I have read that the missing content does not amount to much anyway compared to the base game.  Design Every match in UT99 begins in free roam mode.  This allows you to fly around the map and learn where all the weapon/item spawns are, where the enemy base is, and where conflicts are likely to occur.  Free roam is also nice in that you can see just how detailed certain arenas can be.  Built on the same engine as Unreal (Epic Game's 1998 title), UT99 is definitely an old looking game in terms of chracter and environmental models.  However, every arena feels unique in its tone and atmosphere.  From the lighting to the architectural theme of each map, the level design feels thoughtful as well as considerate of the type of game UT99 is.  Adding to the frantic nature of the game is a nice electronic soundtrack featuring lots of drum and bass.  Who can forget the music of ""Facing Worlds""?  Characters are voiced appropriately over-the-top and the weapons sound sharp and distinct.  The game features a thorough list of options so players can tailor and mod the game as they see fit.    Final Thoughts Long before I was a PC gamer, I played the Infogrames Playstation 2 port of UT99.  It featured updated textures and additional maps not found here on the Steam version, but aiming was clunky with an analog stick.  I purchased the steam version largely out of nostalgia and a desire to play the game as it was meant to be played.  In these respects, UT99 did not disappoint me even though I was retreading ground.  Unfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer or with friends as there are not many games to be found online.  From the soundtrack to fast-paced tone of the game, UT99 and its 2004 successor are  the  arena shooters in my mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since this is hands down my favorite video game of all time ever, I feel it deserves a very heartfelt review.+One of the most iconic and unique weapon sets ever. each weapon has a different use depending on the situation, and each one has an alternate fire mode making them more versatile then your standard shotgun or assault rifle.+A multitude of complex maps. In an age where we pay 60 bucks for a bare handful of maps (looking at you Battlefront), Its hard to belive that you can get a game that has nearly a hundred maps to play on for $10, each one unique and hard to memorize. This game contains some of the most iconic maps in video game history, including Curse, Deck 16, and the amazing Facing Worlds.+Silky smooth controls. This game revolutionized the way movement was handled in first person shooters, and the movement mechanics still rival some of today's triple A titles. Thise game takes dodging bullets to a whole new level.+mutators! bored with your run-of-the-mill deathmatch? apply the low grav mutator for some mid-air combat, or the insta-frag mutator for one-shot death carnage.+Programmable and customizable AI. If youre feeling like a challenge, you can crank up the AI level to godlike, or if you're a filthy casual looking to blow off some steam, set the AI to average or novice and blow them to bits with your flak cannon.-Graphics are of course not that great, but what do you expect from a game that came out in 1999?-video settings can sometimes be a bit wonky. In order to get a resolution higher than 800x600, some messing around with the video drivers are required, as the default driver can't handle any more than that.Why are you still reading? just get the game already.

												5/5, easy. My review is based on the GOG (DRM-free), GamersGate (DRM-free), and PC CD-ROM versions of UTGOTY/UT99. So my Steam stats don't paint the whole picture.PROS:+ Fast and frenetic gameplay.+ Fun in both multiplayer (online or LAN) and single player campaign.+ Instant action mode against bots is still a blast.+ ""Mutators"" jazz up the action even more.+ LOW hardware requirements; netbook friendly. I've played UTGOTY on an old Lenovo ThinkPad T61 with only an Intel 965 GPU, ran just fine.+ Linux compatibility via Wine or the UT99_451_REV4 patch*.I've tested UTGOTY on Linux Mint 17.3 and Linux Lite 2.8, runs silky smooth.+ Mac compatibility via Wineskin found here: http://paulthetall.com/unreal-tournament-mac/ I've tested UTGOTY with the Wineskin on an iMac 2009 model running Yosemite, runs great.CONS:- Graphics are 6th generation (PlayStation 2 era).*UT99_451_REV4.tar.gz can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw5Xv02Yq2HrR3lTUTNfbmlqMWc/editSimply unzip the folder and copy all the files and folders to Unreal Tournament, merging folders and overwriting files when prompted. Then, launch in Linux via the ut99_play.sh launcher.UT2004 is another rocker, with better graphics and vehicular combat. However, UTGOTY/UT99 has lower hardware requirements making it more accessible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is my first love. I have spent more time playing this game than any other game I've owned. Bought it back in 99'. I was in the ""GODZ"" clan my name was ""Kratos"".I downloaded it when I saw it on steam and could not believe people are still playing it.This game was the flag ship for 1st person shooters. (Beats the hell out of Quake 3).I have always built my own Rigs.And this game is a huge reason I still do today. I remember going from 500mb Ram to 1Gig.It ran on 1Gig of Ram!!!If you're young enough to have never played it the 10 bucks is worth it.Give it a try!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament was one of my favourite games growing up and it is still very playable today with a thriving community of veteran fans and newcomers alike. I was expecting the game to be extremely dated and bland but actually; it's as fast and fun as it ever was and is still absolutely brilliant with amazing memories.No camping, no IED's, no grenade spamming, no quickoping, no mic spam, no fanboys, no microtransactions, no netcode woes and no commercial nonsense that plagues today's premium multiplayer games. UT represents the golden age of gaming and still played, enjoyed and loved by many now. It's fast, frantic and pure fun and at just a few quid; it's worth sacrificing a couple of beers for hours upon hours of nostalgia and enjoyment. Ps; better than Titanfall;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still as much fun today as it was back when it was first released. Truly a game that stands the tests of time.A frantic, fast-paced FPS that's filled with action. High game speed, little to no cover, and very few places to hide. The weapons are quite unique and with each weapon having 2 firing modes, the different playstyles one can adopt are plenty. A game that is still a lot of fun to play competitive against your friends in.The amount of game modes offered are decent enough, considering its age. Most are pretty standard game modes that one usually expects from games with competitive multiplayer, but it does offer some that stand out such as Assault. It also has a fair amount of maps, most of which are very memorable and iconic. There are also a lot of fan made custom maps that are easy to put into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only game that ever managed to capture what was fun about first person shooters and gaming in general. for anyone who is a fan of COD, i say do yourself a favor and try this game and see what a REAL shooter is like. Theres no BS leveling system, or classes or guns that you bring into the matches, just you, your map knowlege, and your skill. If you ever want to know what pure fun is like buy this game and play the main tournament mode, you will not be disapointed, and if you like multiplayer, theres still TONS of servers out there to play on.NOTE: this version does not come with ChaosUT. If you want to play chaosUT and you're on Windows 7 or higher you may need to fix your UMOD File association, which means youre gonna need a registry fix which is a semi-lengthy process and can be frustrating.

												I litteraly was playing this game before i knew how to read or was in school.  After that, i was looking for it for the longest time, not knowing it was on steam until now.  Overall, this game is the master of its genre, and is not to be underestimated because it is older.I would rate this 10/10Would ignore education again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best game I ever played. I loved 'Two Face' the map. Just scoping the head and watching the blood split out like nothing when I was 6 years old gave me a achievement sense. Nothing beats this game. Anyway, does anyone feels like ♥♥♥♥ing screaming/beating at 'Gamers' as they don't even know UNREAL TOURAMENT? like who doesn't know the game that could truly go TOE-TO-TOE with QUAKE. I did a 2 minute research on why in the blue hell is Unreal Tourament not as popular or MORE popular than Quake even though it is such a good game. I found nothing. Not going to dig further as it's 4.03 AM as I am making this review. This game is still a game that can go against CS:GO if it was recreated. It need advertising, a good fan base. It's a  really good game, my childhood game. I was playing this non-stop until my Dad showed me another game, combat arms. He thought Unreal Tourament was too brutal. Anyway, GET THIS GAME.GET THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!10/10 would play again if I was used to it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, here I am at 6 AM writing this review on my first game ever played.This game series was sort of a joyride for the first few Unreal Engines - all the way up to UT2K4.I'll always miss this game and the fun I had with it. So many servers are still active to this day despite coming out in 1999, being the main competitor of Quake at the time. This game stuck in my head for so many years and I still listen to its amazing soundtracks. I first got it back sometime when I was really young, and despite not knowing what I was doing then, I played the crap out of this game nonetheless. If you get the game (which I heavily recommend you do on all levels) I'd try out Monsterhunt as a gamemode eventually but don't forget to try offline with bots. With all the mutators and modifications you can make to your private games it is endless joy. There is also an offline vs bots Tournament (hence the name) where you can climb the ladders of different gamemodes to fight the final boss who I will not spoil for you, but is also my favorite UT character.Enjoy!
