												This has open world elements that are fun to explore on a horse or a ATV but can be frustrating when hunting prey. The graphics in this game are really old looking and could have been better. The gameplay mechanics could of made this game great but instead made you feel very stiff. Its fun to find animals to hunt but if you tick off the wrong animal it could cost you your life. There are fun animals to shoot like the elephant, bear, and the standard deer. But this game could of done alot better. I don't suggest this game to any diehard hunters because you will be saddened by what isn't in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very fun game, you can do many things and you may do whatever you would like without too many limitations.You can hunt 8 different areas including the Southern-Central-Northern Rockies, where you are bound to have successful hunts of many different species. The Southwest, where you can hunt desert animals in the hot, dry cactus filled valleys. The South Central Plains, where the dry weather with beating sun will dwell you into a world of hunting successfully many animals, from deer to bison. The Upper Midwest, where the biggest bucks around can be hunted, mixing with bears and a swath of turkey. The Pacific Northwest, where you can hunt the Western North America and Canada- you're bound to have a nice elk or cougar hunt around these vast lands. Lastly, Africa, where exotic hunts await, hunt Kudu, Lions, Elephants, and Boars, in the hot, dry, arid lands of wild Africa.You can hunt 16 animals ranging from Wild Turkey to Elephants in the nature-filled maps that are put in front of you. Just remember, some animals you can hunt peacefully and easily, but some may cost you your LIFE, if your movements and actions are wrong to a species.You are set with a wide variety of weapons to choose from to go on your trips. Remember, choose the right caliber that suits you and the animal for ethical hunting, the weapon you use is up to what you enjoy. The weapons are ranged in types, you are allowed to use bows, handguns, rifles, and shotguns- all the weapons you can enjoy while setting foot in the dirt of the woods.But now, we unfortunately have to go with the flaws.First off, the repetitive, yet annoying walking sound is just terrible, just ignore that. What's worse is the painly slow walking that does not resemble anything close to a human's average walking speed.Second, physics are a bit wonky- with the vehicles you sometimes just randomly fly all over unrealisticly. Also, when you take down an animal with your weapon(s), the animal just stops abruptly and falls over on it's side. Bullet physics are finely realistic though.Third, I don't know if this happened to anybody else, but- after about 18 hours of gameplay everytime I hit the, ""Play"" button, and I get a message saying, ""Corrupt Installation| [missing config file]"". I tried deleting and re-downloading the game, but it still doesn't work. This is very annoying for me, I have been dying to play for a while, if you have a solution, please reply. I use a Windows 8 PC, a fast one, too, by the way.But I don't think that will stop me from recommending this game, this is an awesome game. I recommend it for people like me who want fun during their times, but I DON'T recommend it for die-hard hunters looking for an ENTIRELY realistic hunting game. If you want some of the most accurate hunting games, I recommend theHunter and Deer Hunter 2005, although this is a pretty accurate game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy if you want to run it under win 10. It is far from compatible with win 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
