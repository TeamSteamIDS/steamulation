												World-altering platformers are almost a dime a dozen these days, but when this game was released it received praise for being quirky and innovative.Even now it's difficult to argue against that, the game has a habit of pulling a something new and somewhat interesting mechanic out of the hat every time you start feeling like you're getting used to it.On the other hand, and probably far more important, the game is not fun to play. The growth of mechanics become boring - or even frustrating - sometimes before you've finished seeing them for the first time.It feels very much like a university game design project, made to demonstrate a combination of physics and creative obstacles. That might be because it is a university game design project. I'm not sure.The game certainly had a lot of potential to be fun. Indeed for the latter half of the main game I was having fun, wondering what would happen next. But the game commits four cardinal sins each of which could ruin any game.Firstly, some of the mechanics are almost unplayable. The flint rocks and the spring-reeds are particularly worthy of note as elements that bring a sense of dread every time they appear.Secondly, the collision detection is unreliable at best. Sometimes you can survive a surprisingly long fall or getting crushed by rocks, at other times you can die from a much smaller rock touching you with barely any movement.Third, some of the additional challenges and achievements are terribly thought out.The game has three bonus stages that are on a par with I Wanna Be The Guy for difficulty. There's an achievement for beating those, which makes sense. There are also achievements for beating 5 levels with limited rotations, or in a certain time, or without dying too much. Those make sense too.What doesn't make sense is the achievement for beating ALL levels - including those unreasonably hard ones - with limited rotations, in a certain time, and without dying too much. And further still, the one for doing all that with the fewest rotations possible, a ridiculously low time and without dying AT ALL.There are also three speedrun achievements, the latter two of which rely almost entirely on getting lucky with the placement of randomised projectiles. Replaying the same twenty minutes over and over until it works right is not fun.The last sin the game commits is adding content badly. Following its PC release a Wii version was made, which allowed for dynamic world rotation instead of the 90-degree locked turns in the PC version. The additional bonus levels and challenges were then retrofitted into the PC version, but the smooth rotation was not even though many of them were designed for it. This makes the PC version much harder than it should be for much of the content.I need to emphasize that finding the challenges unreasonable is not the whining of a bad player. I'd accept such a claim for middling no-death runs in Super Meat Boy, but these so-called challenges are just not viable for anyone. Experienced players unanimously conclude that including the bonus levels within the challenge modes when they were all added was either an oversight or a mistake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I punched out of And Yet It Moves after about 20 minutes the first time I played it, and that was so many years ago I couldn't remember why. I started it up again recently and spent some time getting re-adjusted to the jumping and spinning, but it didn't take long to refresh my memory on its failings. AYIM feels like a platformer built to be the antithesis of platformers, a game that embodies everything that platformers aren't. It works at what it does, mind you, it's just that what it does isn't at all fun.I don't think there's a plot to And Yet It Moves, you're just trying to get your mop-haired avatar to the exit of each level. The terrain of each cave or forest or wherever you find yourself is impossible to navigate with just his plodding gait and weak jump so you are empowered to rotate the world around him to proceed. Using this power you'll saunter up the walls and ceilings of caverns, bend around the edges of cliffs, and navigate boulders and planks through mazes of ledges. You'll encounter a few new gimmicks as you progress as well, including animals that must be fed to pass and breakaway platforms to watch out for.This sort of puzzling is bare-bones for 2017 but it was a clever twist on a tired genre back in 2009 when it came out. AYIM certainly helped pave the way for other world-bending puzzlers that came after it, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best example of it. You can only rotate the world 90 degrees at a time, for example, which can make some slopes and complex cliffs hard to navigate. You'll also be doing a lot of flipping from the top to the bottom of platforms and the interplay of momentum and stiff rotation complicates your maneuvers. And I know I mentioned other gimmicks but they're honestly pretty sparse, leaving the majority of the gameplay to just making the same jumps and flips over and over.What really kills this game, though, is the fall damage. There's a lot of circling around and doubling back in AYIM's level design, so to prevent players from taking shortcuts or coming up with their own routes through levels, anything longer than about a six-foot drop kills you stone dead. Actually it's not even the drop that kills you, it's the momentum, so if you get going too fast on a moving platform or stay airborne while rotating for too long, you'll also splatter. It's so bad that on some platforms you have to flip onto the backside of, if you jump too high you'll explode when you land where you're supposed to.This is what I was talking about when I said And Yet It Moves is the antithesis of platformers. Fall damage is easily the worst part of any game that includes it, going all the way back to the original Donkey Kong. It adds nothing as a game element, it only serves to limit players in how they can navigate a level. The same end can be accomplished with walls without having to kill your player, or with pits or spikes so that incidental jumps aren't deadly if they happen to go too high. AYIM is doubly terrible in this regard because speed, not distance, is lethal, enforcing a slow and plodding pace to a game in a genre where some of its best games are high-speed romps.And Yet It Moves works fine as the puzzle game it is designed to be. My problem is how that design prevents AYIM from utilizing the best parts of its genre and turns them into frustrating punishments. It gives you large, sprawling levels of caves and trees and whatever the hell the third world is because I didn't get that far, and then murders you if you try to hop around it or experience it too fast. Outside of the puzzles though there's very little to the game, with no secrets or unlockables to chase. The collage artstyle is fine but underutilized with only three environments and the soundtrack is so minimal and ambient that it makes the game feel even emptier. I doubt I could have seen anything to recommend about AYIM back when it released, and I definitely can't at present.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing the free version at a time when level turning mechanics and physic was not so common as it is nowadays. The individual graphical style in combination with the sound effects open a little charming world consisting of a collage of textures and self made noises.Some years later i got the commercial release of the game as part of the humble bundle. As physic games where already common at that time i was not motivated to play the game as I tough i already new its style and it had nothing new for me.It was only some months later after visiting the studio behind this game on an open day, that i installed it to try it out with a controller in front of my tv. In relative short time I was sucked into the game and only after finishing the whole game, I was able to put away my controller.And Yet It Moves is a puzzle platformer with occasionally high level of difficulty in which you control gravity at 90 degrees. Story wise the game takes you on a personal horror psychedelic trip trough caves, jungles and colors.I had a real grate time trying to survive the craziest jumps while turning the world upside down.

												After leaving this game in my backlog for a long time, I decided to give this game a try again. My first impression a while back wasn’t very positive. The controls were very much frustrating, so I lost interest in the game very quickly. Now the controls are still frustrating from time to time, but after a while you get used to it. Sometimes it seems though that certain actions depend a lot on trial and error. Also, the bamboo stick was annoying and I would much have preferred to not have it in the game. Also annoying is the fact you die very easy. The game looks nice and the puzzles are challenging, but not too difficult. The music and sound effects are irritating. Conclusion: average. Nice to play a few times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS:- A simple concept with interesting mechanics that, for my surprise, indeed stimulated my mind the entire game;- Infinite lives (important since you die very constantly);- Numerous waypoints throughout the game, so you won't have to start all over again after each death, you'll return to the last waypoint which is only some seconds behind;- Waypoints also point to where you should head next (sometimes you may lose direction after rotating the world many times);- Lightweight (I played on a laptop with integrated graphic processor);- Have Linux support;- Funny, creative paper collage graphical style (though some people think it's ugly);- Cheap;- No bugs found;CONS:- Music sometimes gets annoying (but you can turn it off while still leaving the effect sounds on);- A few spots on the game (about 3) are extremely more difficult than all the rest of the game (points where I really got angry);- Short (just like many other good indie titles), but it's only a problem if you like it already;CONCLUSION:Recommended. Despite those 3 spots of frustration, the game got me addicted for some hours. Maybe I have a better intuitive notion about inertia after playing this game... :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most creative, thoughtful titles I've played in a long time. Personally, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't like this game unless you just are not into platformers. Challenges are well thought out, game doesn't overshare about how to do things/it leaves a lot up to the player to figure out (this is a good thing). Going back to play more. Seriously amazing game if you are on the fence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You now exist only in a 2D paper world, the concept of the third dimension is as alien to you as mastering the space-time continunum of the fourth is to us. Fear not that a single drop of water may destroy everything you hold dear and instead embrace your ability to rotate your collaged environment, to progress through its many nuances. ""Progress to what?"" I hear the cries rain out...  maybe the goal you seek is a sacred grail, tales of which are mentioned only in hushed tones - an origami crane, the untold, abject horror of your realisation at the presence of a henceforth unknown dimension that can be grasped by the folding of your corporeal bodies. There is no turning back, a new world awaits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AYIM is a platformer whose gameplay you've probably seen before. It's classic running & jumping combined with the ability to rotate the game world in 90° and 180° steps. While this core gameplay is not too innovative, I liked the additionial mechanics that came with it, like rotating the world to change the direction of a flame in order to burn an obstacle.This game's soundtrack seems to be composed entirely by human voices, which is nice and quirky to listen to. Like the audio, the graphical presentation is pleasantly different as well. In the later levels the game gets really trippy, moreso than you can see on the screenshots. Overall, AYIM seems somewhat strange, but not in a bad way at all.Game's pretty short, you won't need more than 2 or 3 hours to beat it, though there's additional play modes like time trial or survival and achievements to get.I had fun playing AYIM, but because of its short length I would recommend getting it when it's on sale, say.. 5 bucks at most.

												And Yet it Moves is a platforming game that had quite the unique control scheme when it came out. With WASD you control your character, and with the arrow keys you can control the world. Using a mixture of your own movement along with rotating the world, you pass through varied environments to reach your goal.The platforming in this game can be very difficult at times, and some sections feel like they come down to luck, especially when you have to rely on a swinging platform, which don't automatically return to their position after you fail. There are plenty of checkpoints scattered through the levels, so at least when you do fail you can get back to where you were pretty quickly.I found the music to be really grating, and I turned it off after a bit. The graphics look pencil drawn, which can be impressive when done well, but I didn't find them to be all that attractive. World manipulation was at one time pretty unique, but now it seems it makes its way into almost every platform game. While this was a good gimmick upon release, it doesn't really hold up years later when its so common. There is not enough else to hold this game together. Add the poor music, visuals, and the fact that I got a little dizzy after making the world spin around, and I wouldn't recommend this game.Grade: C-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a design project with puzzle mechanics, you control your character and solve the puzzles by rotating the world around you and using your momentum. No story (well, it's a puzzle game, of course), sufficient controls, trippy music, dubbed sound effects. The puzzles are ok, but sometimes, due to the camera following you too close, you are left to guess where to go. 3 hours top to finish the game, the replay value lies in the different challanges (limited rotations, time trial etc).Not exactly recommended for the full price, wait for sale or indie bundle.

												And Yet It Moves is a puzzle platformer, where you spin the world around, or the character, depending on how you look at it, to progress through the level. Sadly though the game is not difficult at all, I have managed to beat it a few times over the past few months without even trying to be honest, and with that, the length of the game is very short as well.The art style is nice, and I really appreciate the sounds here. I especially enjoy the noises your character makes when you fall and break into little pieces of paper. Pttshhhh!I seem to remember getting this in a bundle a few years ago, so I don't feel as cheated out of my money as I would if I purchased it, but I'd only really recommend picking this up when it drops below 75% off.

												This is a super creative and downright fun game but unfortunately it is over way way way to soon. It is only 10 bucks or so on the virtual console so it is well worth a purchase and play-through especially if you like plat-formers but at the end of the day it falls short of truly being a brilliant game. This is a plat-former where you don't move the character but instead you move the world around the character!! that's a bit of a lie as your character can run and jump but that's it. This opens up all sorts of fun and clever puzzles that make you think. The game can also become pretty challenging but it is just too short. The graphics are super stylized and fit the wii perfectly. I recommend this game to anybody but i just wish it were a full fledged game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It definitely comes across as a bit dated nowadays since physics-manipulating puzzle-platformers are a dime a dozen. But it's still a smart challenge and applies some fun twists to its formula. The art design definitely suggests ""capstone project"" but it's consistent–– e.g. the paper aesthetic informs the ways in which you die throughout the levels with their different hazards. It's also a bit comical at times when what appears to be a picture of a gorilla cut from an issue of National Geographic blocks your path.Overall: pretty short, but solid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an interesting take on the platformer genre. You're quite vulnerable and danger is everywhere, and if that wasn't bad enough, you constantly encounter situations that won't allow you to progress.However, you have one power that can help you muddle through: you can rotate the world around you at will. The objects present in it (including yourself) will realign with the new direction of gravity, opening up creative ways of advancing through the levels, but also tricky pitfalls such as the fact that that heavy boulder that was behind you is now suddenly right above you, and in free fall.I wouldn't describe it as the most engaging platformer out there, but that's just one man's opinion.

												And Yet It Moves is a flippy, tippy, topsy-turvy 2D puzzle platformer based almost entirely around the idea of revolving the world around you to solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges. Its ease of play, requiring only a jump button and three types of world rotation (Left, Right, and 180 degrees), makes it a cinch to pick up and understand. The mileage the developers got out of such simple mechanics is pretty amazing. From start to finish, you're presented with tons of unique challenges and brain teasers to sort out, with ideas hardly ever repeating aside from making sure you're mastering the fundamentals. And Yet It Moves is always throwing something new at you, which makes it easy to wanna try ""just one more level"" before you finally either shut it down for the night or complete it.  The only real issues with the game crop up with the sometimes wonky physics. At times it's hard to gauge when a fall will kill you and other times objects in a stage can react a little inconsistent creating some scenarios that will lead to multiple deaths, or on in one case I encountered, leave you stuck completely, which required a stage restart. That said, the bad doesn't in any way outweigh the good, and if you're into puzzley platformers then you definitely need to give this one a spin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And Yet It Moves is an indie puzzle-platformer, released back when indie puzzle-platformers weren't a commodity yet.The mechanisms are simple: navigate levels by running, (weakly) jumping and, more importantly, by rotating the level around you. Rotations are made by steps of 90° or 180°. You have to be careful though, because you can only fall from so high before getting crushed to death in the process. And you keep your momentum even after rotating, so don't expect to cheat death by a last-minute rotation. You will suffer tens or hundreds of deaths, but AYIM remains causal and mostly frustration-free, thanks to infinite lifes and the most generous distribution of checkpoints to ever grace a video game. Which also makes the gotcha-unfair kind of deaths much more tolerable than in other games.The graphics are made of paper collages and give AYIM a look that remains unique and distinct, even all these years after its release. I sometimes wished for more variety though, as there only are 4 or so ""themes"".""Music"" is made of blip-bloop noisy soundscapes, which works very well  but, again, more variety would have been welcome.Beating the game should take about two hours, and I think that's about tight: the end came just before it would have started getting too repetitive. If you're so inclinded, various modes (speed runs, ...) are available to add replayability, but I think most people will be content to just play through this relatively basic game once.Overall, AYIM has enough personality to warrant a recommendation. It's certainly much better than what I expected from the ""mixed"" Steam user reviews. Because it was offered in several bundles, it lies unplayed in many people's backlog. If that's your case, I encourage you to give it a try. I think it's good enough to recommend a purchase, but there's no question that it's a bit short to justify the non-sale price tag.

												And Yet It Moves is a quirky little platformer with the interesting mechanic of rotating the level to progress.  While some games have used it as a gimmick for a single level or area, none have really explored the mechanic in the way that AYIM does.  The entire world rotates around the player-character, quite literally, and not only does the rotation effect his gravity, but that of the physics within the world.  The game uses this shifting gravity to require the player to solve not only platforming puzzles, but puzzles where the physics of in-game objects need to be manipulated through a maze, or a flame needs to be pointed in a certain direction.Unfortunately, for all its uniqueness, And Yet does have a few glaring flaws that can make it difficult to enjoy.  Sometimes it's unclear where to travel next, requiring the player to just hurdle himself around the level trying to figure it out.  Some areas feel unfairly trial-and-error-based, killing the player with a hurdle that they couldn't possibly have known about, requiring them to go back to the checkpoint and retry now that they actually know what's expected of them.  The second act in the jungle comes to a screeching halt when the player is required to navigate platforming challenges that use bamboo stick trampolines with clumsy timing.  The player needs to gain enough air before rotating in order to make it to the next platform, but the game doesn't do a very good job of indicating when the jump button is meant to be pushed.  This leads to a lot of trial and error where even when getting it right, the player can still be left confused as to the timing needed.Over-all though, it's a unique gem in a sea of copycat wannabes.  For all it's flaws, I still give this game a recommendation simply out of its uniqueness.  While the game does admittedly drag for the second act, it makes-up for it in the third act.  The game is at its weakest when it wants the player to fumble about with clumsy physics like in Act 2, but it's at it's absolute best when it's exploring ways to challenge the way the player needs to think around the rotation physics to navigate through an area.  That's why Act 3 really shines; it keeps the physics light, and instead focuses on requiring fast thinking while the player navigates through some well-designed obstacle courses.And Yet It Moves is far from perfect, but chip past the slog of the levels that don't work that well, and it can be easy to see the diamond hiding behind it all.  If you're the kind of gamer who doesn't like dealing with the bugbears of an inexperienced developer, then it might be better to move on, but if you're someone who's willing to let unique gameplay excuse a few poor design choices, then this is a game that cannot be missed.  You'll be hardpressed to find another like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AYIM is an original game that separates itself from other 2D platformers. It's imaginitive with its unique art style and innovates on gameplay. Those who like platformers will surely enjoy this title throughout all the levels. It's kind of a shame that the game ends too soon though. It definitely left me wanting more. Overall it's a decent indie title to own along with the likes of Braid, Super Meat Boy, BIT.TRIP RUNNER.// Roth Sothy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple, somewhat clumsy, tiny puzzle platformer. In terms of gameplay, it's neither innovative nor particulary well done. In terms of aesthetic, it's weird, surreal and -- well, it's memorable, which is more than I can say about lots of other puzzle platformers out there. So, since Steam doesn't allow neutral reviews, thumbs up -- by a tiny margin of the game's looks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""And Yet It Moves"" is a short (assuming you don't want to get all the achievments), but inspiring, experience.The game is a 2D, indie, side-scoller, but not like a standard ""Super Mario"".The player has to move a paper character through a long series of puzzles and platforms; the twist is that the player both moves the character and the scenary, changing the direction of gravity, so that the character will often have to be moved by the rotating world's gravitational attraction.The gameplay is really solid, and insanely fun, with a nicely calibrated difficulty; the game is not particulary hard, but it makes your brain work in a pleasent way.Mind that the craracter can easily be torn apart, because of its nature, so you'll always have to be gentle with scenario's movements, and you'll also have to avoid the many black holes in the map.The main reason why i think this game is a masterpiece is its art direction; the game looks astonishing! everything is made of some sort of ""decoupage"", of different animated canvases.We see pictures of leaves, doodles, terrain, rocks, all assembled in a very very good way, and the game's landscapes are very diverse.The last part will really surprise you, visually, and it's something you rarely see in a game.This game is also a 360° sensorial experience, because the audio itself is brilliant; nature sounds mixed with man made sounds (with the mouth, but in an elegant way)In the end, if you like puzzle games with an inspiring, dreamy and relaxing atmosphere, this definetly is a ""Must-Buy"".

												A wonderful game with a torn paper aestetic that's quite lovely. The minimal beatbox music is fun but I would have preferred a more fleshed-out score. In regards to gameplay, the controls are a bit sketchy with your character being exceptionally floaty and slugglish. The world-rotation mechanic is the cause of a lot of headaches as it's just an odd way to move around and indecision will often lead to death as your character gains momentum the longer you hover in the air.

Product received for free
												Like a lot of people I picked this up from one of the very first (maybe the first?) Humble Bundle deals, so bear in mind I bought this game for dirt cheap.TL;DR:Game is neat but not worth $10. If you like platformers, pick it up on sale for as cheap as you can get it. If you're patient with it's less successful moments of gameplay, it might just provide decent entertainment, if only for a couple of hours. Don't feel bad about passing if you don't own it already. If you do, definitely give it a shot - It deserves that much.Full ReviewIt's a platformer where the core mechanic is the rotation of the world and camera (or the protagonist if you like.) Velocity and momentum are maintained so careful timing is required, per the usual. Game is quite short and there's three chapters that are about an hour in length. The 3rd chapter is marginally longer, though this is a good thing since it's the most fun. It can suffer from being boring and tedious at times (Ch 2), but approaching the end it managed to show some interesting ideas and fairly fun and intuitive problem solving. I think the game was later updated with 3 or 4 bonus levels too, but I haven't tried those out yet. Oh yeah, the aesthetic is pretty cool. I'm glad I finally gave it a shot, but I can't reccomend it because of the price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And Yet It Moves centers itself around a natural twist for the puzzle-platformer genre: if the jump is too long, then make the platform come to you. This ability to freely rotate the level does open up new strategies and keeps things fresh - though the 'freely' of that equation did not survive the transition to PC. In the Steam version of this game, rotation is locked to 90 or 180 degrees at a time, a fact the levels don't seem to have been optimized for. The main 'journey' of the game isn't terribly long - there's no story, implied or otherwise - but it does have the good grace to end before the interesting ideas run out. A variety of challenge modes and a few bonus levels help to extend And Yet It Move's playtime, but this is where its lack of polish really shines (or fails to as the case may be). The little paper avatar is incredibly fragile. A short fall by any other platformer's reckoning will tear him to pieces. The generosity of the main journey's checkpoints ensured this didn't become too much of a nuisance, but the increased difficulty of the bonus levels and the extra restrictions of the challenge modes negated said checkpoint's efforts. This makes for a painful experience, so much so that I found myself judging what I'd enjoyed earlier in a dimmer light. The ambient noises and the constant chime of having reached the next checkpoint are absent from the bonus levels as are the strange collaged images that make up the standard levels, leaving a dull and empty world behind. It's ironic that a game made from torn pages would end feeling rough and a bit flat, but without this sour finishing note, I imagine I would have left pleased - not ecstatic, but pleased at least.

												Reposted here from my blog: http://tetriseyes.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/and-yet-it-moves/I’ve been picking up the Humble Bundles almost neurotically since I learned about them, which has populated my steam library with over a hundred games I’ve never even managed to play. On top of that, I’d found myself avoid computer games habitually since my recent move to Durango, CO, and so I’m not sure I’ll ever get a chance to play, let alone truly appreciate, many of the fantastic independent titles I can now call my own.My aversion aside, I saw As Yet It Moves in my library has a very high meta-score according to Steam; I’d briefly tried the game when I’d purchased my first bundle, but found the controls frustrating and the art bizarre.Oh how wrong was I.Allowing myself to actually play the game, I quickly found it ingenious; the core mechanic is that of a platform game, but you can rotate the world 90 degrees whenever you choose. Simple, and probably not entirely innovative, but it is done so smoothly and so cleverly that I was riveted the whole game through. The puzzles showcased the bizarre logic of a rotating world, and the paper cut-out art became increasingly charming and colorful throughout the levels. The controls occasionally frustrated me, some sort of cue on screen to help me intuit which way I would rotate the camera with each button may have helped me, but ultimately it wasn’t a big deal – and maybe my brain grew a few new connections.I see the studio, Broken Rules, have made a new game called Chasing Aurora… I might just give it a try.

												Fair warning disclaimer: Shortly before this game came out, a friend of mine released a game based on similar mechanics for free, which I found to be more enjoyable (http://runhello.com/p/24 for anyone who wants to check it out), so that kinda colored my opinion of the game, since when I came to it my reaction was one of ""I have already experienced this, done more smoothly."" Now for the actual review.And yet It Moves is a puzzle platformer whose primary mechanic involves rotating the world around your character. The graphical style looks like cutouts from a piece of paper, and remains pretty unique to this day. However, the mechanics/hit detection/acceleration detection can be spotty at times, and the movement feels....un-fluid. Your character pauses every time the world rotates, the movement is slow, acceleration can be difficult to judge so that sometimes you'll die from a fall without expecting, and other times you'll live without any real expectation of doing so.The game's alright - if you're really into puzzle platformers, it's definitely worth a look. It just feels a little rough around the edges, and (particularly this many years after release) the asking price is probably a little steep.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like indie games. In many cases, these are the most original titles around, and they can really suprise you from time to time. But sometimes, a neat idea doesn't carry a game. For example, And yet it moves. Now, I do think that this game does have some pretty interesting gameplay mechanics. So what is the problem you may ask? You may, or may not have noticed that I have only played this game for 30 minutes. The reason for that is this, And yet it moves is quite possibly 1 of the most boring games I have ever played. I am 1 of those people that like to actually finish games that I buy.This is 1 of those rare games that I simpy didn't wanna finish. Usually if I buy a game I will beat it, but I got this game for free which means that I didn't actually buy it, so I didn't have to finish it. I never played this game again, and I propably never will, and I do not regret this choise at all. Boredom is not exactly high on my wishlist when it comes to game features			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the few games I could just not bring myself to finish. The mechanics are interesting, though not especially fun. Several of the levels I played felt wholly reliant on luck rather than skill. On top of that you die extremely easily, sometimes in ways that seem entirely random.This game is not terrible by any means. It's not easy, but not too difficult from what I played. If you're really into platformers, you may enjoy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wouldn't be worth the time even if it were a free flash game. Based around the decent gimmick of rotating the level to progress, but with ugly visuals, bland audio, and poor level design that doesn't support the core mechanic very well. Feels slippery and hard to control, with death by falling damage annoying to judge. Physics can be easily broken to skip parts of levels. More Bundle Crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AYIM is a relatively simple mechanic made blindingly challenging with irregularly-shaped platforms, noisy physics objects, and a protagonist who has a shockingly realistic resistance to falling from a distance 4 times his height. You will probably get angry at this game, but it is a lot of fun too when you get into a groove.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a lot of puzzle platformers.  And Yet It Moves is unique as far as mechanics go.  This game is similar to VVVVVV, but instead of flipping your character up and down, you rotate gravity around yourself.  There are three chapters to play through that take about an hour each.  The game is short; sometimes trippy, sometimes frustrating.The art style is cutout-fashion, reminiscent of an Eric Carle book.  There is no story line.  Supposedly you are the protagonist, trying to find his home in a land of rotating paper.  There is no voice acting.  Sound effects are minimalistic, and the music is not catchy; rather it's an odd beat with the same discordant melody played over and over.  Success feels marred by a constant fear of screwing up, which can be quite easy to do.PROS:-Interesting visual style-Unique game mechanics-Some challenging puzzlesCONS:-Music and sound do not impress-Nonexistent story line-Extremely short-Death is frustratingFinal thoughts:And Yet It Moves has its moments, but these are too few too late to make the game worth purchasing.  Even though I bought it for less than a dollar from a Humble Bundle, it still didn't feel enjoyable.  Puzzle platformer enthusiasts are the only people I can envision having any fun with this game.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle package, so, basically, if I launch it, I get my money’s worth…but I really liked the “tilting” mechanics (you press a button, and you can change the world’s orientation 90 degrees). This leads to some interesting puzzles, and you can’t abuse it because you die from fall damage if you move around in the air too much. For a cheap indie game, I’d recommend it for $2.50 and under.

												Very original idea and quite a good game in the rest of its aspects.But I completely refuse to positively rate this game for the lag in its controls (especially jumping) and the paraplegic character moves. I just had enough of ""indie"" being synonym of crappy controls 90% of the times. Nowadays, originality does not make up for bad controls, it is not acceptable!! We are in the noughties, not it 16-bit Donkey Kong's era, a game should not be released unless it has really been well-polished. It's a fact, nofrickingbody enjoys playing a game with your rear itching.This doesn't but give a bad name to the indie catalog, which holds some true jewels in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the worst game that I have ever purchased on Steam.  Is the gameplay really that bad, you ask?  Honestly I don't know, as not once have I been able to play this game!  Every single time I try to boot this game it leads to a black screen while sounds play in the background, but the game never loads.  Worse yet, this black screen seems to lock my system and the only way to escape it is to physically power off my system and restart it.  Originally I thought this meant that something was wrong with my system, but after scouring the forums for this game it appears that several other people have encountered the exact same problem.  Even worse, if you look at the forums for the developer's second game (Rætikon), you'll see people complaining about not being able to boot that game either!  Long story short, there's obviously something wrong with the way this developer makes their games.  I've tried contacting them through the discussion boards for the game on Steam, but have received no reply.  (To be fair, the developer hasn't posted anything there in over a year and a half.)  I've also messaged support on the official website for this game, but have never received a reply.  I submitted a Steam refund request based on this, but was denied.  In short, I'm stuck paying money for a game that I cannot even play.  This game looks decent enough and those that have played it seem to indicate that it's an ok experience, but there's a very real chance that you might not ever get it to work.  If you feel like gambling perhaps it's worth it, but otherwise there are much better ways to spend your money on Steam.  0/10, as I spent money for nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why I bought the game: BundleWhat I liked about the game: It's simple art style, and eerie music gave me a soothing atmosphere. It's a puzzle game, but it's not that hard - being able to rotate the world was fun, and left me slightly dizzy at times(in a good way). What I didn't like about the game: When you rotate the camera the character does pause, making it feel easier to me, but this may be apart of the game as you can finish a stage without moving or jumping. Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? No, bundle or sale for sure.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant.

												The premise is interesting but overall as a game it isn't very fun or pleasing to look at. You can flip the world around at will so you can turn a long pit into a sideways hallway and so on and aside from simple puzzles thats really about it. The graphics are not very pleasing and I think its mainly due to the contrast with the player character. Had the player looked different or more consistant in some way with the enviroment it would actually make sense. I mainly judge games mainly based on its price with the logic being, if each rehash of COD was 10 dollars in my mind each clone would be totally worth it. The asking price of $10 is not worth it and would only recommend if you can get it under $2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You travel down a hallway with no obvious exit.  There is an opening above you, but you can’t jump high enough to reach it.  What to do?  Easy.  Rotate the world around you.And Yet It Moves is a smart little platformer with unique papercraft graphics. There is no story to speak of, simply a set of gorgeous and inventive levels to jump, fall, and rotate through.Your little hand-drawn guy is pretty fragile and weak, as far as games go.  He can only be moving so fast before impact with the ground or an object will break him, causing the scraps of paper he’s made of to go flying off in different directions.  He also cannot jump very high, at least until you rotate the world and shift gravity 90 degrees.Simply solve the environmental puzzles to move on in each level.  There are no collectables to chase down, no secret rooms to find. This is platforming in a pure, unadulterated sense.  The game does offer challenges to its limited level list through limiting you to not walking, or to a limited number of rotations, or time trials.  These are all enjoyable enough but not necessary to really enjoy the game.  You have to beat every level to unlock those modes anyway.The beautifully simple graphics are a real pleasure.  The ripped paper edges on everything lend a sense of imagination to this game, like you’re watching someone daydream in middle school art class.  The music and sound effects are subtle and quiet, and they don’t try to give this game emotional impact or tension it doesn’t need.  This is a game about exploration and experimentation, not conquest or drama.  Everything about its presentation reflects that.The game can be unforgiving at times, as it can be a little difficult to tell when you are accelerating too much and have no hope to survive a fall.  Luckily checkpoints are pretty evenly spaced.  You will find yourself repeating somewhat simple sections of the level to reach the actual challenging puzzles though.  But I’m really searching to find these minor quibbles.And Yet It Moves is a great little “artsy” game.  Go play it if you want a unique, though simple, platforming experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You probably remember feeling frustrated playing some platformers when you were younger; there was always a platform outside of reach, really high up, and you had no idea how you could reach it. You wanted to change the direction of gravity and just GET THERE. Well, ""And Yet it Moves"" is an indie platformer with the goal of satiating that appetite for gravity-redirection. It's a simple concept: let the player change the direction of gravity at will, so he can reach those places. The Good:* Very interesting graphical style. Everything is handmade and polished with love.* Innovative gameplay mechanic: you rotate the screen 90 or 180 degrees in either direction, which affects the direction of gravity and the screen rotates so that ""down"" is always at the bottom of your screen.* Relaxing atmosphere. The music is soft and mellow, but does get repetitive after some time.The Bad:* The ""genre"" of this game is not a platformer as some reviewers might suggest. The genre is ""maze navigation,"" and that is unfortunately not a type of game that I personally enjoy.* I feel like the default controls for rotating the screen are backwards. The right arrow-key should turn the maze clockwise, not anti-clockwise. Fortunately these can be changed in the options menu.* The camera sometimes zooms very close into the player's avatar (for no reason?) which is VERY FRUSTRATING for a maze-navigation game. It inhibits the player from seeing obstacles from a longer distance.* The game has ""gotcha"" deaths. For example, a random floor may break out from underneath you and kill you. This is not the worst thing given the game's high frequency of save points, but it's still frustrating to suddenly die when you think you're just chillin'.The Ugly:* Just not very fun in general. It took me about 30 minutes of playtime to realize this game just wasn't for me.I got to chapter 2, level 2 before I got bored. (There are 3 chapters of about 4 levels each).* After the ""rotate the world"" gimmick fades off, the game is essentially a ""avoid fall damage"" simulator.

												INDIE! Its a platformer challenge with relaxing and immersive sounds and music. You can tell the game was made on a budget, but everything is designed very well. Its a little slow paced for a while, but there are sections that really speed up, and plenty of puzzles to rack your brain for a little bit. Low replay value, its fun the first time though... can get a little... trippy. Have fun!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you bored? Well this game certainly won't help. The basic concept is nice but the game is just... boring... and generally really easy aside from the bamboo.For one, there's basically no music, so you're running around with ambient noises and nothing else. And running might be an overstatement... the main character is possibly the single slowest character in any platformer-type game. For how short the game is, there's quite a lot of level recycling as well. The third world especially, at least 4 out of the 6 levels in world 3 are basically copy+paste of each other, the same exact obstacles with just tiny differences and nothing innovating about them. The art style is nice, I guess, but this game is only worth playing if you can get it in a bundle, and even then it may not be worth your time anyways.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, it's not very fun.  While these type of physic mechanic games are interesting and can be difficul, this one is just boring.  Just as you think you've learned a new mechanic, they throw something new in and it just becomes frustrating.  The graphics are pretty neat, but it's just not the game for me.  What causes to to die doesn't make much sense, as one moment you can survive a pretty long fall, but then die from the smallest movement and wrong rotation.  For me, it's more aggravating than it's worth playing.  Maybe I'll go back to it, but for now it's in my do not play list.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish Steam would let you rate games from 1 to 10 or something like that instead of the simple yes\no. To this game I'd have given 5-6 out of 10, yet (or therefore) I decided not to recommend the game and not even finish it...And Yet It Moves is a normal platformer with a twist which makes it quiet interesting and challanging - you're not simply moving your character but also rotating the world around in and affecting some other objects as well that way. Despite the interesting idea the game still felt somewhat sparse and lacking for me.At first the game pretty much flows but on more advanced levels you may find yourself a bit stuck like I did. Which means that the game is challanging, of course, but when I quit the feeling like I'm playing for ages and saw I've only played 72 minutes IN TOTAL, I realized something's just not right.The game seems pretty short (I think I've finished about half of the levels in those 72 minutes) and yet sometimes is challanging, and requires skill and patience. Which I usually have, but on this one it just felt like it's not worth it.While it is kinda interesting, as I already said, it still ended up feeling like an ordinary platformer for me, without too much content beyond the 'platforming'.The graphics are very special but everything you see got a little repetitive in my opinion.There's no music at all, barely any sounds, which could add a lot.Story doesn't exist.There are additional gameplay modes which I didn't spend too much time on because I didn't enjoy that much the 'regular' mode.I can't help but feeling a bit bad about writing these things and abandoning the game, because I can't say it's bad, and I this it is very original and has interesting ideas. But it still didn't get me finish the game, although it is so short. So short, that I'm not even sure whether it should cost those 10 bucks.I guess some people would really like that, but personally I think this game could be way better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You probably remember feeling frustrated playing some platformers when you were younger; there was always a platform outside of reach, really high up, and you had no idea how you could reach it. You wanted to change the direction of gravity and just GET THERE. Well, ""And Yet it Moves"" is an indie platformer with the goal of satiating that appetite for gravity-redirection. It's a simple concept: let the player change the direction of gravity at will, so he can reach those places. The Good:* Very interesting graphical style. Everything is handmade and polished with love.* Innovative gameplay mechanic: you rotate the screen 90 or 180 degrees in either direction, which affects the direction of gravity and the screen rotates so that ""down"" is always at the bottom of your screen.* Relaxing atmosphere. The music is soft and mellow, but does get repetitive after some time.The Bad:* The ""genre"" of this game is not a platformer as some reviewers might suggest. The genre is ""maze navigation,"" and that is unfortunately not a type of game that I personally enjoy.* I feel like the default controls for rotating the screen are backwards. The right arrow-key should turn the maze clockwise, not anti-clockwise. Fortunately these can be changed in the options menu.* The camera sometimes zooms very close into the player's avatar (for no reason?) which is VERY FRUSTRATING for a maze-navigation game. It inhibits the player from seeing obstacles from a longer distance.* The game has ""gotcha"" deaths. For example, a random floor may break out from underneath you and kill you. This is not the worst thing given the game's high frequency of save points, but it's still frustrating to suddenly die when you think you're just chillin'.The Ugly:* Just not very fun in general. It took me about 30 minutes of playtime to realize this game just wasn't for me.I got to chapter 2, level 2 before I got bored. (There are 3 chapters of about 4 levels each).* After the ""rotate the world"" gimmick fades off, the game is essentially a ""avoid fall damage"" simulator. You will try getting around (over?) very simple objects many, many, many times per level without falling to your death. Fall damage is calculated very frustratingly and mysteriously. Because the world rotates around your player, it makes it confusing why your avatar dies after falling from what is realistically only one foot off the ground.The Verdict:And Yet it Moves is exactly the reason indie games are indie games: a major developer would have never risked funding a game with this unique gameplay mechanic. I really apprecaite the game for its innovation and risk-taking, but as it turns out, the major developers would have been right not to fund a game like this: rotating the world is simply a gimmick and does not add to the appeal of an otherwise interestingly-looking game. Part of the issue is genre: it simply does not work as a quasi-platformer. I would have liked to see the developer try for a lemmings-style game, or a tower-defense where the creeps always fall ""down"" and sending one group to a danger zone my cause another group to drop into where you defenses are weaker. We can be glad that future developers can learn what NOT to do from this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it has a somewhat novel mechanic driving the game, and it does show some inventive uses throughout the game, it fails on a visceral level.  Nothing feels particularly good about this game, from the stilted controls to the unsatisfying sound effects to the uninspired layouts.  It tries to be arty with its minimalism, but often it feels cheap and hokey.Maybe if you watch someone else, it could be entertaining, but to actually experience it is bereft of joy.

												To me this is a casual game. As others have pointed out the higher achievements and games modes were an afterthought and not many people would delve into these. Thus the game does feel a bit short. I prefer to play this with a controller as it feels more natural for a platformer style game (I didn't play much Jazz Jackrabbit or Commander Keen back in the day) and the trigger buttons are perfect for the rotation mechanic. The puzzles aren't too hard and are all the visual style puzzles that don’t require an explanation. The momentum mechanic is difficult to get used to as it's very easy to pick up too much speed and not be able to land without breaking apart but it is a nice change from the standard ""your character can only jump an x distance before dying"". I recommend this game as a casual game to relax with for a short sitting as that's how I feel it was meant to be played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It should have stayed as a project in the university rather than an actual sellable game.First of all, the music is not music, they're just sounds with your mouth. Hell, at least try to search copyleft music or something. A soothing music space-like would fit like a glove.Next, the story is non-existent. Are we supposed to deal with the imagination? Why we are going through caves, woods, whatever the hell is that? The only event is a mouse bite and was so sudden I startled.There are some bugs within the game too, mostly related to the control. It just wants to play with the controller whenever he wants, sometimes it works sometimes it does not. The respawn is kinda bugged, when you try to move when you just respawn you should not be pressing control buttons because it won't work until you tap another control button again.The graphics aren't nice, but it's something I never complain, especially when games this short. So ignore my opinion about graphics.Overall, it's not a good game. It lasts 3 hours at best, so at least it plays for short. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the demo on the Wii when it was originally released, and I had a lot of fun with it. So when I saw the holiday price drop, I decided to buy it. Well, the thing is... it's broken as all heck. The fullscreen mode flickers a lot, but that doesn't bother me too much. What DOES bother me, though, is that the camera and textures are broken. Seriously, it just displays white. The worst part is that, if you try to go into fullscreen and switch back, the camera will be zoomed in on the ground at, like, 1000%. The menus are good, but the textures just seemed ruined. Please buy this on the Wii, it works REALLY well, but this version just makes me want a refund.			",15,1,0,1,2,0,6

												First 15min Impressions: And Yet It MovesVerdict: Frustrating to play.This is an indie platformer where you can rotate the world 90 degrees at will. The graphics are OK-- they look like a torn paper collage.The idea for the platformer would be interesting were it not for the extreme fragility of your character.  One hit from anything kills you. Falling fast kills you.  Traveling fast into a wall kills you.  One time I pushed a rock, and it rocked back onto me and shattered me.This fragility makes the game frustrating, as you'll be restarting and replaying from checkpoints over and over.  Sometimes you'll do the same jump for the second time and you'll die on impact because this time you crossed over the magic ""you're dead"" boundary.  The jump feels a little floaty as well, so I never felt fully in control of the character.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Much the same way Braid employs an art style to compliment it's time-jumping and rewinding in a way to befit player agency, this one employs a paper mache style to support its surrealism.  I know it was part of a larger bundle back in 2013, so it's been awhile.It's a bit difficult at times, since there's a variety of things popping out on the screen all at once, but again, the most urgent and vital piece on the screen in the one where it all revolves around.  It's also easy to fall off and have to restart, but without the added benefit of being immediately reaccesible, it runs the risk of wasting player time backtracking and going through the same material as before.It's been awhile since I've played it.It's a 1/5.

												A simple platformer with a very unique twist--literally.  You get to rotate the world in which your character travels.The all-paper art style/motif is also a nice touch.(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of Steam's Indie Story Pack, which was gifted to me by a friend.)

												My review is going to be a negative one, but I understand my qualms with the game are not indicitive of the whole game.First off, I've been trying to play most or all of the games in my Steam library.  As with most users, I've amassed quite the collection.  I want to at least experience most of these games to the point where a real reviewer might play if they were pressed for time.  Gaming is a hobby for me, so I don't always complete games that I'm not completely enjoying.AYIM is one of the games where I can see the appeal. The puzzles in the early game get you used to the controls, challenge you a little bit, and even having you thinking ""How am I supposed to get through this?"" Exactly what a game like this should really aim to do, and it did that well.However, I found myself being extremely frustrated at certain points in the game.  The premier example of this for me was when you first encounter the ""flint and steel"" mechanic in the game.  I usually try to figure games out by myself, especially in puzzle games.  However, I had to resort to figuring out what the heck I had to do from Google to get through this section (killing the beehive)  which completely kills the immersion for me.  There was no explination of how  you should try to get through this section, and it seemed very unintuitive how it worked.  Eventually after a few searches of ""How do I get past the beehive + and yet it moves"" on google, I found the solution.Then I hit another section that required you to do the same mechanic time and time again.  I knew what I needed to do to progress but with how the game works and the requirements, I became incredibly frustrated again.That's when I put the game down.  I realized that this puzzle game was not for me. I can see how some would like it; The art style is great, the music draws  you in, and the control over gravity and the camera is a neat mechanic.  However, I just really didn't like playing.  I can't quite put my finger on exactly what turned me off to the game, but I'm fairly done with it for a while.However, I do recommend this game to anyone that has it or has the chance to get it for cheap.  It's in Humble Bundles all the time, and it's one of the cheaper games on Steam, while providing a great artistic puzzle experience.  I got plenty of entertainment out of it and I might pick it up again at some point, but for now I'll move on to the next game without an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very, very cool game. Because the levels are comprised of ripped and torn up paper, and even your character is paper, it looks a lot different to almost every game out there, even now, several years after its release, considering a lot of indie games go for the 8-bit look. This is a very fun game, but it still comes with moments of frustration. The tilting of the screen to move between areas is done pretty well I thought, but there are stages where your timing and approach need to be more than exact, and it can get frustrating dying 20+ times in a row. While it does get repetitive, you're basically doing the same thing the entire game, just walking and rotating the level, it does look really cool and makes for a different game world. It's a nice little indie game that you can lose yourself in for a bit. If you haven't played it, pick it up, maybe when it's on sale, and give it a go. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mixed feelings. This game is a standard platformer, except that you can rotate the perspective very similarly to the bridge. Unlike The Bridge, you can only lock into 4 set perspectives that are at right angles from each other (up, down, left, right). The gameplay is a lot more active than the Bridge also, as in... you can jump. I have to say that I didn't get much enjoyment out of a lot of the levels and was exceedingly frustrated with the bouncy bamboo sticks (the jumping mechanism sucks and if you jump too late, your character will jump as soon as he gets back to the ground, resetting your momentum. Not fun. The thing that kept me playing were the hilarious bosses, which were honestly the most fun and least frustrating challenges of the game, the bosses don't always readily present themselves and sometimes you'll beat them before you ever realize that it was even a boss, but all of them are really creative and make the game worth a short play-through (by short i mean, I played the whole game in less than 4 hours). I enjoyed These end of the level challenges and after the first third of the game, the main challenges of the level make up the back half of each level, so the levels from chapter 2 and 3 are way more fun.The credits are awesome and I honestly believe that all games should follow a similar mold. No spoilers though, you'll have to spend 1 dollar and 3ish hours to find out what it is. Even though it wasn't really one of my top favorites, it was short and to the point and didn't drag on longer than was fun. Overall Score: 7.0/10			",577,200,18,74,76,10,80

												Nice mechanic and an interesting environment to use it. Bit short, no real story, but nice bit of fun. Probably won't touch it again when you're done the first time, but that's alright. Very unique if you couldn't tell, even in the crowded puzzle platformer genre. Always nice to get a new way to have to think about things, though the designers may have been able to use the mechanic to make things more interesting at times. 3/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												I like the style and music, but the gameplay is tedious. The game introduces a lot of gimmicks to keep you interested, but none of them ever really come together or develop. There are no real puzzles in the game, just sort of prodding at the game's physics engine until it works. I would never want to play it again, which, for a game that was only 2 hours long, is disappointing.			",45,5,0,4,3,0,3

												I played the demo on the Wii when it was originally released, and I had a lot of fun with it. So when I saw the holiday price drop, I decided to buy it. Well, the thing is... it's broken as all heck. The fullscreen mode flickers a lot, but that doesn't bother me too much. What DOES bother me, though, is that the camera and textures are broken. Seriously, it just displays white. The worst part is that, if you try to go into fullscreen and switch back, the camera will be zoomed in on the ground at, like, 1000%. The menus are good, but the textures just seemed ruined. Please buy this on the Wii, it works REALLY well, but this version just makes me want a refund.			",15,1,0,1,2,0,6

												First 15min Impressions: And Yet It MovesVerdict: Frustrating to play.This is an indie platformer where you can rotate the world 90 degrees at will. The graphics are OK-- they look like a torn paper collage.The idea for the platformer would be interesting were it not for the extreme fragility of your character.  One hit from anything kills you. Falling fast kills you.  Traveling fast into a wall kills you.  One time I pushed a rock, and it rocked back onto me and shattered me.This fragility makes the game frustrating, as you'll be restarting and replaying from checkpoints over and over.  Sometimes you'll do the same jump for the second time and you'll die on impact because this time you crossed over the magic ""you're dead"" boundary.  The jump feels a little floaty as well, so I never felt fully in control of the character.			",258,133,1,31,22,2,26

												A quirky, challenging, simple-controlled 2D platformer, AYIM is moderately fun.. but the visuals get repetetive and the levels drag on a bit too long. Some parts can be genuinely frustrating and it can have a high learning curve. It could use better music too and a bit more polish. Some might say its part of the game's charm and character, but I just find it a bit lacking.That being said, it is still fun, and has genuinely satisfying moments and puzzles I haven't found in other games.

												AYIM is a cool indie platformer with 2 unique twists: the 1st (and most significant) is the main game mechanic - the ability to rotate the world around your character in increments of 90 degrees; the 2nd is the way it looks - the environment is rendered in an artistic paper-cutout (literally) style. Both of these things add up to an experience unlike any other. That said, your goal is still similar to many other 2D platformers - get from one end of the level to the other - so the game is both familiar and fresh at the same time. At 4 chapters (plus 5 bonus epilogue levels), the experience is also just the right length. The difficulty ramps up nicely from beginning to end, and is usually fair (the exception would be the final bonus levels, which are excruciatingly hard, but since they are optional, that's ok). My only minor issue is the occasional wonkiness of jumping and the seemingly random height drops that cause death. That said, it's still well worth playing for platforming fans!

												This is the ultimate indie game. I don't mean indie as in independently developed and published (although that's the case). I mean indie like hipsters before hipsters were hipsters. Back when they were just into indie stuff, I mean. This game is indie because it's a bunch of torn up paper, like the paper bags you used to get your groceries in before you started using canvas bags to be even more sustainable, and especially before someone told you that paper bags actually cause more pollution than plastic bags because they take more energy to produce. And the sound your character makes when he dies is a sort of ""swoosh' sound that some guy makes with his mouth, which is totally indie. In any case this game is pretty great and if you're high because you got some dank nugs, this will either be a great experience or far too complex. Warning: game has bats. Hunter S. Thompson-esque ""Bat Country"" experiences are a possibility.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this a few years back and I can tell you it's a solid puzzle platformer. It has cutout graphics and practically no sounds, it's all very simplistic, yet it doesn't have that clean look most of the other simplistic games have. The environments and character have plenty of detail actually, and that's partially because they're wrinkled and all.Anyway, the gameplay revolves around turning the level around using the cursor keys. So, as an example, if you see a small tunnel in front of you, that you really can't enter, you just turn the level around so you can drop into it. However, it's not just turning the levels around the entire game. You do walk around on your own. You also have to be careful that you're not falling too hard/fast or you'll have to restart from the checkpoint. Later in the game you'll also have to solve small puzzles and defeat enemies the same way you walk around.Like I said, it's solid. So if you like to play something different, this could be your game.[Rating: 74/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Ignore the Mixed or Negative Ratings on this one. This is a really great platforming game and the unique graphic style works. Just play a few levels and if you're not hooked by then... Well then you just won't be.I'm one of those people that has a very poor attention span and I am extremely surprised to see this game has a Mixed Rating. I was thinking it would have VERY POSITIVE at WORST.This game is fantastic and has quite an eerie and deep atmosphere to it.. The further you get into the game the more eerie it gets. The puzzles are fantastic but I would say more of a Platforming Skill type of puzzle.The music is also somewhat creepy in a weird funky trip out of a way. It just feels like something odd is around.The physics are fantastic and give a real feel of height.This game was awesome. One of the few games I played through.For what it is I give it a 10/10.

												The full title of this game is ""The developer has no brain, and yet it moves"". This is a godawful shovelware 2D platformer.  Some recognition should be made for them not going down the ""Retro pixel"" route that most talentless developers at the bottom of the development ladder take.  Instead they decided to attempt actual art, despite being talentless.   A bold move which results in predictable disaster. Shoddy scanned in textures and the most abysmal hand drawn art that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like Leonardo DaVinci assault your eyes in this monsterpiece.   I actually had to rinse my eyes out at a chemical spill sink. Gameplay is woeful.  It's a bland platformer with a level rotation mechanic (this is meant to differentiate it from other platformers, but many of those have already tried this).   They're not making platformers better, they're making gaming worse.  The art is so poor quality it's really hard to control the gameplay because it's distracting.Technical aspects also plague this game - no 4K support, overscan on fullscreen rendering the game unplayable unless you go into windowed mode if you own a monitor released this decade - it's hard to say if there are any other issues because the graphics are just that bad.   I'd rather throw my PC out than play this abomination again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely a game that makes you think.  While graphically it may not be as nice looking as the triple A titles out there this game has an artistic look that suits it.  It is definitely challenging and while making you angry sometimes it also can make you laugh with some of the wrong choices you make that lead to death. I have to give the maker of this game props for doing something different.			",430,39,23,44,20,6,21

												Got this in a trade. It's worth a $1 at most. Essentially, what you do is spin the world around and move your guy. That's.. about it. The ""music"" and everything is basically the same the whole way through. It' a cool game at first, but then you realize.. as you go on, it's like the same thing over and over. Concept is fun, but there.. isn't much to do. I wouldn't recommend it unless you can get it for like a $1 or in some bundle.Note. I already beat it. Took me a bit longer than it could have as I slacked in parts, but roughly about 2 to 3 hours of game-play, less if you make the effort to play the game and not get bored. Zzz.

												This game is awful. It is seriously one of the worst games I've played.The main problem with this game is very easy to describe:It's not hard, it's frustrating. Because of that, it's also boring.For me, the art style/audio don't work either, though that's of course a matter of personal opinion. I'm glad I got this game in Humble Indie Bundle #3 and didn't buy it separately. If you want a good puzzle platformer that also works with changing gravity: VVVVVV. It is so much better than this game...STAY AWAY.			",220,36,4,22,15,1,30

												I'm not exactly certain as to how I came to be in possession of this game.  I think I was drunk and thought it was Waking Mars.I usually like platformers, but this was a bit difficult to suffer through.  There is no story or clear motivation for you to get to the end of the game other than achievements.  The gimmick here is that you can turn the world, something that is common in platformers nowadays, but this game somehow does it wrong.  Your character bumps slides and bounces off of everything and fall damage keeps you from really having fun with the mechanic.  Much of the music and sounds in the game are made by someone beat boxing into a microphone making the game sound like an episode of Doug, which gets annoying fast.  The early levels are a cave and a forest, both are really bland, but then in chapter three you get bit by a snake and start tripping; the levels and music becomes much better.  There are mods though, they can make the game a bit more fun.I can see how some people might like this game, but I can't recommended it to anyone at any price higher than two dollars.

												Cool little indie game. Found in some humble bundles. It can feel a little repetitive at times but still fun. You're a 2D character traveling around tunnels, that appear to be underground trying not to fall or get run over by rocks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first time I played this I played the demo on the Wii, and I have to admit, the controls kinda sucked on it, but the game itself was great. It was something I never would've expected and it kept me interested. When I got it on Steam I was stoked to be able to play the full version, with better controls might I add. Sure some of the levels are a bit difficult but what's a platformer without difficulty? This is definitely the best platformer I've ever played, as well as the most original. I definitely recommend this to those who need a good platformer to play when they're bored.			",38,4,0,3,5,0,1

												This game is a bizzare yet surpsingly intricate experience, managing to put forth an interesting gameplay concept, a great minimal ambient-ish soundtrack, but much to my disappointment, no story. You are thrown into this cool concept art world, with the ability to switch between horizontal and vertical perspective, but there's no real goal or quest you need to reach in this game, therefore making the game fall a bit too flat (no pun intended).

												This game is definitely interesting. While it's honestly something I never would have played without getting a previous Humble Bundle, I'm glad I did in the end. And Yet it Moves employs something that's not totally unfamiliar to a number of games, but still manages to keep it fresh enough and utilizes the mechanic well enough to keep the minor issues I had with it from keeping me from quitting. [Those issues mostly include the flimsiness of the main character. While I'm sure someone could say, 'But he's made of paper, of course he's flimsy!' there were still a lot of times I felt cheated out of a safe landing.] With no real story, And Yet It Moves is more of an aesthetic trip. With trippy ambient sound-music and minimal sound effects, And Yet It Moves is a wonderfully exotic sensory adventure. It is a little slow, so if you're looking for an action packed adventure, I would say look elsewhere, but if you can handle a bit of pacing and some neat physics-based puzzling, try it!

												I could only say 2 words for this game - SPIN AROUND. This game is a lot of fun and an indie that is worth a try. It has an amazing soundtrack what is ussual for an indie game, the soundtrack makes you play it even more. Indies of these times are even more fun than the games that are counted as RETAILS or ""BEST"" but the indies that are coming now are just amazing. The gameplay is really unique - you must turn around your screen to move your character and make it go to a checkpoint which is more and more near the finish. And the stages are so random, and who doesnt love random things like a crazy seapig with horns. It gives you a lot of laughter aswell as a small brain workout which will help you on a daily day.

												Fantastic art direction (the game looks like it's made out of paper), responsive game mechanics, and a little brain-teaser. A nicely done platformer, where the player has the ability to change the gravity in four directions (up, down, left, right) at will. Wish that the game was a bit longer, more challenging, and a bit speedier. Due to the fact that the character moves kind of slow, it turns towards a casual platformer.

Not a fan of the extremely repetitive soundtrack, and there are moments in the game that feel broken (very much down to luck whether you can advance or not, and have to spend 20 minutes fiddling).

												First thing I'd reccomend is to reverse the Left / Right rotate button configs, the defaults are too confusing.  Second is be sure you have an active internet connection.  The game constantly tries to compare your scores against the online leaderboards even if you have it set to not upload ghosts / times for your runs, and this for some reason equates to massive lag when pausing the game at any point or changing any setting (it doesn't make sense but its what the devs said was the reason for it).This game is... okay?  Visually it doesn't offer much and the game mechanics themselves (directional gravity) aren't new or used innovatively by any stretch.  I'm about halfway through the 'Journey' (aka main game) mode, and I'm not really thrilled by anything I've done or experienced so far.  The music is nicely ambient and un-obnoxious, which could have been a big downfall but luckily wasn't.  Aside from that it seems to have some normal time trialing and challenge options, nothing fancy.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

If the level had smooth rotation and the player walked slightly faster than a snail's pace it would be a solid winner. As is, it requires quick reaction times when rotating, but then demands patience while walking to the next part of the level.			",269,52,8,43,32,3,56

												The last bonus level ""Chase"" has a grave design flaw as pre-last run is hugely based on random instead of skill. Plus rotating the world doesn't stop the bees. They kill you 80% of time while you're trying to avoid the obstacles. Other 20% you die by falling off the level.It's not fun at all, it's enfuriating.Whoever designed the last bonus level, he has killed otherwise a pretty decent game.			",519,123,26,106,44,2,67

												Released after Portal 1 and before indie games began to flood Steam through Greenlight, AYIM was designed in the best of times.Like Portal, it is built around a single novel mechanic which is then used in clever exploration-based puzzles. And unlike it's modern indie counterparts of similar budgets, it does not suffer from bland pixelated blocky environments. Instead, it makes the most out of collage-inspired backgrounds and immersive sounds.It's a little short, so I would recommend buying during a sale. Even so, AYIM is a gem for anyone looking for a puzzle-based game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And Yet It Moves is a basic puzzle platformer built around the ""rotate the world"" mechanic. Everything is very ""floaty"" and as is usually the case with physics based platformers, there are times when it feels you only have the vaguest sense of control over your character. Music and sound effects get annoying after so long and after a few hours, I'd had enough. Not completely terrible, but it just didn't hold my interest.			",306,110,7,32,26,2,24

												When this game came out it was an innovative physics platformer with some interesting new concepts. It did deliver in some ways, there are a lot of mechanics and the art direction and atmosphere is put together cohesivlyNow even though there are good aspects of it overall when put together it falls very flat right on it's gravity flipping face. There is so much stuff that is haphazardy stuck together that is interesting but not very fun. Level design is very strange and doesn't feel challenging just frusterating. The physics that are the core of the game are really really slow and wonky and unrealistic that it just makes you feel bored and upset. Ok now that I have bashed it enough I just want to say that I did like this game when it came out but with the amount of legitimatly fun and interesting platformers on the market I can not recomend this clunky and buggy mound of ripped paper that I will promptly toss over a fire if I need to warm my body, make some smores or to burn it for fun.

												I respect the work put into this game and this is only 'why' I push 'thumbs up'. It is really great idea!I've tried first long time ago, from Humble Bundle, and played a bit. Didn't draw me ""inside"". When added to Steam I've tried it again with similar result. I don't mind lack of a music in background at all, I feel it is adequate to minimalistic graphic design. It has sound effects so it is not completly silent. I love the idea of moveing around not only the char but the world as well. For me it was a first game with such idea. This game is graphically interesting but not great. Bit boring levels.+ promising and simple idea+ not an easy game+ good puzzles+ quite balanced (I've played much more than 0.5 h but still starting levels)+ graphicaly nice- graphicaly nice but specific sp may be disliked by most- for me it went boring- I didn't connect with the character / The game didin't pull me into its worldHowever, I cannot recomend it 100%.On some discount it's worth a try - maybe for you it will be more interesting.

												Review applies to Linux / SteamOS users.AYIM has a game-breaking bug that means that launching it requires you to manually fix a script.  This fix has been been around for a year and has been bought to the attention of the devs, but not implemented.  On top of that and a couple of non-breaking bugs (cheevos, screen tearing), the game has a novel, but rather ugly visual style with minimal, but grating sound effects.If you can get past that (and the rather stilted animation) then you'll find a simple puzzle-platformer where you're able to rotate the world to avoid obstacles and move on, but honestly, The Bridge does it much better and with far more style...and you don't have to modify a script to get it working.

												Released after Portal 1 and before indie games began to flood Steam through Greenlight, AYIM was designed in the best of times.Like Portal, it is built around a single novel mechanic which is then used in clever exploration-based puzzles. And unlike it's modern indie counterparts of similar budgets, it does not suffer from bland pixelated blocky environments. Instead, it makes the most out of collage-inspired backgrounds and immersive sounds.It's a little short, so I would recommend buying during a sale. Even so, AYIM is a gem for anyone looking for a puzzle-based game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can play this game with either a keyboard and mouse or a controller. Not sure how the keyboard and mouse are, but the controller support is great once you set it up. Overall, solid 7.5/10.

												Truly a work of art.  As a game, it requires some extra spacial awareness and puzzle-solving skills, on top of platform dexterity and a bit of luck in parts.  The visual and audio style is a little odd to me, but it works well as a whole, even when it veers toward creepy or psychedelic.  Rotating the world occasionally has surprising effects, several of which must be mastered to finish the game.Replayability is limited, and the completionist will be annoyed at the insane difficulty of certain (most?) achievements, but the experienced platformer looking for novelty will enjoy this for a few hours.

												1/10. This is a bad game. Take all of the worst aspects of every indie game you've played and you might come close to this game. The art is cheap junk that the guy probably found on Google Images and the sound effects are just the guy making the noises with his own voice. The controls are unintuitive until you change the key bindings, and it's boring. You can find better stuff on Kongregate, or maybe by clicking those spam ads on websites you visit while you have AdBlock turned off. STAY AWAY!!!!**unless you want the Steam achieve that will give you a worthless coupon, which you can get by standing on a tree branch while it wiggles back and forth due to the awful physics engine.

												Oh God! It's still moving! Ahhh! Quick! Shoot it in the head!!!Just kidding. Fun platformer with a unique twist (sorry), being able to rotate the world around you 90 degrees at will. Interesting level designs (like bats that fly up that you need to get to fly into an iguana that eats you as you pass) add quirkiness, along with keeping the short levels from getting repetitive. A fun play for an afternoon or two.			",374,82,24,35,24,3,41

												Yet another indie platformer with gravity-bending rules. This game frustrated me, due to the heavy reliance on physics-based puzzles (which I hate). Puzzles that have an element of chance, rather than solid deductive reasoning aren't puzzles... they're obstacles.That said, this game has an interesting style brought fourth by hand-drawn and scanned ripped pieces of paper. It isn't exactly pretty, but I admire effort gone into making this outlandish style. The music is similarly strange, with most of the tracks and sound effects achieved by human verbal sounds (check out the trailer and you'll see what I mean). The music was the highlight of the game for me, evoking a very melancholic mood.In the end it's a fairly straightforward puzzle platformer that won't challenge your brain or reflexes, but scores some artistic merit. Don't buy unless you're a hipster.			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												This game is definitely interesting. While it's honestly something I never would have played without getting a previous Humble Bundle, I'm glad I did in the end. And Yet it Moves employs something that's not totally unfamiliar to a number of games, but still manages to keep it fresh enough and utilizes the mechanic well enough to keep the minor issues I had with it from keeping me from quitting. [Those issues mostly include the flimsiness of the main character. While I'm sure someone could say, 'But he's made of paper, of course he's flimsy!' there were still a lot of times I felt cheated out of a safe landing.] With no real story, And Yet It Moves is more of an aesthetic trip. With trippy ambient sound-music and minimal sound effects, And Yet It Moves is a wonderfully exotic sensory adventure. It is a little slow, so if you're looking for an action packed adventure, I would say look elsewhere, but if you can handle a bit of pacing and some neat physics-based puzzling, try it!

												I respect the work put into this game and this is only 'why' I push 'thumbs up'. It is really great idea!I've tried first long time ago, from Humble Bundle, and played a bit. Didn't draw me ""inside"". When added to Steam I've tried it again with similar result. I don't mind lack of a music in background at all, I feel it is adequate to minimalistic graphic design. It has sound effects so it is not completly silent. I love the idea of moveing around not only the char but the world as well. For me it was a first game with such idea. This game is graphically interesting but not great. Bit boring levels.+ promising and simple idea+ not an easy game+ good puzzles+ quite balanced (I've played much more than 0.5 h but still starting levels)+ graphicaly nice- graphicaly nice but specific sp may be disliked by most- for me it went boring- I didn't connect with the character / The game didin't pull me into its worldHowever, I cannot recomend it 100%.On some discount it's worth a try - maybe for you it will be more interesting.

												Review applies to Linux / SteamOS users.AYIM has a game-breaking bug that means that launching it requires you to manually fix a script.  This fix has been been around for a year and has been bought to the attention of the devs, but not implemented.  On top of that and a couple of non-breaking bugs (cheevos, screen tearing), the game has a novel, but rather ugly visual style with minimal, but grating sound effects.If you can get past that (and the rather stilted animation) then you'll find a simple puzzle-platformer where you're able to rotate the world to avoid obstacles and move on, but honestly, The Bridge does it much better and with far more style...and you don't have to modify a script to get it working.

												And Yet It Moves wound up being a total joy to play. They've steadily added content since the game release which was innovative and beautiful to begin with as a result of its unique control style and the clever cardboard cutout look. There's sort of a multi-player aspect with the ability to compete against other players play-through recordings but I haven't played with it too much honestly, I just like the look of it. I've spent around 15 hours playing so far and I'll probably play a great deal more before I put it down... I haven't played through all the added content yet and I kinda want to start from the beginning again.			",370,49,5,43,12,4,35

												It's been some time since I played this game, but I surprisingly remember it rather well...and well, I suppose I can't really recommend it, based on memory.I'll be frank. I got AYIM as a single piece of one of Steam's first Indie Bundles. I played and completed it only on virtue of crossing it off my list of ""Steam Games that I actually beat."" It was interesting...at first. By the end of it however, it became more frustrating than fun.First off, the game is very short, and I remember completing it very quickly. Steam clocks my total play time at two hours total, and I have a tendency to leave a game open when I go away from my computer, so some of that time was more than likely not even spent playing the game. It was short enough that I remember thinking that I would have been irritated had I not gotten it as part of a bundle...but at the same time, I probably would not have gotten it period in any other case.The game would best be described as a surreal puzzle platformer. It is built entirely around the gimmick that you have the ability to rotate the the level 90° left or right at any given time. Initially, it is a rather fun gimmick, but as the game drags on, it ultimately doesn't introduce anything new. Aside from that one concept, everything else is derivative of ever other platformer ever; booster jumps, disappearing platforms, time puzzles, etc. If you're a hardcore Platformer, than this probably wouldn't bother you, but to me, it got very, very old.The other major...aspect(?) of the game would be it's art style. It is very styalized and surreal, as if you're playing some kind of modern painting in an art museum. It really is a love it or hate it kind of thing. I can't say it bothered me, but I can also say that it didn't particularly add to the game in any way for me either. There's only one level I recall that actually made really good use of the strangeness of the theme. It begins with you getting bit by a giant snake...and well, everything goes from there. I won't spoil it for anyone who intends to play because well, it was the only level that I can say I really really enjoyed.All and all, I can't recommend the game overall. To me, the gimmick fell flat rather fast and it turned into a tedious ""Ugh, how much longer do I have of this crap?"" in the long run. However, if you're a fan of surreal art or gimmick platformers, there may be something here for you. Even then though, I'd at least make sure there was a deep discount going.			",220,24,1,49,16,2,22

												A sidescrolling, gravity-bending platformer with a neat concept and decent execution of its mechanics. In the end, it's just a tad too slow for my liking, but it's by no means a bad game.			",421,166,3,43,11,4,43

												And Yet It Moves wound up being a total joy to play. They've steadily added content since the game release which was innovative and beautiful to begin with as a result of its unique control style and the clever cardboard cutout look. There's sort of a multi-player aspect with the ability to compete against other players play-through recordings but I haven't played with it too much honestly, I just like the look of it. I've spent around 15 hours playing so far and I'll probably play a great deal more before I put it down... I haven't played through all the added content yet and I kinda want to start from the beginning again.			",370,49,5,43,12,4,35

												I'm not exactly certain as to how I came to be in possession of this game.  I think I was drunk and thought it was Waking Mars.I usually like platformers, but this was a bit difficult to suffer through.  There is no story or clear motivation for you to get to the end of the game other than achievements.  The gimmick here is that you can turn the world, something that is common in platformers nowadays, but this game somehow does it wrong.  Your character bumps slides and bounces off of everything and fall damage keeps you from really having fun with the mechanic.  Much of the music and sounds in the game are made by someone beat boxing into a microphone making the game sound like an episode of Doug, which gets annoying fast.  The early levels are a cave and a forest, both are really bland, but then in chapter three you get bit by a snake and start tripping; the levels and music becomes much better.  There are mods though, they can make the game a bit more fun.I can see how some people might like this game, but I can't recommended it to anyone at any price higher than two dollars.

												This indie puzzle game is really nice : cute graphics, original gameplay, deeply-exploited mechanics, definitely a must have for all indie fans ! The only negative point is its short lifetime, count on a few hours to complete it. However, there are several game modes, some bonus levels and plenty of unlockable achievements to extend the game experience !			",254,56,5,30,11,3,29
