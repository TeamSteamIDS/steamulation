												A decent game from more than a decade ago. But it may not be the game for you considering how long my con list is. Pros: 1.) The environment is nice and it's fun to explore around. 2.) There's a good amount of weaponry, ranging from a Desert Eagle to a rare and powerful automatic shotgun, the Pancor Jackhammer. If you favor stealth, pick a silenced MP5 and remain hidden. 3.) There aren't that many vehicles but it's forgivable if you can drive something that fires rockets and wrecks entire campsites. 4.) The A.I. enemies are impressive to fight against. Some operate like a squad and they tend to ""think"" (or pick stealth) more before assaulting your position. 5.) In my opinion, Far Cry offers outstanding music. It builds up and increases tension which is appropriate when you're exposed to assailants. 6.) Graphics are nice, considering this game is over 10 years old. However, there are problems that Far Cry has. Cons: 1.) Multiplayer is dead! There should be an update that states this in the store page. Link: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2092407Don't waste your time in registering for any site to get multiplayer. It has died long ago. 2.) Despite what some people said, a good portion of the campaign is linear, most notably the ""indoor"" parts. Also, the game doesn't do a good job in providing players with a diverse amount of alternative pathways to take. It usually only gives 2 avaliable walkways to complete the same objective and I do not find that acceptable. 3.) There's some sort of A.I. bug in which the mercenaries can shoot at you accurately behind walls when you're in their bunkers. EDIT: Stealth is also broken in this game. The human enemies can ""see"" you at certain points, even when they should not have. This prohibits the ability to sneak around them and often, you have to fight them head-on.4.) While I do not mind, a good amount of the Far Cry community despises the introduction of the ""Trigens"". In a way, I do agree with them because after you encounter them, the game becomes too different. 5.) I was going to complain about the bland plot but the voice acting is far worse. The main character, Jack Carver, has a pretty bad voice actor and his lines are cliche'd. 6.) Some sections of the game are notoriously hard, though not impossible to beat, even on easy. It would be understandable if you die almost immediately by rushing recklessly on the hardest difficulty but on easy is just overkill. The last level was hard but the worst part for me was fighting Crowe, the leader of the mercs, on a sinking boat while facing a helicopter. You only have a couple of minutes of destroy the aerial vehicle (as you cannot use a firearm when swimming), there's no supplies, and Crowe has good accuracy and he inflicts massive damage with his M249. 7.) The worst thing Far Cry has is the ""auto-save"" and it lacks the ability for players to save manually whenever they want to. I heard that there is a console command as compensation but for those who don't know, they will have endless times of reloading an earlier save and you may even get stuck in a loop where you continuously perish. Summary: In all, I did enjoy the game after adjusting myself and giving it a 2nd try. However, $9.99 is too much as multiplayer and customization is dead so please get the game when it's at a discount if you're still interested. On the bright side, Far Cry does have more balls than its successors when it comes to difficulty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reading the negative reviews for this has upset me a little.  It seems that the two main complaints people have are that the game is too hard and the story is somewhat lame.  I would agree that this is a hard game, it does not baby the player.  There is no regenerating health, the enemy soldiers move quickly and have decent aim.  I am not great at FPS games, but playing this game on medium is very enjoyable to me.  The checkpoints are very well spaced.  There are just enough health and armor packs.  If you are getting stuck in one spot I would suggest trying a different approach.  Maybe even back up one checkpoint and come it things from a different angle.  This is very different from the modern corridor shooters.  The maps are enormous and you are free to go anywhere.  I can see how this could be confusing for younger gamers used to COD style gameplay.  Boats and trucks are an excellent strategy with their mounted guns.  Stealth works very also.  Early game with the M16 switching to single shot mode, going prone and headshots from a distance is another good method.  Rushing in and spraying bullets will not work as well.  You will have ample ammo for your pistol and assault rifle, but much less for speciailzed weapons like the sniper rifle and rpg.  This keeps things balanced and rewards the player for good planning.  Final comments on the difficulty.  Everyone has different levels of skill.  For me on he hardest difficulty levels I can not get very far without getting stuck.  On medium the game is fun and I die maybe a couple times per level.  Select the level appropriate for your abilities.  Once you learn where the enemies are and how many that will give you an advantage.Technologically this game is a masterpiece.  Released 10 years and still looks great.  It is the predecessor to Crysis.  As for the story, who cares?  It is a game not a movie.  It is about the gameplay here.  Cut scenes are few and far between and non disruptive.  Nothing gets between you and pulling that trigger.  There are no QTE's or moments where the game takes control away from you.  It is a very pure experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not everyone can understand classic Far Cry at all, gamers nowadays care just about graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The perfect first-person shooter for those who are tired of today's dumbed-down, military-themed games in the genre.It is fun and very, very challenging.  Ammo and health conservation need to be taken into account at all times, and the AI does a good job of making enemies always feel like a real threat.Despite not taking place in an ""open-world"" like its successors, the original Far Cry features some incredibly vast and well designed levels (at least for the first three quarters of the game), allowing the player to approach objectives in many different ways.The story is pretty entertaining, if a bit tongue-in-cheek. It has an 1980s' action-movie feel to it.If you can put up with its outdated graphics, Far Cry is well worth a playthrough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though this game is over 10 years old, it still looks beautiful. The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim. The variation in weapons is not great, but it is good enough (should have been more weapons with silencer).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THIS GAME SCORES [0 | 1 | *2*] = ~83% (67%-100%)Since it has been a long while that I properly played this game, I'm not sure if I would give it a 3of4 or 4of4, so I'll cheat and give it a 3 of 3. :]To me, this is sadly the only true Far Cry game.While you have a lot of free roam space, you slowly work yourself from one campaign story location to the next. You fight in a (loose) jungle and get a proper feeling of being hidden between the bushes and creeping up on the enemy. The modern FC games also have this, but I think it's considerably less well executed.This Far Cry has no ""YOU'RE LEAVING THE MISSION AREA!"" crap, it's all just gameplay. You don't feel victim to the arbitrary whims of the game designer, it's your adventure.No obviously gameplay-stretching collector's items spread all over the map.No always same-y activities. Of course this game has a game loop where certain things repeat again and again, but repetition/similarity are on a different fractal level (Think Mandelbrot fractal zoom.) than the same-y repetitive stuff of modern Far Cry games.No long unskippable cut scenes.Saving whenever you want (OMG!).No questionably simulated civilians shooting in the air each and every time you complete a same-y activity involving them.This Far Cry is like the good old campaign first person shooters, except with an open world jungle and beach and swimming/diving in the water feeling. (Boy, when I played this back then on a 2.5 meter projection, it felt like a vacation!)Bring back the old school Far Cry already! Since Sameysoft seems to be too preoccupied forcing the same theme park formula into everything, maybe it's time for someone else to take over. How many/few games like the first Far Cry exist, anyway? Is there really only one?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												INTRO:After playing Far Cry 3 a few years ago, I went crazy.I loved that game so much that I decided to be curious and look forward trying their other game series.Since yesterday, I finally finished Far Cry 1.I finished every Far Cry games on PC (except for Far Cry Primal that I can't afford for now x.x;;) and I decided to make a game review for each of those games. So I hope i'll do fine as in, English is not my first language :P________________GAME'S STORY:The Story is about a guy named ""Jack Carver"", that got paid by a journalist (aka Valerie Constantine) for some specific mission.They traveled on a boat and some soldiers shot the boat with a Rocket Launcher, which made you wake up on the beach, with no clue where did Valerie go.Your main mission will be to rescue her and you will receive help from Doyle.Other things will happen in the game but I won't spoil in that part :pThe Scenario is kind of decent. I am not a huge fan of this as in, we already saw a lot of those in this early years because it was very popular to make sci-fi games // games with scientists and creatures like Half-Life but since it's a old game and that it was popular at this time, we can forgive them about that. :P________________PROS & CONSPROS:- Graphics are beautiful for how old the game is- Gameplay is decent for their very first game release- Different types of weapons (Shotgun, Snipers, machineguns, grenade-launcher, etc..!)- The story is okay! Not the craziest, but it's okay :P- A good amount of interactions on the radio for the Story, making so the game is not empty at some parts- You can find some funny magazines that they customized, giving more interactions with the player if you ever decided to discover stuffs around and not only play the game- There is 20 levels to do in the game. (Levels, chapters, whatever you call that :P)- The game is fun overallCONS:- The scenario can get dumb at some part, and somewhy you'll see Valerie randomly almost naked at some point lol- The gameplay can get terrible: There is some part where you can't do multiple things at once (Moving forward while shooting, then you can't move to the left or right anymore, somewhy)- In some maps, NPCs can shot you through walls (mostly Army Tents) and it is pretty frustrating to die from someone that you can't even see.- The difficulty is insane.I am very good at video games, and I died A LOT on most levels.I played in Standard, which were the 2nd difficulty out of 5. I got forced to use some cheats at the very 2 last chapters because they were no way to win for me:7 rocket launchers shooting at you and you instantly die, rare checkpoints to heal you / get shields and/or ammos.I never had to cheat to win anygame in the past and I played tons of games, difficult, or not.- Some levels can seem very very very long while some can be short- Some levels are extremely hard to pass just for a small part of it that is insane to win IF I CAN GIVE YOU A TIP, DON'T PLAY IT IN STANDARD AND GO FOR EASY LEVEL. :V _________________Overall, it's a great game to play.Probably the scariest of the 4 games (by that I mean, that there is a moments where you are in the dark with obscure ambiance, and out of a sudden monsters jump on you)I'm not saying that Far Cry games are scary in general, though :PMUST PLAY.

												The first thing to remember about this game is that it is over 10 years old.  However, 10 years later, it is still a great game to play.  The graphics are really nice for such an old game, and the envorinment is great.  The foliage and varying terrain provide great cover and lookout spots.  However, I do think the game misses out on a destructible environment, but this is mostly due to its age.  I would also call it open world, but it it does have linear aspects.  By this, I mean that there can be several routs and combinations you can employ to achieve objectives, but all of them guide you to the objective (i.e. an island will have 3 to 5 paths to get to the center, and each path will suit a different play style).  When you get inside places like the labs, the mission will become linear.  Personally, I was not bothered by this because that is how I feel it should work.  In real life, buildings are not supposed to have complicated floor plans, and it mixed it up from the open outside areas.  Together, these two set different tones and forced you to alter your play style and rely on different tactics.What I was most impressed by in this game was was the A.I.  They actually  act like thinking people in a lot of situations.  An example of this is them ""listening"" for your footsteps and other noises you make.  Another example is that they will operate in groups or squads, and will often to choose tactical approaches to get to you,  They are a challenge, but to me it makes the game feel more ""real"" and creates a fun challenge.Another thing I think the game gets right is the music.  It is incredible.  It comes on at appropriate times at the right volume for the perfect amount of time.  It does not take away fromt the game at all.Some of my final thoughts on the game include the voice acting, levels, and multiplayer.  Your character especially could use some improvement, but frankly, speaking is such a small part of the game that it barely matters.  You will actually probably laugh at it for most of the game, so it is not necissarily a bad thing.  The combinination of the A.I. and environent do create some incredibly tough levels.  However, they are all beatable, you just need to think outside the box sometimes.  Besides, what is a game without a challenge?  Finally, the multiplayer is dead, but lets be honest.  The game is old, its part of a popular franchise.  If you want multiplayer, get the newer games.Overall, I think this game is fantastic, and I would highly recommend this game.  I would buy the games when it is on sale, especially as part of the franchise pack, because the standard price is just too much.  The good news is that it is on sale all of the time.  I hope you this review is helpful, that you would consider getting the game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong, this is the best Far Cry ever released. This is still a classic game that has a place in my heart right next to DOOM, Quake, Half Life, and other classic games. But Steam sells a broken version of the game. If you want this game to work, you need to spend hours and hours browsing forgetten forums from 2006 to find ""fixes"" for this version, but the reality is that it will only work on 64 bit systems with extreme maintanence and will probably never work flawlessly on Windows 10.

												Far Cry was designed as the dream-come-true FPS game of some ambitious newcomers at gamedev stage - Crytek studio. Their first known project turned out as the real bomb when it was released. The hype was immersive - and after all those passed years, I have to say, this game is worth its reputation.""Thunder in Paradise"" rich setout unleashes badass oldschool shooter (like Doom or Half Life) - with so many fixes as one could imagine 12 years back: outstanding visuals and physics, witty and challenging level design, clever AI behavior... And level editor for icing the cake.I remember playing (and ending) this game in 2004-2005, with the hardest difficulty possible. The last level was utterly hard, and it changed my mentality forever. Seriously. Now I have but one fear in my life. My only fear is about ammo depletion. So far as I'm locked and loaded, let'em come!Well, sadly, my skill was decreased since those times, so now I am good enough only at ""challenging"", medium level difficulty. For the newcomers, however, I suggest to start from the basic level of difficulty - the standarts was really different then.I've read many depressing comments about this game from people who decided to give it a try, but was not ready for the outcome. Enemy soldiers are not aim-bots, that's I know for sure. If you're good with positioning and tactical movement in the rough terrains, if you're lucky... and if you're ready for constant reloads... Try it on!The game is selling for such a low price, that every FPS devotee should have no problem with adding this brilliant to the collection. The only real question before buying should be - are you really bad enough for this? You can't hide behind chest-high wall here and recover health. The enemies, once you'll allow them to spot you, will be engaging until you'll finish them all or die trying. Some of them will be crying for backup (and usually, they'll get one), some will be cornering you, while others will rush on you, using supressive fire, grenades and strafing moves... And all that you'll see right from the beginning!As for downsides: saving only at checkpoints is really annoying! Sometimes those checkpoints too far one from another, sometimes, when you crouch your way around enemy, you can not activate any checkpoint at all! And sometimes checkpoints are saving the game just the second before enemy sniper blows your head off. Some levels, otherwise quite well-performed, could become total clusterfunk due to those fixed savepoints. Like the upper level of the tanker, where you have only about 0.5 to 1 second to hide once you've climbed there, before bullethell breaks loose. Or later, in the second half of the game, where some enemies are getting on another level of the food chain... My advise there is to find tweakguide with using console around this problem. Or get over with it as it is!My mark is 8/10. Clever engine and gameplay, nice physics. We don't have scarcity for FPS games, that's right. But if you need FPS where you are not tied to corridor shootouts... Where you exploring the area around before engaging - or instead of it - to learn enemy's routes, behavior, weakpoints... Where you have to worry about not being hit more than about fragging another dozen of dummies - now, there's still not many good games like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somewhere during the late 90s and early 00s, first-person shooters grew increasingly more linear and tightly-scripted. This was largely due to the development time required for a relatively small team to create more open, non-linear environments with complex 3D architecture. As much as I enjoyed some of these linear shooters (No One Lives Forever and Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force spring to mind), I was starting to miss the days where I could walk into a room and discover three or more doors leading out of it. Also a little nervous that non-linear shooters were a thing of the past.Thankfully Far Cry allayed those fears from the get go, presenting the player with nearly endless vistas, huge islands to be explored, enemy encounters that could be approached in a variety of ways. It felt like a brand new yet also warmly nostalgic gaming experience. Far Cry was the first game I chose to play on a newly-built PC system back at the start of 2005. I also had Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Quake 4, Thief: The Deadly Shadows and Deus Ex: Invisible War waiting in the wings. Far Cry came free with the video card, so I decided to ""get it out of the way"" first, only to end up entranced for about 12-15 hours and finding it to be one of the strongest of that particular set of unplayed games.Thank you, Far Cry, for helping bring back non-linear environments to the FPS genre at a time when it desperately needed them.

Far Cry® Review - Rating: 8.6/10General ImpressionFar Cry® is a pretty nice action-based game. The graphics are relatively nice, but for 2004, they are spectacular. The textures are not very special either, but for 2004, they are well-made. The atmosphere varies a lot, from enemy camps and military bases, forests, waters and mountains. There are health kits, weapons, ammunition, binoculars, and even other useful items along the atmosphere. Also, sometimes you will be able to drive jeeps, and in certain missions, small air boats. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sounds of the guns. It sounds realistic. The music is also ambient-type and nice. The voice acting is alright. The gameplay is relatively an open-world style, where you need to go to specific places, to either kill your enemies, put a bomb on a place, or simply reach the evacuation point, and even other types of objectives. There are many scenarios, which will take at least one hour to complete (each one of them). Be aware: this game is pretty hard. Even on the easiest difficulty. If you are a casual player, I do not recommend this game to you. The story is well-thought, everything has a chronological order and it’s pretty interesting. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and a pretty nice design. For less resourceful people, this game might be harder. You need to figure out ways to get to the place of fighting and what to do. The controls are neat. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. Hence I have found several minor bugs, they will not bother you at all. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, everything moves pretty realistic. Also, when you kill your enemies, they fall pretty realistic. Overall, Far Cry® nice action-based game, with relatively nice graphics, a fantastic atmosphere, enjoyable audio and music, a good gameplay and pretty nice mechanics.Positive PointsRelatively nice graphics and pretty well-designed texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the scenarios available3 difficulties available (even on the easiest one, this game is pretty damn hard)A pretty nice designed user interfaceOpen-World gameplay alikeSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsSteam achievements and trading cards would be some nice featuresA note to casual players: You will rage a lot on this gameNegative PointsThis is only a negative point for less resourceful gamers: Hence this game does have a waypoint system (a bar with the cardinal points), you will still have a pretty hard time finding the places/objectives It has several minor bugs, but they are not very important ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry is a first-person shooter action game developed by Crytek and published by Ubisoft in 2004. It was a surprise for its advanced graphics engine and artificial intelligence .Jack Carver, a retired soldier, is hired by Valerie to explore an island. On the island, Doctor Krieger is involved in a genetic engineering project called ""Far Cry"" guarded by large numbers of mercenaries. There are also primates undergoing genetic serum treatment that converts them into aggressive monstrosities. The game is extensive and has a remarkable variety of levels for the time.The graphics engine was called CryEngine and it was a revolution at the time. It could show the outside world and vegetation in great detail. The image quality was surprising because everyone expected the best games to come from the hand of Id Software , Valve or Unreal . Far Cry managed to surpass these industry monsters on open outdoor environments. At that time one was stupefied seeing and walking the surrounding rainforest. Handling vehicles added an interesting gameplay add on.The experience of hang gliding on tropical islands was unique and later copied by several games like the wonderful 2013 Far Cry 3Game.The game was released for Windows PC with recommended CPUs from 2 to 3 Ghz, 1 GB of RAM and 128 MB graphics cards supporting DirectX 9.0b . Many video cards suffered enough with this game in 2004.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Far Cry es un juego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Crytek y distribuido por Ubisoft en 2004. Fue una sorpresa por su avanzado motor gráfico y la inteligencia artificial. Jack Carver, un soldado retirado, es contratado por Valerie para explorar una isla. En la isla se encuentra el Doctor Krieger involucrado en el proyecto de ingeniería genética “Far Cry” custodiado por gran cantidad de mercenarios. En la isla hay además primates sometidos a sueros genéticos que se han covertido en monstruosidades agresivas. El juego es extenso y tiene una variedad de niveles notable para la época.El motor gráfico se denominó CryEngine y  para la época fue una revolución en mostrar el mundo exterior y la vegetación. Maneja HDR (alto rango dinámico) y nubes volumétricas. La calidad de la imagen fue sorprendente, ya que todos esperaban que los mejores juegos vengan de la mano de Id software, Valve o Unreal. El Far Cry consiguió superar a estos monstruos enos entornos exteriores abiertos. En aquél momento uno se quedaba estupefacto viendo la selva tropical circundante. Además el manejo de vehículos le agregaba una jugabilidad muy interesante.La experiencia de volar en ala delta por islas tropicales fue única y copiada posteriormente por varios juegos como el Maravilloso Far Cry 3 del 2013.El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, se recomendaban procesadores de 2 a 3 Ghz, 1 GB de memoria RAM y tarjetas gráficas de 128 MB con soporte DirectX 9.0b. Muchas tarjetas de video sufrían bastante con este juego en 2004.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry was Crytek's flagship game, and they definately left a lasting impression on the gaming industry as a whole.The maps are gigantic tropical islands that you tend to explore only 10% of by going through the linear path. There's a huge amount of detail and a map editor to design your own islands with.That's not counting the single player experience itself. Which teaches you by experience rather than a tutorial. Inorder to take out a base of enemies you have to use stealth tactics and guerilla warfare, all of which take thinking and strategy to properly pull off. Picking the game up today will result in dying very often due to the intelligent AI, but you'll adapt, conquer, and survive. Playing this game is indeed like being on a vacation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, you should know that this game is the FPS version of Dark Souls. You're gonna die a lot. If you like the games where the victory is simply served to you, you should avoid this game. Now the real rewiev:+The graphics are pretty good for a game that was made 10 years ago.+The game is really hard, which makes it better because after you beat a part you were stuck for a while, you feel rewarded.+The story is very well thought even though it's not really realistic for a man to slaughter his way up to the end.+There is a plot twist at the end, which I didn't see it coming and was surprised.+It isn't short. I finished the game on medium difficulty in 14 hours.-There is a glitch in the game, that makes you visible even when you are in a tent or hiding in bushes.-The enemies just start to shoot at you from meters away, when it is actually impossible for them to even see you coming.-You can't really sneak because the enemies hear the lightest footstep and start shooting at you.-There is not enough checkpoints, so if you die at a point you have to redo all the thing even it was incredibly hard.Do I recommend this game? Hell, yeah. If you want a good challenge while playing a good game, get this gem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Want to carry reserve health packs? ♥♥♥♥ You.I hope you see my point now. This game is the very definition of scripted hard. Sure S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is difficult with its enemies' various methods of attacks and variables, but Far Cry is just abusive at times. 5 game modes, with even easy being a challenge for anyone hooked to the post-360 generation of combat.Graphics still stay pretty for fauna and still lookes great on the eyes, if I played this back in 2004, this would probably set my world (and motherboard) on fire. Once enemies with nearly 100% accuracy start to become beatable, the game throughs giant monsters at you. My only complaint besides it being abusive is the lack of quick saving or user defined saving. Its all checkpoints and crap.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This gets destroyed by unknown soldiers.Then you go & find a man who tell you how you can defeat them. During your adventure you will find out, why the soldiers are there & why they bombed your boat.This is a typical action& stealth game. You can't take for example your shotgun, run to 4 guys, try kill them & survive this attack. You have to sneak, hide like Rambo & fight like him, in other words:you spend most of your time crouching or crawling. This is not always easy, because the enemys as mentioned before aren't stupid, they won't stay at their place & wait for you! They will follow you & they can hide themselfs.At last they can take much damage(except the head), you will also meet them rarely alone.If you shoot them from far away they will shoot back or go to your position. I mean, if they noticed you one time, they will never come back to their old positions, if possible they will follow you through the whole map, so you must locate & kill them before they do the same with you. Also you must be prepared for every situation, you cant shoot during all the game with the same weapon.In the middle of the story you will have to sneak/crouch because the special forces are just...badass. You can't skill your character during the game, he will always stay the same, so you will/must become better.So if you aren't very good at FPS games, don't buy it, it wouldnt be good for you.However I recommend this game for players who search for a challenge.9/10***If you survive & finish this game on the difficulty realistic, you can beat/rank up/win in csgo or any other multiplayer games easily.***			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fantastic game that will result in you dying over and over again but having incredible amounts of fun whilst doing so. Only con is that there is no map editor like Instincts. Btw, Rag dolls, and non-linear missions. Man have i missed rag dolls and non-linear missions.Top 8 ways to die-Fall 5 feet-drown in a puddle-Accidently get tapped by a car-Shoot ones-self with rocket launcher-Walk within 2 feet of steam-Drive into a tree-Hand-glide into a cliff-Shot by giant mutated people with rocket launchers for arms (cause why the hell not!)If this is on special, get it.

												[EN]Without doubt one of the most challenging games I have ever played. There’s five difficulty levels - easy, medium, challenging, veteran and realistic. On „medium”, which I’ve finished you die a lot, I mean you die over and over again – I think you are more often dead than alive. Despite the fact how hard this game is, it’s a very good FPS. Even though it’s over 10 years’ old, graphics are pretty good (especially in 4K), very good music and atmosphere. Multiplayer is still alive  - you just need to sign in with your Uplay account. If you like challenges and old style FPS’s then this game is for you.[PL]Bez wątpienia jedna z najcięższych gier w jakie grałem. Pięć poziomów trudności - easy, medium, challenging, veteran i realistic. Na ""medium”, który ja skończyłem giniesz bardzo często, znaczy się umierasz co chwilę - jesteś chyba częściej martwy niż żyjesz. Pomijając poziom trudności Far Cry to bardzo dobry FPS.  Mimo tego, że gra ma ponad 10 lat to grafika jest całkiem niezła (zwłaszcza w 4K), bardzo dobra muzyka i fajny klimat. Nadal można pograć w multiplayer’a – wystarczy zalogować się w grze używając konta Uplay. Jeśli lubisz wyzwania i FPS’y w starym stylu to ta gra jest dla Ciebie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As fun as I remember it and that was 10 years ago believe it or not.The enemy AI is great, some units will team up and attempt to sneak up on you while others will directly attack you head on. In certain camps the enemies will fire through their tents even if they can't see you. (bug)The maps are really large, excluding the indoor ones and it isn't as open world as Far Cry 2 or 3 but it's still great. There also isn't any working multiplayer either just to add, but that isn't suprising considering its age.The laughable voice overs and cheesy dialogue is an added bonus. :)+Buy it on sale for the best value or pay full price if your a boss+			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is from 2004, but its worth every penny.  One of my first FPS games and I still love it.  Its 5 difficulties and many players have serious troble in the first.  There are somethimes you just have to shoot youre way in and others use stelth to get to the end point.  The most importent thing is to mark enemies with binoculars  before you enter an area, maybe go up on a hill or take a sneakpeak.  Also those on far distance and especially those in towers or on hilltops.  Use armed cars (humvee and buggy) when you move outdoors and even boats.Its playable on all win computers (and maybe Mac or Linux) and you just DL, install and start play.  Like all Steam games; verify file catch for every game you DL and install.  Thats a good thing do do before you start playing.  Steam has ver. 1.4 -32 bit and no other patches is needed.  You can install -64 bit, but you dont have to.  you get some more locations in levels (places to find more sniperammo, grenades), more explosives in areas/bases (shoot to explode and kill mercs) and slighly better textures.  But i play them both seperatly and didnt do it all, as wrote in guide for -64 bit (renameed bin32 to bin32.bak and bin64 to bin32) - Only to have steam overlay in -64bit version.  I let them stay as seperate games.  And for all new players (and old too):Make a new profile for each difficulty you play (never use default) and you can play -32 bit or -64 bit and use same profile for both.  Then you later can go back to a lower level to check out other ways or places to explore if you get into trouble in harder difficulties.  In the last you will get a lot of problems...   goood luck			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Once you get to the part where Jack Carver (player) is kicked out of the helicopter, he gets up and your faced to jump over a high waterfall, surrounded by tridgen mutants and like 10 bullets to use lol. I enjoyed jumping off the hang-glider into the water ;o). For being a game that's 11 years old, it's still fun to play. If you like Action/Adventure this is a great game to give a chance!

												Having passed this game 3 times ( 2 times on the original CD version) i can tell you that this is a good game. The mechanics are all here and has great physics. There is some tough moments in the game but it's nothing impossible if you're willing to change up your strategy . The singleplayer is all i really play but the multiplayer isn't exactly dead. There is some servers at certain times of the day where you can join a full match and it can be loads of fun. The only issue i have with this game is that everytime i exit the game, it leaves a window saying critical exeption ....etc. And the voice acting is kinda funny. -Decent Story-Amazing gameplay-Beautiful graphics even to this day9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crouch, sneak, sneak, sneak.  Knife kill.Crouch, sneak, sneak, sneak.  Sniper kill.Crouch, sneak, sneak, sneak, repeat Sniper kill until you run out of sniper ammo.Jump in enemy jeep and kill everyone with the heavy machine gun mounted on the back.Crouch sneak, sneak, sneak,  Run really fast to get as close as you can and unload with your assault rifle until everyone is dead but you.  Use hang glider to sneak up on enemy outpost.  Throw Grenade and wait for explosion, plant C-4 and wait for explosion, use bazooka to blow up enemy helicopter.  Run around shooting people until your eyes are so tired and bloodshot that you can't blink anymore. Rat -a- tat tat. Rat -a- tat tat.  BOOM!Repeat  the above until you win the game.If this sounds like fun to you, then this game will get the job done.  A real challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being the first entry in the series, this game makes honour to its name. Despite being quite old, it still manages to be a good game, although it presents several problems that impact negatively against its overall quality. The AI, for example, while good for flanking the player and working together, feels unfair since they can see the player through walls, and they spot you quite easily, so stealth isn't as fun as it should.There's a good variety of enemies to fight, with different weapons and skills, but, as mentioned, there are problems with them. Another problem is that some can kill you quite easily before you even spot them. As for weapons, there's different types, and they all work very good.The environments are impressive. From beaches, to old Japanese bunkers (and ships) from WWII, going through jungles, swamps, and even a volcano, this island has everything; and you can use several vehicles to move around.As far as the story goes, it's like a cheesy 90s action film. Not to say that's bad, since it really fits the tone of the game; and, let's be honest, jumping out of a jeep as it falls from a cliff towards the ocean is something that makes you feel awesome.All in all, I recommend it, even though it made me rage a bit.

												In Far Cry you shoot, you hide, you cry and you die A LOT!It's an open world game where you have free choice how to approach enemies. You can try several tactics and see what works the best for you. It's not run and gun kind of game. You will need to go stealth very often. Trust me you will feel much better when they don't know about you. The last thing you want is a rocket into your face!Causions! It's a game which can cause you high level of frustration! It doesn't have quick save option so you just have to hold your breath and hope for next checkpoint before you get killed from the very last survival hiding somewhere so well that even your binoculars didn't register him! And then all the hard long work starts over ;)There are some bugs.. sometimes they make it easier for you but mostly harder. If you think you never swear, you will when experiencing some unfair situations in this game when you do nothing wrong and still get smashed like a ripe tomato!I really like and enjoy Far Cry, the combination of frustration and satisfaction after finishing hard missions. I like hiding in bushes and taking enemies one by one. I like all the cute mutants in game and they like me too obviously.. they cuddled me so much! Very deadly cuddles!I would recommend the game to everyone who likes good old games and who has the time and patience to retry missions. With Far Cry you will feel like your other games got so much easier! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Pros  Solid and satisfying overall gameplay Excellent graphics, even to this day Fairly long in length Reasonably impressive gore Large level variety and scale, everything from beaches to japanese bunkers to vast scientific facilities Levels are open to exploration Almost no filler levels Reasonably effective stealth system Decent enemy variety Talkative protagonist Trigents are a unique aspect not commonly found elsewhere Creepy and unnerving without the use of jumpscares Neutral  Voice acting is laughable at times. Driving is a bit wonky, but workable Cutscene animation is overtly cheesy The selection of weapons is somewhat small No crosshairs, with the exception of scopes Opening sequence doesn't make any sense Cons  Enemies have nearly pin-point accuracy, even on lower difficulties Enemies have wallhacks through certain types of walls Plot basically boils down to ""We came, we saw, we killed everyone"" Some level sequences feel long-winded Armoured enemies occasionally shed off rifle bullets like dandruff With the exception of explosives and the sniper rifle, enemies can take infinite amounts of bullets at longer ranges Physics engine is likely to kill you with inanimate objects A driving sequence that's likely to kill you multiple times because of the aforementioned aimbot An escort missing where the NPC will probably drop under a bridge, unable to move Final score:  8.7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oldie but goodie, Nominated this one for the ""WHOOOAAAAAA, DUDE!"" award simply because even today this game is still miraculous. The combat system in it's series is bar none; the story in it's series is top notch, and honestly no other Far Cry can even come close to how awesome this one is. This is still my favorite Far Cry even having played all of them, the engine is just simply better in every way. Back in 2004 this is the one game game developers wished they had on their resume. This game is from back when Ubisoft cared about the quality of their games, and made strives to make every element of them astounding. Sadly their quality is no better than EA's or late Bethesda's, it's horrible when Developers/Publishers get lazy but you can always appreciate the gems they put out for us.Graphics: 10/10Even today I can't believe how amazing this game still looks, even modern games nowadays still barely match it's par in performance and aesthetic. It's either the graphics are too complicated for most computers to run optimally, or the graphics have to be dumbed down enough to meet in the middle. Far Cry is a benchmark and example you can literally do both if you put actual effort into your game. Developers nowadays don't have the same inspiration as they used to, every game that comes out nowadays just seems like a rushed pile of crap. Bonus points for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ motion blur, or awful looking bloom/HDR. Being honest I CANNOt stress enough how awful motion blur is, andshould NEVER EVER be used in a game. This game passes the perfect 10 test by having everything it needs, and not including options it doesn't need.Engine: 9.5/10Everything is cohesive and works great, as well as FPS is stable and it's performance runs smoother than a brand new Chevy. There's an option for everything you could possibly desire, it runs smooth and even lower end duo-cores with low profile GPU's can possibly run this on max settings. At least my old dual-core could, and the thing would STILL pump out 100+ FPS without even dropping below 90. This engine is the definition of perfection, and this game is the perfect example of it's capabilities. Some downsides are how dated it might seem even today, but to be honest besides how useless melee weapons really are in the game the combat system is quite nice overall.Customizability: 10/10The game has everything you need, every option you could/need want is there for your choosing. Truly no afterthoughts with customization, sadly multiplayer is no longer a thing unless if you're fine with private server trackers (which normally have an ample amount of cheaters.) There's very loose modding support, but considering it's an older CryEngine game, you really can't take points off for that.Interface: 10/10The menus are sensible and very aesthetically pleasing, everything is simplified and not overly complicated. For a game of it's time, it seems in the interface there are no afterthoughts. It even has a developer console in case if you feel like exploring the island a little more.Functionality: 10/10This game has never crashed for me, not even in the earlier versions. The quality assurance of this game must've been on point because I VERY rarely run into any glitches in multiple playthroughs. Once in awhile something might spawn inside a mountain, but if anything it's great for a laugh.Sound: 8.5/10One of the lower points of this game is the sound, and it's levelling/zoning. To be honest it's not terrible whatsoever, but some sounds are lower quality than others and stick out more. Some sound zoning can be quite confusing as npc's in certain positions will actually some how play a ventriloquist and seems like they're either farther or closer away at times. With having a dedicated soundcard and Sennheiser headphones, I feel if anything this is more of the game's issue than mine. Although the atmosphere is really just fine, this game was definitely not made for 3D sound emulation.Overall: 9.7What can I say? This old gem still holds it's own weight even today, the game is just fun to play and has a great storyline attached to it.  Was definitely worth whatever I spent on it, not that I ever remember how much it was to begin with. If you see this on sale consider picking it up, although keep in mind it's astounding for 2004 it's still from 2004! If you want to experience a gem from the early 2000's, and happen to be fond of Adventure FPS games with slight roleplay elements then considering dropping a few bones on this. Maybe Ubisoft will finally take a hint, and start actually trying to develop games like they used to. You know, with love, dedication, and some applications of elbow grease here and there.

												One thing i loved about this game is how difficult it is. The A.I. of your enemies and the non-regenerating health adds a challenge, hardly seen in modern FPS games. Additionally, the environment is beautiful and you surely won't get enough of it! Something i hated was the monsters and the story. I started the game thinking that it would be a realistic shooter... Then i saw monsters and that kinda killed the realistic feel i had for game. As for the story, two words: cliche and repeated.Despite monsters and the story, shooting, sneaking and generally the gameplay makes it a great game for meRecommended/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd have to say this is probably crytek's best game. The graphics hold up even by today's standards. Gameplay is not perfect but its ok. The AI is extremely tough, maybe a bit cheap, and expect to die and die a lot. Having completed it on realistic difficulty, at first I thought what a load of bs. Then I realized that is how the devs wanted the game to be. You have to plan your attacks by tagging enemies on your binocs and then you either have to pick off enemies from a distance with an assault rifle or go prone and sneak up on them with a suppressed smg. No regenerating health either. You have to look for medkits and armour. Overall I would recommend it for players who like a tough challenge. Definitely more fun than Crysis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Far Cry  is a classic FPS that started the Far Cry franchise that people know and love. I wanted to play the original because I wanted to check out the franchise's origins and see if the game held up.Overall, the game is pretty entertaining. I will warn you though that of the five difficulties, the hardest is extremely hard and you will have to min/max in order to beat the game in a timely manner. When I played, I played on the normal difficulty (3 of 5), which took me about 15 hours to beat.The humor in the game is a little campy, but is enjoyable to laugh at if you don't take the game seriously. Overall I recommend playing it if you enjoy shooters and you found yourself wondering about if the game still holds up in 2015.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My god! It has really been 10 years since this game was released! It truly is unbelievable how time flies!Anyway, this is one of those FPS games that I consider a milestone in the genre. Came out around the same time as Half Life 2 and Doom 3 did. I remember playing FPS games with corridors and relatively big rooms but never a game where you have a completely open island at your disposal and you can go wherever you want. Also, the game's engine handled these scenes very well and the frame per sec value did not drop significantly once you left a building and were in the open.The story is quite silly, actually. You escort a journalist to an island then suddenly a rocket destroys your boat. Now, being stranded on this island, your only chance of survival is to go deep into the jungles. You'll soon find out why there are so many mercenaries with several bases here and what cruel experiments they've been conducting for a while.The game was really beautiful at the time and beside the open-door areas it gave you the option to commandeer vehicles. This was also new at the time and this was refined later on in Crytek's Crysis. As much as I thought the story of Far Cry was lackluster I thoroughly enjoyed this game and did several walkthroughs.

Really smooth gameplay and such.  Old, but nice graphics.  Difficulty is insane, even on the lowest option. (Adds playtime)    The Bads  Steam update broke the stealth mechanics  AI issues and such.

												Even though this game is over 10 years old, it still looks beautiful. The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim. The variation in weapons is not great, but it is good enough (should have been more weapons with silencer).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a beautiful game, but surprisingly un-fun. After the novelty of the setting wears off, you're left with a very repetitive assault FPS that gets crazy difficult as the game progresses.Games like Far Cry that won't allow me to save my progress where I like have an uphill battle to gain my love. After the 4th or 5th time re-assaulting a jungle village, only to die from a sniper shot after clearing 90% of it, my patience was worn thin. It's uneven difficulty, apparently to make a short, pretty  game feel longer. This is one of a very few games that I quit without finishing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing to say, this game has a rather drastic difference compared to the other far cry games. Mutants, yup, you read that right; Mutants. I wont say too much more on the subject as it is a key part of the story.Please don't let the Mutants put you off, this is still a great game with a decent story and fun gameplay. This took me around 12 hours to complete the campaign on the difficulty set on challenging but difficulties can be changed by to easy, normal, veteran or realistic. As you can imagine realistic is a nightmare but adds some replay value to the game as there are no collectibles.In total there are 20 missions for you to complete and there is some exploration to be done if you desire to do so. This exploration is not like other far cry games in an open world but each mission is quite vast so you can check out different buildings etc to find guns, armor and other useful items.You will find a range of weapons and vehicles to assist in completing missions. Weapons range from pistols, assault rifles, SMG's, sniper rifles and rocket launchers, some weapons also have an alternate fire mode such as a grenade launcher or changing fire rates. As for vehicles you will experience cars, boats and hand gliders.There is also a mulitplayer mode on the main menu when you start this game but it requires a ubi.com account; therefore I decided not to try this mode out but if it does work; chances are that no one would be playing anymore.One final note; the graphics for this game are still rather impressive seeing as that at the point of this review the game is 13 years old, and even better; almost every GPU from the last 10 years or every GPU from the last 5 years will be able to play this game with max settings.This is a good game and I definitely recommend it. As mentioned previously, try not to let the Mutants put you off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's 'fun' difficult, then there's 'unfair' difficult. This definately qualifies as 'unfair' difficult. Stealth kills are a no-go as far as I know, since apparently the enemy is telepathically linked and KNOW when you stab one of their guys even if they didn't shoot nor yell or were seen, and immediately coordinate lock on your location. They also can perfectly shoot you through bushes and tent walls as if they had Xray hacks. That's just the first 30 minutes. If that's how it's going to be on ""Normal"" difficulty, I think I'll pass. I dunno why they even bother with the rock throwing mechanic because if you kill one guy, no matter how quiet, they know exactly where you are and you cannot hide.I understand other games are like that, but this game exists on the premise of tactical gameplay. But you can't exactly be tactical with mercinary psychics. You are better off playing this as if it were Doom or something. While that may not be bad itself, it seems strange in a tropical environment with bushes that realistically you could sneak around in.The story is shakey even from the start. For one, after a brief acid trip, some CIA dude I guess somehow KNEW exactly where you'd be and left a phone for you to contact you with. I dunno I guess everyone in the game has a 6th sense but you...unless of coarse you beat the game already. All I can say is this game has a cronic case of game logic.I did not encounter any of these problems in Farcry: Instincts, so I assume obviously Ubisoft listened to the negative feedback with this game and fixed it for the alternate remake.

												There are some who think that Goldeneye is still the best FPS. They are wrong, it's Far Cry in all its original and awesome, hilarious glory. It doesn't matter how many hours I play it, it still has me on edge - laughing and swearing in equal measure. Hasn't dated a millisecond and is a million miles better than any of the sequels which aren't sequels, they just share a name.Some games just get it right - Neverwinter, Ocarina of Time and Far Cry.

												One of the classic FPS games that set the new standard in gameplay and graphics in its time.  The jungle scenery and island panoramic views were and still are breathtaking.  The ability to take a different approach to a single situation rather than being led on a rail to each action segment made the game very flexible for many players.  Once you enter the hallways though, the game turns more into a Doom clone where you only have one path to choose and you are faced with a new type of enemy that again evokes memories of Doom.  As a whole the story is interesting and gives you meaning to why you are fighting for your life.  I like your companion that helps you throughout the game to give you directions on where to go and what to do as well as giving background to the storyline.  The storyline consists of your boat, while on vacation, being shot down as you travel near an island.  You recover in the island and start playing cat and mouse to survive only to realize that this was no accident and the crew of your boat were purposely near that island.  But why?  What is so important about THIS island?  Play and find out, definitely a classic for all gamers to experience at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite being a 10 year old game, FarCry still manages to impress with its dated graphics and gameplay mechanics. Games back then struggled to balance gameplay with open worlds as most computers at that time simply could not handle the processing power. Yet Crytek and Ubisoft decided to take that extra step and prove everyone that they could make a giant game for its time.There is no question that the islands that you play on are huge. While the game is not true “open world” per say, it still offers amazing space to test out your strategies. The game is linear in a sense that you progress through “zones”. Each zone has its own small enemy settlements, vehicles, and random events. Some zones are very linear while others promote exploration and different use of tactics. This is where FarCry is at its best. FarCry becomes so much fun when you as the player can figure out your own strategy in how to take down the enemy. Will you fly above your enemies and try to land on their base? Drive up in a armored vehicle and blast your way through? Perhaps take the underground passage and surprise your enemy. Or simply drag your enemy out into the jungle where you pick one by one.Yet there are moments where FarCry will feel like a totally different game. Halfway through you are forced to play within confined walls and shoot “Trigens” or mutated human soldiers who do ridiculous jumps and can one shot you, making gameplay extremely frustrating. To make it even worse, the game’s autosave feature saves seldom, making dying even more infuriating. Luckily, this can be fixed by a quick in console command.Make no mistake, FarCry is a very difficult game. Perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever played on hard. But it isn’t the “fun” type of difficult. It’s more of the bullcrap type where enemies have unlimited rocket launchers, grenades, and machinegun ammo while you run out quickly. Additionally, the game breaking bugs such as enemies spotting you behind walls and managing to shoot you behind tents and knowing exactly where you are makes stealth rather useless. It’s as if the game is taunting you that it could be much better had stealth actually worked.The game’s story is nothing noteworthy as it suffers from stereotypical clichés, boring characters, and a villain who makes little to no sense. FarCry does, however, do a good job in making you feel like a predator throughout the game. At times, you can feel the effect you have on the world as your enemy gets more and more frightened by you.Last but not least, the game has some serious glitches that makes gameplay infuriating. Saving during the zone called “Swamps” and loading is not possible after the car chase as the save always becomes corrupt. The only way to complete that part is to simply not die. Which when you play on hard, is not very easy to do. Additionally, the BS enemies who can snipe you miles away while you cannot even see them within distance is another part of the game which may make you want to throw your controller or mouse at the monitor. For being a 10 year old game, Ubisoft sure has not spent time in fixing some of these serious glitches, and it’s a problem since they are selling the game with these glitches.Overall, unless you are a classic FPS lover who wants to experience the very roots of the FarCry franchise, you won’t be finding much here. FarCry is both fun and maddening, and the bugs certainly do not help. It can be fun, however, to try the open zones and play the game when it is at its best. I certainly recommend that.Score: 6/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overwview : If you are more than 14 years old then you must remember the classic Far Cry 1 !!!                   It was way before there was a crysis & the game just came out with cry engine (CryTek) & the massive open world was so big that most players had to upgrade their VGAs to 128 mega byte cards !Thats right back then 128 Mega byte was HUGE amount of memory for a vga...Gameplay : even right now betweeen good (FPS) games like unreal tounament, crysis, battlefield, etc... Far Cry stands out !It's smooth tracking for cursor gives the player a true PC FPS experience...The way the enemies evolve with ur playstyle is amazing, they get stronger to further challenge you, if you play too well... ( not a lot of games has this even now days )the game does not simply raise the difficulty level, a good program is written too handle this...The Story : The story is solid, it doesnt evolve the guy turning sides at the last seconds.... like boring games....The character of the player is believable and has a voice that goes along with visuals and bring it more to life....   Is It For You Or Not ? : If you love FPS games that rely on actuall true gameplay and aiming you will enjoy this game...Even the graphics are good now because the game was ahead of its time when released...If you liked crysis, you will like this too.i give this game 9.1/10Reviewed By IMMORTALEADER			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crytek is a developer that knows how to create near perfect first person shooters. Far Cry is another of those examples from their repertoire. This is some great, solid stuff, despite the bugs and glitches. A game to remember. Far Cry is hard. A true challenge even at the easier difficulty settings. Performance is an issue even for today's hardware standards. The game seems to need a fresh system restart to run at its full potential. There are plenty of bugs and glitches. Some were so major that I was forced to reload a save point several times. The game engine and physics is different than most other games, and this takes a little getting used to. The main character's voice acting is pretty bad. Almost to the point of making it sound like a comedy. For whatever idiotic reason, the game alters the Windows audio settings to its liking without setting them back to their original state. This is extremely annoying. Staying in the subject of sound, do a Google search and you will see the massive amount of sound problems people experience in this game. To access the multiplayer portion of the game, one is forced to register and create an account with Ubisoft, which is absolutely ridiculous. The developers clearly reward players who specialize in stealth and skill shots rather than running and gunning. The atmosphere, mood, and setting are superb; providing a tense and exciting experience almost every second of the game. The tension you will experience is not often produced by other games at this same level. There are many parts where you will be spooked and surprised by what comes around the corner or appears suddenly. It is all done very well. Level design in this game is outstanding. The AI is good, and there is always a challenge. Far Cry is all thriller, no filler. It took me about 17 hours to complete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: A challenging, but rewarding and realistic old-school FPS.Sale Price: $2.50 (what I paid)Pros:-The difficulty (I'll count this as a pro). I played it in the middle difficulty (out of five) and it was, by far, the hardest FPS I've ever played. The whole game forces you to rely on split-second timing and perfect long-distance aiming to survive. This makes you much more tense than newer FPS with regenerating health ever seem to do. You're often forced to methodically clear areas slowly and precisely, which is much different than most run-n-gun games these days. Far Cry 3's hardest difficulty was significantly easier than this.-The stealth works very well. Your only chance at survival is to creep around in the woods. The ""attention meter"" is your best friend. Also your night-vision goggles are essential at spotting enemies in the distance and in the dark.-The AI is very advanced for the time. The bad guys will sound alarms to bring in help (which was reused in FC3), and will  take cover. However, they do occasionally do stupid things that shows how old the AI is, but it's not too bad.-The maps are semi-open world, with a set destination but often with multiple paths through the jungle or in vents. This design is the main thing that distinguished the game from other shooters at the time, and it's still cool today.-The graphics are very good for the time, particularly the map size and the foilage. Crytek are the masters of realistic video game foilage, and it shows here.Cons:-There's no quick-save, just checkpoints. You'll often find yourself running like a madman through the jungle in hopes of passing an autosave checkpoint. A game this hard needs to allow you to save more often, although any time you want probably isn't ideal either. There is a console command that lets you quick-save, which I used towards the end of the game when I was fed up. I recommend you decide at the beginning whether you will use it and then stick with your choice.-There's a bug that allows enemies to see you through tents and sometimes walls. I hear, there's a fan-patch online to fix  this, along with some graphical improvements. I honestly didn't notice the wall thing at all, and there's not very many tents in the game in the first place.-Finally, the plot is equivalent to a pretty average B-movie story. The voice-acting is somewhat dubious, and the main character, though fairly memorable, doesn't seem to enjoy anything at all.-Multiplayer is dead and almost certainly isn't coming back.

												Graphics are lovely with a real tropical feel to the game and a small amount of awe as you realise you can go anywhere on the maps, which are sometimes HUGE, Objectives are well paced and not confusing. There's no wandering around wondering what to do next.The enemy AI is very good, especially considering the open nature of the game, often they will try to out-flank your position or simply get behind cover so you must then flush them out leading to some pretty tense moments. However, it's not perfect, sometimes you will see the bad guys rooted to the spot for an easy kill or they simply charge your well hidden position and it's a turkey shoot. If anything, the flaws in AI make the game easier which is preferable to the opposite situation!The weapons are beautiful: a mix of real and futuristic improvements. Ammo is never really a problem (well, with the exception of the Sniper rifle bullets and the RPG loads when they would really tip the balance in your favour) and, most importantly, the damage they inflict is balanced: both enemies and player go down with about the same amount of damage. Where the game falls down is near the end when a couple of pointless nonsensical plot-twists ruin the story. The game 'ends' three times, with some ill-thought through extra levels tagged on each time.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry has changed considerably as a series, most apparent when looking back at the first instalment, you might not even like this title even if you're a fan of subsequent Far Cry games, it's simply not the same. On it's own Far Cry has aged, and that's incontestable. Clear examples of ageing include the AI acting incomprehensibly at times, the graphics that haven't held up well, and probably the worst part of the entire game; the utterly predictable, rather cliché story that you're unlikely to get invested in.On a lighter note, gameplay has held up extremely well in my opinion, the gun-play was well implemented with a variety of weaponry to use, the levels are large enough and well laid out for facilitating various approaches to objectives whilst still being linear as a whole. As I said, just because you liked Far Cry's sequels won't necessarily mean you'll enjoy this so I'd recommend looking at some videos before you consider purchasing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike most games the bad guys in Far Cry really do have a mind of their own so its not just a case of running through and popping the odd enemy here and there, the mercenaries in this game are highly clued up and will detect you whether you move slowly, take cover or simply make them paranoid, you will not get past these guys easily.The best description for Far Cry would be ""a game that received hype, but lived up to every last damn word of it"".It delivers on all fronts: graphics, story, and especially gameplay. The only downside is that those with lower end machines are going to have to drop their graphics and resolution down quite a bit to achieve an acceptable frame rate.If you want a thrilling single-player FPS with the best looking graphics to date, then FarCry is for you.

												Far Cry 1 is definitely on my list of top 5 favorite shooters of all time. Graphics still look amazing even up to today's standards. This was the first PC game I ever played. It started my entire PC gaming career, and for that reason I have to give this game extra credit. Far Cry brings back a lot of memories and nostalgia when I hear the ambience and environment of the jungle. What I've always loved most about this game is the sound and ""feel"" of the guns. I've played a lot of FPS in my time, but Far Cry has a way of making each and every weapon equally satisfying and fun to use. The physics are really well done. The hit detection makes your kills feel very satisfying while shooting at the island's mercenaries. This is my main game that I can always fall back on even to this day no matter how old it is.This game will challenge you. The AI are tough. If you're new to this game then it is no walk in the park. The ""Medium"" difficulty alone was rough my first time around. I still have my retail copy of this game and with years of experience I've improved a lot and have managed to move on to higher difficulty levels in campaign. This game blends in the role of stealth and action. Most scenarios require you to think of different tactics in order to take out each and every enemy one by one instead of the typical ""run and gun"" shooter. Adding new singleplayer Mods and Maps will greatly enhance the fun of this game. You just have to know where to put these files in the FarCry directory because this game doesn't support Steam Workshop unfortunately. There are also map editing tools you can download to create your own single player levels.The sequels to Far Cry are completely different compared to this one. Story wise and gameplay wise. I'll always prefer the original Far Cry over the newer ones any day. This is the real Far Cry experience. To me what has always been disappointing is how the sequels do not continue the story of the main character, Jack Carver. He is without question the true protagonist to Far Cry above any of the new playable characters in the sequels.Every FPS veteran should know of this game and played it before at least once. If you haven't, I highly recommend buying it. Crytek develops some of the best games of all time, such as the Crysis series, and Ryse: Son of Rome. Aside from that, it's too bad Crytek abandoned Far Cry and didn't develop the sequels.I wouldn't feel too skeptical about some of the negative reviews. Do not hesitate to buy this classic. Highly recommend. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Aside from that, it's too bad Crytek abandoned Far Cry and didn't develop the sequels.I wouldn't feel too skeptical about some of the negative reviews. Do not hesitate to buy this classic. Highly recommend. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow It is mindblowing...I actually just wanted to test the performance but i was so immersed in the game i could not let go for a full day. If you're looking for an excellent game and don't mind the graphics too much then you'Re right here. The graphics are actually not that bad but now this game is getting 10 years old and compared to other titles of this age and now it offers a lot.1.You can drive anything a buggy or jeep, that will allow to shoot during driving. Also you can choose between a rubber boat, speed boat with rocket launcher, hang glider or big truck. This things jump, drift, get wrecked and accelarate differently.2.Moving like in not many other shooters. This one offers what battlefield 3 does: sprint, prone, jump, crouch, lean left and right. As well as making different noise levels for the enemy and beeing more or less easy to spot.3.Shooting at it's best with realistic weapon recoil, holding breath for shooting. crouching and proning affects accuracy significantly, as well as running. 4. No line shooter. You can engage in 3 different walkways most times and don't need to kill more than 50% of the enemies to get through. I had so much fun attacking the enemy in the back or even just melee them. No matter if you like to sniper around, avoid stress or just blast the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the situation. If you're good then it will work and if not then you will be restarted at the last quick save.5. Not open world nut action bubbles with nice details and long distances before reload. Everything stays on the map except corpses. if you forgot to pick up more ammo? No problem you can run back until the start of the level and it is still there altogether with those cars you've blown up and the huts you destroyed.6. Intelligent AI. Not the usual noobs you encounter in some new shooters. They fall back take cover and engage you from different sides. No AI actually stands still once they noticed you. None of them spawns behind or in front of you. They just come from any corner of this map where you forgot to look for them.If you are defensive and slow they approach you early and thus you won't face later so much. Vise versa for the heatheaded attacker.7. The Physics are awesome. All things are ragdolling around and the creators have given you awesome tools of destruction. Blow up a tank to smash the enemies with the wooden planks flying around or hit them with a rolling barrel. Knock them over with cars or use mortars and machines guns to get rid of them. Everything follows the laws of physics very nicely. Except boxes won't break from bullets and enemies can see you through fabrics, which are not bullet proof. Never the less no one glitches through walls (except the hands at the doors, but that's okay)I would say it earns a 9 out of 10 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I strongly recommend you to mod this game and play on easy to make it a smooth ride through the story and not a frustrating experience. The mod isnt god mode but a very strong weapon. Link for the mod: http://www.gamewatcher.com/games/far-cry/downloads/last?key=y6eqaHcAgpk4_CVFstee0ze7vfGe9n1MucUAPEDmRiADMkxdER0pZZhyCUZ-%0ApLns%0Athe gamehas a nice story for its time a good twist and with the mod gameplay is very fun(without it it is too hard even on easy mode) AI is pretty bad tho. I think its not worth it's price but I'm on a budget and can't get anything too expensive so it might be ok for other people (I got it for 1.50$ on ubisofts publisher weekend along with child of light and far cry 3 blood dragon.) 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though this game is old and dated, it is an incredibly goodlooking game with very difficult gameplay and a massive variety of items, weapons, movement etc. The graphics are better than alot of games these days, and the world itself feels very realistic. It may have (VERY!) cheesy cut scenes and (HORRIBLY) bad voice acting, but this won't really affect anything really. After playing FC3, this game instantly amazed me! If your a massive fan of the Far Cry 3 or 2 and would love to see the beginning of the series, don't hold back on getting this. $10 for Far Cry is ridiculously cheap. It may not of aged as well as Half Life 2, but it's still an incredible experience to be part in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top Class entertainment and affordable especcially on sale.I played this game in my younger days when it came out, i bought it by chance at the time and im just after replaying it. Its a wonderfully made game,Brilliant far fetched story, hours on end of gameplay, its after taking me a week to complete, a large array of weaponry at your disposal and a wonderful setting, a beautiful remote tropical island in the pacific with golden beaches, dense jungles and high mountains. The whole island setting adds to the game and gives it a brilliant atmosphere. I actually didnt want the game to end when i was playing it,its that good.  For a 2004 game it was ahead of its day and puts some modern fps games to shame. Overall a huge seal of approval by me, some minor faults but all easily sorted, afterall it will be out 13 years in 2017 which is remarkable!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, Far Cry is among the first person shooters with best level designs I've ever played. Combat is really fun and satisfying, just make sure to not attempt a pure stealth run: the AI is really good at open firefights, but incredibly frustrating to deal with if you try to sneak your way past them.

												This game is - to this day - the hardest game I have ever played. I haven't even finished it! I got close to the end but died too many times and rage quit, forgetting to save in the process therefore losing quite a bit of progress. Regardless of my fit: I would recommend this game until the end of time as it is ACTUALLY challenging (unlinke many games these days) and it's enjoyable...unless your temper is as bad as mine.

PROS:+ fun & challenging gameplay+ cool vehicles+ choice of weapons and explosives+ no auto-heal (medkits only)+ vast enviroments of tropical islands+ enemy AI+ long gameplay time+ look and behaviour of the mutants+ no uPlayCONS:- nobody is playing multiplayer- couple of a bit linear indoor levels- INSANELY difficulty in some parts- voice acting is strange sometimes- ridiculously high number of HP of the mutantsComment:Got this game from a friend who switched to consoles and did not need PC games anymore. That was over 10 years ago and I am happy to say this game was great. Altohugh back then it was VERY graphically challenging for many PCs it was well optimized and so I could play it too. I quickly realized what a gem it is in how fluid the combat is....and how merciless the fights are. You see I played on Realistic, the hardest difficulty, because my brain was dumb and I thought realistic meant more simulation-like. Nope. It means the game is HARD up until the point the mutants appear ... then it is INSANELY difficult. But yet...somehow it was still fun for me. While taking out mercenaries is doable (a headshot kills everyone) the monster mutants needed a lot more bullet persuasion to go down. Except for the difficulty this game is great in vehicular combat - helicopters, boats, cars, trucks ... and you can even ride a rogalo! Graphics are nice, even today. The story is a bit bland but not bad, just simple - save girl, fight bad guys and then defeat monsters. Playtime here does not tell you how MANY MANY hours I spent trying to beat it on Realistic. But it does say something about how good it was when now, 10+ years later when my discs no longer work, I still went and bought it. If you can overlook (or enjoy) the difficulty and linearity of some parts then I can recommend this for you, it's loads of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun action game. The game is semi-linear with 20 levels, but there are often multiple paths and multiple viable strategies. The fps combat itself works well, and the game also has a decently realistic stealth system. The game autosaves pretty often at certain points so dying isn't annoying, which is good because you will die a lot (and sometimes for dumb reasons like an enemy somehow getting 5 headshots in a row). I'd recommend playing your first game on easy difficulty since the last few levels can be really hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately the steam version ships with the infamous 1.4 patch which breaks the A.I making them much harder than they originally was;  and this game is pretty hard compared to newer Far Cry games and this makes the game alot less fun and makes stealth nearly impossible, heck it makes certain sections of the game nearly impossible since the A.I can shoot at you with high accuracy at long distances, even through walls with high accuracy too. In order to play the game without the AI super soldiers, you need the unofficial patchs or somehow downgrade to patch 1.3Now, I remember playing this back in 2004 and thought it was originally a good game, because back then-  Far Cry WAS a good game, but the standards have risen considerably over the years and this game shows cleary how low gamers standards was back then. Far Cry suffers from a huge amount of general issues which makes the game generally much harder than it really needs to be, such as troop placement being so specific to catch the player out, each mission as such is more about remembering where enemy mercs are; rather than planning a strategic attack- think of MOH; Sniper Alley style gameplay here, its frustrating and needless.Then to add further insult to injury, you have to put up with Carver being a complete tool in the gun accuracy department, his accuracy with weapons is excruciating bad, whilst the mercs have near perfect accuracy, this is why there are liberally scattered health packs and armor around because its nearly impossible not to take hits.   The accuracy is poor, imagine an artifical spray and pray - the gun cursor is just a 'basic' indicator where the bullets will go, not nessarily where you are pointing.  The gun sights offer slightly better accuracy but still, not good enough considering the accuracy of the mercs and traps. Even with some much needed mods like FCam; the game is still a huge chore to play and saving after every encounter with mercs is essential- forget using stealth tactics...if you want working stealth, install Far Cry 2 and skip this.As for the difficulty, there is honestly very little difference between easy and realistic difficultly - thats how hard this game is; realistic mode is just mostly for masochists who enjoy dying alot, or  who have played the game so much they have remembered the exact layout of the merc placements.

												I have spent more time in this game than any in my Steam library, so I suppose I should recommend it lol.  I also played it before owning it on Steam.  I think I am in all honesty burned out with it though...it took freaking 13 years though.  And its visuals and effects are still very impressive.  It's AI is not bad either, especially for its time.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a beautiful, atmospheric, high adrenaline first person shooter.  It's also a challenge.  You'll get your *** handed to you in this game trust me.  This game is worth $10.00 even today in my opinion-especially since you'll want to revisit it regularly.  I haven't even messed with modding the game and I'm telling you: it's worth your money. ***Runs off to mod the game and jump back in yet again***Another note: It also works incredibly in VR with VorpX, futureproofing it further.

 Far Cry   Gameplay and StoryIn Far Cry, you take control of protagonist Jack Carver, a former US Army Special Forces officer who now drives paying customers out on his charter boat. As he drives his new customer, Val Cortez, out to a mysterious Archipelago, his ship is blown up by the islands occupants, and he finds himself stranded and looking for this strange ""Val""Far Cry is a first person action shooter, which is built off of CryEngine 1, so it has the basic gameplay template that comes with the engine. Far Cry is semi-open world, but there is always a main objective to follow, no side missions. There are multiple routes one can take to get to certain destinations as well.Click here to see all weapons used in-game[www.imfdb.org]Sadly, this game has no other features besides it's linear story mode and multiplayer, which is mostly dead.

												Far Cry is very clearly an old game. The AI is stupid and glitchy, the enemies can see you from a mile away and shoot you with pinpoint accuracy through walls, and the poor graphics and cheesy action lines will make you realize how far video games have come. That being said, I had so much fun playing through this game. From the enemies that yell ""are you alright?!"" as you headshot them to your character's nonchalant reaction to the suicide missions he's sent on, this game had me in stitches, and at some points, it's extremely difficult to get through the missions (whether you try and stealth your way through or go in guns blazing). 8.5/10 will play the next 2 and maybe even buy the 4th one when it comes out.

												Date of review: 07.10.2014Platform: PC Specifications: Released in back in 2004, Far Cry revolutionized the FPS genre with never before seen graphics and a huge ""open"" map which countless possibilities... no wonder many regarded it as the best FPS since Half Life. But that was a long time ago, can Far Cry still deliver after 10 years? Yes it can.Story:You are Jack Carver, a former US Special Forces soldier who now runs freelance boat charter services in the Pacific. You are employed by Valerie Constantine to take her to a mysterious island once occupied by the Japanese during the second world war, claiming to study its little-known ruins. Shortly after Valerie goes ashore your boat is attacked (and destroyed), and you barely manage to escape, finding yourself alone without any equipment on an island no one really knows about...Far Cry was never loved for having an extraordinary story, but the plot is solid enough and it doesn't lack twists and turns, keeping the player interested. It also mixes realism with sci-fi quite well and the transition from the realistic jungle warfare to the... well more sci-fi stuff is well paced.7/10 Visuals:While Far Cry can obviously not  keep up with today's graphics, maxed out I still wouldn't call it an ugly game. Sure, it's outdated, but it can still surprise you sometimes with the beautiful tropical setting. The vegetation and water still look good and the draw distance is surprisingly long making the game pleasant to play in the open environment. Interiors however do show heavy signs of aging. Good news is that you will be able to play on ultra settings without any problems on even low end machines nowadays.Once it might have been 10/10 today I will give it 6/10Gameplay:I was absolutely surprised on how much I enjoyed the gameplay of Far Cry, which blends some of the old school FPS elements like hitpoints and medpacks, armor, etc. with some of the more modern game elements like the huge open world, vehicles, stealth mechanics (especially useful in the jungle), etc. providing a multitude of ways to complete a given objective with a surprisingly competent AI. Also, while it is definitely an arcadeish shooter it will require a decent amount of planing and tactics because Far Cry is actually a hard game, especially towards the end. It might sound funny but Far Cry is a refreshing experience compared to most of today's shooters.10/10Sound:In terms of music and sound effects Far Cry is solid again. You won't remember the soundtrack for days, and the voice acting is sometimes poor, but the ambient sounds were quite good, further improving the immersion in the jungle fights.8/10Replay value:While the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would affect the outcome, the gameplay provides countless ways to approach and deal with your objective, making the game worth several play troughs.8/10Conclusion:Far Cry might have once stood out primarily because of its visuals, but today is worth playing because of its challenging and fun gameplay. I do consider it one of the ""must play"" shooters out there and I definitely recommend it.8/10Test system specifications: AMD FX-8350 (OC @ 4.6 GHz); 8 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1866 MHz; AMD Radeon R9 280X (AMD Catalyst 14.4), Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate.

												2004 was a great year in PC gaming, and while many regard Half-Life 2 as the brightest star of that great year, I'd still rank Far Cry on top of that. The game was a masterpiece in engine technology, and features some of the most interesting level design in FPS gaming. The weapons and the feeling of power they transfer to the hands of the gamer is of such a caliber (pun intended) that still hasn't been toppled by any game since. The Desert Eagle and M4 in Far Cry are quite simply the most enjoyable weapons in gaming.The game doesn't come without flaws though. The game suffers from the 'Crytek disease', namely, that a large part of the game is considerably worse after the introduction of superhuman enemies. In Crysis, it was the blue alien scum, which singlehandedly reduced the game to a bullet-spamming festival of bright lights, taking away all the interesting gameplay features. In Far Cry, it is the trigens. That being said, I'd rather battle trigens over aliens any day, but shooting loud-mouthed mercs is still way more fun.If you are interested in playing this masterpiece, by all means, play it with the FCAM 1.99 mod. It improves graphics, add more features and fixes bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is, ahrd but fun. It isnt too open world, as you'll go through a storyline and encounter quite a few loading screens. But on the long run great. Find weapons and figure out ways to surprise people, anybody can run it, its 2004-2005 so the graphics arent to heavy, and are pretty good for that year to be honest. The interface is rather simple, and you can only save at checkpoints, not as Far Cry 2 or 3 where you can save where you want so it really does add a make sure you dont die feel to it. Its fast moving and you've got to have your wits about ya.85/100 This is a well fleshed out game, but remember my score is opinion based so if you're not a huge fan of linear ish maps or being stealthy, then you may want to get this game when its on sale.

												How long has it been since I last played a game where you don't need to regenerate your life instead you have to look for medical supply? This is the best part of the game. Die a lot yet you get all tensed up so you wont screw and kill your enemies before they blow your head. One of the best. I do and I'm still enjoying the game :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a big FPS fan but I really enjoyed this game. Got it cheap and had many hours of fun. I would the describe the levels as sandbox-corridors. The levels overall were fairly linear, but most levels had breathing room and were wide open for experimentation with the ways you could approach combat. There are plenty of opportunities for vehicle/boat-based combat, but I found navigating the vehicles too cumbersome to really enjoy driving and shooting at the same time (especially the land vehicles). Played on Medium difficulty and it was definitively challenging. The game sometimes seems to steer you towards a stealth-based approach, but I didn't see any real mechanics to actually support stealth. Enemies could spot you really easily in thick brush or when you're far away, hear you even when you're approaching in crouch. and were ridiculously accurate when firing. Plus, you only carry a machete if you sacrifice a weapon spot. There really should've been a dedicated knife button or slot. So usually I would tag as many combatants as I could from afar with the binoculars, pick off the closest enemies or the most dangerous ones with available sniper ammo, rockets and grenades, and then charge in to mop up with the shotgun or machine guns. The game does a great job of slyly adding better weapons as the levels progress, so you never get too bored if you're paying attention and trying new guns. Used the TILDE key constantly to save the game via console. The auto-save spots were too infrequent.I enjoyed the enemy variety. You start off fighting vanilla mercenaries, and the game introduces different enemies and varieties throughout. Fun addition to game was that one group of enemies was constantly fighting another, and they'd only pause battle so both could attack you. Levels that included three-way combat were great. The story and characters are goofy fun. The way the game's plot reveals itself slowly over the 20-ish levels was well done, and maybe I'm dense but there was a twist near the end I didn't see coming. I was pleasantly surprised. The voice acting was hit and miss, but I thought the voice actor for Doyle the scientist did a great job, which is vital since he essentially narrates the game.Played 30+ hours, experienced zero crashes or noticeable bugs. Very stable game. Graphics were great for a game this old, and I really enjoyed the overall look of the island/sea setting. Crytek's specialty is advanced graphics and its reputation is well earned here.Give this game a chance if you haven't already, it's great fun. It's also a lengthy game so it's a great value proposition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite game that is out there, the game is great even though it's fairly old. The game takes place in various different places and mixes up the combat with different enemies. You can either sneak your way trough, or go in run and gun. The game is linear...yes, but you have different ways to get to your objective, which is pretty awesome.The enemy will work with each other to hunt you down, making the game a challenge.

												I played this game way back when it first came out. My Dad bought it for himself and I played it after him. I absolutely love the game. Although I haven't played Far Cry 2, the rest of them that came after this one are boring. Sorry to anyone who thinks otherwise, but the original is, by far, the best in the series. The graphics are older compared to what can be done today, but even so, it beats the hell out of Call of Duty games. The enemies are funny when you listen into their conversations, there is realism in that you can only carry a few guns, you are forced to think tactically to overcome both obsticals and enemies, and the level design is superb. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an FPS jungle survival with a sprinkling of mystery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Far Cry"" is arguably the toughest FPS I've ever played.Even on a completely subjective terms, I'm openly admitting that my review here is far from being a valid measure stick for how the game truly feels in the hands of an average FPS gamer as the RPG genre is what I usually prefer the most. That being said, my favorite shooting games until now were still those so-called ""old schools"" like ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"", ""Soldier of Fortune"" and ""Vietcong"".Nonetheless, ""Far Cry"" is the game that doesn't allow you to simply run through your enemies and shoot them down mindlessly, but rather requires application of some real-life tactics and forces you to play like you truly are there on the islands as even a minor mistake could cost you most of your health bar. Enemies are tough, extremely intelligent and highly perceptive (especially on higher levels) to the point where you would almost consider it a bug - let's just say they can spot you from afar through dense undergrowth and even through tents... not to mention shoot you from miles away with like 90% precision. On the other hand, you're unable to tell where they are shooting at you from most of the times. However, that's not what makes this game hard in my opinion.Lack of manual ""Save game"" option is.It's quite frustrating to stealth around and take your enemies one by one for like half an hour... only to get shoot by some fodder your radar failed to spot (or even worse - your radar did spot him, but you were still unable to tell his exact location due to vegetation or whatnot). Briefly, distances between checkpoints on some levels seem painfully long.Despite that, this game can be passed without a single cheat, indeed. In order to do that, rely heavily on binoculars and cry vision goggles the whole time and you'll be fine. Oh, and make sure you don't miss to pick weapons like G36 or OICW because it's next to impossible to pass a couple of the last levels without them.Overall, story of this game seems pretty generic and predictable (with main character not being so particularly interesting); I'm giving it a solid 8/10.

												This game was like a beginning of a legacy. Its graphics win by miles to any game from the same year (2004) and 2005 too and more. This game is a ""must play"" (just like F.E.A.R.). It has its flaws, like the AI spotting you (and shooting you) through walls and being silly sometimes, but it's AI, right? And this game is hard. Even on the easiest difficulty this game is a challenge. But its mechanics are good, so you will enjoy it.My final veredict: if you can, like me, buy this on steam sales, go for it.

												Although this is an old game I have just purchased it. Iam enjoying the gameplay - you can choose how to approach each situation either run and gun or be a little more stealthy. Can be quite difficult in parts - the only thing I found frustrating was being unable to save after a particularly difficult battle only to be killed by a sniper and then having to start the battle again. Found myself turning the game off when this happened too many times and taking a break before attempting it again. Otherwise still playing and enjoying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can definitely see where a lot of Crysis's mechanics came from, as FarCry is moderately close to Crysis without a nanosuit. That makes this a really, really good game, in terms of enjoyment. Story is okay and voice acting is shoddy at best, but gameplay is great.The only thing that gets me is that the game doesn't work for me after a certain level, I haven't found a fix, and no one else has had the same problem, it seems. Still, those first few levels are worth it. Besides, I can probably finish it later on a new computer. This one is melting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awful voice acting, terrible graphics, still one of the better FPS games I have played. The game feels more of a giant maze where there are new types of baddies thrown at you at every corner, where as most FPS games I have played are very linear and its usually the same old bad guys. The game requires you to be thorough, but not that crazy where you are backtracking for five minutes. For it's time, it is pretty well put together. Being made in 2004, you might think oh the graphics aren't that great, but really when you think about it, this was in PS2/XBox/Gamecube era so graphics weren't that great for any game in this time. You can run in and gun or take the EXTREMELY SLOW approach and silently do in the goons, for the first half of the game. After the first half, the silent aproach is not imposible, but more of an incovenience when you have an arsenal of weapons to your disposal. Might I add that this game is longer than all of the other FPS games I have played and also TOUGH. It took me 15.7 hours (according to steam) to play through this game ONCE on normal difficulty. Pretty long for a FPS game, probably due to the fact that in 2004, developers were more focused on the main story of the game rather than the multiplayer aspect like the two titans, Call of Duty and Battlefield. If the game added up the total deaths i had, it would seem almost embaressing. Oh, and the dreaded 4x4 part. If you have played this game, you know what im talking about. F--- that part. If you havent played this game,  you can switch to the rocket launcher. Check the control options, that is all im telling you. People are saying the game is bugged, it is true, mildly. the guards can shoot through the tents accurately. You dont come by the tents very often but the bug driives people away because it is so close to the beginning of the game. Gameplay, I give this a solid 9/10. Replay value I give it a 6.5/10. This is due to the fact that the only other time you will probably want to pick this game up again is when you are feeling notalgic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!!! SPOILERS !!!Awesome game, especially the stealth aspect is very fun to play. The AI. is very glitchy at times, unfortunately, but other than that, the gameplay is good.One of the disadvantages the game has is the Checkpoint save system, which unnecessarily increases the difficulty by a huge amount at some points As you progress through the game you follow a (very open, yet) linear path to various objectives that are pointed out on the map. At various keypoints, for example behind a base, a yards down the road, or at a roadblock the enemy put up. These are usually few and far between, *especially* in later levels of the game. As you activate the checkpoint by walking into it, instead of completing an objective (like killing the soldiers guarding the base (roadblock), it can happen that you accidentally save while on very low health. With a normal Save/Load system you would just reload an earlier checkpoint and try again to complete the section at higher health/armor, but this waqy you have to completely scavenge the base and all the surroundings for ammo and health/armor to at least have a chance at progressing through the game, as you WILL die very quickly, depending on your difficulty.Apart from the save system, another flaw of the game is the steep difficulty curve. At one point in the game you will encounter so-called Trigens, mutated apes that will jump at you and can usually kill you in just under a few hits.These can make it extremely hard to survive against other human enemies, just because they reduce you to such low health.Another frustrating enemy appears much further in the plot: Giant mutants. With rocket launchers. That detect you from like 200m away. Afggdfgfdgdgsg.These are so frustrating to kill, as they usually take like a million hits to kill, draining your ammo count (one time, I had to resort to grenades, as all my guns were completely out of ammo!)Overall, the levels are well designed, though, and the rest of the gameplay makes up for those annoying details.If I had to rate the game, I would give it an 8/10. 9/10 if the Save system was improved out of the box, that means more checkpoints and better placement of them, or a Quicksave/Quickload system, like in many other games.

The AI. is very glitchy at times, unfortunately, but other than that, the gameplay is good.One of the disadvantages the game has is the Checkpoint save system, which unnecessarily increases the difficulty by a huge amount at some points As you progress through the game you follow a (very open, yet) linear path to various objectives that are pointed out on the map. At various keypoints, for example behind a base, a yards down the road, or at a roadblock the enemy put up. These are usually few and far between, *especially* in later levels of the game. As you activate the checkpoint by walking into it, instead of completing an objective (like killing the soldiers guarding the base (roadblock), it can happen that you accidentally save while on very low health. With a normal Save/Load system you would just reload an earlier checkpoint and try again to complete the section at higher health/armor, but this waqy you have to completely scavenge the base and all the surroundings for ammo and health/armor to at least have a chance at progressing through the game, as you WILL die very quickly, depending on your difficulty.Apart from the save system, another flaw of the game is the steep difficulty curve. At one point in the game you will encounter so-called Trigens, mutated apes that will jump at you and can usually kill you in just under a few hits.These can make it extremely hard to survive against other human enemies, just because they reduce you to such low health.Another frustrating enemy appears much further in the plot: Giant mutants. With rocket launchers. That detect you from like 200m away. Afggdfgfdgdgsg.These are so frustrating to kill, as they usually take like a million hits to kill, draining your ammo count (one time, I had to resort to grenades, as all my guns were completely out of ammo!)Overall, the levels are well designed, though, and the rest of the gameplay makes up for those annoying details.If I had to rate the game, I would give it an 8/10. 9/10 if the Save system was improved out of the box, that means more checkpoints and better placement of them, or a Quicksave/Quickload system, like in many other games.

												Far Cry was one of this games which I remember playing as a child. So I bought it on Steam and don´t regret it.Short:+Good gunplay, weapons feel strong.+Tactic matters in taking out enemys.+Good mix between linear and open world sections.+Thinking outside the box will reward you.+It´s looking pretty good for a 2004 game.+/- ITS HARD AS♥♥♥♥♥♥+/- Story is not really deep, but still cheesy enough to entertain me.-AI sometimes goes full Cyborg-mode and see you through vegetation and geometry.-Render distance is pretty low, AI will often attack you outside your watchable space. Using scopes is the only solution.-At some points, enemy placement is simply unfair.-I got stuck in geometries a couple of times, seems like just bad collider.Long:Far Cry is one of the last true ""old-school"" games which means it is designed to be hard. If you want an easy shooter to kill some time, this is the wrong game for sure. To say it lightly you WILL die, a lot. For starters I recommend to play your first run on ""easy"", even for hardcore shooter-fans. Because every difficulty setting has an invisible +1 on it, what I mean is: easy is normal, normal is hard, hard is super hard etc. You get the point.That said the game feels very good, the gunplay is strong, the AI is somewhat intelligent and tries to actively get you with a variety of tactics. Also the graphics are okay (especially for a 2004 game) and exploring feels rewarding. Hidden armorys, shortcuts and pathways are waiting in nearly every level for attentive players to be found.On the other hand Far Cry suffers from two major flaws: The first is the fact that the render distance is very low, so what happens is that enemys WILL attack you outside your see-able area. You have to get closer or use scoped weapons to even see them. That said the enemys are unbelievable strong, especially when they somewhat go full ARMA 2 cyborg-mode and see you through obstacles and hit you with every shot at insanely distances.The second flaw are bad colliders. I got stuck several times in different levels and sections, which got me killed and that’s frustrating.Well every other aspect is not worth mentioning, the music is okay, story is not great but cheesy which makes it okay.So I would say:Gameplay:        5*Graphic:            4*Music&Sound:  3*Story:                3*Overall 8/10 Points, I had fun and that is a good sign.

На РусскомРекомендую ли я эту игру? Конечно да!Это один из сложнейших FPS шутеров, в который я играл.Это первая игра на CryEngine.Но, что я хочу получить, когда покупаю игру в Steam?Я хочу получить рабочий продукт. Скачал и играй, а не сиди битый час на форуме впустую.Да игра, будучи заявленной под WinXP, уже три раза устарела.Короче, покупать её в Steam нет особого смысла.А у меня есть лицензионный диск от Буки. Накачу на домашний комп WinXP и зарубаю.На АнгельскомDo I recommend this game? Of course yes!It's one of the hardest FPS-shooter I've ever played!It's a first game on CryEngine.But what do I want to get after buying a game on Steam?I do want to get a working product. Download&Play, not useless surfing the Internet searching solutions to make it work.Yes, of course, this game being declared for WinXP, became outdated three times already.Well, there is no sense in buying it on Steam.

It's hard to explain why this FPS game is so attractive, but it has its own charm with no doubt. Splendid graphics even for now, gameplay with non-stop action wich cheks your surviving skills for every second.In my opinin, Far Cry can give a battle to such giants as Doom, Quake and Half-Life because it's worth it every damn moment.

												The graphics still hold surprisingly well, and I am still amazed at how immersive the island setting can be.  Despite beign set in a tropical island similar to Crysis and Far Cry 2, Far Cry manages to create its own mood.  Even if sometimes bordering on action movie, there is still an unnerving sense surrounding the whole experience.  You are both the prey and predator, picking enemies one by one or when caught, running for your life and likely having to restart your checkpoint due to the game's relentless and super accurate AI.

												One of the best looking games ever made. Sound effects are amazing as well, dialogue is cheesy but fits the theme of the game. Plenty of enemy variety, although some are overpowered with being able to move too fast and having impossibly precise aim. Stealth is encouraged with plenty of ways to hide and be silent when killing. Going in gung ho usually does not work due to the overwhelming number of enemies that can be in the area. Long campaign, although it does get repetitive after a while and rewards you with a sudden and anticlimatic ending. Boss fights are challenging but not profoundly epic. Vehicles are fun to use and control fairly well. It can be a pain having to trouble long distances without a vehicle, which may happen from time to time. Use the console for saving because the checkpoints are way too far apart. The franchise has come a long way but if you're interested in its roots like I was it is a fun adventure through the jungle. 8.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Truly a classic.  Graphics are respectable, especially considering this came out in 2004.  I'm sure this game was melting rigs back then.Story isn't half bad.  Dialogue is cheesy though.Good variety of weapons and a great soundtrack.But...The difficulty.  I've never died so much.  The lack of a save besides autosave adds to the difficulty, and this game is truly difficult.  On realistic, I would almost advise taking blood pressure medication since it literally is die, repeat, die, repeat, die, repeat (you're like tom cruise in edge of tomorrow). There was maybe like two sections between autosaves where I did not die multiple times throughout the entire game.  AI not only has x-ray vision, but can headshot you from 200m away with a pistol through walls/tents/bunkers.  Driving vehicles will also give you cancer.Despite all that though, it's still quite enjoyable.  It's a real challenge unlike many current games which feel dumbed down.Highly recommended.

												I've played this game many years ago. I picked it up on Steam during a sale for less than £2. This is Crytek's first game and when it was released it was revolutionary. I'm playing it now 11 years later and I'm having so much fun. I played through almost half the game in one go. The series has come a long way since the first installment, but if you'd like to see how it all started you should give it a go. You'll have a blast.*EditIt has its issues as well. For example in one level there's a guy in a helicopter that's landed where you need to go. He's shooting you with a minigun and you can't kill him even if you spend all your ammo in his head. You just have to go around him :/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry, a game made by Crytek in 2004. It is a first person shooter that has created a lot of spinoffs and sequel. But how does the original fair. THIS GAME IS FREAKIN HARD. I've played hard games before but this game will make you rage in some occasions. It has inconsistent difficulty (I played the game on easy and struggled throughout), VERY smart enemy AI,(they can see you through walls and hear your when you are 5 metres away), enemy's aim is EXTRAODINARY (When there is a beach separating me from the enemy, they can hit me with every SINGLE SHOT and the voice acting is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ Besides that, the game is good. It has an alright story, very well desgined levels, interesting technology AND TRIGENS WHICH are 10 times harder than normal enemies (especially human ones).Gameplay: 6/10Story: 7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't one of those ""Run and Gun"" shooters. This game is all about edge of your seat, be ready to fight, and think about what you are doing type games. I played this game on normal and the challenge is quite hard. You can be stealthy or confront hordes of baddies to blast. I figured out very quickly to stand still and listen to things around me which became a huge advantage. Another advantage is your binoculors, not only can you see people in the distance, they also track who ever you see on your radar. This is a great game, I bought this in the far-cry bundle and just cannot wait to play the next ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game still looks beautifull!Even though this game is over 10 years old, it still looks beautiful. The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim. The variation in weapons is not great, but it is good enough (should have been more weapons with silencer).All in all this is a alright game and I think it deserves a score of 6,5/10. This is a good buy, if you can get it for a discounted price, or in a bundle.Weapon of choice: Mouse and keyboardDifficulty: ChallengingResolution: 1920x1080Graphics: All max			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics still hold surprisingly well, and I am still amazed at how immersive the island setting can be.  Despite beign set in a tropical island similar to Crysis and Far Cry 2, Far Cry manages to create its own mood.  Even if sometimes bordering on action movie, there is still an unnerving sense surrounding the whole experience.  You are both the prey and predator, picking enemies one by one or when caught, running for your life and likely having to restart your checkpoint due to the game's relentless and super accurate AI.

												Far Cry, a game made by Crytek in 2004. It is a first person shooter that has created a lot of spinoffs and sequel. But how does the original fair. THIS GAME IS FREAKIN HARD. I've played hard games before but this game will make you rage in some occasions. It has inconsistent difficulty (I played the game on easy and struggled throughout), VERY smart enemy AI,(they can see you through walls and hear your when you are 5 metres away), enemy's aim is EXTRAODINARY (When there is a beach separating me from the enemy, they can hit me with every SINGLE SHOT and the voice acting is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ Besides that, the game is good. It has an alright story, very well desgined levels, interesting technology AND TRIGENS WHICH are 10 times harder than normal enemies (especially human ones).Gameplay: 6/10Story: 7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't one of those ""Run and Gun"" shooters. This game is all about edge of your seat, be ready to fight, and think about what you are doing type games. I played this game on normal and the challenge is quite hard. You can be stealthy or confront hordes of baddies to blast. I figured out very quickly to stand still and listen to things around me which became a huge advantage. Another advantage is your binoculors, not only can you see people in the distance, they also track who ever you see on your radar. This is a great game, I bought this in the far-cry bundle and just cannot wait to play the next ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game left an important legacy, I'll give it that. It was one of the better-in-class during its day, but ultimately it hasn't stood the test of time. It's not a bad game, but it's not great either. I understand the ""cult"" following - it was and still is a beautiful game in its own right, the levels are quite large and sprawling, it's got tons of content, and it has a 90s pulp craziness about it.Honestly though, it's just not a well designed game. The movement is too sluggish for the level sizes, vehicles handle fairly bad, the ai are really stupid but equipped with incredible vision and aim, and it's unjustifiably difficult at times. I started to wonder why it was such a mess until I realized it was Crytek's first game. Ubisoft Montreal has improved the series dramatically, lack of innovation in the present titles aside. If you're coming from Far Cry 3-4 or even Far Cry 2, this game is completely different aside from some general level design motifs.Don't get me wrong, It's absolutely worth the current 10 dollar asking price and it can be quite a lot of fun, but do yourself a favor (if you haven't already played this) and dont treat it as a game to be played through to completion. It's not worth your time and energy. Just treat it as a fun FPS sandbox to play around in. Once the mutants show up it all goes down hill pretty fast (actually somewhat slowly since god damn, this game seems long). There are some mods to check out too, so if the free form open-ish world gameplay wasn't enough, theres that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a fan of retro games, I grabbed this game on sale since friends said it was a good game. That nails it: it WAS a good game back in the days. But first off, the good things: This game was simple, dumb fun most of the times. Let me tell you why. Most importantly, shooting in this game is really fun since you get a nice load of guns, binoculars and a working stealth system. Pretty well done for a game of this age. There's some vehicles you can drive which is kinda fun, too. Your enemies aren't entirely stupid either and there's a whole lot of different enemy types, adding enough variety to keep you entertained.The story is ridiculously dumb and cliché (yeah, this is a good thing IMO). The typical random guy who turns out to be a born killing machine and badass (you), the ""hot"" sidekick babe (unfortunately not as hot as the developers think she is) and of course, the ultimate antagonist: The German, crazy, narcissistic and ubermensch-creating Doctor Krieger. The plot is so dumb it's actually funny, so I guess it's alright as it is. Whoever buys this game can't possibly be expecting a deep story anyway, right?Now to the bad things. This game is old, and that means its mechanics are not too well balanced and can FRUSTRATING. So if you are not the patient type, just forget this game. I'll give you some reasons as to why it gets so frustrating sometimes. First off, it doesn't have a health regenerating mechanic like most new shooters have. That means, you often get stuck with low health in very hard situations, making those even harder. You need armor pickups and health packs and both kinds are not being distributed in a regular order. Sometimes, you literally swim in pickups, sometimes, you don't get even a single one for what feels like five minutes of trying to survive literal rocket rains.Oh, yeah. Second: ROCKETS. This is a game mechanic extremely frustrating since you cannot dodge them in certain situations and NPC's are too dumb to realize when the rocket is going to harm THEM as well so they just stay trigger happy even in meelee range. Also, there's a lot of enemy types using rockets, so it happens a lot.Third: Enemies act pretty normal in close to medium range. At long range, they become ♥♥♥♥ING EAGLE EYED MLG SNIPERS. Okay, maybe not this bad, but still, enemies spot you from veeery far away and start shooting, resulting in you losing health to an enemy you cant even see with your bare eyes. Especially annoying if these enemies happen to have friggin' rockets with them.Fourth: Game design. While this game has decent design (meaning having you knowing what to do, where to go and not being unfair) at most points, SOMETIMES IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN'T. While that is pretty common for old games, that doesn't really make it better. So be ready to face fights you will have to do at least ten times to figure out which kind of game mechanic or AI flaws you might abuse to actually win them (that's what I meant by patience).If all that still doesn't bother you too much and you're okay with older graphics, wait for a sale and pick it up. It's a nice little shooter when you're bored and also the first Far Cry game, paving the way for the Crysis series and the newer Far Cry games. It's interesting to see how incredibly similiar the gameplay of Far Cry 1 was to its successors. Still, this is a very old game suffering from typical design flaws. Remember to be patient with it.Thanks for reading and enjoy the game if you buy it. ;)   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic FPS shooter game in every traditional sense of the word.Nothing really complicated in the way of having to use any special powersand abilities.No nanosuit like in Crysis to go invisible and increase your strength.No teammates to help you out when going gets tough.It's just you and your ability to outshoot and outrun your opponents.Or try to sneak past them.Excellent graphics for it's time but obviously outdated now.Also what makes this game really worth having is the many custom modsand maps that are available to download for it.If you like the older action games like SOF,Delta Force series etc. thenthis game should be on your wanted list.In addition to human enemies there is an extra challenge in the form ofmonsters created as a result of a mad scientists genetic experiments.And these creatures are tougher than the mercenaries.So beware and have fun shooting your enemies and getting killed inreturn.Make sure your character obtains a good life insurance policy becausechances are his lifespan will be short which may be either bad or blessingfor his beneficiaries.

												Although the sequels to this game usually include elements of sandbox, RPG, and open world, the first game in the series deviates largely from its sequels. It has more a focus on level design and campaign than the others. It has has elements of sci-fi and corny golden-age FPS. What I'm trying to say is, don't buy this game expecting it to be ANYTHING like Far Cry 2, 3 or 4!In its own right it is a good game. It establishes a unique form of gameplay that many of its sequels use, and other games have expanded upon. It isn't ""bang-bang"" and hide behind a rock sort of strategy, the fighting in this game will require you to think, plan, and execute with extreme efficiency. If you don't play by the game with strategy, you will find yourself dying countless times. Trust me, I played the game on easy, and I still haven't got past the last level!Although this is a great game, it hasn't aged so well. The textures aren't so great, and the character models are dated. However, the beautiful enviroments of the island have aged quite nicely. If you come to this game looking for deep, meaningful, Bioshock-like dialogue; you're going to be disappointed. This game never takes itself seriously for a second and that includes dialogue. Jack is your typical all-american hero, Val is your typical matter-of-fact reporter, and the mercs you fight are just as corny, saying lines such as ""I've got your number!"" or, ""I'm gonna open a can of whip♥♥♥♥♥on you!""I find that this is kind of like a good predator video game, great action, over-the-top voice acting and dialogue, and the best gameplay you'll get. This game is great, too bad it hasn't aged well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the most difficult FPS I've ever played. But it's also probably one of the better FPS games I've experienced because it never really felt repetitive to me, unlike other games of the same genre. You need to adopt a methodical apporach, be wary of your surroundings, and be a crack shot in order to progress through each level. You can't just dive in and spray like scarface every single time. That's not gonna cut it in this one. I'd recommend buying on discount due to some bugs and (from what I heard) multiplayer being dead. But if you're an avid FPS player, this is a goodie to have with 20 levels,12-15 hours of gameplay, and the open world. Oh,and whoever designed the last level in this game is a sadist.

												Trully, this game takes the FPS genre, and makes it so you have to use your brain while playing it. It took me almost a year to beat it because it was so hard.  I kept taking breaks because the game created so much stress but for a shooter in 2004, its not that bad.  If you get mad about video games easily DON'T play this Far Cry.  Its a classic shooter campaign, its not like the Far Cry's we know and love, but its part of the franchise, and its not all bad.  Bottom line its worth playing for patience skills(It will jam those skills into you), and the story is still good.  So if you like a challenging game play Far Cry Classic.  I got it for $2.50 during the steam christmas sale 2014.  If you dont like hard games, save your sanity and dont even bother.  Thank you for your time.-A Far Cry Fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its some time since this game was released and it still have amazing graphics, of course some thinks could be better, but that doesnt matter, cause this is one of best FPS games of 2004, with good sci-fi story, lot of enemies including mutants, huge amount of deadly weapons, great A.I., which is even today one of the best			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike any of the other Far Cry games, but definitely worth playing. Graphics are a joke (it's an old game, what do you expect?), difficulty is insane, but gunplay is so satisfying. And the difficulty is high enough to make you feel quite accomplished each time you progress a level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've come into this game knowing its flaws (for example the glitched sneaking) and I feel like everyone should because from what little I've played if you get over those it's a damn good game. Nice but very hard gameplay (plus the hilariously bad voice acting that will make you die every time someone speaks)Btw running this on windows 10 no problems so far			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was great. My dad said it was DOOM 47. Besides glitches like people shooting through the tents and through cement walls when i can't even see them, and a turret section. The glitches were great like walking dead AI and the bomb flying through the elevator. Action packed all the way through, you should try it out if you haven't played it already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had not ever played far cry 1, and taking the year released into consideration this is a game well worth the 10 bucks. You can see where they made improvements as the series went on but the maps are pretty large. Still feels like its open world fsp almost. The aiming is a bit awkward, some AI detect you pretty easy but some of the AI should get some credit the meter did not rise until they actually saw me. Some must of used the force to detect my movements. For map size I would argue it rivals the later Far crys and fallouts though it is very empty/repetitive map and they did add a lot more later on. The story thus far is kinda cheesy. The graphics on max look comparable to late ps2 early ps3 graphics id say. I've heard there are enhacements which I am just using the stock version so with those who knows what kind of graphics you could get. So yeah of course nothing is going to make you go wow but the game doesn't quite feel 11 years old. One interesting note I'd like to make the game comes with an option to add mods on and switch between the modded version and original version on the main menu which in my opinion is awesome. Of course you have to find the mods yourself but still.If you haven't played the game and like open world fps games then this is a good idea to play!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent enough game, although the authors made it insanely difficult.  I've read elsewhere that they did this on purpose to make it more realistic, but in my opinion it made teh game less enjoyable.  I had to configure GOD mode to actually get more enjoyment and less frustration out of this one...  Aside from that, very decent game play, the story line isn't horrible, and the action is still very intense.Good job on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's like Crysis but not as good because crysis emerses you into the storyline. I guess for 2004 this game isn't bad but the game is pretty hard. Go to an enemy base kill everyone drive off.

												A short story  about this game. before i do the review. First thing i remeber was i watched my friends brother play this game back in elmentary school , when i was around 9 or 10 and so i might have played some very few minutes back then but i can`t remember. I remeber I bought this july 2009 along with cod 2 somewhere in Germany in a super market. I finished cod 2 i was probably one of few in my classes that played the orignal cod games and didnt start and jump on the bandwagon on either mw 1 or for the most part in my class mw 2. However i bought far cry 1 and got to the last part of the game and never managed to do it if i recall correctly , before i had to unistall it. So i decided to take with me my far cry cd to my small house for the holiday and try and play it again. Ofc my cd didnt work, but i had  luck that it was 75% of steam so to re buy it digital instead of using my old vista computer and burn my far cry cd to another cd , as i couldnt until i get home anyway , i decided why the hell i can now have this digitally. So now we are around 7 years later and i finally managed to completed this. So how does it hold up compared to then.  Well i recalled alot of the locations from when i played particaly the last location and some of the locations mid way trough the game eiter way:Good:- Gameplay, u can stealth some parts if you want to, you can plan your approach most of the times, and most of the levels has multiple solutions or multiple routes to take.- Good soundtrack- Great level desing- Great gunplay. - Its hard even on normalDecent : - Voice acting- Story , it would be on bad if this was anything but an fps , but you dont exept a fps do have good story and the story is actully pretty decentBad- Enemy line of sight can sometimes be bit weird but usually works just fine.Beside that not muchRating 9/10  One of my favorite fps along with cod 2, mw 1, medal of honor frontline, half life 1 and even far cry 2 ( yeah i  know i am one of the few who really liked it)   ( Deus ex if that counts to)Probably had more fun with this then far cry 3 too.Total play time if you excl my steam version i guess  around 25 hrs. I was far worse on fps 7 years ago then i am now. I rarely play fps these days but this one is recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this game is a bit old, if you adjust the video settings, you can get it looking pretty sharp. It's a bit like being in a dumb 1980's action movie. The characters are flat and the storyline if chock full of cliches. But that's the whole point. The sexism in this game is so off-the-wall that it goes beyond cringeworthy and into the realm of insightful. It feels like a glimpse into the writer's soul. Who hurt you, man?This is one of the most difficult shooters I've ever played. While you can reach most checkpoints by being careful and patient, it's still a bit much. The checkpoints are so far apart. Sometimes you have to beat impossible odds and you die just before reaching the checkpoint. About 2/3 through this game, I looked up a cheat that lets you save/load anywhere. That helped a bit but it was still incredibly difficult. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its been a long time since I played an FPS game, so I thought why not give FarCry a try. I've never played a FarCry before , nor seen any playthroughs of it. So I went at this one blind and simply said it exceeded  my expectations. This is not a game that you raise your gun and run through without taking your share of fire. On the contrary you take fire and suffer multiple deaths througout the game. FarCry forces you to use tactics to survive.The AI can be brutal at times utilizing actual tactics to hunt you down and kill you. It is a common ocurocurrence to get cut down by a sniper , walk into an ambush , or get caught up in crossfire. Often times the mercs will distract you with a 3 man squad while the fourth member is creeping silently to flank and destroy you.You must use stealth , cover, and keep your *** down in the bush or you will certainly wind up dead. Throughout the game I would crawl  through the jungle to avoid contact as long as I could. Recon is a must in FarCry , if you go into an enemy camp unprepared you are dead. Even the best trained soldier dies if he is unprepared , so remember to recon and  take the best weapon synergies possible into the fight. You must learn to adapt as the batlle will shift from jungle to corridor frequently. FarCry forced me into a very slow methodical pace , and as such may not be for everyone. I really enjoyed playing FarCry and it renewed my interest in FPS games again. If you are the kind of gamer who enjoys a real challenge then I would highly recomend that you give FarCry a play. FarCry is filled with many interesting twists and as a result I never really knew when it was going to end. As I've said before ""If you are not very careful you will die alot."" Try not to get frustrated FarCry was intended to be difficult. If you should survive until the endgame hopefully you will have found FarCry a rewarding experience. I highly recommend FarCry to people who appreciate a challenge in an FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2004 was probably a great year for video games (Half Life 2, Halo 2, Fable , etc). Far Cry is one of those. This is the game that not only introduced the Cry Engine (famous for powering Crysis 2-3) but a start of one of the coolest FPS franchises in history. Far Cry is set in a mysterious set of islands in Micronesia (the Pacific). You play as Jack Carver, a former soldier that gets sent in to sabotage a research facility that is experimenting with mutated soldiers and animals by some evil scientist guy namd Krieger. The island levels are beautifully crafted. You can also swim, ride vehicles such as trucks and boats and collect new weapons. There's a pretty good variety in the game's arsenal.  The story for Far Cry however is basic and simple so don't expect anything special.But if you've played Far Cry 2-4 and want to try the game that started it all, you might be disappointed to find out that FC1 is actually linear, not open world. However, several levels feel wide enough to give you the illusion that you're exploring. The game is also increasingly difficult. I managed to finish this on medium difficulty for the first time but the last levels were so hard, I actually had to use godmode for cheats. There was just no way I was gonna finish it without that. And I already went through really hard levels without cheating in the first place. But despite that, I do recommend this. It's a great game but in retrospect, I am not sure if FC1 did anything considered revolutionary at the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far cry is an open world FPS, the game is 11 years old, but it still holds up, but its not all fine and dandy.You play as Jack Carver, a former special forces soldier who is hired by a woman named Val, investigating a strange island, all the sudden the boat is attacked and Jack is beign hunted down by mercs. i wont give to much spoilers because at the end of the game there is a HUGE plot twist. First lets talk GRAPHICS. For 2004, this game looks great, the water is the most impresive part of the game, yep the water. (I Think Half-Life 2 Looks Better) Gameplay is standard FPS shizz, you shoot things. the weapons are generic but some are kewl. the starting weapon is a deagle, and the first rifle you get is the generic M4 carbine, soon you get a sniper rifle, rocket launcher and other stuff, there is a upgraded version of the m4 that has a grenade launcher, but the 3 best weapons are the following, The Shotgun, fully auto-matic and takes out bad guys quickly at close range, the OICW, the best assault rifle, semi auto grenade launcher, and scoped. The most BAD♥♥♥♥♥weapon is the Negev, the FMG is op, you get it towards the end of the game. Now lets talk about the difficultyFAR CRY IS HARDEven on normal this game is difficult, but the biggest offender isTHERE ARE NO QUICKSAVESopen the console using the ~` key and type, \save_gamethat will quicksave, YOU WILL NEED IT SON.""Hey! How Was That FPS Game With No Quicksaves? Said No One Ever"" - gggmanlivesOverall Far cry is a great game, with fun gunplay, good graphics, i could recommend Far Cry, however the main issues are no quicksaving and the difficulty, i like a challenge, but that will trun off people.

												Cry of Fear is an awesome steal from the App Store where you play as JacK Carver, a standard Hollywood guy who can shoot a gun. As Nancy Drew, it's up to you to find out why you're on an island or something. Handsome Jack is a super compelling protaganist whose greatest enemy is a cargo ship that you'll die over and over trying to get into for no reason. This DLC is GOTY worthy and my personal pick for Best Adapted Screenplay. Move over, Tyler Perry! Just Kidding. On a more serious note, Cry of Falafel is a challenging, rewarding paradigm with the potential to become the number one ebook on the Kindle store. solid 1/1			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I need to start off my review saying this. This game is balls to the walls difficult for an FPS. It is not forgiving and I was basically only able to beat this game by using a save game cheat. And that is basically the only part of this game that makes it unreplayable. Too be honest I found the gunplay to be quite fun. It is lacking as the enemies are complete bullet sponges, taking in up to a full clip from your M16. Guns in this game are neat, but it does focus on assault rifles. Other than three of them there are only enough weapons to fill the status quota of different types of weapons. Lacking? Yes. But still fun as I said earlier. The story of this game is quite...stupid. Government genetic testing. Bored yet? It is definetly not the reason you will be playiing the game. And neither will its claim to be an open world game. Maybe I just played the game wrong somehow but I found the world to be quite linear, with largish levels to trudge through. I started playing this game about the same time I started playing Far Cry 3 and...I was dissapointed. Now I know what you are saying, that I shouldn't be comparing it to a newer game, but to call this game open world seems like a sin to me, and made me glad we have 3. Score: 6/10It is worth it on sale and if you want to see how the series began. Or if youre a hardcore bada** who can take on the world. If you can kill every enemy in this game on one playthrough you are the ultimate gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is still as fun as I remember it was 10 years ago. A classic FPS with a bit of a cheesy/cliche story that will test your abilities to plan ahead in battle (or spam quick save/reload)!Go buy it, if you're a fan of HARD shooters. Graphics are also pretty good, amazing for something that's 10 years old (at the time of writing)!Other pros include:- a semi-open world, you can explore all you want but you won't gain anything from it (at least I didn't find anything).- some pretty funny one liners from enemies at times, you  will  be that guy in the shirt, whose♥♥♥♥♥is surely grass by now. - a somewhat creepy/scary atmosphere at times.- overall hardness of the game. It's quite hard, mailny because the enemies have laser guided x-ray targeting that could even spot you if you were behind a brick wall on mars.- no uplay!!!""...the guy in the shirt!""/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game received my personal ""Most pleasing visuals of all times"" award, which, fyi, is effin' radical. I mean, the game has pretty stupid gameplay, and the story is horrible (I mean, c'mon... a sailor goes up against a bajiggazillion mercs with WAAAAAY bigger guns, muscles (and probably dïcks too) than himself, and STILL he wins? Really...)! The characters are ridiculous, and the main dude's voice is hilariously steroid-y. And YET this game is bloody brilliant. Because of those freakin' graphics. It's worth buying it just to mess around in it, exploring jungles and chillin' on beaches. 8.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This thing came out in spring 2004 few months before Doom 3 and i guess that was the reason of D3 missed some portion of popularity... Of Course not everyone wants to deal with ugly demons somewhere in the a$$ of the hell when there is possibility to ride a motor boat/jeep around green and shiny tropical islands and be pleased by such beautiful water rendered by CryEngine. I can bet everything i have this game was the one who set the rulles for next gen 1st person shooters for at least next 3-4 years in 2004. And the only few things that this game missed we could saw in Project IGI such as gameplay balance/moments. Today i can't imagine what does ""next gen"" means b'cos every freaken 2nd B+ game called next gen... But back to 2004 FarCry 1 was true next gen game. With many attempts since 2004 I was walking through this game and at last ""happy-ended"" it one or two years ago on highest difficulty like I'm doing sometimes to get maximum satisfaction after finishing game to the end and after this stand up and say something like ""Yes! I Did it!"". This game was the 1st game where i've saw how enemy's IA working with some kind of virieties... how smooth ingame 3D graphics can be .... how to search and find the only 1 possible way to walk through a certain moments(highest difficulty) and how to learn to save game every freaken minute or less. Farcry 1 have common but aint bad story line in canons of action/thriller genre. Game is linear but still have some freedom/roam of movement b'cos it's big maps/levels. Multiplayer was also very fun and satisfiyng. I still remember those crazy jumps and kills on boats/jeeps across tropical islands that we can see now in modern Battlefield series...As year 2004 project 10/10.Sound/Voice/Music - 8/10. Graphics/Visuals - 10/10. Storyline - 8/10. Gameplay - 9/10.I would reccomend this game as common 1st shooter but one of the best 1st person shooters ever were released... to everyone. This game is strong part of history in PC Game industry. By the way... single player gameplay is not so dynamic as people can see in CoD series. So DO NOT expect nonstop action.-W-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally played through this as part of a backlog-finishing plan.  Totally worth playing through.  Beautiful, massive environments.  Fun and interesting stealth system that works well with the foliage throughout the game.  The accuracy of weapons seems well-adjusted to the ranges in the game.  Some nice variety presents itself throughout the game in some unique environmental designs and mission objectives.  Great combat to enjoy throughout as well.  This is a linear game unlike later Far Cry games, but open-world structure is not needed here.  A great experience definitely worth playing through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As with Far Cry 2 and Far Cry 3 being out in the market, this game is hardly mentioned. Is it because Far Cry 3 literally beat down the others so nobody will try this game? or just because the game is very old. Not sure. Very fun when you have nothing to do and this will entertain you for a couple hours. Multiplayer is pretty much dead so I wouldn't even try to get onto that.When I downloaded this game, I launched it and I got a ""Critcical Error""or ""Critical Exception"" Probably becuase I was playing on a Integrated-laptop. I easily fixed this by going to Far Cry Config and turning dynamic light to ""HIGH"" instead of ""VERY HIGH"" I guess it just took too much to handle for Intel HD Graphics.When I played this game on Intel HD Graphics (1000), it ran on mostly Very High settings with Shadows on Low. Ran around 50 fps average, so you shouldn't be worried about if you can run this game or not. This game is VERY VERY challenging to play even on MEDIUM difficulty, as it then goes all the way to Realistic, which I am not even going to BOTHER run. But definitely more challenging than Far Cry 2-3, and even other games to this day.8/10 Fun, Exciting, Challenging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks great for its age. Gameplay is difficult for the bad reasons of unreasonable AI that breaks the majority of stealth in the game. Will likely need mulitple patches as there are some gamebreaking bugs. Difficulty spikes near the end on the hardest difficulty setting to an insane level, but again not in the Dark Souls sense of difficulty. Cheap AI.  The gameplay is decent Far Cry style with a lot of movement to roam around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe this game is an acquired taste.I haven't acquired it after 17 hours.Far Cry is difficult for the wrong reasons, in my opinion. I played it on medium, with adaptive AI turned off (maybe that was my mistake).Enemies will shoot accurately at you before you can even see them (at max render distance).Enemies with rocket weapons will shoot your face from 6 feet away; they'll be fine, and you'll be at half health.Enemies fighting each other will switch targets to you, even if you're just passing by.As you progress through the game, ambushes become more and more frequent.The control scheme is good, although driving is a little wonky.The story is decent, but it's hard to enjoy when you fight the same set of enemies 7 times in a row.Graphics are dated (obviously), but not distracting.I wanted to like Far Cry - the feel of it worked really well. You're not some glorious hero, saving the world. You're a guy, killing lots of people on an island because you don't want them to kill you.The guns, the vehicles, the enemies and sneaking around all felt right, strengthening the game's atmosphere.I wanted to like Far Cry.

												The AI can see and shoot you through tent shack walls, and there are a lot of tent shacks. The 3 hours I've got right now? 2 have been spent trying to get past one camp where they can always shoot me, but I can't always shoot them BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE THROUGH THE DAMN WALLS. Oh boy, time to take on 15 AI that can competently kill you while you have no cover and blocked visibility! And look at the games I have on here. Almost all of them are first person shooters so it's not like I'm new to FPS.  Jesus this game is frustrating.EDIT: I have finished the game. Found a couple more walls the AI could shoot through. They're too all-knowing and can snipe with short-to-midrange automatic weapons from across a giant area. This game is much more brutal than most shooters these days. I can't remember the last time I've died in a campaign so much. That was just normal difficulty too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, first of all, this game is hard, very hard even on the easiest difficulty. Having said that, for a 2004 game, the graphics look stunning.I must add that it is strongly recommended to use the Iron Sights mod when you are playing this game. The in-game ADS is far from perfect and by using this mod, this would greatly enhance your gameplay.If you are a die hard FPS fan who is looking for a challenge, I highly recommend this game. However this game is simply not for the casual gamer. Only hardcore FPS gamers need to apply due to its difficulty. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, before people asking why I make a review to a game in which I have 0 hours...I played this already hundreds of hours I guess. Not on Steam and with mods. FCAM mostly.Back when I played it, it wasnt even on Steam and I played one of the first proper 64Bit games, with patch.You are Jack Carver and you are on a trip to a island.Unexptected your companion disappears and you get attacked by mercs. You have to escape onto the island.You are swimming and a grenade explosion underwater throws you into a tunnel and you get unconscious.You wake up in a old sewer and need to escape. You fast meet a guy called Doyle which seems to want to help you.He gives you cordinates and tips how to survive and what to do. So your trip over the big island starts.The gameplay is a classical FPS shooter. Located in a openworld tropical island most of the time. You have several wespons like a knife, pistol, machine gun or sniper to fight against the enemies. You will meet many on your way over the island and the interesting is that they are quite inteligent, especially for old 2004 enemies. There also some sort of mutant enemies next to the typical mercs but those come later into the game. You also have some sort of spy glasses to mark enemies on your map marker or just check the situation. On your way you sometimes also can use cars. Thats pretty much it. Simple but extremely well made, especially for 2004.The engine is the CryEngine. Back in 2004 this was one of the best looking games out then and it really changed the way of FPS shooters. Well, notably together with HL2 which came out around the same time.Also this was the first game of a German developer named Crytek. Which is also known for the Crysis series.This game has nothing to do with the Ubisoft Far Cry games like 2,3,4. The only thing they have in common is that they are FPS. Dont make this mistake please!The graphics are extremely good for the time and even today it somewhat still looks good or decent at least.All graphic options you can imagine are ingame. There are even Render options ingame with that you can let the game for example look like a cartoon game! Rarely I seen such options in games! Far Cry turns into Borderlands. Also sound settings are extremely advanced! Extremely good and well made PC game. There is also a 64Bit patch available. You need to install it extra though. I personally recommend using the mod FCAM instead. Delivers pretty much the same graphical enhancements. On the top there are even more graphical improvements. This mod really pushes the engine to its real limit. Even my HD 5870 some years ago couldnt handle it on 60FPS on maxed settings, 1080p and 4xAA. For the fact that the game was like 6 years or more old this was astonishing. FCAM also adds proper ironisghts which work really good! Also it fixes many of the annoying bugs like enemies which can shoot through objects and hit you... FCAM is a must have! Even for first time players! Grab the latest 1.999 version on moddb guys!Positive:- Old but gold!- Pretty good PC game, technically speaking- Really good FPS experience- Challenging difficulty, good enemy AI- No regenerating health!- Great graphics with many options- Mod FCAM makes the game even better and makes it ""perfect""- Crytek! Because yes!Negative:- Difficulty is high- Multiplayer is dead as of 2014. Gamespy is down but it was never played that much in MP anywayReplayability: HighRating: 9.5/10In my opinion this is totally one of the best games ever made.Rarely I played a game so often, especially after so many years. Definitely a big part of gaming history, especially on PC.Also mods like FCAM improve it so much!What are you waiting for? BUY IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+This game looks amazing for a 2004 release.+Story wasn't fantastic as far as I made it, but I was looking forward to it, nonetheless-Buggy ladders-Buggy stairs-AI can spot you from a mile away (edit:  they can spot you from unreasonably far away, and many times were spotting me from behind tents and such)-Missing textures (probably from a bad patch, don't know, honestly don't care anymore)-It refuses to even start on the highest graphic settings-I have to crash the game to get out of itBUT HEYI tried.  I really tried SO hard to love this game.It's simply not fun.  I made it almost half way without cheats.And even the devmode cheats couldn't get me through.I will not finish this game.Would be great if the AI weren't gods among men (and I'm on the easiest setting)edit:  AMD FX 8350, single R9 270x, 16GB ram, 7200RPM HDs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First things first... The graphics are amazing. For me, it's the first time that I played where you are in the tropics and can swim in the waters. Each level as you progress shows off a different part of the day. Morning, mid day, evening and night. The game play is straight forward, you also have an open range to wander but, it gets redundant at one point. Best to stay on track and enjoy the scenery either by running, driving, motorboating, and even by hang glider.Kill the bad guys, kill the monsters too, they can be scary at times, some of them move fast. You can use machine guns, sniper rifes, pistols and even throw rocks to create distractions. Typical FPS game and well what's differnt too is that your game difficulty depends on how you deal with the bad guys. Sometimes you have to use stealth to get by or face a barage of angry mercs.The game is worth playing. Check out any youtube videos on it. I have played this quite a few times already before it was on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I noticed the other day that Far Cry was on sale so I decided to buy it because I'm a massive fan of the latest far cry games not thinking much of it because of when it was made (2004) But as soon as I got in the game there were massive explosions,gun fire and a whole open world to explore which is a huge tropical island with many unique locations to explore. The graphics aren't amazing but the gameplay makes up for that. It has a decent story line with many similarities in gameplay to the most recent games. I would highly recommend this game especially if you're looking for an easy to run open world first peron shooter.Check out my youtube chennel here : www.youtube.com/theprodynamicgaming ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was wondering how long it would take for me to find a game that was really not worth my time. Farcry made me cry, a lot. So let's get into this.Far Cry is not a game where the story was generally well thought out. They throw you onto an island ""paradise"" where your character, jack Carver, was vacationing. From there something random happens and you have to fight through mercenaries in order to get contact with scientist named Doyle. Your character immediately trusts Doyle for no reason and then proceeds to fight through random monkey mutants and mercenaries in order to rescue a woman I still know nothing about. In short the story doesn't really make sense and is full of plot holes. Often the characters do things blindly or through the power of male female attraction. If the three characters do know each other then it's not well established. The story feels barely stitched together and thus is easily the weakest part of the game. It simply doesn't make sense, less so than many call of duty campaigns. From a sound design perspective the game is fairly unremarkable. Be ready for weak audio cues and sound effects that don't really match the actions of the characters. When a main character gets shot in a bullet proof vest he will basically Wilhelm scream, the enemies shout the same five taunts at you. All the weapons have compressed unrealistic sound effects and generally speaking the OST seems to be the same five tracks. If it isn't, then they all sound the exact same. This game did not impress in the sound department. The game mechanics are frankly broken. I've seen alot about this actually and it seems this is the result of a bad patch but it still made the game barely playable. Only a few of the guns actually are usable. The AI is ridiculous, stealth (though introduced as a mechanic) is not functional. Trigins will kill you in a single hit, and the game's version of a difficulty curve is simply to throw more and more enemies at you at a time. It never gets more challenging from a skill perspective; it just throws more of the same challenge at you until the end of the game. The armor mechanic is okay at best, as it does give you more hit points and the sprint meter and crouching / going prone works fairly well to stabilize weapons and focus aim. However the game also suffers from bad vehicles. The vehicles are nearly un-drivable due to their half first person camera viewing. The third person viewpoint actually makes the car more un-drivable. In any case the vehicles require you to drive and shoot at the same time, and this just make sit incredibly hard not to crash into everything and incredibly hard to kill anything in a vehicle while moving. Far Cry also will spawn in helicopters ontop of your character providing instant death. The game is also prone to glitches such as bullets not activating collision detection, enemies shooting through walls, enemies freezing, audio and visual glitches, as well as many others.  Finally the game does attempt two boss fights. One of these is very easy and hardly of note and the second one broken. When fighting Crow on the freight ship, the game has you fight a heavily buffed helicopter with a rocket launcher. The helicopter can take 15 rockets and Crow has a mini-gun that can shred your armor and health instantly. You can see how this is broken as heck...Presentation however is where Far Cry earns some credit. The level designs tend to be functional and original in the late game. They show a level of creativity that takes you from tree top testing facilities to a massive volcano. Each of these levels provides ample cover and weapons (disregarding the enemy game play of course). Also the graphics actually look fairly decent. As a game from 2004, on high setting the water looks phenomenal and the game itself is pretty average. The FMV cut scenes, while pretty rough, are also fairly good for FMV of the time. In short the presentation of Far Cry was its saving grace and actually gave me something to look forward to in each level. So now to summarize...Pros:- Average FMV cut scenes- Strong level variety and design- Strong enemy variety- Average graphics for 2004- Satisfying boat level because only the boats aren't brokenCons:- Forgettable and repetitive OST- Poor use of SFX- Prone to major glitches- Most of the guns are unusable- Poorly implemented mechanics- Bipolar AI.- Constant instant kills from enemies.- Broken boss fights and helicopter spawning- Dam. - Nonsensical story- Generally bad one liners and forgettable charactersFor you completionists in the crowd this game is not for you. While easy to complete in the sense that it has no ""new game plus"" or bonuses beyond beating it on normal, it's still a pain due to how broken it is. Be prepared to get angry. Some levels are broken due to the enemies being hyper intelligent. Dam is an excellent example of this because the player character has no basic melee attack and the game only gives you a machine gun with ten bullets. You will die over and over again at this point hopelessly running through hundreds of tirgins attempting to reach a checkpoint. There are other moments like this that are breathtakingly bad but I don't have all the space to recount them. For completing the game you will unlock mods and statistics mode. Mods are useable as there was a modding community for the game, however I haven't a clue if there is one that fixes the issues with the 1.4 patch. Statistics mode is the exact same game with a few additions like a kill counter and an accuracy rating at the end of the level. While it's nice that Ubisoft added a completion bonus to the game, this bonus really offers no new content and really isn't worth the trouble. If you hated this game once, you’re not going to love it because of statistics. So to conclude i'd give this game a 4.2 out of 10 (as it did have its moments and honestly wasn't the worst thing I’ve ever touched) and a completionist rating of Plook at it! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Replayed this game. I'll start off again with the great stunning visuals within this game (of it's time.) Best part of all, you don't need anything too high-end to play this title. The story is rather short and but clear enough to understand the premis of the game. Cutscenes happen almost instantly and you resume playing in an instant as well. Almost makes you wonder what had just happend after the short duration. Gameplay is rather repetitive. You kill, and kill some more. Unlike the other Far Cry games in the franchise, you can't really attempt stealth in this game. Enemies will spot you from afar. Leaving you in a gunfight against a great number of enemies. The game is also rather hard. Mainly because shooting one enemy will alert the rest. Again, no stealth feature was implemented. Despite all the setbacks, it is still a good game back in it's day (still is.) If you're a fan of games that consists of guns blazing. This would be a game to add to your library. I recommend!

												I thought Far Cry 2 was the hardest in the series HA HA I was so wrong. AI is very smart here and the fact that you can't save whenever you want makes it even more difficult. This game's hardest setting have some hilariously hard parts where you'll  want to punch your screen after the 40th try (the part when the girl drives and you shoot, GOD DAMN THAT PART). Although the voice acting, the cutscenes and the story are terrible, the gameplay and graphics (for its time) are superb. It is very satisfactory when you make a headshot with your good old M4 from a long distance. A good variety of weapons. The multiplayer is still there, but you have to be lucky to find someone playing. The rooms are usually filled up with BOTS. It can be pretty fun though when a miracle happens and a room fills up. If you want a challenging FPS, this is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The start of the epic farcry series, farcry has made a well start. The graphics where pretty good for its age, the enimies had a good level of difficulty with them compared to other games where the enimies where pathetic. The caracters sadly wern't really memorable except for my opinion jack who was pretty funny sometimes. There is a small variety of wepons but you can have fun with them all [my favorite one is the shotgun] as well as some sweet gadgets like the thermal goggles.  The bosses where a bit of a shame as they where simply easy to kill [excluding crowe in the helicopter]. Speaking of which the story was similar to half-life, BIG BAD SCIENCE EXPIRIMENTS GONE WRONG however with a twist as you yourself have to escape it and to me it was a pretty decent plot. So to total it up I do recomend this game for those who want to see the origins of the farcry series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game! Far Cry is really inventive and seems ahead of its time in many respects. Once you get over the slightly dated graphics, you'll notice all the enjoyable things that make the hours fly by. The gameplay is excellent, and the level design is very good. Each time I felt the game might begin to feel repetitive, some new elements were introduced, and had me hooked right back in. There are cars, boats, choppers, turrets, tunnels, ruins, fortresses, mercenaries, monsters... Lots of things to get excited about, lots of variation. I'm a pretty decent FPS guy, and I always go for the ""normal"" setting, to treat all games equally... but I was surprised at how challenging this game is. I'm not used to dying this much. Most of the time, it's OK, though, because it forces the player to take a more stealthy and planned approach to combat than in most shooters. But sometimes the high level of difficulty has to be blamed on ridiculously difficult bosses (and areas), and that got a little tedious at times. I bet that 80% of the total game time was spent on a handful of tough situations that had to be repeated over and over and over again. Of course, as many have pointed out, the protagonist in Far Cry is voiced by perhaps the worst voice actor I've ever heard, and that's saying a lot (I've been a gamer since the eighties). That factor certainly contributed to keep me out of the story, so I could  never really relate to what was going on in the story. Thankfully, it didn't take too long to get used to that fact and just go along with it, have fun, shoot stuff, get blown up, laugh and go at it again. 7/10[24.7 hrs total game time]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed  Far Cry , it's a good ol' classic romp,  across a mad evil-scientist's desert island lair; the classic videogame tropes don't end there  In terms of graphics issues mentioned by other posters. I managed to run the game on the highest settings, although I did get a black screen the first time around. I dropped the water quality down one notch from ultra-high and after that it seemed to start-up fine. So it's worth playing with.I did have a few issues with NPC's firing through walls, but not that often, maybe two or three times along a full play-through. Once I had to just jump into a 4wd and speed off to the next encounter as there was no way to kill them.Although it probably is a little more difficult than more recent FPS's, Medium didn't feel like too bad a difficulty to play with. But I had to use all the tools at my disposal. Using the binoculars to surveil the next target location, ahead of engaging visible enemy troops helped to work out true numbers (even through soft cover); as well as making them appear on the mini-map. Also the NVG'ish Goggles (Cry Vision on the Keyboard Mapping) helped to assess and take out targets' before they saw me.All in all, it was well worth a play through and I'd definitely recommend picking up a copy, especially if it's on sale. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(glitch to where if i kneeled down it could shoot me if im not it cant hit me when hidding  in a spot.tho i find it funny how i can hide in the bush and they cant find me. the even wa;l inchs past me w/o seeing me. i could be on a small iland with only 3 bushesi also had trouble where they can some how see me in bunker tent things even the helly was able to shoot to kill me.i will make a compleaty review soon. i find it a good vaule when i got this on sell (the 3 game pack FC 1.2.3 )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry is a first entry to the far cry series in which the name of the game is actually connected to the plot.Although it's an old game – it is still works on modern system (although there can be some problems but there are solutions on the internet) and it still looks beautiful.The game unlike it ""sequels"" is not a sandbox but a collection of maps, in whice each map is an open environment to travel from point A to B in any approach you choose (at least on the easiest difficulty)Let me tell you this, this is a hard game even on the easiest difficulty and Realistic difficulty? don’t even try unless you want some challenge and then getting frustrated because the enemy AI is cheating on every difficulty with their pinpoint accuracy and their x-ray vision that allow them to see through walls that are made of fabric like tents and of course can shot you through them (although you can also do this but sadly you don’t have x-ray vision).It's not a bad game but not really good either, it's an important game as part of the evolution of the open environment and sandbox genre and I can only recommend it to those who are curious about the origin of the Far cry franchise.

												Now, I know that FarCry is an old game that many of us have probably heard about or played earlier in our lives. But for those who haven't, usually their first course of action would be to buy FarCry 2. I can't stress this enough: DO NOT GET FARCRY 2, AT ALL. IT IS A TERRIBLE GAME. FarCry 1 was much more mission based and was aboslutely stunning, even if the aliens that were thrown later felt like a cheap cop out. Either way, FC1 > FC2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thought Far Cry 2 was the hardest in the series HA HA I was so wrong. AI is very smart here and the fact that you can't save whenever you want makes it even more difficult. This game's hardest setting have some hilariously hard parts where you'll  want to punch your screen after the 40th try (the part when the girl drives and you shoot, GOD DAMN THAT PART). Although the voice acting, the cutscenes and the story are terrible, the gameplay and graphics (for its time) are superb. It is very satisfactory when you make a headshot with your good old M4 from a long distance. A good variety of weapons. The multiplayer is still there, but you have to be lucky to find someone playing. The rooms are usually filled up with BOTS. It can be pretty fun though when a miracle happens and a room fills up. If you want a challenging FPS, this is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry is a first entry to the far cry series in which the name of the game is actually connected to the plot.Although it's an old game – it is still works on modern system (although there can be some problems but there are solutions on the internet) and it still looks beautiful.The game unlike it ""sequels"" is not a sandbox but a collection of maps, in whice each map is an open environment to travel from point A to B in any approach you choose (at least on the easiest difficulty)Let me tell you this, this is a hard game even on the easiest difficulty and Realistic difficulty? don’t even try unless you want some challenge and then getting frustrated because the enemy AI is cheating on every difficulty with their pinpoint accuracy and their x-ray vision that allow them to see through walls that are made of fabric like tents and of course can shot you through them (although you can also do this but sadly you don’t have x-ray vision).It's not a bad game but not really good either, it's an important game as part of the evolution of the open environment and sandbox genre and I can only recommend it to those who are curious about the origin of the Far cry franchise.

												Being the first of the Far Cry series, I had expectations but knew that it wouldn't be what I expected. And it wasn't. It's a linear game with very challenging enemies and mediocre graphics. However, that does not make it bad as it has that very challenging feel that only games made in the early 2000's can give.

So basically what I am saying is if you wish to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed in around every corner and have enemys with the eyesight of a hawk and the aim of a sniper (regardless of the weapon they are using) constantly pestering you this is the game for you! Even on normal you will constantly get destroyed regardless of how good you are at fps games. Would recommend it for people who wish to have a challenege and to see one of the more revolutionary shooters in the past 10 years. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never payed attention to this game when it first came out, I wasn't and am still not the biggest fan of first person shooters.  On a revisit though, this game isn't half bad.  You have to be exceptionally stealthy and tactics matter.  Go in guns blazing guaratees your death.  Even at ten years old the AI of the enemy is good enough to really hurt your ability to advance.  The setting is even interesting from a historical stanpoint.  The game is very long with some interesting level design for most of the game, and to give it some more legs you are given a serviceable story with incredibly bad acting, think 80s action movies.  With that they introduce some scifi elements that really detract from the good enemy AI, think mutants, but it didn't stop me from playing to the end.I recommend it on the basis that you go in aware it was a top of the line game from another time and definitly shows it's age.

												I'm not really sure what to say about this game, becasue I both loved it, and hated it. I did have a blast playing it up untill the last few levels, then it became so hard that I only beat it with pure luck, witch really hurt my view on this game. The story was alright, but god the voice acting was awefull, however the over all gameplay made it bareable atleast. Over all though, I would still have to give this game a positive rating; it's not perfect, but after thinking about it, it's much better then alot of shooters from 2004. So I give this game a 7/10.

I will admit that the trigens later on in the game are tough to deal with at times if you go into the levels they are in running and gunning(yes, there are ways to stealth). If you want a game that is fun, tough at times, and enjoy a classic, pick this one up. You will not be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over a decade later, how does this first title in a franchise hold up?Well, it's frustratingly difficult even on the easiest settings. It has a stupid ""checkpoint"" system which means you have to redo the same sections over and over. There's the odd bug and glitch. And the voice acting is atrocious.Nonetheless, it's still very enjoyable to play. The combat is fast and satisfying. The environments, though looking very dated, are great to explore. And it manages to annoy you enough that you want to keep going, because you know you'll have a particular spot licked if you try just one more time.I wanted to hate this, but I can't. I simply had too much fun with it. And you will, too. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over a decade later, how does this first title in a franchise hold up?Well, it's frustratingly difficult even on the easiest settings. It has a stupid ""checkpoint"" system which means you have to redo the same sections over and over. There's the odd bug and glitch. And the voice acting is atrocious.Nonetheless, it's still very enjoyable to play. The combat is fast and satisfying. The environments, though looking very dated, are great to explore. And it manages to annoy you enough that you want to keep going, because you know you'll have a particular spot licked if you try just one more time.I wanted to hate this, but I can't. I simply had too much fun with it. And you will, too. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that is still good, even though it's 11 years old.Expect to spend > 20 hours on your first playthrough. This game is very difficult, and you have to evolve a different strategy for each firefight. It's a nice mix between open-world and linear, where you can take multiple paths to reach the same goal depending on your playstyle. The story is OK, but I'd recommend getting a quicksave mod; otherwise you'll spend half your time just walking back to the action from the last save point. The AI is a bit derpy, but the game is still challenging.Also, it runs amazingly well. 1080p 900fps on a 750 Ti, and with graphics to rival any much newer game!If you're considering getting this game, do. It's regularly reduced to less than £2 in sales.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crytek is a developer that knows how to create near perfect first person shooters. Far Cry is another of those examples from their repertoire. This is some great, solid stuff, despite the bugs and glitches. A game to remember. Far Cry is hard. A true challenge even at the easier difficulty settings. Performance is an issue even for today's hardware standards. The game seems to need a fresh system restart to run at its full potential. There are plenty of bugs and glitches. Some were so major that I was forced to reload a save point several times. The game engine and physics is different than most other games, and this takes a little getting used to. The main character's voice acting is pretty bad. Almost to the point of making it sound like a comedy. For whatever idiotic reason, the game alters the Windows audio settings to its liking without setting them back to their original state. This is extremely annoying. Staying in the subject of sound, do a Google search and you will see the massive amount of sound problems people experience in this game. To access the multiplayer portion of the game, one is forced to register and create an account with Ubisoft, which is absolutely ridiculous. The developers clearly reward players who specialize in stealth and skill shots rather than running and gunning. The atmosphere, mood, and setting are superb; providing a tense and exciting experience almost every second of the game. The tension you will experience is not often produced by other games at this same level. There are many parts where you will be spooked and surprised by what comes around the corner or appears suddenly. It is all done very well. Level design in this game is outstanding. The AI is good, and there is always a challenge. Far Cry is all thriller, no filler.Far Cry is great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to make a huge list of reasons why you shouldn't give them your money for this game. It all boils down to the game being unplayable and tedious. Combat boils down to you camping a doorway and shooting enemies as they enter your reticle one by one. If you play this like any regular fps you will get killed instantly, more often than not you won't even know where the bots were that shot you to death. The finale of the third level has you scale a ladder that you'll get stuck on, unable to pull out your gun while a helicopter rains down bullets on you without you being able to run away to dodge or retaliate. If your idea of a fun fps is watching helplessly as your hp bar go from over 100% to zero in less than a second from an unfair number of overly strong bots (on normal ffs) then this is the game for you. Skip Far Cry 1 and 2, the first good one is 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll review what little bit I managed to play. The intro cutscene seemed to make no sense and it was just a whole lot of random♥♥♥♥♥♥and then you are taken into a tutorial, and this is where you find out that the controls suck balls.I won't get too in depth with it but crouching is weird and sometimes it doesn't even do the animation and your screen just jerks down. Sprinting is about 2% faster than your normal speed so all it really does is make you less accurate, does a weird animation and uses up your energy which you need to jump and I think you need it to hold your breath for some reason.After a little bit of walking you are introduced to the stealth system... Which doesn't work. Press G to throw a rock which is for some strange reason the same button used to throw grenades but that's just a little weird. Now here is why it's broken. There is no delay between an enemy thinking they hear you and them shooting you and this is the best part of the 'stealth' system, I was trying to sneak around and I threw a rock to get some enemies to move and what do they do? Shout 'I've found him!' and they did a 180 and shoot me. So it thinks that it has stealth mechanics but doesn't so your best bet is just shooting everyone but, surprise! sometimes you just die. I don't know how, I thought I had everyone killed but I was being shot so I went and hid and then BAM, dead and remember how sprinting only makes you go 2% faster? yeah have fun running back, oh I'm sorry, taking a leisurely stroll back to where you were to try and kill everyone again. Animations are just plain lazy, don't look at the machete because you may end up throwing up. Now, to end this review I will leave you with this. What happens when you decide that it's a terrible game that hardly works? You try to leave, what happens if you try to leave? It crashes and your cursor disappears of screen making it basically impossible to close though I did manage to get my cursor to reappear after locking my account and unlocking it again so there's that.pros- I can't wait to uninstall it so that's a pluscons-stealth system is broken-ai is broken-sometimes you just die because the game decided you should die-movement system is broken-game is broken so don't buy it-1/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one is thought to enjoy. Far Cry has without a doubt some nice moments and some nice open levels. Many elements of it have been recycled in Crysis as well as later Far Cry games and it's nice to see how it all started. But Far Cry does have a few to many fatal flaws to recommend.Most prominent would be the insane difficult, most enemies can kill you with two or three hits. By itself that wouldn't be a problem, as stealth would be the logical answer, but stealth doesn't work here. Enemies can spot you from miles away and will instantly shot at you when you use your sniper rifle. There is a silence gun in the game as well, but that doesn't work long range. Enemies are also far too fast on their legs, so you can't really play hide and seek, the enemies will have you surrounded you long before you can find cover.To make this issue even worse, the game frequently moves away from the open island levels and into buildings and bunkers. In those settings you are often confronted with enemies right in front of you after you open a door, leaving no room to do anything from a distance. Your binoculars, that help to detect and mark enemies on open terrain, become useless here.The next problem is the lack of quicksave, despite being at times pretty open, Far Cry sticks to a checkpoint system and linear progression, but when exactly you will hit a checkpoint is unpredictable due to the openness of the levels. They are scattered more or less randomly throughout the levels. Luckily the the lack of quicksave can be fixed, as quicksave function can be enabled by editing a config file, it's just not exposed in the GUI.The game has it's moments where things click, but those moments don't last very long. One moment you might be impressed by the level of foliage the game presents you with, but the next moment you might already be shot dead from an enemy that you didn't see coming.After now quite some hours into the game my frustration with the game, despite having quicksave, is getting a lot bigger than the enjoyment I am getting out of it. There are just too many situations where the game doesn't communicate what you have to do and you have to trial&error yourself through far too many enemies. The game never manages to establish a proper flow.On top of all that I also had plenty of problems getting the game to run in Windows10. Lowering lighting settings to ""High"" and installing the AMD64 patch made the game start properly, but even after that it's still hanging when you exist it.Edit: I finished the game now and some of the later levels, especially when you run around with a companion NPC, tend to be more fun and interesting than fighting in caves against monsters. However the basic combat still stays quite frustrating as there just isn't a good way to attack enemies in a stealthy way. It always ends up chaotically with a lot of trial&error and a lot of dying.The weapon balance and control also seems out of whack. The RPG is drastically underpowered and slow moving, requiring four or more rounds to kill one of the bigger enemies, assuming you can hit them in the first place. Moving with a weapon while watching through the scope will disengage the scope, but only after a short delay and it won't reengage the scope when you still hold the button. Some weapons also require a hold for the scope while other do it as toggle. Getting a good zoom level on the scope also requires some additional button presses. All this makes scope use rather cumbersome.The story also isn't anything special. Good guy vs evil doctor and his monsters, with a few minor twists and turns thrown in.So overall this just isn't that good of a game. Has it's moments, but also far too much frustration and annoyance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2004 was an exciting year for gaming, and this was one of that year's flagship titles.  I skipped over it until 2014, when I picked up all the Far Cry games in a set.  I decided to play them in order.This game did not age well.  It runs very poorly on modern hardware.  Every aspect of its design is an example of a mistake we've learned from.  It felt like such a chore, that I gave up about 60% of the way through and skimmed through an LP instead of finishing it myself.  I've never done that for any game before.I can't recommend this, unless you're playing it for nostalgia or a bit of education in gaming history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic favorite of mine ruined by a final game breaking patch.Farcry was groundbreaking on release from a tech perspective and was simply a really fun game to play. Sadly the 1.4 patch destroyed stealth play giving enemies the ability to see through walls and in many cases shoot you through them. Not to mention certain areas you simply get stuck on due to a heap of bugs that never used to exist.I finished this game a few times after it's initial release and loved it, it's such a shame it's no longer worth playing due to being sabotage by it's own developer since then. If you can manage to get the game without the 1.4 patch I still suggest it, otherwise you're simply wasting your money.Way to ruin the legacy of a once great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry has somewhat dated now. There are points of it which are still good. Its pretty much non-linear sandbox style maps. You've got your target location, but how you get there is up to you. The use of vehicles is nice (though fairly commonplace in modern games), the locations are nicely rendered and the combat system is okay. The hero is pretty forgettable, just the standard 1980's musclebound ex marine with zero personality. The plot line is somewhat cliched and doesn't really hold much interest. So an average game really, which hasn't stood the test of time too well. My score 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok Ok this is a hard one, This game is OK for 2004 but even on the lowest difficulty it is very difficult. The graphics for 2004 aren't very good, the AI isn't the best, and don't mention that if there is a wall that can be shot through, the AI will almost always shoot you through it. But if you LOVE very challenging games then this is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Frankly, I have no idea why this game has such a high Metascore and most people are impressed by it.The only thing that I found to be ""stunning"", to quote another review, was the amount of bugs and glitches I encountered during the few minutes I played far Cry for.Enemies that shot through walls, my jeep launched across the jungle with mach 5 due to being stuck between some trees.Might just be my particular experience and opinion after all though ...

												However groundbreaking this game may have been when it came out, its successors have only served to highlight some deep flaws. The stealth - a core element of the gameplay - is often a joke thanks to inconsistent line of sight and terrain mechanics, while the combat is awkward and overly difficult due to stiff controls and animations. And the graphics and general shooter gameplay, while respectively impressive and decent for the time, have not held up very well. I want to like it, but I just can't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those instances where the last few hours or so ruined the complete rest of the game for me.  Started off with some great shooting in some nicely wide-open levels, ended with a bunch of annoying NPC-escorting, turret-operating, and a final confrontation inside a volcano where you'll repetedly get shot to pieces by snipers you couldn't possibly see through all the fog.I really ought to go play through this again, maybe throw a few mods on it.  But until then, these are my last memories of this game.  And they aren't good ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the game itself stands up to the test of time, the compatability issues are very frustrating on many modern computers.First off, the steam version of this game has an old bug present which allows AI to see and shoot through certain walls. This can be fixed by modding the game or downloading a fix patch. However, this bug was fixed early on when this game first came out, and therefore there isn't an excuse for it to be present on this Steam version. The main problem, however, is the fact that in my experience, certain load points always crash the game. I have been unable to fix this problem.Overall, not recommended unless you are confident you can make the game work on your system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is it past 2005? Yes? Don't buy this game.Although it was considered ground breaking and innovative in it's time, it has not aged well and is now mediocre at best plus a BUNCH of bugs and a ridiculous amount of difficulty. I just finished the campaign and I will not be playing the game at all after that. I simply wanted to play through it so I could say I played the whole series. One of my main gripes with this game is the way the AI can perfectly shoot you through walls. I'm all for bullets going through tents (it seems the buildings in the compounds are made of the same material as tents or whatever) and all but it should be a random chest-height spray that you can easily avoid. Not perfect pinpoint aim right at you no matter where you move or how you attempt to dodge. Couple that with the fact that you can easily die in 3-4 bullets, and you get some really, really frustrating gameplay. I know this was made in 2004 and I gave it the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But, even in 2004, I expect to be safe from outside gunfire when I enter a building. Also, another thing that frustrated me were the stairs. They are extremely broken, mostly the metal ones, and I often got stuck and had to spam prone/jump to get out of the glitched area. This could often be a problem when in a fight as you can't really walk up these stairs without glitch-hopping and jumpinh around.Lastly, the games story was really bland. For almost the whole thing, but especially at the end I was questioning why I was doing what I was doing.SPOILERS AHEADI want to take this time to rant about the end of the game and how stupid/confusing it was. So for those of you who have played it, when you blow up the nuke, all of a sudden you are now captured in a helicopter with the main bad guy? It made no sense to me. I thought the game was going to end with that nuke but nope instead you get put into a typical fight for survival where you are striped of all weapons and equipment hooray! And then the end where you got to kill Doyle? Was his betrayal not the most obvious thing or what. I thought literally from the moment he first contacted me that he was going to end up being a bad guy in the end. Really predictable and boring story coupled with bad voice acting to boot, I'm just glad it's over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well this game is a decent one (when the AI isnt ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - the action feels very fluid), but I wouldnt recomend it. Story is ok but its more ""been there done that"" - nothing original. Voice acting - well its bad. At the time it came out the graphics were very good and the game aged well, but the engine didnt. Playing this thing on 64 bit OS requires to find a patch that downgrades the game form steam's 1.40 (btw this version has AI that pretty much can see you trough walls) to 1.32 and still the game, atleast for me, works wierdly ( for example it nees 40seconds to shut down...) If you really really want to play this thing - find Far Cry Addon Mod - it should make the game work better. My playtime shows no time becouse I added the update to play on 64bit machine and that usesses other exe that the one on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after playing all four far cry games, I can say that this is the worst in the series. The second half of this game is absolutely terrible. The mutants are by far the most annoying and unnecessary enemy in the franchise. The mutants with the rocket launcher take FOREVER to kill, and if you get hit once you are done for, even on the easiest difficulty. The mutants only show up about half way through the game, and everything before that is just fantastic. The game is actually really fun in the beggining and it sets the far cry series up for greatness. If they would have stuck to the same formula that made the first half so great, I would have given this a solid 10/10, but of coarse they had to screw it up.         6/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm sure this was great in 2004, but I'm judging it both in 2015 (when you have better shooters to spend your time on) and compared to what else was available in 2004 (such as Half-Life 2).  It still looks pretty good, but the game mechanics have not aged well.  There's no plot connection between the various Far Cry games, you might as well spend your time on a later and better designed Far Cry.The plot, characters and voice acting are sub-par.  I get it's supposed to be a parody, but it's the sort of lazy parody that becomes what it's parodying.  You're a guy with a gruff voice who will kill everybody on an island because some stranger on a cell phone says so. Finding your probably kidnapped girlfriend seems secondary.Combat can be brutal, even at a modest difficulty level, and you usually want to avoid a stand up fight (this is a positive to me).  You're usually heavily outnumbered and don't have a lot of health.  However, the game's combatants fall to typical overpowered FPS tactics like sniping, head shots and vehicles.This could have been mitigated by a good stealth system, but I found it hard to predict when and what would cause me to be spotted.  Sometimes I would be sneaking inside a building and shot through the walls.  Other times I could head shot a guard in the middle of an enemy camp and nobody seemed to notice.  Maybe they're all just super chill nilhists?  The inability to save the game other than at predetermined save points made dying after spending much time sneaking around particularly frustrating.The breaking point for me was a map in a dark cave.  Grey soldiers against grey walls that I can't see, but they seem to see me just fine.  I'd sneak along only to hear ""who's there"" followed by muzzle flashes in my face.Maybe the game gets awesome later, but I'm not sticking around to find out.  I'm skipping ahead to Far Cry 2.

												If I had played this game when it first released 10 years ago, maybe I wouldn't have had such a big problem getting through this game. There are so many issues I had with the game that made the experience unpleasant, and a chore to get through.The guns are crap, in my opinion. Every single one of them. Most of them have pretty crappy accuracy, do little damage, and even point blank range with the shotgun takes a few shots to kill almost everything. The only gun worth anything was the sniper rifle, but only when prone. Otherwise, good luck with the broad side of that barn.The AI is stupid. They were shooting me with pinpoint accuracy through a wall at one point. Through a WALL. What the hell is up with this?Random guys with RPGs that are sometimes near impossible to spot can nearly one shot you if you're not paying attention.Your movement speed is horrid. You pretty much move as fast as a snail, and the sprinting is only a small fraction faster. Some of these levels are HUGE, and if you can't find any sort of vehicle, or the game doesn't give you one, well, god help you.This game is HARD as Hell. In the later levels, there are so many baddies in each swarm, some extremely powerful with way too much health, several of them at the same time, that I don't think its likely to be possible without cheating. I'm not a hardcore gamer, and I don't like this level of difficulty. I was playing on Normal...not even one of the harder difficulties, but I still couldn't do it.I didn't really find the story all that interesting. For me, it was just kind of there, behind the swarms and swarms of enemies.To me, the game just feels unbalanced, unpolished, even broken in some ways.This game had a few redeeming qualities thoughSome of the levels are pretty open, which allow for multiple approaches to getting past or through the enemies.Each level was unique and for the most part well-executed. Some areas are huge. The indoor level layout was pretty linear but this wasn't a problem for me because I grew up playing linear games like this.Actually, I think that's about it, off the top of my head. I didn't absolutely hate this game but I did not enjoy my experience with it. Unless you're a hardcore gamer who loves challenge, I would pass this up and try the other games in this series instead, or if you got the entire collection really cheap like I did, just don't bother with this one and start with Far Cry 2. This game is just too hard.5/10Meh			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project Far Cry, also known as Far Cry is the original title in a franchise which has been successful for a decade now. Its setting has evolved a great deal since its inception. I'm not sure if Ubisoft was aware of what they were creating back in 2004 when Far Cry was released but I believe it's safe to assume most gamers have had a fair amount of enjoyment from the series.Far Cry was set on the world's most tropical island with crystal clear waters and a bright, vibrant, lush green bushes and rainforests. The setting of this game really is something you would dream of and is quite interesting in this respect - the environment is beautiful.As this game was released along-side to id software's Doom 3, Far Cry claimed via marketing to be so much better in every way. Unfortunately Far Cry was heavily over-rated by the media of the day and provides little to cater for new technologies and physics at its time. Doom 3 may have had serious hardware problems in its day but it has aged gracefully and the same cannot be said for Far Cry. I actually found Far Cry loves to randomly crash with critical errors, so naturally my judgement is that Far Cry was never completed - which might be the reason for my gripes with this game.I loved the weaponry - however limited, but especially the machine gun - for such a limited time of which I had. I enjoyed the method of mission delivery and how missions are carried out and the games general mechanics. The game does however feature broken physics, a disinteresting and mediocre story and really bad AI.As for the physics, it was quite simple that I expect not to be shot inside of a building from the outside with bullets and I would expect to never kill people outside in that situation - but honestly, it seems there's a first for everything. The story and protagonist were quite bad but I won't spoil any - I actually found more interest in the companion unlocked late in the game. The bad AI, well I wouldn't say the AI themselves are bad because I saw them perform some interesting things including team leaders giving their forces hand gestures - I'll admit that surprised me. What I mean is that the enemies can take you out from miles away with a rocket and there's nothing you can do about this - but when you get a rocket launcher you don't have the same accuracy. It seems there's some serious aimbot action happening here and I disapprove.My only other gripe is related to the realism of the tropical island setting - where the story progresses to include monsters and mutants and some seriously lame elements. Aside from this they basically have one-hit kills and take a lot of ammunition to take down so the difficulty fluctuates significantly and most people will give up on this game.To be fair I didn't use all the games mechanics, I didn't learn where enemies are exactly, so there's definitely a way through this game with ease but not without experience. I suppose I never used these features due to the control setup, and I just shifted the controls to my liking.Overall, I believe this game is highly over-rated and those calling this a classic are only doing it for nostalgia. It's a great game on the outside, nice and fun, but once you begin progressing you'll realise that it's not an amazing game with huge technological advances such to what everybody of the time were fed by the media, but it's nothing more than incomplete and broken.I'm glad its sequel was an improvement in every way, really.

												In some ways this is a neat game, It has smart gameplay mechanics and challenging enemy AI (a lot like the marines in Half Life). It is really more a predecessor to Crysis than Far Cry 2 which is almost in a different genre than FC1.However, I found this game to be more frustrating than entertaining. At first I had a lot of fun because I could use different strategies against the enemies and they were challenging. A lot of the late game enemies are just a chore though. No strategy really works, you just have to play the section ten times until you get lucky and kill them. And since the story is garbage there isn't really much reason to stick with it, it's just painful.It's extremely difficult, it will make you angry, it will make you cry, you will always die just before you reach the save point because you had to reload at an awkward time. Spare yourself some suffering, play Half Life or Halo 1 instead. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have great memories of playing the multiplayer on the original Xbox and Remade Xbox 360 version of this game so I bought this expecting a similar experience and oh my was I dissapointed. It is nothing like the console version and the multiplayer is boring and terrible. What made the multiplayer great on the consoles was the map editor which doesn't exist in this version nor do any custom maps appear online (which is dead, only 1-10 servers with only about 3 or 4 running with a maximum of 8 players if you're lucky) which is the only thing that really made Far Cry multiplayer worth playing.The campaign I didn't play much of, but it's really typical. I've been waiting for this game to hit 2.49 on sale for a while because a part of me KNEW I was going to be dissapointed and I wasn't wrong. I wouldn't recommend buying this even if it was 99 cents because it's honestly not worth the time in my opinion. The campaign is worth a playthrough I guess but you won't want to play it again.To get to the point, if you want it for the multiplayer, DO NOT BUY IT because it's basically non-existant. If you want it for the campaign then only buy it on sale because the experience isn't worth 10 dollars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Combines hitscan enemies with really long combat distances, quickly lost health that doesn't regenerate*, and AI that are cartoonishly acurate. Pass on this one.*Medkit-based FPS games only work if properly balanced. Doom, Quake, and F.E.A.R. are games that do it right. In the first two, it's because most enemy attacks can just be dodged. In F.E.A.R., it's because the game lets you a) slo-mo, b) permanently upgrade your health, and c) carry upto 10 medkits. Regenerating health suits games like Far Cry a lot better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't like to think I am jaded by modern games, but Far Cry is just awful.  The story is terrible and would have been cliched in the 80's, the acting is awful, and the gameplay is boring.  It does have an excellent free-world kind of map but it kind of pulls you along where it wants you to go.Driving the vehicles in this game is sort of like trying to coax a twitchy squirrel out of a closet while you yourself are mixing uppers and downers.I would not pay $1.99 for this game.  I wish I had not bought it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have great memories of playing the multiplayer on the original Xbox and Remade Xbox 360 version of this game so I bought this expecting a similar experience and oh my was I dissapointed. It is nothing like the console version and the multiplayer is boring and terrible. What made the multiplayer great on the consoles was the map editor which doesn't exist in this version nor do any custom maps appear online (which is dead, only 1-10 servers with only about 3 or 4 running with a maximum of 8 players if you're lucky) which is the only thing that really made Far Cry multiplayer worth playing.The campaign I didn't play much of, but it's really typical. I've been waiting for this game to hit 2.49 on sale for a while because a part of me KNEW I was going to be dissapointed and I wasn't wrong. I wouldn't recommend buying this even if it was 99 cents because it's honestly not worth the time in my opinion. The campaign is worth a playthrough I guess but you won't want to play it again.To get to the point, if you want it for the multiplayer, DO NOT BUY IT because it's basically non-existant. If you want it for the campaign then only buy it on sale because the experience isn't worth 10 dollars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In some ways this is a neat game, It has smart gameplay mechanics and challenging enemy AI (a lot like the marines in Half Life). It is really more a predecessor to Crysis than Far Cry 2 which is almost in a different genre than FC1.However, I found this game to be more frustrating than entertaining. At first I had a lot of fun because I could use different strategies against the enemies and they were challenging. A lot of the late game enemies are just a chore though. No strategy really works, you just have to play the section ten times until you get lucky and kill them. And since the story is garbage there isn't really much reason to stick with it, it's just painful.It's extremely difficult, it will make you angry, it will make you cry, you will always die just before you reach the save point because you had to reload at an awkward time. Spare yourself some suffering, play Half Life or Halo 1 instead. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Far Cry 1 is a game that has aged surprisingly well. Especially from a graphics standpoint.It won't make Nvidia enthusiasts salivate. But it means that Crytek was able to churn out enough polygons and sfx to make it actually passable in the critical eyes of today's players.That is high praise, technically speaking, since 90s and early 2000s FPS usually look like something that came out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Far Cry's Trigen Baboons. So maybe its historical legacy will be that - the first modern 3d game that has aged visually well.It's also very easy on modern gfx cards. It seems my GTX 460 breaks more sweat when rendering pixeled hipster games.So how is Far Cry in terms of play?It's really basic: A beautiful caribbean island, a shlocky story.You're shooting bad guys with guns, take their guns and run around, quite a lot actually. The most shocking features are a *omygawd* stamina bar, being able to *gasp* drop down and shoot from a prone position and *sweetjeezustheresmoar* shooting through many types of walls.This is all implemented solidly.More of FC's strengths: AI behaviour is great. Sound fx are fine.Some features were run-of-the-mill at the time, but may be received controversially today:No automatic bumwiping er... health regeneration I mean. Have fun backtracking!No excessive exposition. No military propaganda.And...caveat millenials ... NO QUICKSAVING. The game autosaves for you, rather fairly, I'd have to say. This might be a dealbreaker for many, but it actually works.If you're a fan of basic FPS, you can play Far Cry without blushing. It's alright. No shame in liking meat and potatoes, chart music or missionary, All others, pass. There's just too little substance.VERDICTDr. Krieger's ethics commision approves 2,5 out of 5 specimen.Decent, basic, passable - for FPS fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original Far Cry is not worth playing unless you have some deep, nostalgic value attached to it. If that's the case, though, you are the only one who will want to play it. If you’ve never played it before, it is too outdated to get any enjoyment from it. It’s something like Wolfenstein 3D: great for its time but out of place among modern games. There are too many other good titles out there to play that are superior to this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found it hard to see why people liked this game so much. I found it rather boring, frustrating and unstable. The gameplay is quite varied for an FPS but at no point did I find myself remotely caring what was going on. The AI of the enemy is rather good. They do things like try to out flank you and summon back up but this results in the difficulty of this game being ridiculous. Despite playing this on a high spec gaming PC built 5 years after the game came out I still had to knock the settings down to medium to even get the menu to load and it crashed frequently. This just added to the annoyance and the frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the most overrated game I've ever played in my life.The GoodIt has good physics effects and animations considering the time it was made, that goes for the graphics as well which are quite beautiful and advanced also, it has decent AI, and Jack Carver is a relatively funny main character.The BadIt's a ridiculously unbalanced game in terms of difficulty, in the second easiest difficulty you'll find yourself doing several sections again and again and again and again and again (x10) for no other reason other than some enemies are more powerful than they should be, or simply because the game offers you no resources at all, you have your guns, you have your ammo, and you have your luck.It's also a terribly bland shooter, the only thing you'll be doing in this game is routing through the jungle trying to get the drop on mercenaries, or sometimes weird monsters, sometimes it won't be a jungle, it will be a generic concrete structure called ""bunker"" or ""facility"" without any real distinction or meaning.Finally, the story is almost nonexistant, it's only there to give sense to the gameplay, and whatever value it has, it only comes by the main character's ocasionally funny lines ... ocassionally.I bought the first three games, including the third one's expansion, for 10$.If the sequels are anything like the first one, then I might as well just have thrown those 10$ straight into a volcano.

												Undoubtedly a game that was impressive upon release, today, it finds itself done wrong by an overwhelmingly mediocre story, inconsistent difficulty, and general tedium, which leads me to not be able to recommend this game.Certainly, it wasn't immediately terrible, the early sections of the game, bar one helicopter sequence, have you traversing an island that would clearly have faint echoes in 2007's legendary Crysis, with impressive foilage and shooting action for 2004.  But as the game progresses, the enemies get dumber, the hallways get longer, and the game starts to wear on you.  The shooting never really evolves past hopping around the mutated enemies, or spraying hot lead in the general direction of humanoid ones.The story itself seems disinterested with you and your actions, with the closing third of the game feeling slightly tacked on just to pad length.  It's never really quite sure if it wants to be a parody of Rambo-style B movies from the 70s, or a completely serious and dull tale of the multitalented cardboard box that serves as the protagonists's personality.  Also in this final third, the difficulty reaches a cliff the likes of which had me reaching for Dwarf Fortress for relief.  The first of two final bosses proves to be a painful experience even on Normal difficulty, but far too easy on the easiest one.  There is a section nearly directly preceding it that has you running through the jungle from the mutants, where it's basically luck if you get hit or not by them, allowing you to progress.I may have gotten this game for very cheap, and even with no expectations, I came out feeling disappointed.

												One of my least favorite games I've ever played. I played this game because I anticipate buying a new computer and getting the next-gen Far Cry games (3 and 4) so I decided to play the first and second games to see how they may compare. After playing this, I already know this is my least favorite out of the entire series.- Gunplay in this game is bland and repetitive. There's no variation in the combat whatsoever and after an hour or so it becomes the most boring thing ever. Plus it's very inconsistent, you can one-hit a guard with the suppressed MP5K then a minute later you can mow down the same type of guard with the M4 and kill him after half the mag is in his chest.- The NPCs are the worst. Seriously, being able to shoot through the walls at you in multiple situations after one of them has seen you is the worst. It makes so many parts of the game almost impossible. Their repetitive, bland voices make you want to cry. After about 30 minutes of hearing ""I'm gonna shoot your face off!"" and ""I'm gonna lay down the smackdown!"" I already wanted to gag myself with a spoon.- Speaking of voice acting, every person in this game with a speaking part makes me cringe. Especially the main character, his Nukem-esque voice and cliche one-liners become super annoying after the first moments of hearing him.- Some parts of this game are so hard they may even seem impossible (even on normal difficulty). The NPCs have some undying blood-lust rage even on the easiest setting. You should be able to have fun and rush whomever on the easiest difficulty but you can't do that and it's overkill in my opinion. Some parts like the mini-boss against Crowe on the sinking ship, where you have NO supplies around you and the game doesn't allow you to shoot while submirged in water so it's super difficult to get a shot off especially while Crowe is mowing you down with his LMG.- Some things, like the ability to look at a situation and decide where to go and what kind of way to take it (Like run-and-gun vs. a stealth approach.) made me happy early on, but later on it turned into ""Okay, either turn right and get shot at or turn left and get shot at. Your choice bro."".- The story is strictly linear and boring. It's pretty predictable and the complete change in the enemies in the middle of the game was terrible. Especially since the ""Trigens"" are one-hit kill enemies (with no armour). It seems like a cool story at first and it looks like it'll end up being a pretty nice, open game but it's just so straight forward and linear. It's honestly super disapointing.Overall, I don't recommend this game. Maybe right now since it's just 6 bucks or in the bundle but only then. It's not worth the time you put into it.

												So firstly i have never played any Far Cry game ever before playing this one in 2015.  This is because i like to play games in order of release and i recently bought a package in the Steam Winter sale 2014 which included Far Cry, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.  I cant remember how much the package was but it was super cheap.So this being my first ever Far Cry experience i went in knowing that this was released a long time ago and that it was an older game so didnt expect too much. I haven't really played any other games that i can compare this to within the same time period either so i don't really know what graphics/gameplay mechanics were like back then.So this game immediatly has terrible graphics in comparison to the film quality graphics of today but i assume they were probably pretty good for 2004 :P The game is basically mission based unlike Far Cry 4 (which i haven't played but believe is Open World??) so it does feel very linear, meaning you have to go down this set path to these set objectives even though there are occasionally multiple paths to the same place.The A.I is too sensitive or there is no option to sneak in this game since they appear to 'hear' you from what would seem well out of hearing range.  The A.I can 'hear' you through walls of buildings, they can see you and shoot you through buildings or tents. The health in this game is very very badly balanced with the enemies/difficulty too.  Since this game has no achievements i thought to myself 'i'll play on the easiest difficulty just so i can enjoy the game and walk through it no problem' LOL! Yeah so i somehow manage to take two bullets and my entire Armor and Health are basically depleted on the easiest difficulty. This just makes it too much of a pain to complete the missions for me and having put in what i believe to be a decent amount of effort and time trying to finish the game, i just can't bring myself to finish it because im dying too easily, the story isnt too interesting, the voice acting and all the cheesy lines are terrible and im just generally not enjoying playing it.So from me this game on its own i wouldn't reccomend but i will be playing Far Cry 2 next and so on, so maybe as a part of the Far Cry package it wouldn't be as bad.

												Far Cry. Oh Far Cry.This game. This game is hard. And frustrating. Hell, it didn't even work properly on boot up. Nor did it work perfectly when it DID finally boot up. Had to turn down my settings to ""High"" and the shadows to ""Medium"" in order to get it working properly.But: First things first. You're a retired elite soldier, running some tourism boat tour company or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ A young woman asks you to drive her all the way to a small collection of little islands because she wants to study ancient culture or whatever. A rocket strikes your boat on the way to the islands, you get stranded and then: The girl is from the CIA! Mercenaries want to kill you! Mutants! A nuclear bomb! More mutants! A volcano which is exruciatingly hard to get through! EVEN MORE MUTANTS! Oh and you have to stop the guy who created the mutants for humanity's sake, of course. And you get the girl. And everyone is happy in the end. Except for the tons of dead guys.That's pretty much the gist of it, really. Anyway, being top-notch at its time, Far Cry isn't all that bad. It's got decent game mechanics, outrageous physics and ok graphics. Well. It came out the same year as Half-Life². Go figure. What I dislike the most is that all the levels are split in, well, levels. No open world, just an arrangement of missions for you to fight your way through. And it's got bugs and glitches, making it possible to skip some sections entirely - or not being able to get through some sections at all. Also, it's hard to try and search for a different approach to any given mission, making it boring after one playthrough. No replayerability whatsoever. There's always an optimal way to get through this game and all the other ways are just painful.Speaking of painful: This game is hard. Even on medium difficulty you'll be running into enemies that do not hesitate to shoot a rocket straight in your face from 2 meters of distance, snipers that shoot with pinpoint accuracy from roughly 2 kilometers away so that you can't even SEE them because of the horrendous draw distance. Or just a big bunch of waaaay too strong mutants that come jumping at you and melee you to death in one or two hits.Also: The plot. It lacks any form of engagement. Halfway through I asked myself what my original objective was, why I'm on this island and why the hell I have to blow up three radio towers. I listened to the guy giving me the mission, I did. But it seemed just so irrelevant that I forgot five minutes after. And when I finally came to the last five levels I started asking myself ""When does this end?"". But I wanted to get through, just so that I beat this game.If you like AI behaviour that renders you defenseless on higher difficulties due to them shooting with pinpoint accuracy and onehitting you and if you like levels that only allow for one or two approaches at it and you don't care about any sort of plot, you might like Far Cry. Speaking for myself, I didn't like it too much and wouldn't recommend it. Unless you can get it quite cheap when Steam's got another deal. Then you can have a go at it. But otherwise... no. If you'd asked me 10 years earlier I would've said ""WOW! This thing is AMAZING!"". But today's standards do not allow this to happen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having no nostalgia or rose tinted glasses for this game I can firmly say this game dousn't really stand well against the test of time. When it was new and innovative Im sure people looked at it like it was great. I can firmly say that this game isn't that great. Its definetly dated and in relative to game design of more recent its just inferior.Is it fun? Yeah, but more often than not I found I was having fun only to just die with no real idea who or what killed me or how. Then being forced to reload and play what might be a lengthy part of the game which ultimately undoes any fun it was the first time.  Also the fun is to few and far in between.Gameplay genereally revolves around getting from A to B and killing everyone who gets in the way in between. Sometimes B is an objective or a bomb you need to blow something up which means you need to go get the bomb then back track usually. Theres vehicles peppering the game that add some variety aswell as a myriad of weapons. Some of which are quite a bit more usefull than others. Theres a combination of both semi-open world maps and corridors though the game is best when outside in a semi-open world map where the AI is best to play againstThe AI has issues. They do that old thing games used to do (and bad games still do) where enemies will snap to you and shoot immediatly if you so much as poke your head out while they are alerted, while some other times they won't even be looking the right way or they will just stare at you. Or if your driving on a boat at full speed they will still be hitting you no matter how fast you are going. Its compounded by the fact tracers dont necesarrily follow where the bullets are traveling or hitting (which is especially common in older and cheaper games) so it can be hard knowing exactly if your hitting or what your getting hit by (next to no problem when your on foot shooting though when using mounted weapons it is). Another issue is that in close quarters the AI shoots so accurate and fast that with guns one guy can pretty much take most your armor and health away. Which while you did everything right, all it took was one rogue guy and a bad checkpoint and now your saved with less than 50% hp and no armor.  Luckily theres usually not much terraferma between health and armor, though sometimes it can be quite a drag to get to them. Ironically regenerating HP would actually make this game more enjoyable especially with how difficult it is and how little damage you can take anyway. An issue I have found is that RPG guys are way to often. RPG wielding enemies will shoot from ridiculous ranges at you, fortunately RPGS travel pretty slow but its still annoying especially with the blast radius. Another point about explosions, they are very inconsistant. If you shoot a rocket anywhere near a vehicle (such as using the jeep mounted RPG to blow guys out of cover) and even relatively far away you will 1 shot kill yourself. I think I played this on challenging, so I advise playing it on normal or easy, unfortuantely on easy and normal the AI are pretty stupid and can just barely hit you with my testing. Yep, its one of those games where instead of making the AI linearly more challenging its basically a cliff of difficulty.The mutants are an interesting addition but have so little variety that theres only like 3 or 4 diffrent ones and compared to the humans they arn't fun to fight due to little or no tactics but they can kill you with incredible ease in some cases. But by the end of the game theres a over reliance on mutants with rocket launchers to make it difficult and it really stops being interesting by then. They soak up so much damage that its easier in most cases to just go past or around them and since you move so slow it can be hard to dodge away from them and their spalsh damage which again is the reason I prefer not to fight them.It gets worse when your going up against armored guys who will soak up anything short of a headshot (So thats where Far Cry 2 got that design idea from...) And the inconsistant nature of the AI just gets worse. Some bushes that should conceal you the AI might see right through and get alerted and shoot you, while the opposite also happens. Sometimes AI decides they want to dump a magazine and hit you with a good number of rounds while at medium distance. Though for all its bad, the AI does try basic tactics such as sneaking and they do exhibit independant like thinking capabilities. Instead of the game saying you are here (which does happen) the AI will exhibit cases where NPCs will search for you and while one may find you the others wont be informed of your location in the world until they learn of it. Or atleast thats what it seems like, its not as good as Far Cry 2 and both pale in comparison to Arma and mil sim games. The mutants don't seem to do much in terms of tactics though.Saving is not very good. Unlike past games like Doom or HL1 saves are check point based and not very good. Sometimes they are to far between and with no capability to save yourself you are at the will of the save system. So a shoot out your having trouble getting past means you have to reload and get back to the fight just to try to get past it.  These days check points and auto saving is much better than this but this is far from that and really needed a manual save.Vehicles pepper the world and levels and offer variance to the gameplay which is especially nice with the boat levels as they are some of the largest levels and offer the most tactical choices aswell as looking the best. I really like the reflection in water when used in games. Unfortunately land mass dousn't usually get reflected due to a glitch in the steam version regarding modern OS compatability if I remember.Compatability wise, the game is just barely there. Im honestly surprised the game actually works and dousn't crash or have many issues. Its advisable to download a fan made updated (1.41) or some other mods that make it so enemies dont see through buildings (primarily tents and shacks how the f*ck did that get through QA?) aswell as some address other glitches or add stuff to the game. If you can help it, don't buy the Steam version but instead buy the GOG version.  Sometimes when I try to close the game the game will give a black screen and keep running. As I said it just barely works.The story is a throw away. Its like the John Carmack quote. The story here is just ultimately to give you a reason to go kill and shoot people and its pretty stupid and goofy but not entertaining on its own or anything worth mention.The GOG version costs the same and is more open aswell comes from a truly free (freedom wise) service in terms of DRM.I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are heavy into classic FPS games or unless your looking for a decent but hard FPS game. If you just want a good or great game this just isn't it, Far Cry 2 is better in some aspects especially gameplay though so I would recomend that one more so. If you really care about the Far Cry series your not missing much if anything at all. If you do want to play it don't put it above normal and maybe even easy and it might even be worth it to stop playing the game before you get to the latter levels as story wise and mechanics wise your missing nothing. Best parts are when your in an open area and fighting humans anyway. Also the final fight is intensly difficult for what feels like all the wrong reasons. Its all the worst parts of the game put together to just make it hard. So theres nothing your going to miss if you stop playing before the final mission or around the time the game turns more into a corridor shootery type game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Updated 1/28/15-How to begin this review? Firstly, thank you to Rinon for buying me this game. Now with the pleasantries over with I can go into the meat of the review. Yes, this is an eleven year old game, but even on my rather decent gaming rig I was getting graphical artifacts, crashes and not even being able to play the game for what little I played. I purchased this game retail when it came out in '04, and my memories were true. Crytek make pretty engines, but horrible games. With enemies that can instakill you on moderate difficulty before you are within visual range of them, enemies that have models that pop in out of nowhere, and constant, frustrating artifacts the game was unplayable for me on each and every setting. Audio was a joke, as my headphones could just barely pick up voices and/or sounds even when at the maximum volume. Normally my OCD requires me to play each and every game in a series, but for now - I am skipping over to Far Cry 2. Your results with this game might vary, but in my opinion - do not get your hopes up.-Update 1/28/15-Another three hours of wrangling with the game and all I ended up with was a pair of BSODs, an overheated GPU, and a full on crash that forced me into safe mode. I hate to do this but I am going to have to urge others not to purchase this game, it could damage modern hardware if my results are any proof.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I beat the game while using mods to try and fix some glitches, but saddly my time in game was not counted. I cannot reccomend this game. I played it through to the end (and if you can beat the end level without snapping the keyboard in half your apporaching saint levels of tolerance), and the game was just stretched to thin and had way to many moments where I had to reload back about 3 saves and try and despratly figure out who kept killing me. This is a game where you will get sniped by enemys from an enermous distance away, and then you just sit there and cry trying to figure out who did it. It's hard but not really in a rewarding or fun way.  Also  in terms of cannon for the rest of series (like that matters) this game might as well not even bar the name after crytech left.

												The enemy AI is SO broken. At first the combat is fun and the game seems solid, but then you learn that enemies can see you through walls and that, while the game instructs you to move stealthily through areas to avoid fighting, you cannot sneak past enemies. It is not possible. They will spot you even if they are 100 yards away and you are crawling through bushes. This alone ruined the game for me, but there is also an uninspired story and terrible voice acting to boot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												3/10An utterly frustrating, disappointing and enraging game.Worthless minimap, no world map at all, no manageable inventory, no character progression, 7 weapons in all of the game (including a useless machete, a pistol only the weakest NPC's use and a rocket launcher you will never need).Also just one piece of repeatable armor and only one occasional way of healing which you can't even carry around.The story must have taken them like 1 hour to write, seeing that you are just thrown intothe thick of it and later on (unlike later far cry 3) you aren't told the story either.Insane damage from even the most simple of enemies even in medium difficulty that I played, regardless of their positioning (hit you through cover and with their sight obscured by objects), INSANE sight range for some enemies (last case of that I encountered was getting shot at ACCURATELY by RPG's from a distance so big that I couldnt even spot the enemy with my binoculars). No valuable long term stealthy gameplay either, due to the aforementioned factors, as well as the enemy being able to hear your movement on a certain radius (this is waht makes the machete totally worthless, seeing that the hearing radius is grater than your mellee range) and no silenced weapons being available (not even the sniper rifle, which will triger NPC alertness no matter out of what range you are shooting. You as a player are OFC unable to hear the enemy snipers shots).No replay value what so ever seeing that there is no RPG immersion, no decisions to make, no nothing. The same story over and over again.This game is a bit like COD, only that you have insane NPC's instead of noob kids ruining the game. Hell, some NPC's are even campers!On the other hand to get through some places you will have to start thinking, meaning that the progression isn't obvious or given to you by the game, even the descriptionless objectives and close to useless minimap add to this.Finally, to be fair, I have to admit that I didn't try multiplayer, which, if good, could at some points to the game (in case you still find anyone playing vanilla Far Cry, that is).

												Far Cry could have been a much, much better game if the difficulty wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ed up...Even if the difficutly level is easy, you will encounter enemies who shoot through walls with 100% accuracy. Your armor will run out really quick then u will be desperately runing away, and be shot to death. I do understand the game wants me to do things stealthy. However, if I am forced to do everything in stealth because the difficulty level is so ♥♥♥♥ed up, I am not willing to.Remember people, it was on EASY.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game started out fun and interesting but has quickly turned into a game that I very sincerely regret buying. It was a complete waste of money, and I rarely say that about any game. The only reason I am still playing it at this point is because I have a thing about finishing all of my games. It looks good enough for a 2004 title, the voice acting is bad but forgiveable (nothing can be worse than Resident Evil), and the maps are large and sem-open, but that's where it ends. The stairs and ladders are bugged, the AI Balance function isn't actually a functional function, the enemies are OP and can one-shot you from clear across the map, the stealth mechanics don't work, you can't exit the game without it crashing on you, and probably the worst thing: there is NO manual save. Well, there is, but it's way too much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do. It involves altering some game files in developer mode. So yeah. The game auto-saves at the worst possible locations, so I found myself having to cover the same expanses of map and doing the same things over and over and over and over again until I got lucky enough to make it to the next checkpoint. Like I said, if it weren't for this thing I have about finishing my games, I'd give up on this piece of junk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's this strange belief that's been circulating since 2004 that Far Cry is somehow a good game, I know, I know, it's too ludicrous to be true.But it is, and it's still here, that strange, unfathomable belief is still here.And as I play it, I wonder to myself, why? Why after having climbed a ladder to engage in the game's first ""boss"" fight am I immediately assaulted by a helicopter, six goons, and a microsecond to react, rendering me robbed of almost all my health and at the mercy of maybe one or two more hitscan shots before I am murdered in an abysmal display of horrendous level design?Why do I continue to meander around in floaty vehicles with terrible physics as annoying goons fling rockets at me from the ocean in an extravagant play of profoundly dull encounter design?As I marvel at how intensely dull and uninteresting the weapons are, I become overwhelmed by a miasma of ennui, I slowly realize nothing about this game was designed for my enjoyment, instead it was created by some hellish idiot who thinks that suffering is synonymous with ""challenge.""Garbage boring mutants will leap at you in a room discharging rockets in every direction, and as you try to manuever your way through the 4x4 space, you will scream in futility as you pound bullet after bullet into succesful headshot, only to fell the garbage boring mutants after your 16th round. Insane men screaming at you to ""bite my♥♥♥♥♥quot; will do about-faces and physically combine into a super hivemind that will immediately know if the single man you murdered 50 miles away died by your hand after you tactically distracted him with the infinite supply of rocks your character materializes out of a pocket dimension he carries in his massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they will then proceed to ventilate you with hyper-accuracy, utilizing horrifying magicks to warp physics and have their low caliber weaponry forcefully pound tiny bullets into your small-minded, idiot brained character's puny skull from continents away and promptly kill you very fast.People on the forums will then tell you to be stealthy, as the mercenaries within the game prove that they are masters of evil wizardry, and will reach out of the game into our reality to cast confusion spells upon the residents of the Steam forums and turn them into drooling nincompoops who refuse to accept the truth that is around them, that Far Cry was deisgned by a coven of extremely hateful and ugly witches who want nothing more than to subject humanity to pure pain and agony.It's really quite ridiculous, and almost every part of this game just suffuses with loathing for the player, the omniscient enemies that will lazer you through bushes, the impotent level design that seems to think long corridors with little deviation is interesting ""open"" level design, the obnoxious, confoundingly idiotic story and brutally♥♥♥♥♥♥poor voice over.You'll even start to notice how crap the visual feedback is, how stunningly unsatisfying it feels when you finally DO down the bulletsponge enemies, how every weapon feels weak and clunky, how generally unsatisfying and lame every aspect of the engine is that isn't about the graphics.This game gives me a huge headache, this game fills you with that really lame sense of frustration after every quickload where you feel compelled to finish the game, like an obligation, but unlike real world obligations, the only thing you get out of this one is the game putting its donger in your mouth.Speaking of quickloads, there is no manual saves or quicksaves, you have to use a cheat code to save yourself, in this hellish nightmare of a game, they don't even give you this one simple mercy. Out there, the designers of Far Cry are assuming their true shapes, massive brain eating slugs that have been gestating in the liquid magma core of the earth, rising up to pee all over your face invisibly with invisible pee as you play this game.Juicy 2004 graphics though.That's literally the one thing that's good about Far Cry, the graphics, the graphics were great, absolutely great for 2004.Now it's 2016, and the game looks like dated feces.And now it only sucks, it doesn't even look pretty while it sucks, and it doesn't even provide you with the courtesy of a real life donger for your mouth.I hate this game.

												The short version: bland selection of weapons, laughable stealth mechanics, and inflated, artless difficulty in a pathetic bid for cred as a tactical shooter. A worthless non-plot even by video game standards, to the point where the usual juvenile BS barely even registers as campy or offensive. No, Steam, I don't recommend this game.The long version:The weapons are boring. You have your choice of (thus far at least, I'm not finishing this thing): assault rifle, two SMGs (one useless), rocket launcher, sniper rifle (rare), shotgun, pistol (useless), and machete (useless). Obviously not every game needs a sweeping array of whimsical fantasy weaponry, but a big part of shooters for me is bonding with my favorite guns and none of these dull gray slabs cut it.The story is not worth a turd. The player character has bad cringey voice acting, no real qualities but a sort of flat, lazy sarcasm, and no will of his own, only taking orders from a voice on his phone. A female partner is teased early on but shows up in a cutscene tackily emulating Ursula Andress in Dr. No only to disappear again for hours.The graphics are nice for their time. Vegetation--bushes, grass, vines, leaves--was (and often still is) one of polygonal graphics' big weaknesses; setting a shooter on a tropical island must have seemed like an impossible dream to many. And yet the jungle gets monotonous fast. You can (literally) go off the beaten path and explore around and sometimes find alternate paths through a level, but doing so never feels worth it because you can't actually sneak past enemies (more about that later). Indoor levels don't even have graphics or exploration going for them. Cement fortresses filled with catwalks and computer equipment. Sewers and tunnels with no sign of vermin and that don't seem particularly dirty or smelly. Blah.Movement is awkward. You can't go very fast, even when sprinting, which depletes a stamina bar and broadcasts your location to every enemy within a city-block radius. You'll be spending most of the game semi-stealthed in a crouch position by holding CTRL but even then enemies can easily spot you. Interacting with the environment sucks too, you have to be flat up against and aiming perpendicular to and directly at whatever it is you want to pick up or use. So doing anything actually badass, like using a keycard to jump through a door in the middle of a firefight, or killing a dude, grabbing his gun, and killing the next dude with it, is next to impossible. Oh, and the ladders! I forgot about the ladders. The suckitude of ladders in this game doesn't even deserve explanation. ♥♥♥♥ you, ladders! Far Cry is also, as others have noted, too goddam hard. Enemies a mile away can detect you and kill you to death in under a second. There's also godawful pop-in that prevents you from seeing distant enemies. Frequently you'll die suddenly from someone you can't even see or hear. Once, I discovered this was because the enemy was headshotting me FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF AN OPAQUE TENT. The stealth mechanics, with the exception of the night vision, are next to useless, and it even features that ultimate early-2000s PC FPS frivolity, the ""lean"" movement bound to Q and E. The best you can hope for with stealth is to position yourself for a firefight and maybe take out the first one or two guys (often of ten or more, mind you) in an area. You have radar and can use the binoculars to mark enemies on it, but doing so is a false sense of security because it usually won't see everyone, and those one or two guys it didn't catch will get the drop on you. And even successfully being stealthy isn't the best choice, because guys you sneak past will come running to find you next time they hear gunshots. You can't hear enemies coming because they make no footstep noises; if you're lucky you'll hear some stupid taunt like ""I'm-a gonna gun yer face to helllllll!"" or whatever but those voice clips always sound closer than they really are. This is all on the default ""Medium"" difficulty, by the way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story:Ehhhhhh...ewwww.....really Ubisoft? Another mad scientist with his attempt at making super humans, but it goes wrong and then they go rogue. Great...I really need another game where this happens. OH I'm trying to escape the island!?! Why don't I just use one of the last 17 boats I got into to escape?!? NO I have to use them to go from small island to other small island. NEVER back to the mainland. I mean I got here on a sailboat I think  could make it back with a tank of gas so don't give me that excuse. And then there is Valarie...screw Valarie. I don't care! I have no idea who she is! There was no character development. I mean I love a game where you get chucked into it and you have to figure everything out, but when I'm told to go save someone whom I have no relation to? That's just bad design. It ceases to become a game and it becomes work. Maybe they should give me an incentive to go after her? Make me want to save her not just tell me to in order to justify their game and provide an excuse for, frankly, sub-par level design.Playability:This is where the game took a turn for the worse, I mean really worse. The AI was one of the most disgusting things in the world. Think Sonic '06 level of broken. I mean almost completely broken. The so called “stealth” would never work. You could be 100 yards away, prone in a bush, and you would hear “There he is!” and start getting shot at. They constantly “see” you before you even enter the room, and once I was spotted while prone INSIDE A VENTALATION SHAFT! All this combined with constantly being shot through walls or the guy INSIDE the garage but lit you up from a car's turret regardless makes the game most aggravating. Another moment was when you were told that the entrance to the boat was a hole in the side. Well guess what? They didn't mean the big obvious hole in the side. It was a small entrance near the bow of the ship. It took me about 10 minutes of jumping against a wall before I thought “Maybe the hole isn't this hole? Maybe there is another? Maybe Ubisoft pulled a fast one on me?” Even with all of these pitfalls, by no means is it a difficult game. Just repetitive and annoying. So many things were included in the game to make it longer. It felt like an ordeal, so when you beat it you wouldn't want to have to go through it again providing the illusion of difficulty. They used level design to act as a difficulty supplement, not make it actually hard. Honestly, when I see a game company do this they lose a lot of respect. Level Design:“Open world” another great joke from Ubisoft. They obviously think open-world means “go here, then here, then here, then big battle, then go here.” They were extremely linear and after awhile just left a weird taste in you mouth like you get after drinking milk and then not drinking anything else for an hour. It became “Great...another building” and there was a lot of “Here I am shooting a near-identical person in a near-identical situation as the last few hundred.” It just wears you out. The addition of checkpoints just proves my point. You cant have checkpoints in a non-linear game. They just made the game even more linear. The only way you can save is if you go along the per-defined path layed out for you. Additionally, there are no side quests. I'm not saying that side quests are a mandatory feature of every game, but in an open world game, they certainly are.Graphics:Rather good, but honestly Counter-strike source and Metal Gear Solid 3 had better graphics and they were released in the same year. One redeeming feature was the draw distance in Cry-engine is vast which required little loading time.Overall:“A glorified tech demo, don't bother unless you're curious about how advanced graphics could get back in 2004.” -Crisis from SteamIt made me laugh, and I agreed so I figured I'd re-post it.

												There are two types of challenging games. The first type is the one where you get killed a lot because you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and you know you ♥♥♥♥ed up. Super Meat Boy. Dark Souls. Then there's the type of game where you get killed a lot because the design is cheap and unfair. That's Far Cry.Far Cry is an absolute chore to play through. You will need to persist through piles of inexplicably bad design and an ungodly amount of unfair deaths to trial-and-error your way to the best tactic. Get Lucky or Die Quickly. It's finishable, but why would you want to? It's just not fun.SO HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.The game uses a checkpoint system, so quicksaving through a map when things are going well is not an option. You usually have the choice of fighting or using stealth. If you use stealth, be prepared to move VERY SLOWLY while crouched or prone, which saps the joy out of staying hidden. It can take a long time to traverse the map like this, and since enemies have such keen perception, you'll probably get spotted most times anyway. Not keen in the fair sense though. Keen because they can hear your footsteps from hundreds of feet away behind a building, or one of them can see you through the dense foliage you're hiding in because your shirt is so ♥♥♥♥ING RED, and they can all shoot through solid objects with unerring accuracy because they all have x-ray vision. Getting spotted after a 5-10 minute stealth creep and reloading a checkpoint isn't fun.So the alternative? Run and gun. This is a mixed proposition. It can feel good when it works, and the combat is nice and responsive, but you will get flanked and taken down constantly. Far Cry employs a health pack system with very few health packs, so again, 10-minute checkpoints need to be played over and over again because it just takes that one ♥♥♥♥ing guy out of the 25 you fought to get around your flank and it's die, redo. It reminded me a lot of Call of Duty 2 on Veteran mode (anybody?), but I was playing on normal.Here's how the ROCKET LAUNCHERS work. Mercs and mutants with rocket launchers fire them in such quick succession that if any one of them gets the bead on you, you are literally too slow to outrun them. If you DO stay ahead of the rocket stream, the smoke keeps you perpetually blind while the screen shakes, thus making it IMPOSSIBLE for you to fight back. Rocket launcher guys are usually a half-mile away as well, so die, reload. It's like playing Doom 2, except that you can only take one hit before death and the bad guys can shoot through walls and also, you have crazy glue on the bottom of your shoes. Not fun!Die, reload. You will die a lot. Maybe you'll get a checkpoint, but it will be in the middle of combat. Remember that rocket stream I just told you about? I got a checkpoint once while there were two rockets in the air sailing towards me. Die, reload, die, reload, die, reload, can't escape, restart entire mission. Thanks Far Cry!The combat is functional in the corridor sections, but in wide-open spaces, it's just a matter of exploiting the AI in cheap ways and engaging from long distances to avoid any real conflict. The best strategy: go for headshots while the AI is non-reactive to your presence and they're just standing there like target dummies. Or wait for them to get caught in a ridiculous movement loop and time your shot. Not fun!Your health, even on easy mode, is laughably minimal, and the hardcore difficulty of the game is mostly caused by the AI's impossibly keen sense, unerring accuracy, and your ability to absorb about 2 1/2 bullets before dying. Not fun!I got halfway through the game and realized I had no idea what was going on or why this dude was on this island or why the voice actors talk like they're not taking their jobs or this game seriously at all.I wouldn't either, the script and story are a pile of feces.At one point a mercenary shouts, ""YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU WERE DEAD!"" -- while he's unloading his machine gun at me. Try to make sense of that.Spoiler alert: there are mutants, and they look like rejected Quake 2 designs.This entire game has no idea what its identity or focus is.You can't even blame 2004 for this. Half-Life 2 came out a few months later and was perfect in every way, while Doom 3 even succeeds in topping this game with its focused combat and sharp atmosphere. And Doom 3 sucked.I would rather contract malaria than play this game again. I guess I'll play the sequel.3.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has some flaws. Somehow AIs can shoot through walls and know where you are,  and somehow they got wallhack if you get detected. The unfair part, is you can't shoot through walls and hit them. This game is mostly a stealth game, once you are undetected its easy, once you are detected, be prepared to get hit alot and go bck for hp and armor, because in easy difficulty 10 hits your dead. Normal is around 5 or so hits...and there is even a realism difficulty in the game. Overall, if it would be a bit more balance would be nice. 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												I admit this is a good game, probably was even better when it first came out, however because my first Farcry was 3 I simply can't recommend this game, the story is not one that I enjoyed and after playing this game for 7 hours + 2 offline hours, I really feel like the progress I made just wasn't worth the effort. At the end of this game I felt like I had wasted so much time, and really I was just hoping the game would be over.. However please keep in mind that this is an opinion. Again, I'm not trying to pummel this game to dust, because it IS a good game, however my experience with it just wasn't enjoyable, and because of that I don't want to recommend this to friends. You should only buy this game if you played this a long time ago and actually have some kind of connection to it.Anyways, I read a review somewhere down below and I have to say that the graphics definitely do hold strong after all these years.

												This would of been a great game to get in 2004, but now ten years later; this game is boring, has seemingly repetitive gameplay with small tweaks in the objectives you are doing, terrible voice acting but suprisingly good audio quality, and obviously this game has the graphics of a game from 2004, like it should.  I'm not entirely hating on this game since it is old, and I'm sure that this was a great title to play in 2004, but this game just simply isn't worth $10 as of 2014 and beyond.  The only reason that I own this game is because of the Steam Summer Sale of 2014 and I bought the Far Cry Franchise Pack, which including; this game, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3, and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.The only reason I would suggest getting this game is in the Far Cry Franchise Pack, but if you already have the other Far Cry games, don't bother buying this title.

												If you like fighting AI that can shoot through walls. This is for you. I love stealth, I love to be able to out think my target. This game is crazy hard! But not for the right reasons. It's hard because the AI is broken and can shoot through walls. Meaning you can't hide and you can't hit them while they can still hit you. Moving on to Far Cry 2. I'll watch a speed run of this, but I'm done playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												B-movie writing for a story (in the bad way).Obvious workarounds to sequences and boss fights.Game seems to require stealth, but is poorly implemented.Enemies gain +3 dex when behind opaque thin walls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Enemies that can see with an assault rifle further than you can with a sniper rifle, fire with pin point accuracy over vast distances, spot you moving from miles away through pretty much any cover, and of course, are bullet sponges. No doubt a great game when it came out, but utterly frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was really excited to go back and play this but to be honest it has hardly held up with time. Plot and dialogue are painful, enemies can see through walls but not bushes and overall it feels clunky as♥♥♥♥♥♥Play Crysis or Far Cry 3 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never thought I would play a game where the console version is infinitely better than the PC version, but if ever there were such a thing, this is perhaps the most extreme case.  This might be the worst game I have ever played.  The graphics and draw distance are nice considering the times (tho I found the texture pop-up annoying), the gunplay is acceptable, but these were clearly the only things that any thought was put into; the obnoxious, flaky AI consists mostly of wall-hacking aimbots (in fact, a user had to create an unofficial patch to fix bots being able to see and shoot through certain surfaces, which made the game unplayable for me.  To be clear, that's a USER doing the DEVELOPER's job for FREE), and combined with an archaic checkpoint system with no manual or quick-save, you can anticipate spending hours of your life replaying the same 10mins between checkpoints overandoverandoverandover sluggishly advancing through the occasionally engaging maps.  The game seems to encourage or give the option of stealth at times, but with AI like this, I gave that up by the third level.  Some games are frusturating but highly rewarding, but I never even felt any sense of reward overcoming each obnoxious ""challenge"", only dreading the fact the game wasn't over yet and there was still plenty of hell ahead.  I wasn't even a little pleased until it was over, but not at all pleased with all that wasted time I will never get back.  If you're going to make a game this bad, at least have generous save systems so we don't have to put up with it for so long.  I can't think of anything with worse voicovers and dialouge that takes itself seriously (one character was clearly voiced by a close relative of Microsoft Sam).  If this is good writing, than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and The Rock more than deserve Oscars for their latest masterpieces.  There is absolutely no charm, not even in the context of the B-movie sense, which I can appreciate.  Even the soundtrack is awful and uninspired.  This comes off to me as one of these elitist ""tech demo"" (if I may quote the great Steamcast host spitfire ♥) games that exist soley for people to invest lots of money into their computer so they can gawk at the graphics and brag about how they can afford the hardware to run it at highest video settings.  The PC library wouldn't be complete without them; there's at least one or two every year, and each one pushes back mainstream acceptance of PC gamers a little further.  But it's almost 2014.  Graphics have moved forward from where they were a decade ago.  So the only reason this was worth playing to begin with is beyond obsolete.  All this is not to suggest good graphics are ALWAYS a bad thing, but they must supplement the experience, not BE the experience.  I was appalled at the few threads I came accross debating whether this or Half-Life 2 is better.  If you are interested in this game or even if you've already played it and like it, I can't recommend enough playing Far Cry: Instincts (unfortunately only on Xbox and Xbox 360) instead.  Despite essentially being a corridor shooter, it almost mirrors the PC version; the voice-overs - featuring Stephen Dorff as a Jack Carver that actually resembles a human - are stellar, the dialouge and story are at the very least decent if not good, the maps are much more atmospheric and in the case of the sequel Far Cry: Instincts - Evolution, I would say absolutely breathtaking at times, Paul Haslinger's soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard, and the execution overall is much better.  So play that, and not this; this will drain many hours from your life and offer nothing interesting in return.P.S. Thankyou Valve for allowing us to not recommend games.  Long overdue.

												It doesnt live up to its legacy, Go play far cry 3 and run around as a rich white dude, it actually has a working game mechanics and you can actually pull off the stealth, So what I am saying is, go buy far cry 3 and 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most of the comments on the other reviews are accurate. The AI is ridiculous. With the large areas you play in, you'll be getting hit by someone you can't even see!I also found that the game frequently crashed on me. Not worth picking up. I'm sure it was a ground breaking game in its time, but it doesn't really hold up. I picked it up for very little during a Steam sale, as I'd heard a lot about the Far Cry series, but had never owned a computer capable of playing the more recent sequels.Also, the 6 hours that it says I've played is actually longer as in order to try to fix the game crashing bug, I deleted and tried reinstalling. Nope. Still crashes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suspected this game was a graphics demo back in the day, and my thoughts were confirmed when I bought this game for a few bucks on a steam deal.The game is horrible.  The plot is lame and there is no feeling for any of the characters.  Too many inconsistencies.  ""Oh there's no reception anywhere on the island"", but why then are you talking to me on a video phone?  The plot went from rescuing the guys wife to bio-engineered creatures, to nuclear bombs, to a lava eruption and everywhere in between.The game tried to portray stealth, but when there are such gaping bugs in the game, it makes it no fun.  Multiple times guys would spot me and shoot through the tent, concrete walls and anything else when I was sneaking around.  Cover?  Nope, not really.  Another frustrating point where enemies would shoot you through solid walls.  Don't forget about those invisible ones either!  Can't say how many times I'd line up to end up popping an invisible wall instead of the guy.1/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing like a bug (known since launch) that corrupts your save games to be unloadable, rendering the game that autosaves only to be unplayable.  Their solution?  Use the console and cheat your way to the next checkpoint, oh, and you have to modify your shortcut to put the game in developer mode to do so.  Add the random crashes to desktop and we have a real winner.I'd expect nothing less from Ubisoft, a company that I'm adding to the list of things to boycott for total suckage.  Between their completely idiotic DRM attempts and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that just fail to work I'm done.  Assassin's Creed, you say?  After shanking a thousand dudes with the same old boring metal icepick and trying to follow a plot shot out of some crackpot consipracy theorist's adolescent boner I have no wish to follow the sequels of an I.P. that's been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into the ground.From now on I'm researching the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of all these old games Steam is rehashing to the unknowing public before buying this crap.
