												This is a game about killing orcs. The concept is simple enough, but the execution is high quality. The game is basically a 3rd person shooter in which you have to defend a magical rift in a castle from a horde of orcs and other monsters that are trying to get through it. If too many monsters make it to the rift you lose. One man against a relentless horde of monsters may not seem fair, but you have a lot of advantages. In addition to your trusty crossbow, you'll have a large arsenal of spells, traps, and guardians to help out. Furthermore you earn skulls for completing levels, and you can then spend these skulls on further upgrading your arsenal.At the start of each level you'll have time to plan and set up your defenses and get a feel for the layout of the area. You'll be told where the orcs are coming from, what route they are likely to take, how many waves there are, and even what monsters you can expect to come knocking down your door.This is important because, despite the simple premise of ""orcs must die,"" this is really a tactician's game. The first few levels you may be able to survive using just your crossbow, but as the difficulty level increases you will have to diversify your tactics or perish. You'll start facing more orcs, tougher monsters, monsters that come from multiple entrances, and even multiple rifts that must be defended simultaneously. I will give one bit of warning that is not mentioned in the game-- if you intend to play on the default (war mage) difficulty level as I did, in order to earn the maximum of 5 skulls per level you not only need to prevent any orcs from reaching the rift, you've also got to do it within the par time. Once you start the initial wave the timer starts, and it doesn't stop even during the ""break"" periods you sometimes get between waves.The game is single player only. The graphics and music are adequate, but not AAA quality (this is an indie game, after all, and I don't expect AAA quality here).There is a storyline which is short, simple, and entertaining. Borderlands fans will recognize the voice of Axton the Commando as the War Mage.If you like third person shooters or defense-centered gameplay you'll like Orcs Must Die!			",303,55,5,61,33,3,51

 Simple, Fun, AddictiveThis game is very simple, defend your crystal from orcs! I know that sounds pretty booring but trust me, this one is good.First of I wanna talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is actually really addictive and fun, its not hard to understand. First the gameplay seems really simple but after some time it gets harder.The graphics are nice and cartoony, something that I really like! and the controls are nice and tight.Is this game worth the full price? Freaking yes! its a total hidden gem!Will this game run on a older PC? yes it will and good too!1-10? I give it a 8 out of 10.All in all its a great indie game with alot of fun hours ahead for you! I totally recommend it. ",556,107,23,60,36,7,62

												Here we have a very fun game, but it can get you very angry when you try to complete it perfectly. I completed with multiple rage quits.The proposal is simple, tower defense, prevent the orcs from reaching the portal, there are different types of enemies with different behaviors. The fun is to develop a strategy with the available traps, exploring the scenario in order to exterminate all. The vision in the third person possibility you to actively participate in the struggle, something different in these types of games.With a fun and intuitive gameplay, the graphics also pleases with his cartoonish appearance, the sound of stacks of orcs being crushed and torn is comforting. The plot is simple, just an excuse to kill orcs in many ways.7.5/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Excellent tower defense-ish game!  It's smooth, colorful, bloody, violent and pretty damn difficult at times.  It's a lot like a single player Dungeon Defenders.  Removing the multiplayer makes it easier to see whats going on, and allows for more creative thinking.  Each new level, trap and ability you unlock will leave you thirsty for more and more Orc blood!The traps are extremely divers and fun to experiment with.  Some combos work better than others, and some strategies are easier for different people.The pace of the game will keep you on your toes, and the learning curve is well balanced.  With the constant addition of new enemies and new traps, your tactic will have to change throughout the game.Its a good length for the content as well.  If it was longer, it would feel drawn out or not leave enough room for omd2.Over all, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying – on sale!  I only stress that this is bought on sale because you can play all of the omd maps on omd2 – with or without a friend.

												Single-player tower defense thing where you seek to commit massacre against poor huggly green people who just want to leave their crappy homelands for a better place. If you do play this game, do so with the knowledge that you are a terrible person who willingly makes enemies walk into spike-traps, get grinded up into goo, and catapulted into lava pits.Enjoy the murder! :P			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.			",89,13,4,10,13,0,19

												Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Amazing game, totally love it <3.It has everything to spend a great evening:+Cartoonish but high-quality graphics - Great animations of everything - traps, spells, orcs deaths. Lovely.+Variety of enemies (and even allies) - different enemies, different approaches.+Gameplay: provides awesome replayability which is just great for a single player game - this is a tower defence game AND you are playing as a hero that places those towers, so you can play with more offensive traps so they do everything for you, you can put more effort into leveling your character and kill all the orcs manually, or you can buy some troops and make more defensive traps to block the enemies. Great game. Good level design and nice story.+If you lucky enough - you can catch this game for 90% on sale - instabuy (don't forget the dlcs they are very useful)+3 difficulties+Nice OSTOverall, I loved everything about this game. Very well done.			",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! then skip to Results and read from there.Robot Entertainment mixes elements of different game types to conjure up a brilliant rendition of the tower defense genre. Taking action packed battles and mixing them with strategy you get a game that pushes both hack ‘n slash as well as base management. Story:The order has fallen, the last War Mage is dead, and protecting the realm is now left up to you his apprentice. You must fight your way through the unlimited hordes of orcs as you defend the rifts from falling into the wrong hands. As you press through your adventure you come to learn the evil forces are being led by a corrupted War Mage who plans to destroy humanity. Will you be able to save the world from falling into darkness? Campaign:The campaign is broken down into three acts. The first act has ten levels, the second act has 8, and the third act has 6. Despite each act having fewer levels than the last they are all about the same length as the number of waves increases throughout the campaign. Each level unlocks a new element to the game and once you’ve completed the level you gain the new item for any preceding or future level. Each time you beat a level you get a rating of one to five skulls, unlike most games these skulls actually are given to you as a currency which you can use to upgrade items. You can only get five skulls per level, meaning you cannot beat a level scoring five skulls then play it again to get another five skulls. Each level you can choose from a mastery tree that allows you to kit yourself out for that level, based on your strategies this can vary greatly throughout the campaign. You will progressively unlock more tower/item slots, which start as you only being able to equip three towers/items but later on you’ll find yourself with 10+ slots. You play the entire game in third person, and similar to other games of the genre you are able to join in the battle and help your towers out. This means you are not just sitting there waiting between waves, but rather taking an active part into the gameplay. Some levels you may find yourself not needing to join in, while others you will be right in the fray. Gameplay:Each level allows you to equip an inventory which allows you to choose from a combination of spells, weapons, and towers. There are two weapons (crossbow and bladestaff), four spells (flame bracers, ice amulet, lightning ring, and wind belt), two guardians (paladins and archers), and 17 towers. I found myself typically sticking to the same set throughout the entire campaign, but there are many different strategies you can go for. By placing player activated traps you can take a large part of the game, you can sit back and use guardians to do most of the work, or even mix and match. The gameplay is fast paced and really pulls you into the mix by getting you to experience new elements each level. Artifacts of Power DLC:Artifacts of Power is a DLC that includes new items and towers. The DLC includes two traps (Shock Zapper and Floor Scorcher) and two spells (Vampiric Gauntlets and Alchemist Satchel). I used the Floor Scorcher and Vampiric Gauntlets a few times, found the Shock Zapper completely useless (as you need a roof for it to function), and used the Alchemist Satchel to get a +50 kill streak for the achievement. All and all this DLC isn’t exactly necessary, but if you can get it on sale and included in the pack it’s worth grabbing. Lost Adventures DLC:Lost Adventures is a DLC that includes new level, enemies, and even a new tower. There are five new levels, which offer more skulls allowing for even more upgrades. There are two new enemies the Frost Bat, and Cyclops Mage. It also includes one new trap the mana well which allows you to refill your mana gauge. This DLC is completely worth it as it adds additional content, new enemies, towers, and refined leaderboards. If you can get this on sale or in the bundle you will not regret it. Results:Orcs Must Die is an epic tower defense hack ‘n slash game that keeps you pressed and wanting more. With rating systems that actually give you rewards, fun and interesting enemies, a long and arduous campaign, and an amusing little story Orcs Must Die is a Must Buy (too easy). If you are looking for something similar to Sang-Froid or Sanctum this is pretty much in that line. Once you beat Orcs Must Die you’ll feel like you need to buy the second one as it makes you just want to play more. Pros:+Leaderboard system that allows you to rank yourself amongst friends.+Level rating out of five skulls which can then be used to buy upgrades.+Loads of spells, weapons, and towers to choose from.+Skill trees which can be customized each level to allow you to change how you play (more player intensive, tower support, or mixture of both).+Smooth graphics which look good and don’t push it too far.+Funny and amusing dialogue which gives you a laugh without being offensive.+Intense amount of action, keeps you pressed and fighting between each wave.+Built in level traps (such as rolling locks, acid pots, lava pots, and ballista).Cons:-I had a few levels glitch where an enemy wouldn’t leave the spawn point and thus I couldn’t kill it requiring me to restart (this was annoying if it was at the end of the level).-If Gnoll Hunters fall into acid pits they do not die (as I learned when I set up a level that used nearby acid pits to kill enemies). -One of the DLC levels (Reverse Tower) is just The Tower in Reverse. I know this is obvious from the title, but if you purchase the DLC before playing the game its disappointing to find out one of the levels is the same thing just backwards.			",331,44,5,40,30,0,70

												This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:1. How in the hell does the skull system work...???2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...???3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???Here are the short versions to those answers:1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious ""target time"" that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select ""statistics"" from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:1. Wind Bracers2. Archers3. Tar pits4. Barricades6. Ice amulet7. Steel Weaver -> Death AugmenterYou'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:I installed Orcs Must Die! and played through the first two difficulties with a constant smile on my face, pretty much bewitched by the fun combination of traps and spells I could use during each mission. I refused to let it go until I beat it on the hardest difficulty and got all the achievements. I give this game five skulls (and a horned helmet to boot)!A fun, addictive, and enjoyable experience that keeps on giving.Orcs Must Die! is not the type to focus on its lore or story more than it's necessary. There's a legion of baddies out there and it's up to you and your ridiculously generous array of traps, weapons and spells to stop them. The simple and funny cinematics and voice acting cover the rest. The protagonist is witty, easy-going, wise-cracking, and arrogant to the point of annoyance. And as such, I lovingly refer to him as Bruce Campbell.The HUD and menus are minimalistic and have been built for easy and simple navigation with a gamepad. Even so, using a keyboard is in no way inconvenient especially when considering that all of the action is paused while looking through the menus.The graphics are in no way elaborate or any form of high definition but they are far from being poor or shoddy. Considering the high level of action and running around required, they are quite appropriate as nobody wants to have to restart a mission because they got overrun by orcs while looking at the pretty walls. The sound effects fit with the visual style amazingly well, the music is very fun and needs a lot of time for the repetitiveness to become annoying, which sadly cannot be said by the quippy voice acting which does get old pretty fast.The controls rarely feel awkward and only become a problem for perfectionists (such as myself) who wish to align all their traps perfectly. The heat of battle on higher difficulties makes for split-second perfect placement which when failed might require users to restart the mission. The Options menu is quite modest but fitting to the purpose of Orcs Must Die!. The Achievements don't ask too much from the user and completionists will get almost all of them by the end. In regards to the Leaderboards, some of the higher scoring users got there with cheats that allowed absurd numbers but ranking among friends works just fine and in real time.I installed Orcs Must Die! and played through the first two difficulties with a constant smile on my face, pretty much bewitched by the fun combination of traps and spells I could use during each mission.

												Orcs Must Die! is a dynamic combination of arcade game and tower defense. The action takes place in a fantasy land where the biggest threat to humanity are hordes of orcs. We, as an unlucky mage, must keep order in the whole castle. Simple, isnt it? Graphics looks more than good. Whole, maintained in a characteristic, slightly cartoon style is conceptually shapely, ingenious and simply pretty, works flawlessly. Hours pleasant annihilation of opponents.Because good orc is a dead orc.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												For those who don't know, it's a third-person tower defense set in a fantasy world. You're a war mage and your job is to defend the human world from the invading orcs. That's the synopsis in a nut shell without giving too much away, the rest is orc slaying fun history.There's a variety of useful items including but not limited to 2 main weapons, 4 spells, 10 ground traps, 4 wall traps, 3 ceiling traps, 2 minions, and 3 ""Weavers."" All of those have various uses and abilities and it's all up to you as to how to best deploy them against the enemy. That's not even including the DLC. Weavers are simply menus with available upgrades you can purchase with cash earned from waves. You get a limit of which items you can use per mission, the max being 9 available slots. You are also able to upgrade traps when the time comes with ""skulls"" earned after each victory. So it's somewhat tactical, you need to strategise your approach when starting a new map. It gives you a moment of grace to choose which traps to use and to scout the map.The music is upbeat and catchy, it compliments the protagonists witty commentary and the bloody orc slaying perfectly. I haven't encountered anything negative to say about it.The sounds effects are crisp and simple, nothing special of note here. The one sound that got on my nerves was the Autoballista firing sound, it's a loud WHOOOOSH and drives me nuts when I have a lot of them. Other than that, I don't mind the rest, it's very atmospheric. The sound that sent chills down my spine was the sound a flock of Fire Babies makes, it's very ominous.There's no endless mode, if you want an endless mode then get the second game. However, you can create a mod of the existing levels and add or modify waves. It's hands-on and takes patience and some planning on your part to do this, it's not an in-game feature.Pros:Great graphicsGreat atmosphere and special effectsInnovative abilities and trapsResponsive controlsController support (tested with XBox 360 layout)24 non-linear maps, each with their own challengeExcellent voice actingNot too over the top humorBeautiful art and great music3 difficulty levels (Apprentice, War Mage, Nightmare)Can fight 10,000 orcs with modded wavesCons:Autoballista fire soundSingleplayer onlyNo endless mode or any other mode besides the main levels (excluding DLC which adds more content)Can't invite Weavers into the battle (this disappointed me </3)No key remapping for left handed peopleNeutral:Orc Archers are stronger than Orc Warriors which makes sense but still seems backwards to meModding waves will disable leaderboard progress and for good reason but your kill counter is unaffectedUpgrading can be initially tricky, I recommend saving your skulls until you have at least most traps unlockedActive leaderboard that shows yours and your friend's scores and shows where you are placed globallySkull farming can be tedious, getting a perfect victory has strict requirements but it's worth itIt's a smashing success, ingenious concept and will offer you potentially hundreds of hours of tactical fun.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Orcs Must Die! Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Action; Strategy; RPG; Casual   My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWOrcs Must Die! is an amazing take on a tower defense/3rd-person action combo.  Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.Orcs Must Die!  does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the game… and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. It’s definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours. There is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.There is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.This game is just downright fun.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

Orcs must die belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle.+ Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want.+ Plenty of creative environment kills available+ Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage+ Creative weapons+ Funny+ Really cheap on sale-Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends-No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  ",72,11,2,5,3,1,6

												This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch.  Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!			",830,537,32,137,218,5,117

1-sentence review :Perfect mix between a 3rd Person Shooter and a Tower Defense Game !Pros :- Challenging without being too difficult- A bunch of really different ""towers""- A ton of enemies- Varied & interesting Levels- Funny main characterCons :- Lacks a little bit of polishing on user-friendliness- Orcs Must Die 2 is better (It's not a con for me, but it's the reason some idiots don't recommend this game :) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist.Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes.The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace.The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy!The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the ""skull ranking"" system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												HANDS DOWN - The Best Purchase Of The YearThere simply aren't a lot of games these days that really bring to the table what Orcs Must Die does. The concept is simple, easy to learn, harder to master. Very addictive and very satisfying to play. Not sure yet? Looking for a description of the game? Basically it's an indie 3rd POV Tower Defense, with Warcraft look & feel and the action of Team Fortress 2.If your looking for a reason not to purchase, I really can't give you any and that's been while since I've had that with any game!

												I'm not a huge fan of Tower Defense games in general, but Orcs Must Die managed to catch my attention some years back and I'm glad it did.The game functions like a combination of Tower Defense and Third Person shooter, much like a certain dungeon defending other game that is absolute garbage and will not be discussed in this review. As you make your way through levels, by accomplishing various feats you gain Skulls that you can use to unlock and upgrade traps and guardians you can place in the levels, as well as unlock and upgrade gear for the Warmage Maximillian, who you run around fighting with while your maze does its work.Every level serves up its own array of challenges but for the most part there's a solid strategy to be found in the basic sort of ""put up barricades so there's only one bottleneck, then shove them through as many traps as possible."" On Nightmare mode that attitude changes entirely, but for the game's normal mode, that basic strategy will get you through pretty much the entir game with only a few rough spots.Enemies run the rnage from a bunch of orc types, who just blindly run at the Rift, to kobolds, who ignore everything and just attack the rift, to gnolls, who tend to ignore everything else and just come to kill you. There's also Giants, Trolls,and Ogres who are massive lumbering foes who are barely stopped by any traps and require immediate attention or prolonged trap work to kill. Frantically rebuilding your mazes while hacking and blasting away at orcs is a lot of fun no matter how you slice it.The game's not overly replayable, IMO, unless you're going to max out five skulls on every single level on both difficulties, but if you do want to do that, there's plenty of playtime ahead of you. If you're interested in score and leaderboards, the game also does have that, but I wasn't personally interested in it. Some of the levels are very challenging though, especially in Nightmare, and unless you suss out the level's specific trick, especially on Nightmare, getting 5 skulls can seem like an impossible task. At this point the game becomes as much a puzzle as it does a Tower Defense hack and slash game. You can also go back to older levels with the new unlocked trap gear and marvel at how your upgraded traps smash through orcs like so many dominos while the Warmage gets to watch.There's a reason this first game spawned a sequel, a F2P MMo, and even a boardgame: It's because the game is a whole lot of fun. The story isn't anything amazing, and mostly serves as a backdrop for why there's orcs everywhere (You're the guardian of a Rift in a massive castle, and you're shutting them all to stop the Sorceress from sending armies through.), but that's fine. The only real downside to the game is that there's no multiplayer.... but hey, the sequel has multiplayer! So play this one to get the background and get your feet wet, then jump in with some friends into Orcs Must Die 2: Bigger and Better-er. Absolutely recommended.			",315,49,6,72,19,0,73

												I absolutely love this game. Great tower defense game. It has a great and memorable soundtrack.I would get tracks stuck in my head that would compel me to play more Orcs Must Die. The orcs are funny, the graphics are smooth and visually appealing, and a game that has enough challenge without taking away the most important part; the fun. There are few games that after I have completed that would whisper in my ear ""dun-dun-dundundun now that you've finished Nightmare difficulty you gotta go back and get 5/5 skulls on each map"" Which I did, and loved every second.You won't regret buying this game. Do it, for the orcs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to ""5 skull"" all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!			",3439,1417,129,372,466,31,567

												The gameplay is gritty, easy to learn, and difficult to master.  The game is quirky, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is easy to pick up, but hard to put back down.  It has a few shortcomings (no CoOp), and Nightmare isn't quite as difficult in this original as it was in the sequel, but the gameplay is still going to challenge players of every skill level.For those of us who love Tower Defense/FPS hybrids, this game is a solid purchase at anything under $10, and a steal when it dips below $5.  If you play through the achievements (all of which are reasonable), you can expect about 15 hours of very enjoyable gameplay.			",95,12,5,25,20,2,21

												A third person tower defense game based around traps and killing orcs. Addictive and very fun gameplay. Has a large variety of levels offering many fun challenges. Nightmare mode offers a little more of a challenge as you need to know exactly how you want to set up your traps and make sure you don't do any misplacements. I was really addicted to this game when it first came out, and bought Orcs Must Die 2 to play with my brother. Pros:+ A large selection of fun traps you can use to maximise killing efficiency+ A good selection of levels to play + Addictive, fast-paced gameplay where you have to use your hero to his maximum potential alongside the traps.Cons:- I tend not to like it when games offer dlc for extra cash, however the game of year edition is quite cheap when on sale, do it doesn't matter quite so much anymore.My Score: 9/10			",423,136,3,45,19,1,47

												I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.

												Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore,  has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. It’s a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.Ratings system:For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.Concept: 6.5/10Gameplay: 5.5/10Overall: 5.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

												Orcs Must Die is the classic tower defense game with the added twist your character being controlled in the first person perspective and equipped to help out when those wall mounted axes isn't quite getting the job done. First person tower defense is nothing new but it is how solid and streamlined Orcs Must Die feels that makes it stand apart from it's competitors.You are the last of the War Mages, not the brightest, not the strongest, just the last one. And you are all that stands between the peasants of the land living in an idyllic medieval utopia and being introduced to the business end of a rusty axe. To stem the tide of orcs pouring in through magical portals you must progress to a succession of levels killing increasingly larger and more diverse waves of enemies. To help you on this task you have your trusty crossbow and variety of traps and magic.You start each level by choosing which traps and weapons you want to use, completing missions unlocks more and completing them well allows you to upgrade them. As you slay orcs you earn gold which can then be used to place more traps or to gain various in-mission upgrades. As the levels progress you are introduced to all the classic tower defense enemies, the fast runners, the big slow damage sponges, the attackers that run straight for you, the suicide bombers that can kill your barricades, the fliers that follow completely separate paths from their ground dwelling kin and every other enemy that has been in every other tower defense game to date.Graphically the games goes for a sort of cartoonish look that works fairly well most of the time and the music does the job equally adequate. The various juvenile one liners being spouted by your character grows tiresome rather quickly however.There really isn't much to set Orcs Must Die apart from any of the other tower defense games out there, it does everything they do and never strays too far from the path of tried and true. What makes it shine however, is how extremely solid it all is. No action is wasted and every item in the game feels like it serves a purpose. The gameplay is tight and satisfying and although the nature of the genre makes it repeat itself quite a lot as you reach the higher difficulties it manages to maintain a longer lifespan than most tower defense games.All in all Orcs Must Die is your standard first person tower defense game, extremely well made and a must have for any fans of the genre but not a game that will attract any newcomers or a game that brings anything new to the genre. A tried and true fomular, executed solidly.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

Additionally, decent graphics and music, and hilarious tongue-in-cheek narration (you may recognize the voice actor as Axton from Borderlands 2Cons: Extremely difficult to get 5 skulls in some of the levels, which requires many replays (it reminded me of the rating system for Angry Birds in that way)Recommendation:  Buy the game.

												I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.			",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

												Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time. Whatever your approach, an orc's pain is your gain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was sold on the idea of using savage and over the top traps against an endless parade of orcs, and the game certainly delivers. Sending orcs cartwheeling into lava rivers was fun, sure, but the real joy for me came from finding the optimal way to exploit the level's layout for maximum damage. This is where Orcs Must Die! really shines through - the stages of careful planning at each level and the subsequent circus of death that follows after like some sadistic reward for your troubles.

												This is a singleplayer game, but you'll definitely get your money's worth from the lengthy campaign.From Robot Entertainment, developer of Halo Wars. Orcs Must Die lets you play dungeon interior decorator and build playgrounds of orcish murder. So go on and have fun.			",323,80,6,63,25,1,33

												Pros+Good variety of traps, weapons, and spells that allow for different playstyles. Want to go heavy on traps? How about heavy on spells and weapons? Or a nice mixture of both? Finding the perfect combination for what works for you can feely very rewarding and fun.+Good map variance. Maps can force you to switch your build so there's rarely a comfort setup that works for everything. +Good music that very rarely grows tiresome or reptitive.+Graphics are good and still hold up even several years later. Gives off a cartoony vibe, which I enjoyed.+Good variety of enemies that require different combinations to kill effectively.+A good amount of challenge from the Nightmare level maps that might require multiple set ups or attempts to figure out the perfect combination.Cons-Some of the voice lines that trigger when you set up traps can grow tiresome and reptitive really quickly.-I suffered some audio issues where a voice line would either stutter halfway through (but the gameplay would be fine) and some waves on some maps just not playing music.-The story is nearly non existant, but who plays a tower defense game for the story?-No Co-Op or online play.Overall Orcs Must Die! is a very fun rewarding Tower Defense / Third Person Shooter hybrid that I highly recommend to fans of those genres.

												You know from the developer said about Orcs Must Die:Slice themBurn themChop themPound themFreeze themYou can use any methods to kill Orcs in this game, simple concepts but varies of executions. Your war mage is become like one man army, dealing with thousands of orcs every time you play this.You got traps, guardian, spells and weavers to help you killing the orcs, you'll never regret it how things works out if you play this. This is a hybrid of 3rd person shooter and Real Time Strategy (RTS) because you need to know what kind of trap that will make orcs unable to enter your rift and don't forget of Big Boys such as Ogres and Bat for the Air units.

												We always think about killing games to include either people or zombies, I never think about orcs. But after playing this killing orcs, ogres and trolls seems to be as easy as threshing a colbalt into a grinder.The game is a tower defense, with it's main focus being on the traps you setup along the orcs path and not so much your weapons. It allows you to strategize and be creative, in a way I think it helps you intellectually by seeing things in different perspectives as to how you'll set up your traps. By the end of your first level, you'll be dancing to the victory song while screaming, ""ORCS MUST DIE!""			",158,72,1,32,27,3,37

												Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game. The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun). At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift. Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.

												I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game Lets take a minute to go through the pros and consPros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo          The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy          The headshot feature is my personal favorite            Archers on a bridge are OP          The Graphics are suprisingly great Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun           I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D			",61,3,0,9,4,1,5

												Overall Score 8/10Fun factor 8/10Control and Gameplay 8/10Graphics 8/10Sound 8/10Replayability 8/10As tower defense games go this is one of the better ones I've played, coming out as a steampunk-isk genera. Mixing magic with machinery giving you some cool traps and weapon. As for difficulty it's pretty laid back and requires a small amount of strategy and skill something you can casually play for hours of fun. I'm going to admit I rushed through a lot of the levels and tried quite a bit more than the average player would have. It still took me 30+ hours to grab every achievement and finish all the levels and unlock all trap upgrades. If you can pick it up for 50%-90% off, you won't regret it as it’s well worth the time and money spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game from a bundle sale, I wasn't expecting it to be good.After some months after buying this game I gave it a try and the experience is sweet!The game offers you a simple yet challenging gameplay.Like a tower defense game you only need to prevent the enemies (in this game Orcs,Gnolls,Ogres,etc.) from getting into the Portal (Rift).You can plant traps and use you hero to cut them,shoot, and kill them with spells, this makes the game more interactive. (which isn't like other tower defense game where you have to wait and watch after planting your towers)The story is good too simple and funny which makes getting to another level somehow enjoyable as you get to know what and why the orcs are attacking.The Hero isn't boring either and you get to somehow love the guy as his humor and sarcasm is pretty entertaining and funny.Grab this game and have some fun.

												WTF is it?   -   Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.Verdict   -   Well worth the time and money.BTW   -   This is better than that Rift mmo.

WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix.The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. Pros:- Kill orcs (need say more?)- Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies- Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy)- Smart♥♥♥♥♥coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)Cons:- Not story rich- Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)

												Orcs Must Die! is a fun, addictive game that combines twitchy, arcade shooter goodness with tower defense mechanics to hold back the neverending tide of Orc invaders.  The levels are well designed and the traps are some of the most unique I've seen in the genre.  From bubbling pools of lava, to spring boards that launch enemies into ponds of acid, as well as the classic spike and arrow traps, you'll have more options than you know what to do with.  The story is basic but complimented by funny banter from the main character and is told through voice over and still images.Perhaps the games greatest strength relies in the the 3rd person shooter elements.  You're not relegated to simply laying traps and hoping for the best.  Instead, you can fight alongside your machinations, whether it's with a spear, crossbow, or magic; you yourself lend a hand in achieving victory.  It's fun and fast paced and keeps the player engaged in each level as well as providing room for error when setting up traps.  This is something, I feel, the genre as a whole is in need of.  Too often in these style of games, the player is relagated to one or two winning strategies that are only uncovered through tedious trial and error.  In Orcs Must Die!, the player can create endless combinations to achieve victory precisely because they can shoot and stab the orcs alongside the traps.In the end, it's a fun, addictive game with 3 difficulty levels and plenty of replay value.  There's also a sequel worth mentioning.  So if you like tower defense games, this is a must buy.  If you don't, I'd still check this out on the cheap during a steam sale.  It just might surprise you.			",204,53,0,40,4,2,23

												Orcs Must Die! is one h*ll of an amazing game. I loved it so much that I played it over and over again until I got all the achievements for the game and cleared every single stage (including the ones from the DLC) with flawless victories. Then I still kept playing just for the heck of it. And I mean, I usually don't even bother getting every achievement for the games I play. I don't really remember why I chose to buy this game at first. I must've got the game w/o even watching the gameplay because I thought this is one of those old, classic tower defense games. The thing is, it was actually so much more than that. This game is an excellent combination of a third person action shooter with a tower defense-like aspect. The best part of the game is there are so many ways you can play this game (depending on the stages and your preferences). You can just lay a whole lot of traps and watch the hapless orcs get sliced, crushed, and burned to cinders without even lifting a finger (this usually requires some advanced traps and upgrades you get about halfway through the game, so you won't be able to do this from the very start). You can also become the ultimate orc-slayer and butcher hundreds of orcs single-handedly with your crossbow and bladestaff (well, with the help of a few barricades to limit their paths). Or you can actually act like a War""mage"" by equipping yourself with a bunch of different magic armaments and blast the orcs with arcane fury (again with the help of some barricades, I suppose). Depending on which traps and spells you choose to employ, the possibilities are practically endless. You just have to be creative. Also, this game differs from those boring, classic tower defences where you just build the towers, sit, watch, and wait until the long waves end. This game is fast paced (especially on insane difficulty where you only get 3 seconds for preparations!) and action-packed. Even if you choose to just build a whole lot of towers and watch, you will still feel like you are constantly ""In-action"" due to the way the levels are designed.One warning here though: if you absolutely hate third person shooters, this might not be the game for you as you do have to make extensive use of your crossbow in the early game (but as I said, it is possible to completely rely on your traps and guardians and not lift a finger on most of the later stages if you so choose).Another possible downside of the game is that it has no co-op or multiplay (which became the central part of the later series of this game). It's a pure single-play game. I personally think this is completely acceptable because: 1. If you absolutely want co-op, you can just play the sequels; 2. Unlike the sequels, where the levels are designed for multiple players, the level design of this game is made to be challenging but manageable for a single player.			",49,3,0,9,4,0,19

												Orcs must die is a tower defence game, without towers.  You place traps in expansive hallways and court yard like areas to defend rifts from a massive amount of Orcs.  Hundreds on screen at once running toward your rift.  You have traps, spells and weapons to fight them back and away from the rift and you are going to need every little bit of help you can get to work the field.  So prepare properly and get ready to hold down the fort.  Go buy this game!			",434,101,5,51,40,4,44

												Do I recommend this game?  Erm. . .  sort of.  If you buy Orcs Must Die! And Orcs Must Die! 2, then the levels from game 1 become available in game 2.  So I recommend that you buy the first game, but not actually play it.			",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.			",507,224,0,69,23,1,46

												Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.			",140,4,1,20,5,1,11

												Orcs Must Die! is yet another take on the now ubiquitous action-tower defense genre. In many ways, it's similar to Dungeon Defenders (see previous review), but you play as only one character and there is no customization, other than what traps you decide to use on each level. That doesn't make it bad, however. In fact, it's a real plus in the game's favor... as the main character is, well, quite a character! I guarantee his goofy lines will bring a smile to your face. Gameplay is standard fare for the genre - progress through a series of levels in which you must set up traps and defend your magic rift from hordes of orcs. Every new level completed adds a new trap or ally to your arsenal, making for a smooth progression (though nothing is ever really a cakewalk). You will be challenged, for sure... especially on later levels. If you're looking for a new tower defense game (or maybe looking to try one for the first time), Orcs Must Die is about as solid as they come. Give it a look!			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game.  You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways.  In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them.  This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side.  After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn.  These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians. After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME.  I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions).  Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay!  There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost.  It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.  However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs.  Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat.  If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube.  And if you like what you see, buy it.  Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.  TLDR: 10/10  Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review.  Harmed before, oh hell yes!			",19,1,0,3,1,0,5

												Orcs must die? Definitely! Ever play Dungeon Defenders? Well, if you have, imagine this is the one where you play alone (a bloody pity) and you do not have to level up or get god-like weapons/pets. You do however, get a bookload of traps and handful of spells to massacre the orcs/ogres/gnolls/batties etc. In most circumstances, I actually had so much more fun with this than Dungeon Defenders (I mainly blame my overpowered Steam friends for it though).If you never played Dungeon Defenders, well, imagine this as another tower defence game but you get to jump in and massacre the orcs yourself. Spells/traps/archers, plenty of ways to do it =DNote though, it is a rather short/limited game and it is single player but the joy of seeing that your wonderfully laid traps have worked perfectly - always a fantastico moment! One indie game that totally deserves your attention!			",530,181,16,98,60,6,119

												An excellent Tower Defense, in Orc Must Die our goal is to kill orcs. The concept is simple, but the execution was ver good. This is basically a Third Peron shotter mixed with Tower Defense, and our goal is to defend our portal that is inside a castle. Orc Must Die has 24 levels, and everyone level has a different approach, in each level you will fight hundreds orcs. Now you must be thinking that you are alone on this fight, well no, you will have many traps and magic powers to help you on this journey. On the beginning of each wave you have unlimited time to prepare your set up. Since is the first wave you won't have too many coins but don't worry because on the firsts wave, archers and barrels are the perfect combo. Graphically speaking this game goes for a sort of cartoonish look that fits fairly well, also the OST does the job equally.If Orc Must Die has COOP - OMD2 has COOP - would be a much better experience. After i decreased my backlog a bit i sure want to re-play this game again! Recommend! ~ 7/10			",493,181,16,44,79,10,49

												English:I'm not an expert in video games, or graphics, or hardware, or anything, I'm just someone who likes to play video games for fun and to tell the truth, with this game I've had tons of fun. What I like is that it combines well the action and strategy parts, you have plenty of options to kill your enemies and that means you can play and play again and again the same level and you'll always find new ways to beat it. Also, if you like the idea of ​​being a wizard and control the elements, cast spells and above all ... to kill thousands of orcs! then this is the game for you.Therea are many traps at your disposal (you can improve them to make them even more effective) and weapons to choose, to find your own style of play, either fighting melee in the heat of battle or observe from your safe zone at the fortress and let your traps do the dirty work. The learning curve is well achieved with 3 levels of difficulty. If you are the one who doesn't like stories and always skips introductions, prefaces, videos and sometimes even the tutorials, then this game will not give you problems because the story is told as you do the levels and only has a few cinematics so that you can focus on the main task, killing orcs !!!The only thing I dislike is that if you play in offline mode it won't let you use the orc slayer costume with the double sword, which although pure aesthetic makes you see like a badass XDFinally in short, a great game, plus the sequel is also very good, if you find any of the 2 games on discount, don't hesitate to buy them, you will not regret it.Español:Creo que otro análisis sobre este juego esta de más, pero aun asi escribire mi opinión. Para empezar no soy un experto en videojuegos, ni en graficos, ni hardware, ni nada, solo soy alguien a quien le gusta jugar videojuegos para divertirse y la verdad que con este juego lo he hecho bastante. Lo que me gusta es que combina muy bien la parte de acción y la parte de la estrategia, tienes muchisimas posibilidades de acabar con tus enemigos y eso hace que puedas jugar y jugar una y otra vez un mismo nivel y siempre encontrar una nueva manera de pasarlo. Además si te gusta la idea de ser un mago y controlar los elementos, hacer hechizos y sobre todo... matar miles y miles de orcos! entonces este es el juego para ti.Tienes muchas trampas (que puedes mejorar para hacerlas aún mas efectivas) y armas a elegir para que encuentres tu propio estilo de juego, ya sea combatiendo cuerpo a cuerpo en el calor de la batalla u observar desde tu fortaleza y dejar que tus trampas hagan el trabajo sucio. La curva de aprendizaje esta bien lograda junto con sus 3 niveles de dificultad. Si eres de los que les aburren las historias y se saltan todas las introducciones, prólogos, videos y a veces hasta los tutoriales, pues este juego no te dara problemas ya que la historia te la cuentan conforme haces los niveles y solo tiene unas pocas cinemáticas para que te concentres en lo que es importante, matar orcos!!!Lo único que no me gusta es que si juegas en modo desconectado no te deja usar el traje de mataorcos con la doble espada, que aunque es pura estetica hace que te veas como todo un malote XDEn fin en resumen, todo un juegazo, además la secuela tambien esta muy buena, si encuentras cualquiera de los 2 en descuento no dudes en comprarlos, no te arrepentirás.

												A great single player third person tower defense action/strategy hybrid. You control a Warmage that is able to attack with ranged/melee attacks as well as spells as you defend against waves after waves of nasty orcs that get more difficult over time. The gameplay is very smooth and snappy. An overall well made game that in my opinion (the only opinion that matters) is superior to Dungeon Defenders in every way minus the co-op.

												The gameplay is kinda similiar to Plants vs. Zombies but in 3D.In here you can cast spells, upgrade weapons.There are multiple pathways to defend which needs a bit of exploration so you can decide the positioning or placing of weapons before unleashing the orcs (Orcs and additional enemies may varies depending on what level are you in).It's actually enjoyable imo.

												Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself!

												An incredibly robust and enjoyable take on the tower defense genre. Tight controls, a plethora of options, and a general fun factor that keeps you coming back again, and again, and again. It is hard not to love this game.Despite its quirky, comical outer shell, it's a game that has a surprising amount of depth to it, a characteristic that makes it both challenging and satisfying. Whether you're a fan of all-out, balls-to-the-wall action games, or more of a strategy connoisseur, Orcs Must Die! definitely deserves your undivided attention.Orcs Must Die! is a blast, offering a fun, fresh twist on one of my favorite genres of all time. While its unique defensive structures will be appreciated by the more creative strategist, I'm sure this title would be especially enjoyed by those that might be bored by the more detached nature of traditional tower defense games.

												An excellent Tower Defense, in Orc Must Die our goal is to kill orcs. The concept is simple, but the execution was ver good. This is basically a Third Peron shotter mixed with Tower Defense, and our goal is to defend our portal that is inside a castle. Orc Must Die has 24 levels, and everyone level has a different approach, in each level you will fight hundreds orcs. Now you must be thinking that you are alone on this fight, well no, you will have many traps and magic powers to help you on this journey. On the beginning of each wave you have unlimited time to prepare your set up. Since is the first wave you won't have too many coins but don't worry because on the firsts wave, archers and barrels are the perfect combo. Graphically speaking this game goes for a sort of cartoonish look that fits fairly well, also the OST does the job equally.If Orc Must Die has COOP - OMD2 has COOP - would be a much better experience. After i decreased my backlog a bit i sure want to re-play this game again! Recommend! ~ 7/10			",493,181,16,44,79,10,49

'Orcs Must Die!' is a well designed indie game to play a fast round without thinking of playing 'CS: GO' instead.Desc:You have a portal with (dependent on difficulty level) 20 lifes, each orc getting into it decreases the life. You goal is to place traps/units and use magic to kill all the orcs without losing any life. At the end you gain skulls for each completed level to upgrade your traps/units. Easy as that.Pros:+ 'Pointless' killing orcs+ Humorously dialogs/story+ Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks)+ Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow)+ Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units)+ 3 magical sections+ 3 levels of difficulty+ No Bugs/Glitches+ Downloadable Demo(+ Achievements [some are hard to get])(+ DLCs)Cons:- no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented)- I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'.9/10 ",162,77,0,14,21,1,21

												A very fun defense romp. It feels a little more ""puzzley"" than Sanctum or Dungeon defenders, as opposed to hectic and shootery. Very well-crafted, and quite funny to boot. It's very hard to pull off an arrogant, irreverent, wise-cracking protagonist who doesn't just come across as obnoxious; but in this case, I think they did a great job.UPDATE: I found this game much more fun than the sequel, and if you're only going to play one of them, I recommend this one.

												Orcs must die! That one sentence is actually all you have to know about the game with the same title. It's a mixture between tower defense and an kind of action-rpg, where you have to prevent orcs and all their fellow companions like ogres, flying wyvern, and all that good stuff to enter the portals to the outer world. To do this, you have to... kill them. Of course.Story:If you actually want to play this game because of the story, you're considering buying the wrong game. There is basically no story, except if you call that little bit of dialoges between the hero and the villain a story. They're fun to listen to, as mentioned below aswell, but nothing special. Just the regular ""evil person wants to destroy the world, hero has to stop her""-story.2/10, but f*ck that, that's not what makes the game the great game it is, so read on.Gameplay:Before starting a game, you have to decide which items you want to use. There are about 25 different defense elements and 5 weapons for the player, such as a lightning ring, an ice ring or a blade, and of course the crossbow, which is your standard weapon.Then, after having built your line of defence, you enter ""G"" and the actual fun begins. Orcs and other creatures come and run to the portal (or portals, as you have multiple ones to protect on higher maps). Depending on your build you'll have to do more or less yourself, while your defence units are killing the mobs.There are three difficulties, one for beginners, ""Warmage-Difficulty"" (which is the standard one) and ""Nightmare-Difficulty"", which you unlock after beating the game on Warmage-Difficulty. On nightmare, you have only 3 seconds before the game begins, then you can't stop it anymore, so you have to think fast and play fast. There's actually skill required.9.5/10Graphics:The game is not the newest. It hasn't got high-end graphics, but I like the comic-style of the art design. It's playful, fun, and excentrical. It fits perfectly to the game and to the main character, who's a little bit narcisstic, sarcastic and feels over-the-top, which makes him super fun.7/10Sound/Music:The entire sound is great. While fighting, there's a mixture of rock/metal music with old, somehow medieval music playing. It's fast, it's hard, it rocks, it's just excellent if you like this kind of music.If you headshot enemies, there sometimes might be special e-guitar riffs played, which makes them quite satisfying.The monsters sometimes may comment your actions or say stupid things like ""why does his crossbow shoot 1000 times a second?"" with ultra-stupid voices, which makes them REALLY fun to listen to. Also, they make somehow fun of themselfes, which fits into the concept of Orcs Must Die! pretty well aswell.The hero - the Warmage - is nice voice acted and sometimes also comments the action going on on the screen in his sarcastic way. Pretty fun aswell.The villain is nice voice acted aswell, and the dialoges between her and the Warmage are in most of the cases really fun to listen to.10/10, definitely.Overall:Orcs Must Die! is a great tower defense game. It's fun, challenging, entertaining, humorous, and hours fly by like a few seconds when playing it. I love it.36.5/40 (as story isn't important, if you want to consider it, you get a 38.5/50; but trust me, it's a 50/50 for me personally.)			",90,12,3,11,14,0,13

Easy as that.Pros:+ 'Pointless' killing orcs+ Humorously dialogs/story+ Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks)+ Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow)+ Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units)+ 3 magical sections+ 3 levels of difficulty+ No Bugs/Glitches+ Downloadable Demo(+ Achievements [some are hard to get])(+ DLCs)Cons:- no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented)- I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'.9/10 ",162,77,0,14,21,1,21

												Orcs must die? Definitely! Ever play Dungeon Defenders? Well, if you have, imagine this is the one where you play alone (a bloody pity) and you do not have to level up or get god-like weapons/pets. You do however, get a bookload of traps and handful of spells to massacre the orcs/ogres/gnolls/batties etc. In most circumstances, I actually had so much more fun with this than Dungeon Defenders (I mainly blame my overpowered Steam friends for it though).If you never played Dungeon Defenders, well, imagine this as another tower defence game but you get to jump in and massacre the orcs yourself. Spells/traps/archers, plenty of ways to do it =DNote though, it is a rather short/limited game and it is single player but the joy of seeing that your wonderfully laid traps have worked perfectly - always a fantastico moment! One indie game that totally deserves your attention!			",530,181,16,98,60,6,119

												An incredibly robust and enjoyable take on the tower defense genre. Tight controls, a plethora of options, and a general fun factor that keeps you coming back again, and again, and again. It is hard not to love this game.Despite its quirky, comical outer shell, it's a game that has a surprising amount of depth to it, a characteristic that makes it both challenging and satisfying. Whether you're a fan of all-out, balls-to-the-wall action games, or more of a strategy connoisseur, Orcs Must Die! definitely deserves your undivided attention.Orcs Must Die! is a blast, offering a fun, fresh twist on one of my favorite genres of all time. While its unique defensive structures will be appreciated by the more creative strategist, I'm sure this title would be especially enjoyed by those that might be bored by the more detached nature of traditional tower defense games.

												Preface: Keep in mind that I am going to review this game... without the DLCs. They're not bad. It's just that I haven't bought them... yet. Even though I've had Orcs Must Die for a while. The story of the game is about a young-adult, sarcastic, nameless Warmage who's defending rifts in dungeons, which is gateways to the Warmages' medieval world, against waves of Orcs. I do not wish to spoil any quotes or scenes from the game, because that would just ruin everything. The gameplay is Tower-Defence... but not in a traditional way with a birds-eye-view. You play as the Warmage in 3rd person, like Gears of War(except, you can't take cover). You run around in the dungeon, place traps and choose which weapon and spell you are going to choose for the wave. At the end of each wave, you are presented with a high-score. Depending on how well you played, you will earn orc-skulls to level up your traps/magics/weapons. The Warmage doesn't Level-up. This game is more based on tactics, than brute strength. Unlike Dungeon Defenders, which came out almost in the same time-frame. The music in the game is medieval but with a crazy tone to it. I like it. Sometimes when the Warmage kills an Orc, The Warmage makes a sarcastic/hilarious statement. I can't give away what he says. Like I said, it would just ruin the fun. It is important that you do not mute the Warmages voice. Because the story presents itself on flashbacks and what the Warmage says during gameplay. It's a Short-and-Sweet game with a special twist to the story and the gameplay. Orcs Must die! gets an ''above-great'' 9/10. I highly recommend this game.[Review in a nutshell]This hilarious game, with green Warhammer 40k orcs, is a ''must have for anyone who loves Tactical-Tower-Defence games''.			",115,39,0,36,6,2,4

Posted: March 17, 2016
												Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die is a combination of third person action and tower/trap defense, similar to Sanctum but with humor and medieval weaponry. The game is a lot of fun, but unlike the sequel, there’s no co-op gameplay :(You take on the role of a cocky student war mage trying to hold back the onslaught of orcs coming through into our world. The hero is pretty dumb, but fortunately the orcs are even dumber and their paths through each level are almost completely predictable. With your magic traps and artifacts (for casting spells) you need to make sure as few orcs as possible get to the end of the level and enter the rift (sometimes there’s more than one rift to defend). The game is broken up into individual levels, each with a different map, and on each map can be multiple orc entrances and exit rifts. At the start of each level you are given unlimited time to run around and see the layout, as well as set up your loadout (which traps or spells you can use during the level). Once you’ve started the game you cannot change your loadout, you’d have to restart the whole level. You have a ton of traps to choose from, although a few of them aren’t much use and you’ll likely be sticking with the basics like wall arrows, tar pits, and barricades for most of the game. You’ll be facing only a few different kinds of orcs (fast runners, arrow shooters, ogres), but they’ll be coming in large numbers so the key to beating each level is channeling the orcs into choke points where you can use fewer numbers of traps. The traps cost money so you can’t just fill the map with them (and unlike many other tower defense games, you cannot upgrade the traps during the levels). The biggest difference though between Orcs Must Die and traditional tower defense is the fact that you the hero are on site blasting enemies alongside your traps. You’re armed with a reasonably powerful rapid fire crossbow that’s able to kill small numbers of the slow moving orcs, or the really fast runners that die in one shot. Your traps usually have cooldown times so you cannot rely on them to catch every orc. For example, a spike trap might only trigger every 5 seconds, and during those 5 seconds, more orcs might run over it. It’s up to you and your trusty crossbow to fill them with arrows while waiting for your traps to be ready again. Every level you beat unlocks a different trap type or spell (like fireball or lightning) so by the end of the campaign you’ll have a massive arsenal to choose from. Pros:+The difficulty ramps up slowly and gives you a chance to learn various strategies for tackling levels. In the meantime, enjoy the humor. “Oh no he di’nt” – Orc, as he’s knocked into lava+You can go back and replay levels with your newly unlocked traps and spells. The game tells you the top scores for each level that your Steam friends achieved. I’m not that competitive though, I just wanted to finish each level and see the story.Cons:-I mentioned the difficulty ramps up, and by the end some of the levels seem practically impossible to get max score if you’re trying the Nightmare difficulty.Overall, Orcs Must Die is a little known gem. The metacritic score is high, but nobody really talks about it. Some of the Steam achievements require mass grinding though, which is a little annoying. 9/10 ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre. 8/10			",130,11,3,10,1,0,13

												Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.Technically: the game is a fantasy / medievial ""tower"" defence + third person ""shoot everything that survived trap lines"", 30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable 20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay, nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay, challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,Gameplay notes: The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,  The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave, Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line, Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff, Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast, Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them, During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade. Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story. Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps, No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2), It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy. The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad.  Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.  His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity. The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage. Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall).

												Orcs Must Die! is a rare gem. It's basically a fantasy tower defense game with no way to see the whole strategic battlefield at once. Instead you run around like crazy, setting out traps for the bad Orcs and Ogres that burst out of the doors to save the world as a non-talented wizard apprentice. IMHO it's better than the second part as it's really pure and straight fun.			",249,87,10,31,24,3,50

												Orcs Must Die is a game where there's orcs... and... they must die. Why? ♥♥♥♥ing, I don't know, they're evil and they're breaking into your castle or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anyway, it's basically like a 3D tower-defense where you play as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a crossbow who can put traps in places to mercilessly slaughter all the orcs. You gotta make sure they don't all get through, or else you'll lose, or if you're like me, if one gets through, then you gotta start over because that's prevented you from getting the highest possible score. In all seriousness though, this is really fun game, and if you can catch it on sale, consider yourself lucky.			",203,47,4,22,12,2,14

												Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre. 8/10			",130,11,3,10,1,0,13

												Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.Technically: the game is a fantasy / medievial ""tower"" defence + third person ""shoot everything that survived trap lines"", 30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable 20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay, nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay, challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,Gameplay notes: The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,  The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave, Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line, Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff, Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast, Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them, During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade. Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story. Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps, No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2), It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy. The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad.  Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.  His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity. The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage. Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall).  Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one). The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.General info OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle /  dungeons.

They should've made it auto so you can just press on. Not everyone is using game pads. -) Having passive skills or upgrade for personal improvement would've been amazing but there was no such thing.

												I didn't expect to have as much fun with this game as I did, but it is a really fulfilling game. I got this one sale for something insanely cheap, and kept in in my library for a long time before I even got to play it. I'm sad I didn't boot it up until now. The game is a mix between a third person shooter (although there is a melee weapon) and some tower defense/strategy elements. As you successfully defend each level, you'll be able to unlock new magic/defenses/units/passive buffs and it is all really rewarding in the end. I would love it if this game was multiplayer, but even still in its current form, it is a blast to play around with.			",87,20,1,16,3,0,8

												I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed)Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense 9/10 in my bookThe only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue			",77,9,0,13,10,2,28

												Orcs Must Die! is one of the most enjoyable games I've played this year. The combination of tower defence and third person combat gives a perfect mix of strategy and fast paced action. There's an interesting variety of enemies and traps which allows for good tactical depth. Some traps seem weak by themselves, but when combined with other traps, prove to be very effective. The map layouts are filled with opportunities to take advantage of, such as chokepoints and lava pits, and then you can use your avatar to plug the gaps in your defences. The hard rock background music adds to the intensity, and there's a nice Plants vs Zombies style sense of humour. There are hours of fun here even after finishing the campaign, as you can try to complete the maps on higher difficulties or go for 5 star ratings and high scores. The low purchase price equals great value for money. Its also very stable and bug free. Buy this game NOW.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												An action tower defense game. Because the player is actively involved in the action of the game, via setting traps and using weapons/spells, this game is actually fun compared to all those boring tower defense flash games and the like. The traps are mostly all useful in some way, allowing for players to be creative with them. Highly recommended to all, because killing orcs is just to much fun in this game.			",124,11,0,7,6,1,21

												Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.

												Veridict: 9.0The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a ""tower defense guy"", then this title is a must have.Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.			",69,23,3,9,7,1,5

												How I got this game? It was on sale and I am sucker for sales. But still it is my personal best buy. Fun, addictive, constantly returning for more. Playing levels over, and over for one more skull, for using new traps on old levels, for finding more ways of stomping squishi `umans. I mean, ergh, stupid orcs. The best thing is you can play it for 15 minutes or for hours at the time depending of your own time scedule. THIS IS the great stres relase game. The commentaries of your character are always funny, and give him personality. which brakes the usual stereotypes in games, which is refreshing. GREAT FUN, WHAT SHOULD YOU ASK MORE FROM GAME? nothing, THATS RIGHT. You squishi ` umies...			",159,47,1,37,21,4,62

												Orcs Must Die! (OMD!) is an absolutely fantastic addition from the indie developer, Robot Entertainment. It's a game that blends third-person action with tower-defense strategy. Casual and hardcore players alike should be drawn to OMD! given its uniqueness, exciting gameplay and its corky sense of humor.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												This hate-speech-disguised-as-tower-defense is just another example of anti-orc racism to add to the ever-growing pile. The orcs as portrayed in-game are dull and dimwitted creatures who walk straight into spike pits right after seeing their fellows impaled before their very eyes, a disgustingly prejudiced parody of these noble souls. Additionally, you play a single human against waves of orcs, a design decision that encourages speciesist imperialism in a decidedly unsubtle way.But I'm sure you'll agree the gameplay's a lot of fun, right Adolf?

												The name of the game is defend teleportation rifts from onslaughts of hundreds of orcs with hilarious lines. You can do this with several weapons, spells and strategically placed traps, all of which are unlocked one by one for completing each of 24 different levels. While the game probably won't keep you glued for hours at a time due to its repetitive nature, it's at least 8 hours in length or more if you hope to achieve 5 stars (or skulls in this case) on every map to get the most out of your trap upgrades. I for one love traps and defensive structures in games, so needless to say, it got all the more amusing watching my traps grow to an un-escapeable nature by the last few waves of growing orc numbers and other varying monster types. It's great casual fun with a nice challenge and I reccomend it to anyone, as long as you can get past the fact that the options menu is quite limited. Oh, and no re-bindable keys. For shame!

												Orcs Must Die is a drama of apocalyptic dimensions. You’ll run around killing them with a mixture of clever traps and third person shooting but this tower defense game is really the story of the poor Orcs that you decimate. Every Orc’s story is told with a hallucinatory intensity, whether they were tossed off a cliff by a spring, slowed by tar before being perforated by poison arrows, burned to a crisp by ground based fire traps, or stabbed to death by the merciless protagonist. Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life.I can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself.  Orcs must die has turned me into a better person. As a result of this game I’ve decided to clean up my act. I will no longer leave spike traps on the floor lest my future offspring trigger them. Also, I will try being friendly with strangers rather than freezing and shattering them.   ",380,53,11,47,48,1,97

When I went back to play it, it felt like a new game again because I was able to become more creative with devising new trap set-ups. Simply put, this is easily a very enjoyable game that we can keep going back to from time to time until the sequel comes out!Dear Wife:Strategy is the key to winning this game. It invites you to be creative and rewards you with being efficient. Unfortunately, murdering thousands of orcs may not be your cup of tea, so to speak. We’ll definitely pass this one.My Last Thoughts: KEPT. I allowed it to stay in my hard drive until the sequel came out.IMPRESSED.

One downside is the highly sensitive mouse scroll speed, which I still don't know how to reduce. However, you soon get used to it and it doesn't become a hindrance. The graphics and designs are amazing; the audio and voice acting are outstanding; and the game mechanics (level design and weapon design) are dynamic and intuitive. Some players may find it easy - however this is a thoroughly enjoyable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game! This is basically a tower defense + third person shooter, similar to Sanctum, but with a much better sense of humor and style, and doesn't give me motion sickness. Within the first five minutes of playing, I quickly felt inclined to play through the rest, which is a rare experience these days. There's a good progression, as the game starts to get noticeably harder in the final levels. There is a nightmare difficulty once you beat the game on normal, for an even harder challenge. Every level you're presented with a new trap or item, but I found myself not using most of them, having tried them out and finding them less effective than existing gear. Since every level offers up to 5 stars, replay is fairly good for those striving for the most reward out of each level.Well worth the asking price, especially on a sale. I hear the recently released sequel is even better, so I look forward to that.			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												Orcs Must Die! Is one of my favorite games to be honest! This game is filled with humor and has a really nice gameplay. The only drawback is that it's a pure solo game. Something which it's sequel Orcs Must Die! 2 remedies! you take the role of a warmage, protecting the world from invading hordes of Orcs, Gnolls, Ogres and other creatures wishing to enter our world through magical rifts. The story-line is actually quite nice. If you enjoy tower defense games then chances are good that you'll enjoy this game as well!			",323,111,16,29,43,4,72

												I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!			",241,35,5,14,10,1,32

It's also not DLC infested like dungeon defenders.Only complaint could be the lack of CO-OP but then again, orcs must die 2 is right around the corner. Can't wait for it.This game is more action oriented than Dungeon Defenders, so you're contanstly doing something.This game offers many traps and 3 different difficulties. And yes, the hard mode is hard. Not impossible though.One of the best tower-defense i've ever played.Overall: 8.5/10			",276,32,5,22,21,2,23

												Oh yes! This game's atmosphere is awesome, never has killing hords of orcs felt better than in this game. While you are busy killing waves of orcs, a pretty good soundtrack will play in the background, which gets you hyped up for the coming battle. Prepare for one hell of battles, if you can't kill Orcs because they look cute, than you are going to easily fail this game, the difficulty in the game is really high and only the toughest players will make it to the end.With a little plot, which consides of 4 ""Cutscenes"" this game will keep you excited for the next levels, however be warned that the lines get easily repetive, it helps to only play 3-4 levels a day maximum, to enjoy the game at it fullest.The big bad thing about this game is that it doesn't have any multiplayer, but the sequell (Ors must die 2) has one, this game seems to have as far as I know the better SinglePlayer out of the two ""Orcs Must Die!"" games.Its defintely a fun experience.

												Orcs Must Die is a tower defens / shooter video game.I'm personal really big fan of this games.You not only try to defens yourself and the portal with traps and towers.Because you have the option to fight your own.Charcter has a small amount of upgrades and new weapons to unlock and choice.It's has a very big number of challanges to complete to clear the full game.Very nice to play alone.. and alone because there is no freaking multiplayer... for this buy part 2.Easy to control video game and playing it with a controller plays very nice.No co-op multiplay still.. a must have game for the tower defense / shooter lovers.I give this game a 8/10.

												It's tough to talk about this after having played 2, but here goes.I enjoyed this game enough when I first played it.  Some of the later levels get tough, and there are really only a few viable traps/weapon combos, but it works out.  There isn't a lot that I would say is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is more than I can say for 2, but there also isn't much challenge, either.  Nightmare mode isn't necessarily hard, it just removes the strategy part of the game.  You're not given time to think/analyze/change placements, really.  I mean, yeah, that's hard, but it's also not really upping the difficulty in anyway.  Of course, maybe that's the best way to increase difficulty in a strategy game: removing much chance to strategize.There is, believe it or not, a story to this game.  I wasn't really aware of it for a while, but it's totally there and you might miss it if you're not paying attention.One quip I have is that things get redundant quickly, but whatcha gon' do.It's an alright game, good even, if a little stale/boring/dry at times.  Like I've indicated elsewhere, though, Two is an improvement in every way, from the interface to map design.  The addition of co-op was a much needed boost to OMD as well.If you skip this one you're not necessarily missing much.  A lot of the traps/dialogue/maps are carried over into two.  Still, this was an alright game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What you need to know about this game:It's a mix between third Person Shooter and Tower Defence game, where you are up agains a army waves apon waves of orcs and other creatures...The music is really good the grafics are cartoonie but well done, and the humor of the game is simply brilliant! (you get alot of 1 liners while playing the game) and the game have an insane amout of replayability, especially if you are the kind of person that loves to complete a map ""perfectly"" like me (a perfectionist) at that point the game becomes more of a puzzle game when you try and figure out how you can kill all the enemies in the most cost efficient way possible and even if you aren't a perfectionist the game is still well worth its price if you ask me.I highly recommend this game :)			",257,18,6,20,22,4,26

												The tower defense genre has always been evolving over the years and seeing FPS games now entering this arena made me nervous at first , but after letting sanctum slip by I thought I would try this instead and......WOW!Frantic gameplay that really makes you use the noggin about what types of traps should go where and how to lure the orcs into them.Great level design and colorful crisp graphics.The arrogant none-too-bright d-bag protagonist made me laugh out loud at times and the story was cute.For the  $5 I spent (including all the DLC) I'd say I got one hell of a deal here , considering I would have paid full price had I known just how much fun this is.If I had to rate it : 8.5/10			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												This review was written after I beat the game.Fun and reasonably challenging. The dialogue, voice acting, and story, though sparse, are pretty funny, too. Each level is really a puzzle to be solved - there's not necesarilly a ""correct"" solution for how to place your traps, but there's ""aha"" moments when you discover a feature of the level that makes a certain setup very effective. The fact that you get to control a hero makes the gameplay much more fun - you can have a big impact on the enemy waves with skilled shooting and use of the various magic spells.There's plenty of replayability in competing on the leaderboards or among your friends for a high score.My one major complaint is that several of the levels have a split design where you can't force all of the enemies through one choke point, so you have to split up your attention between them or set up lots of traps and hope they're working well enough. It's kind of annoying to mentally deal with this and spend time running back and forth. I understand the point of the game is to be mentally challenging, but this task is more mentally exhausting than it is fun.I also don't like that you aren't told in advance exactly what enemies will be coming through which doors before each round. If you want to go for really good scores, it's just an unnecesarry and un-fun memorization tax upon you to remember each wave.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.

												Orcs Must Die! is a mix of tower defense and a third person ""shooter"".Singleplayer onlyGraphics:     5/10The textures are quite simple. I know the game was intended to look like a cartoon, but if the developers added a few more details and colors, the game would look much better. Visually I like most of the enemies, but some of them have a truly awful design. For example: The animations of the dragon-like, winged ""things"" (enemies) fluttering in the air are far too static and the textures are not more than mediocre. The particle effects are very fitting for the game. The traps are well made, but in my opinion the look of the ""Shock Zapper"" trap doesn't fit its function. I suppose that's a matter of taste though. The details of the map are quite low, but this provides a certain overview that the game needs in order to keep the building site highly visible. I rate the graphics of the game as moderate.Sounds:     8/10They really did a good job here. The background music fits perfectly and enhances the game's quality a lot. The trap sounds are amusing and adequate. The only thing I really miss are enemy sounds. Yes, there are enemy sounds, but you will hear them quite rarely. With the orcs being silent you can't really tell when they appear behind you. It may not be that important because the developers added a minimap, but that's a missed opportunity to make the game a little bit better.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10Both killing orcs with your weapon and with the traps is a lot of fun. The developers offer you a nice arsenal to protect the magical rifts. Spike traps, shocker, mushrooms, floor scorchers, archers and much more will help you slaying the orcs. The only thing what I really miss are really interesting weapons besides the crossbow and the alchemist bombs. The controls are easy to handle and building traps is no trouble at all.Level design:     5/10On the one hand the developers built some well structured tower defense maps (which isn't that hard I guess), on the other hand they really missed to add more details. You have the same wall and floor colors in almost every level. I would say you could rebuild those levels in minecraft with a good texture pack and it would look almost the same.Enemies/AI:     4/10The AI is - what a surprise - really poor. But I honestly didn't expect a complex AI from a tower defense game. So I will skip the rating for the AI and take a closer look at the enemy diversity. Besides the normal orcs there are big tough ogres, fast little kobolds, fast gnolls and flying creatures. The game doesn't actually need more enemies, but why did they just recycle the enemies and put a ""frost-"" ""fire-"" and ""armored-"" prefix to avoid designing more creatures?This kind of recycling is not necessary. 4/10.Story:     3/10Yes, it actually has a story. I was surprised. The hero is a sorcerer's apprentice who is now in charge of protecting the magic rifts (teleporters to the world) from the orcs because his master is dead who protected the magic rifts before. It's not quite a story, but a reason to fight against the orcs. I think I will give 3 points for the good attempt and the humor.Critic summary:     5.5/10Personal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]Well. It's a funny little game. No big title, but worth 5 bucks.I finished the game and I don't regret it.If you like tower defense games this might be an option.			",133,4,1,7,4,2,6

												Fun fact: I dislike Tower Defense games for being boring, repetitive and unpersonal. Oh, and boring, just to mention it again.Another fun fact: Orcs Must Die is NOT a tower defense game, even though it could easily be mistaken for one. But I would rather consider it a 'Tactical Defense TPS'. You're not a commander building towers, you're a guy building traps which are meant to aid you in wrecking Orcs. Lots of them. And boy, it's fun.Let's begin with the art style and sound. Both are fluent, coherent and quite fine. I won't say superb, because the game obviously is neither an AAA title nor top-actual, but it's well above what would be necessary as a minimum.A big point of the game is it's humor, that clearly hit my favour. Whether it's Orc's philosophing and quoting famous memes, or the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-charming protagonist, or his even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologues, the game makes you chuckle. Whilst orc's get gibbed left and right.Which is literally all this game is about: Killing orcs in the most fashionable/efficient/hilarious way possible. You got a wide array of different traps, weapons and champions at your disposal, and often the level'S themselves have special environmental hazards, high bridges ideal to kick orcs off from, lava pits...Even as an enemy of TDGs, the game was great to play.Which leads us to it'S only downside: 'was'. The game is terribly short. I've beaten the entire campaign + bonus missions at this point, with a perfect completion on about 75% of all levels (many of those on first try). Yes, there is a 'Nightmare' difficulty, but I'm not sure whether I will go for that or rather switch to the sequel ofthis game instead.But hey, it's a budget game,so we can't exspect 40h playtime, can we?Result: 8/10 Solid and extremely satisfying way to waste time. ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A variation of tower defense where you have to place traps to defend cores from invading monsters. While there's lots of toys (with new ones being thrown at you every level), some get left in the dust/unused (boom barrel, steam trap), while others get progressively more broken as the game goes on (archers, paladins, decoys). My biggest complaint is it's missing the stat tracking most tower defenses have to help you maximize your gold usage,  leaving you to guesswork if your traps are laid out properly. The maps are uniquely constructed, often requiring specific tactics to clear effectively, making each map tense and engaging. About a third of your arsenal are weapons for your character which keeps you in the action most of the time, unlike most games in this genre.With 24 maps you're looking at a sizable tower defense game with plenty of crossbow-twitching, fireball-slinging, ice-shattering orc carnage.

												When I play Orcs I feel my iq plummet like TV viewership around election time. Building killboxes then listening to the orcs scream in pain brings tears to my eyes as I laugh at their terminal one-liners.I am a sick sick man.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun defence game where you get to kill Orcs! You unlock new traps and depending on your rating you can upgrade traps to be even more devestating. I highly recommend to anyone who wants a little fun with this game, though be very careful with the upgrades at the later levels can be really daunting.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Great physics game that gets progressively harder in single player tower defense action. Weilding your crossbow, you fight a army of orcs attempting to survive them and find out what is happening. Owning this game and the second gives you classic levels in the first one as well. Recommend if you get the second orcs must die for the complete story and extra levels with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Orcs Must Die is easily my favorite downloadable title for 2011. Why? Because it takes classic tower defense and makes something new, innovative, and fun out of it. The game blends third person action with tower defense strategy creating a very unique experience. The game is very well designed on that regard, meaning that it is impossible to beat a level using only traps or only spells (you must use both). You play as a War Mage able to use spells and weapons to stop the Orcs from entering the Rift. You also have the ability to lay traps throughout the environment. Each trap is uniquely designed and offers different gameplay elements. Some examples of traps are tar traps to slow enemies, swinging maces, spike traps, arrow wall traps, etc. You play a good amount of levels progressing through a very simple but entertaining storyline. Overall, Orcs Must Die offers a very new and unique experience for Tower Defense fans. To put it simply, if you like tower defense, GET THIS GAME!			",127,15,2,10,3,0,8

												Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is ""Orcs Must Die!"" It's not ""Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime"" or ""Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense"" or ""Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War"" or anything like that. Replace ""Orcs"" with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

												I am not a fan of tower defense games, but this game (and it's sequel) give a refreshing spin on the genre. It combines 3rd person shooter with tower defense. This allows you to actively participate in the defense. You'll be shooting down enemies while managing your defenses.The level design gives you enough choice to try out different tactics. Sometimes there is one obvious tactic. Other times you have to try out different combos. Even though not all traps are as powerful/balanced, you can't always use the same traps. This gives enough variation through out the game.Orcs Must Die 2 adds a few new features:+ Co-op+ Endless Mode+ New playable class (mage)+ More customization			",462,228,16,110,41,3,100

												Game with the best tutorial in history!  ""Hm... How does this trap work?"" No problem at all! Before you start  phase you get to see exactly how the trap works:  1) trap  2) orc 3) trap + orc= burned/slashed/thrown in air  The only bad thing for me is that the orcs just mindlesly run around following same patern.

												Great third person tower defense game for the price!As a big fan of tower defense games as well as fantasy action games this one really stood out to me. The game not only feels smooth to play but manages to maintain a good pace throughout the levels, adding different towers and weapons to your arsenal along the way. For anyone looking for a funny, fast-paced tower defense game to pass the time, I recommend checking this one out.			",184,30,4,68,36,2,71

												A unique twist of the Tower Defense genre of games using traps instead of towers and 3rd person action. You are encouraged to use a crazy mix of traps and spells to rack up ridiculous combos and kill streaks. With 24 Levels, plenty of trap, weapon and spells, 3 upgrade trees and a lot of orcs and other nasties to slay, for $14.99 you cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.			",560,52,2,47,11,0,25
