												I had heard about this game previously mainly because it is a Resident Evil 4 clone (or as some call it, Resident Evil Boat or Resident Evil 4 Lite). This is not too surprising when you consider that the studio that made it, Darkworks', previous horror game before this was Alone in the Dark: New Nightmare, another Resident Evil-clone game. In fact, the studio seems to have this big thing for horror, as they have released six games in the last 15 years, and half of them are horror titles (the newest one they released was I Am Alive). Cold Fear plays like possibly the truest form of new Resident Evil meets old Resident Evil I have seen. The game switches up between a Resident Evil 4-style camera (when you're aiming, during certain gameplay segments), and fixed camera angles (ala' old-school Resident Evil). Assuming you aren't horrible with fixed-camera angle controls, the transitions were done pretty well and weren't nearly as disorienting as I thought they might be. They were handled and placed well in my opinion. A few good subtle scares, mixed with shoot-shoot, bang-bang, but with some limited ammo edge (though not extensively). And while it isn't the prettiest game around (even back for when it came out in 2005) it is not a bad-looking game, and had a few special effects throughout I thought were pretty ace.The audio was also pretty nice. The voice acting was surprisingly okay to good, the music fit the mood perfectly with a few rather unnerving tracks, and the sounds in the environment did a lot to help build up the couple of locations that appear in the game.I also have to mention now that I love ocean settings, and though Resident Evil Revelations most recently took place on a ship in the RE universe, this game handled its ocean setting much better I feel. They included things like furniture sliding around based on the turn of the ship (yes, the ship occasionally will churn itself back and forth), waves that sweep up onto the ship decks you have to watch out for or else they might sweep you away, actually pretty good rain effects, Some slight sea-fairing mist in a few places... The setting felt a lot more believable and more oceanic, which is good in my eyes.Probably the single most surprising elements for me was how interested I got into the story. Not so much the character drama (which there's a bit of, and not many of the characters are that-well fleshed out) but the story told in the files in the game. While it wasn't mind-boggling and there wasn't any twists to be found, I found the background story and papers about the monsters and people who were here immensely interesting, probably the most interested I'd been in a horror games files in a long while. There was one file towards the end of the game that was a bit stupidly long, but they were mostly well-lengthed as well. Unfortunately the game has one of the most disappointing endings I've experienced in a while as well.The combat in the game felt a bit like a poor-man's Resident Evil. It was serviceable and fun, but not anywhere near RE or Dead Space levels, though I must give credit that a lot of the monsters were rather original for this type of game. What is unfortunate is that some of them were almost hilariously cheap. The lesser 'cheap' enemy of the two I refer too is actually one of the main enemies in the game, which is this parasite thing that kind of looks like a starfish with extendable limbs. Ala' RE4, these things sometimes pop out of enemies when you kill them (they make a distinctive chirping sound). What is cheap about them is how ♥♥♥♥ing tiny they are, and how stupidly long their reach is. They can crawl on walls and ceilings, and can be hard to spot, but from several meters away (like, the length of five grown men from head to toe) they can extend their limbs to attach onto you and start rapidly draining your health away. They won't let go until you either get out of their range, or kill them, and they can drain health fast. And they almost never appear alone, they usually have a pack of themselves around.The second annoyance, and the biggest gripe for me in the game, is an enemy takes on the form of a dog-like thing. He appears in the second half of the game, and HE IS CHEAP. This enemy can crawl on ceilings, usually appears in really dark locations (where you can only see its eyes), can crawl into vents and appear elsewhere (this was before Dead Space, so wasn't inspired by that), and is the fastest enemy in the game. This would all be fine, EXCEPT when the enemy gets two meters close to you it will ALWAYS, ALWAYS trigger a one-hit kill move. There is a chance to avoid it with a REALLY quick QTE, but it's hard, and this enemy does this so ♥♥♥♥ing much, and it doesn't even make sense as the attack takes about 2-3 seconds to do, which would be enough time to get away from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the moment he triggers it you're locked into an animation with him and can't move. You don't face many in the game, but god dang it, they killed me more than anything.And it wouldn't be as bad, but the saving system in this game only happens at story intervals. Sometimes you'll go long segments of gameplay without a saving point, sometimes you'll get a save point almost immediately after the last one. Typically appear around cutscenes, but think something more Resident Evil 1 or 4-ish would of worked better here, especially as you do some backtracking in this game (like the older Resident Evils).But outside of my complaints above, I actually really enjoyed the game. Some of the enemies were really interesting (and most pretty fair), some of the scenarios and scares were actually pretty well-done. It was a pretty good length, and while a few rough edges, I would say the game was a pretty decent knock-off, worth it for those who like this sort of style of horror game. It has an action-survival focus, but it was scarier than any recent Resident Evil game I can recall. And like a lot of good horror games from yesteryear, and though I couldn't say it's a 'great' game, I think it's a good game that is worth it for anyone who is interested in this type of thing. It's well-priced for what it provides, and I honestly do think it's a shame this game never got a follow-up.But it also reminded me of how I actually miss the days of games like these being circulated. Horror games have never stopped circulating with clones (just look at all those Slender, Amnesia, and Dear Esther clones out there), but game's like this, maybe not amazing or groundbreaking, but competent and entertaining B-tier games that have a bit of heart in their soulless ripping-off methods and some twists to everything to make it their own... A reminder why the middle-tier game almost being non-existent these days is so disappointing. Even with the horror genre on the up-rise again, it doesn't seem like these type of games will be continuing anytime soon.But modern sentimental feelings aside, I think this type of game might be more appreciated now as it was really one of the last of its kind before developers decided that the horror genre was dead and that middle-tier games are a dying breed. I'm even impressed to say that Resident Evil Revelations, which I thought was a pretty good game, is at ends with me on Cold Fear, as I feel Revelations does some things better, while Cold Fear does other things that tops it at times.Tl;Dr: I played a boat with zombies on it. Starfish are ♥♥♥♥♥es, and I am sentimental about B-tier and horror games like this. Spare the time to give the game a good checking out if this type of thing is up your alley, though some frustrations do await.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cold Fear Review by Mike KnightAtmospherically, Cold Fear is an enjoyable (and sometimes quite scary) action game. While Cold Fear does not exactly establish itself as a high-quality survival horror game, the involved story and occasional interesting gameplay element make Cold Fear worth playing, and there are Zombies.The GameIn Cold Fear, you play as Tom Hansen, a US Coast Guard officer who has been sent to investigate a mysterious Russian frigate on a windy and stormy night in the middle of the ocean. You find out early on that the boat is occupied not merely by hostile Russian soldiers, of which there are plenty, but also by alien creatures that feed on the humans and provide a severe threat from both inside and outside their host bodies. Your investigation leads you to a few friendly faces and many threatening ones as you uncover the mystery of the ship and its lethal cargo.The perspective is third person, with the ability to go into a first-person aiming mode through which you can freely guide your view. Although the fixed camera gives a wider glimpse of the scene, it's not easy to keep fluid control when going back and forth between cameras, which is a problem as you try to maneuver around the boat and take out the enemies you encounter along the way. Additional controls let you crouch, run, and scroll quickly through weapons, which is slightly more intuitive in the PS2 version, thanks to the extra trigger buttons. However, since the weapon scroll is placed on the white/black buttons on the Xbox controller, the difference is not that severe. The PC version works well with the keys, though I doubt it will have any coltroller control, (unsupported at least.) Running brings up an onscreen meter that, when depleted, prohibits you from running anymore. This helps to make certain puzzles more challenging, and you will find yourself monitoring the meter frequently, but it does not detract from or add to the gameplay in any significant way.Because Cold Fear takes place in ocean-locked environments (and it looks very cool), the control scheme is affected by the movement of the waves. This is mostly noticeable when you are outside, and at times it looks like you're walking almost completely sideways, due to the volatile movement of the deck beneath you. This adversely impacts the controls, but the trade-off is a unique and interesting component of the gameplay. As you fight against the tossing of the boat, timing yourself to cross decks only when the waves are low, you encounter some of the most compelling aspects of Cold Fear. Unfortunately, the outside environments are not tapped to their fullest, and you'll spend the majority of the game, past the first hour, in generic indoor locations, though you do need to go outside once in a while.Your objective in Cold Fear is to discover the story behind the vessel's apparent destruction and the emergence of the nonhuman creatures upon it. Despite being a highly derivative story about a genetic experiment gone wrong, the relationship between characters is interesting, and the story is neat and simple. Most of the plot exploration is conveyed through notes that are littered about the environment and through dialogues with characters (for the short duration that the people on the boat other than Hansen manage to stay alive). The notes are well implemented, and they drive the story and reveal critical information about weapons, environmental objects, and enemies.Although you start off with merely a handgun, there are a number of different weapons to be found in the middle of the ocean, including a submachine gun, an AK-47, a speargun, a flamethrower, and a grenade launcher. The weapons are almost all equally effective, except for differences in power. The speargun is the only weapon that is not used explicitly for dealing damage, and when fired, it releases a gas that draws enemies near it. This is a great tactic to use in conjunction with one of the more explosive weapons such as the shotgun or grenade launcher. Otherwise, the objective of the game is to make headshots on all humanoid enemies, which can be exceedingly difficult as the enemies draw nearer to you. Fortunately, most of the weapons have either a laser sight or flashlight, which aids your precision. The point of the headshot is to conserve ammunition, although enemies will not die unless they are decapitated. This means that if you shoot an enemy anywhere other than in the head, and merely knock it down to the ground, you have a certain amount of time to run over and step on the head before the enemy gets back up and attacks you again.Many of the Zombies are possessed by Exocel Creatures, which are spidery beings that alternate between crawling on the floor and the ceiling before attempting to take possession of a human being by reaching out a long tendril into a human's mouth and then climbing inside. Outside of a host body, these exocels are fairly easy to destroy--usually one bullet sends them rolling up into a ball, and a second one takes them out--but given their flexibility and their penchant for appearing out of nowhere, including bodies you've just killed, they provide a formidable threat if not dealt with quickly. More advanced abominations of genetics appear later on, but with the more difficult enemies, it's sometimes easier to merely avoid confrontation and run along to the next room. If you choose to run, you'll find these creatures often jumping on your back. When this happens, you're given a button sequence to throw the enemy and try to achieve a critical hit. If you successfully land a critical hit, enemies are killed much more quickly than if you had gone about it the normal way. Because of this, it's sometimes tactically important to let Hansen be jumped by enemies, as long as you can throw them quickly.Other game tactics include using pieces of the environment to do the work for you. You can shoot explosive barrels, fire extinguishers, and different-colored valves to create an environmental trap for oncoming enemies. From time to time, you'll encounter a fight between two of the enemy species, and you can let them fight among themselves before you intervene. Environmental effects, such as laser beams and swinging obstacles, can often be used to pick off the less bright enemies, and the rocking of the boat will send a zombie or you overboard, if you're standing on the wrong side of a slippery surface.That's all good, but a significant drawback to the gameplay is the lack of an in-game map. Hansen declares early on that he is able to remember some Russian, so he can translate the signs on and around the doors if you look at them with enough reverence--but because of the similarity of the areas and the sheer number of open paths at any given moment, you'll spend a great deal of time backtracking and trying to recall exactly which path to take. There are clues here and there, such as new enemies and changes to the environment, but for the most part you're left to wander the boat and figure it out on your own. And wander you will, though there is lots to explore.The atmosphere's major saving grace is the music and sound effects. The music is dramatic and very flexible, changing with the mood as necessary. Although a couple of the tracks get repetitive and even slightly grating, for the most part the music does nothing but help the game. Likewise, the sound effects are appropriate to the environment, including the harsh creaking of the metal boat and the constant splashing of the waves upon the deck. I found this to be an excellent and very underrated game. Get it whilst you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great old school survivor horror shooter. It had so much potential to be much more but is held back by technical flaws. I must point out that it was quite revolutionary back when it was first released with its unique combat style. Pros:+ Great Atmosphere + Unique survival horror combat style (i'm aware RE4 was released first but they're a tad different)+ Marilyn Manson ending soundtrackCons:- Clunky controls that makes combat frustrating at times- Short game- Glitch that makes you waste ammo (at least on the pc version)- Stingy save points (but that's arguably old school for ya)- Disappointing last bossOverall, despite its flaws, it is still a fun game and worth the price here on steam. Fans of survival horror should give this game a shot. 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun survival-horror experience that brings me back to the good days of Resident Evil. What's even better is that it features two camera modes, one being Resident Evil 4's over-the-shoulder style, and the other being the classic single over-head camera angle from Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3. The game itself is fairly underrated, but it could have used more work. Either way, it's a good game for a good price and has an interesting story while borrowing some concepts from Resident Evil 4.My Rating: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cold Fear is an unashamedly old school survival horror game, so you should pretty much know whether you're interested in playing it or not. But I must say it's a pity that a game with such a realistic feel and a believable atmosphere suffers from several annoying problems, such as the lack of an in game mini-map or an inventory system, iffy controls and the inability to save your progress or use the health packs at will. Although it's almost copy-paste Resident Evil (which is good in my books) I can't really recommend it to anyone except to the genre fans and to those who can approach it with nostalgia.

												""Enough similarities to call it Dead Sea.""Cold Fear is a 2005 action-horror developed by Darkworks, a studio mostly notable for spending half a decade developing I Am Alive, then dying before the game was even released. Funny that a game called ""I Am Alive"" killed the studio.This game, however, is a fantastic game and you should play it.Blending fixed-camera angles and third-person shooting in not the most seamless manner (but still one that's way more fun to play than it has any right to be) and trudging around the whaler in Cold Fear is legitimately fun. Despite the fixed camera angles, it forgoes tank controls in favour of almost spritely 1:1 control.On one hand, this means that navigating the environment is fast - almost breakneck with your very generous sprint meter - it's responsive, and makes dodging/tactical movement viable. On the other hand, it does mean that Cold Fear is balanced towards the easier side, in the same sense that the Titanic was balanced towards the bottom of the sea.Except on Extreme, where enemies one hit kill you. Don't play on Extreme. It's short, but contains enough variety and pacing that this isn't by any means a bad thing - especially with its bargain bin price. You could get more out of it by replaying it on Extreme, but don't. Don't do that. You don't even get anything for it. 5 hours long, and another hour or so if you ignore my advice and get destroyed by the first enemies in the game.They will just shoot and insta-kill you, and there isn't THAT much mechanical depth.For the shooting from your end, there's a decent selection of weapons, all your bases covered. Nothing exciting, but only one is wholesale useless (flamethrower, of course, as if that weapon hasn't been burned enough) so what more could you ask for.Shooting your way through the ship, there's some fantastic environments to go through - all rainslick with some contextually impressive tech. It does get repetitive - most environments are some amalgamation of rust, metal, rain, and Russian, but the core art design is there and shines through. Following these environments, we've got a surprisingly experimental OST, all full of baby's cries and bike bells, and some SFX that gives the weapons a nice punch. Not Vlambeer's level of gun-wizardry, but enough to make them nice to use.The story is subpar. Like how a brick to the face is a subpar meal. Characters are completely forgettable - so much so, that I'm surprised they didn't go with the bald marine version of Tom Hansen they show off in the concept art. Dialogue is ""modern action"" tastelessness, plot threads are dropped - including a couple of major ones - the lore is one-note, and the climaxes are as marred by a distinct lack of boss battles as they are by missed opportunities. Bad writing doesn't stop Cold Fear from being what it is - a mechanically impressive action-horror game that delivers non-stop action instead of trying to be something it's not. All with some pretty visuals and a bargain-bin price. Horror may be a saturated genre these days, but Cold Fear is timeless. It's well worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd like to call this a survival horror game but its just a horror, yeah theirs monsters in claustrophobia areas that sometimes jump at you but... My playthrough I was feeling like Rambo due to all the ammo I was carrying, The amount of weapons you end up with at the oil rig is a bit ridiculous. If you ever run out of AK ammo just switch to the pistol its a powerful sidearm and in a few kills you'd have enough ammo for the AK again. There are other weapons like the hand held grenade launcher and flamethrower but you will not have to use them, honestly stick to the handgun, AK and shotgun and your sorted. The Story is basic and bland some things are unexplainable but since this released in 2005 I'll let it slide. The controls for the most part are responsive the only thing that was pi$$ing me off was the aiming, it was handy to move and shoot but it just felt clunky and unresponsive before you play this game I recommend you set your mouse dpi higher to combat this.The save system is a bit weird you can only save at the beginning of a chapter (which is considered a mission in this game) and if you die that acts as your checkpoint as well, but to be fair a chapter to another chapter is fairly short. The game uses a fixed camera angle and 3rd person camera and does a pretty decent job of knowing when its required and not needed.Summary:Its good for the asking price but don't expect much survival horror with the large amount of ammo kicking around, I know its a Russian ship/oil rig but come on. My advise find a way to unlock hard mode from the beginning ammo should be more scarce I hope...Pros:+Balanced AI+Minor Glitches+Various enemies+Fair pacing up until the oil rig+Manages to capture some horror+Holds up well on the PC for a 2005 gameCons:-Restocking Ammo at armory-To much ammo-Dodgy Aiming-Various enemies only appear near the end of the game-Dat end boss			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game reminds me of a good Roger Corman film, where despite of the kindergarden dialogue and having more cliches than Commando and Rambo combined, you manage to have lots of fun with it. Just as Dead Space, this game screams ""RE-inspired,clone,fanfiction whatever"" all over it, mixing the RE 4 over-the-shoulder mechanics with the fixed angle of older RE titles (definitely better than RE 6 and scarier than RE 5). So, I recommend this game because of:+ Enjoyable survival horror.+ Interesting story. + Good lore.+ Engaging atmosphere.+ Excellent use of environmental hazards (at least in the first half of the game).+ Good use of combat mechanics.What you might not like/My nitpicking:- Unresponsive mouse. Whenever this glitch shows it can definitely be a pain in the a$$ because enemies will bvtt♥♥♥♥ you while you move your mouse 2 miles just to move the cursor 2 pixels. Fortunately, you might not experience this.- Short story.- Terrible dialogue.- Cutscenes feel rushed.- A wide variety of enemies that by today standards you might find way generic. Certain types of enemies are underused.- Too many weapons. From the six weapons I can remember I found myself using less than a half of them throughout the game.SPECIAL ADVISE:* While I did not have any of these, several users have raised concern over a couple of issues that they experienced with the game.These being a launch error and a graphics mold glitch that makes the game look like you're playing Sin City: Mutant Undead Boat Edition. As I said, I didnt experience these issues as well as many other owners and you can find the solution for these in the community boards. So, while certainly there are lots of nitpicking, you can find a very enjoyable game in this criminally overlooked little gem. If you're a fan of survival horror, cheesiness, B movies, Syfy Channel or good ol' RE games, this is definitely a must buy. Did I mention that it's better than RE 6? ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you added a map to this game, it would actually be very good.  Not BRILLIANT, perhaps...certainly not ""perfect""...but very good.  As it is, you require an almost-photographic memory to work out where you're supposed to go next, even though you've probably been there a few times before.  Could this have anything to do with the fact that the first half of the game takes place on a cargo ship and the second half on an oil rig, so y'know, much of the scenery looks much the same?  Forgive me for not remembering where the ""upper corridor next to the secondary science lab"" is, 'cause I've seen a few of those of late, I swear to God.  Yessiree, a map would have be nice.  Or some of those more modern, new-fangled, Bioshock-y arrows pointing you in precisely the direction you need to go, failing that.  But a map...even better.  Heck, the very first Resident Evil had one of those, and this game certainly doesn't go out of it's way to not rip off virtually every OTHER aspect of that classic game, so...again, a map?  Too much to ask?!   There's a few other problems, too...though ones which are perhaps SLIGHTLY more forgivable, given the era this is from.  The save points are kinda crap (it chooses them for you, sometimes miles apart from each other), some of the aiming with the laser sight on your guns is kinda abominable (gotta love them stairs), and the plot is as bizarre as bat guano.  Having said all this, though...it's a defiantly ""old-school"" survival horror game, and anyone who enjoyed Resident Evil 1 through 4 is sure to find it a virtual must-play, if for no reason other than the fact that games like this are pretty hard to find, and how many times CAN you play those first four Resident Evils before you tire of them completely (the answer in my case being MANY times, but there's still a limit, even for yours truly).     Sincerely, there's a lot to love about this game - the atmospheric rain/wind/rocking boat effects are particularly impressive - and, unfortunately, a few things to truly detest.  But I got past them.  And so will you, if you're the kind of person I just described.  JUST DON'T EXPECT A ♥♥♥♥ING MAP, AND YOU'LL BE FINE!!  AAARGH!!!Verdict: 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: RE4 survival horror type of game with good AI and atmosphere. Cons: A game with great potential but developers blew it away with crappy controls and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera positioning. There is no map which means you to memorize key locations otherwise you'll just end up getting lost and running in circles which is very frustrating. Infrequent auto-save point and locations which means you have to survive for another 5 to 10 minutes before you reach to the next auto save point. Lastly, the characters and storyline are well filled with cliches. Score: 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The weather, water and atmospheric effects are very well rendered and smooth. The shadows are clever - many times I turned to fire on a bundle of ropes or a gas cylinder that looked like an attacking beastie. The sound is also cleverly designed - door hinges sound suspiciously like the howling of some of the creatures, things go bump in the night due to the ship rolling, caged beasts bang on doors, walls, etc. The creatures themselves are well rendered - if they get up and close, you can see every deformation, every bulbous growth, etc. Altogether, this makes for an immersing environment, and - at the beginning, at least - quite a tense one.While the art is excellent, the level design is mediocre at best. It was ambitious to have a large chunk of a game like this on a relatively small ship, but as it turns out, it may have been a bit TOO ambitious. While the art and environment are excellent and immersive, there are many points one re-encounters, crosses over, and at many points, objectives are simply names of places you haven't been yet, so you rather stumble around aimlessly hoping to hit what you're looking for instead of making clear progress or heading through a relatively fixed course. As with many other TPSs, the camera angle is fixed in most enclosed spaces, which makes it absolutely useless for exploring a room, moving through the room, or spotting/fighting enemies. This leads you to spend most of your time in the pseudo-FPS, ""over-the-shoulder"" aiming mode, so that you can actually see where you're going. Save points are pre-set. You can encounter some pretty stupid obstacles pretty far along beyond a save point and find yourself repeating 10-15 minutes of gameplay, sometimes more than once. That alone can be infuriating.

												A game sort of like Dead Space. Similiar style of gameplay as Dead Space, with unique twist in gameplay regarding the enviroment. In DS it's open space, in Cold Fear [what a silly tittle] it is sea during a powerful storm. So you have to adapt during fight to being splashed by waves that are hitting the deck and swaying of the ship from one side to the other holding onto the rail so you don't fall into the raging sea.Story is b-horror movie level, which suits the setting nicely and is not that stupid to stop you from playing. Soundtrack is great, unlike in DS here atmosphere actually works at some points. It' s an older game yet it still manages to look decent mainly thanks to the weather effects.If you're looking for a cheap yet enjoyable experience you might just have found what you're looking for.datwaveson			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay outside of a few small issues is spot on. You will find most of the things you had in Resident Evil 4 gameplay wise. Considering the two games were released very close to each other I think it's a coincidence that they have a lot of similiarites, but unfortunately Cold Fear is the underdog and it couldn't prove anyone the opposite. It may have a good enviroment with the ship rolling everywhere in the storm a dark, metallic station with no sign of escape and good gameplay, but what it lacks is anything memorable to come back for. We can write it off as an enjoyable game, since it is indeed one. But what it lacks is something iconic or unique. I mean, the story is very simple (kinda shocked that people see this plot as an interesting concept, but it may be me) and the characters are as common as they get. You can't build anything on that. It's like a B version of Resident Evil 4.The combined effect of Resident Evil 4 and the uncharacterized nature of Cold Fear lead to the catastrophic sales the game got, but ultimately didn't deserve. It's a very unfortunate, we could've had a great franchise now if they add a more ideas and develop the game a little bit more. So yeah, Cold Fear is remarkable for it's good use of gameplay mechanics, but falls short compared to other titles of the genre. It's a game worth trying out, but I can only pass it off as OK.

												A great game. I really enjoyed this. Similar to Resident Evil, it has those annoying camera angles that mess up your control over your character sometimes.But it only happens occasionally, and you soon get use to it.So what's to say. A matter of personal opinion on what you consider scary.This game has a few of those moment when you think something is about to happen THEN . . . !!!Nothing...So you relax, then when you feel safe again BAM! .. You crap your pants, fire bullets off into the darkness and swear at the game. haha.The environmental setup of this game is good. The Boat is hard as hell to aim on as the sea is rough. But you get a real feeling that you are on the boat. The rain splashing on the screen in droplets, blurred vision, its very immersive I find.Downside to this game, Resolution settings dont go very high.And its too short. There's a boat level and a oil rig level. I would have enjoyed a third.Otherwise, all is good! 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
