												MDK is a must own! MUST OOOOWWWNNN !!! The first time I saw this game was on a PC in a Tandy Electronics store in early 1997. lol, boy I tell you, I played it as much as I could. Which was only 15 mins. But when I had to leave, I knew I had to get away from games like Doom, Quake, Heretic, Descent, Blakestone 3D, Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D ... etc. These 3D platform shooters were the next big thing!The graphics amazed me back then. Now that I play it, I gotta admit it isn't as great as I had remembered, but the gameplay is incredibly fun that you'll pay no attention to the graphics. There’s this really cool slanting to the camera angle when you run left or right. I also find the parachute mechanism as integral and addictive to the gameplay as bullet time is in the Max Payne series.MDK is about 6 hours long. For the amount of content to make things interestingly non-repetitive, I'd say this was well laid out by the developers. Some people might think the game is short. And maybe it is by today's standards. But if I remember back to those days as a kid, if a game was fun, you'd replay it again. It was that simple. And I would gladly load MDK up every now and then just to blast around and have fun today. That's the way it should be!I can't even understand some of the pure genius of ideas in this game. Like I remember shooting this alien or whatever in the head and his eye popped! I shoot him in the nose and that got mashed. I mean like I shoot Ellis or Coach in the eyes in L4D2 and they don't pop ... you know what I mean? lol. Incredible detail and very imaginative game. Too much to explain. You have to play it to see it.The control scheme is a bit wonky. You have to remember this was at a time where using the mouse to look around on PC wasn't that common. But I personally don't find it a bother. There are some people that have created modern mouse configurations for this game. But I recommend to use the keyboard old-school with the mouse only for sniping. Having said that, this game would be very user-friendly with a controller.The music is pure awesomeness! It gives such great atmosphere. The sound effects like the gun shooting doesn’t get tiring.What I don't understand is why the Steam version of this game lacks the ending escape sequence movie clip followed by this French music video. You'll need to obtain MDKEND.FLC and MDKBZK.MVE and place them in the MDK/MISC/FLIC directory to view the ending like normal. Thank god for the Internet and Google search, this problem is easily remedied.The Steam overlay also doesn't work. So you'll need a program like Zeckensack's Glide Wrapper or nGlide. Apparently these programs also fixes wrongly displayed textures and ""windowboxing"" which the game defaults to.Overall despite nearing 2 decades old, MDK makes it into my top favourite games of all time. It is so refreshing that it makes me wonder why a lot of triple A titles of today that use laser technology to scan actors into the computer as 3D models, combined with motion capture, life like level designs and Hollywood-like plots fail to draw me in! I would give MDK a personal score of 93/100.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Steam release of MDK is a bit of a letdown. It inspired me to make a fan patch for the game since, not only does it not include any glide wrappers to make the game compatible with modern systems, it also missed a LOT of original content from the game such as cutscenes, artwork etc. Using my patch though you should be able to experience the game as it was meant to be. In my opinion MDK is a pretty awesome shooter. It's insanely easy to play (especially with a modern WASD+mouse control setup), easy to grasp and while the game is a bit short, it has an insane amount of variety in level designs and graphics, especially for its time when most shooters looked like brown and grey corridors (*cough*Quake*cough*) and the game also features more open arena-like spaces a lot. A DEFINING feature of the game is the sniper rifle which attaches to your head like a helmet. Back in the 90's, this must've been the FIRST shooter I remember that had a sniper weapon that felt as good and simple to use as this. And it zooms in without any kind of pixelation as well.The music is also stellar and composed by Tommy Tallarico who obviously took a lot of influence from Danny Elfman in his score for the game, using a lot of synthesizers mixed with rich orchestral sounds and themes. The soundtrack is as varied and whimsical at times as the game is and fits perfectly.Graphically the game ranges from being really colorful to having almost gothic HR Giger'esque designs, especially with the main protagonist. The low polygon count gives the game a very unique look though it uses a lot of very impressive graphical tricks for its time such as a world consisting entirely of mirrored surfaces that still looks awesome today.All in all, MDK, or Murder Death Kill as it's originally called, in my opinion is an underrated must-play title for all shooter fans.

												Great game just like I remember it except one HUGE problem... They completely cut out the ending! After you defeat the final boss the game just abruptly ends, no awesome song and cutsceen. Also the screenshots they showcase on the steam game page are all from the beta version of MDK and none of those are actual screenshots from the current game. I'm happy to see the game on steam but steam has a lot of cleaning up to do with this game.Edit: I hear that steam may have patched this problem with there being a lack of an ending so good on them! Still such a good game though!			",58,14,0,6,1,1,1

												An old classic (maybe a bit underrated) third person shooter. Thought its not very known, its a very cool game, with a good ammount of action, funny moments (The world's smallest nuclear bomb used to open doors through the game its a little gem) and big open locations. Unfortunately, the Steam version suffer of some bug and glitches, (quickly fixable thanks to the Fan Mod released that you can find it here, http://steamcommunity.com/app/38450/discussions/0/864973123467667345/ )  and a very bad controly system that even an almost total remap wont fix totally.SUMMARIZE. For the price on steam, its a worthy game to buy, that will give you a good ammount of playtime. Just remember that it will maybe require some fixes before it can be played properly.

												Well done Kurt!MDK is a fast third person shooter that puts you inside Kurt's remarkable coil suit to fight against aliens that are trying to conquer Earth. For that, you're equipped with an infinite-ammo chain gun and a sniper rifle, combined with a lot of items (nuclear bombs, did I mentioned that?!) that can be obtained along the game (I mean NUCLEAR BOMBS!). The campaign is linear, with six worlds to complete. It's a classic, tremendously funny. I still can enjoy it like I did in 1999.If you're not familiar with classic games, give it a try on a sale. Otherwise you probably already have it on your library. ;-)NOTE: The Steam version comes up with some bugs on newer systems (such as slowdowns and missing textures). There's a patch available that fix them all. ",137,3,6,1,2,0,2

MDK		*10/10This game is a Gem. Unfortunately its age always prevented me from trying to play it on modern systems, because I was sure it would give too many troubles because of old 3dfx compatibilities issues. I WAS SO WRONG. But not because there are no issues. Of course this is the classic ""old-game-released-forgotten-and-unsupported"" so as soon as I launched the game all I could see was the character and the skybox... No walls or enemies or items or other models... LUCKILY there's always the steam community ready to help, so you can found a Fan patch in the steam forums that will grant you a solid chance to play it with no more issues.So what about the game? This is a 3rd person Action-shooter with lots of innovative game mechanics and situations totally unseen before at the time. So you can move in 3rd person view, jump around platforms and stuff but you can also glide with a retractile parachute. You can go in 1st person view to use a sniper mode, where you can aim for headshots with classic bullets or, if you find them, you can use mortars or rockets, or auto-aiming bullets. Around the maps there are many tools and weapons you can grab, from the classic decoy to the smallest nuke in the world or the most interesting bomb (a bomb that dazes and attracts enemies before exploding). And this is a very small list.Another top mention goes for the innovative and often CRAZY level design which I can't describe at all except for the picasso room (even though maybe picasso isn't exactly the most suited artist for that room), and that still nowadays can't be found anywhere.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. This game can look like just a 3rd person action-shooter, but it adds often so many unique situations that make this game and incredibly original gem. Unique situations like the very beginning of each level, where you Literally dive from the sky down to the map avoiding the enemy radar to prevent them from shooting you, or the tunnel slipping sectons, the skating sections, Sniping positions and obviously the end of each level where you travel through a wormhole or whatever it is...MUSIC. It might look (or sound) underrated but I DAMN LOVE this soundtrack, it changes every ""room"" with small loops but they're great, they can sound epic, ominous, crazy or action-paced. And I know someone could expect a cheap quality music or composition, but not here. Not this time.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY. This release has compatibility issues on modern systems and since this game is really old it obviously isn't supported in any way. Luckily there's a fan patch in the steam community that can help a lot making the game playable to most systems with compatibility issues. DURABILITY. It's short, VERY short. Unfortunately it doesn't take much to be completed, just look at my play time. At least it's a little compensated by the absence of saving game except at the end of each level... As long as you don't apply the patch, because it adds the possibility to save anytime with F2... XD SAVE GAME. As I've just mentioned there's no chance to save the game except after you've completed the level. Luckily with the fan patch you can save with F2 anytime you want... XD GRAPHICS. I know, it's old and honestly I dont' care much. Actually I really like it because at the times it had lots of incredible effects, and was visually appealing. Actually I like a lot today as well and I personally believe it aged better than other games of the same era but I chose tu put it in the CONs because I'm a nostalgic player that lived this game's innovation, so another random guy might not love its look as I do because he never knew the game or is a new generation player.

												Yes.. it's definitly refreshing to play this game again after so many years.This is the very first game that offer mortal .. gernade.. and many different object interaction that's uncommon for FPS game at that time. Replaying this game after 20 years it feels quite a bit easier then what it was but it's still so much fun to zoom in and kills an alien that tries to taunt you miles and miles away.You play a ganiter that works for a madscience and work with a humanoid looking dogs to save humanity from an invasion.. Ya.. MDK = Murder Death Kill and it's so much fun ever after 20 years.Game difficulty is quite high compare to most other FPS because the controls are not easy to master. Doesn't matter if u use.. mouse. keyboard.. joystick or gamepad.. it's always a bit hard to manage the controls. But once u learn how to use it.. it's a very fun and rewarding game.The graphics cannot compare to modern day FPS but it's still quite ok for fans of this game. The music is still one of the best I ever experienced for FPS game.One thing you must take notice is that this game will need an unoffical pan patch to run properly with out any graphics glitch.7.5/10.. and play this.. to experience the sheer fun of Murder .. death.. kill.

												If not one of the very first PC games that brought in the 3D Third person shooter genre. A classic game that is very underrated by people who played other shooters like Doom II or Half-Life 1. You play as Kurt the guy in the tight black suit with a one handed arm chain gun. Your mission is to stop an alien race from invading a futuristic looking planet Earth. Cause mayhem with a variety of different weapons and go through obstacles and platforms to progress further into the game. The graphics are pretty old but if you are looking to enjoy playing a good classic video game without flashy graphics this maybe the game for you.			",22,2,1,0,1,1,0

												This is a cult classic and i still have the Cardboard Box, played it a ton back in the DOS days :)  I have strong nostalgia goggles for it so i would absolutely recommend playing this... probably not an objective opinion.  I don't know how this would hold up for somebody who has never played this before... i would guess not at all.  I really can't tell you if you would like this or not.  That said, i can not recommend buying it on Steam, you should probably buy it on GOG instead, it already comes with nGlide (3Dfx emulator compatibility thingy) over there, on Steam you have to patch that in yourself to make MDK work or download fanpatches or half the textures won't even show up.  There is no ""just install and play"" here, it is literally unplayable how Steam delivers it because most of the objects, including the world or the character are invisible.  It is a really OLD game so some fiddling with it is required... but if GOG already did the fiddling for us, why buy the unplayable release from Steam who can't be bothered to do those clicks for us?  Game is 30FPS, but that isn't a problem, it just looks like a old DOS game, not stuttery like console ports would (i'm very pedantic about 30FPS ... i even downvote things with 60FPS locks if my 144Hz screen isn't used to its fullest...).  There are big black bars around the picture (letterboxing) on a 1080p 16:9 screen.  The biggest hurdle are probably the awkward keyboard keybinds that you need to get used to first... or change.  Sorry, the nostalgia goggles do not outweigh the need to fiddle with stuff here, can't recommend the Steam release, go get the GOG version.  Of course you can make the Steam version work as well, with some effort, i just think we should not support Steam's total lack of quality control.			",192,9,9,25,8,0,25

												Extremely disappointing.  Doesn't work.This game does not render any sprites, nor the polygons in the enviornment.  You simply see the Skybox, and hear the sound effects as if the game was working.  That alone is enough reason not to buy it, but if you want more...* The music on the TitleScreen/Menus is different to what I rememeber, and so it didn't trigger any nostalgia.* And I've heard (but cannot confirm) that the Steam version of this game is missing the song that plays when you complete the game.

												MDK is a brilliant action game! The shooting feels good and the game is also quite hard at times. Although the graphics look dated, graphics don't make a game. Although it's not always clear were you're meant to go, and the shooting does get a little repetitive towards the end, the game isn't too long any way. As far as enemies go, there aren't really all that many different types, they are mostly re-skins. As for the level design, it can be confusing at times, but each level is vastly different from the last, which is good to see. Overall, I think this game is great, and you should try it out!

												This game features some mind-blowing art concepts for its time, best flash-action combat permitted by directx 1.0, unique acrobatics, catchy gun wielding, and the coolest sniper rifle sight ever. The sound tones coupled with the fitting background music set an immersive combat atmosphere. Lots of fun punk action great for training your reflexes. This no-nonsense game is just down-right cool. The downside is the patch you need to download before the game runs properly with Windows 10 without all the graphics glitches, one I got was from Alyxx, and even then my game breaks down near the end of level 3 despite several re-installations and game replays using different save files. A real gem from the 90s. This game seems to have inspired several later creations including Area 51 and Borderlands. Kinda puzzled why the new developer ridiculed the original product in MDK2 while coming up with something much inferior without that fine finish and attention to detail?			",24,11,1,1,16,0,4

												This game is all over the place....Part third person shooter, part adventure game, part abstract puzzle game, part platformer.This is a weird game with so many different ideas and designs put into it that it could've only been made in the 90's when experimental gaming was at its peak.

												MDK. Dated in todays's standards, it nonetheless manages to remain a fun and entertaining game. It's rather short, but the uniqueness of every level coupled with the surreal yet beautiful environments and high-tension gameplay makes this a classic. The controls might be a tad odd at first, but remapping them is easy and the game is pretty darn entertaining once you get the hang of things. What are you waiting for? GET IN ON THIS!

												Mmm. I remember my brother having this game and loving it back in the day, so I bought it super cheap on sale. The graphics for... well, I don't know what's supposed to be there, because it just looks like a big empty space that I can't move around in, right on the first level. Buyer beware. It may not work on your machine. It also seems to be one of those where if you tab out, the whole thing breaks, and Steam thinks it's still running, but it isn't. So. Yeah.			",94,19,0,37,6,0,7

												Really, just a fantastically fun third-person experience. Even though it's a very early example of the genre, MDK is fluid, smooth and imaginative... just fun to play, and the player sprite looks great. Good with mouse/keyboard or a controller.			",715,77,27,45,37,5,83

												The BEST game I have ever played!I played MDK with my brother for the first time in 1998 and it has always been my favourite of all games.I remember how I was using the controls for shooting and sniping and my brother was coordinating with the arrows, ah the memories!We usually spent 1-2 hours on a single level (there are 6 levels in total) and we enjoyed ourselves like never before, we managed to immerse into the game, to feel the thrill and the excitement of the main character...This game is old, yes, the graphics are not that great, but everything else is. It just is. A masterpiece.PSJust remember, if you get this game - download the Steam Game Patch made by Alyxx (http://steamcommunity.com/app/38450/discussions/0/864973123467667345/) as it fixes all the graphical issues that the game has on modern computers.

												While indeed yes, I played MDK in the past and I enjoyed it I have a few things to say about the game on newer PC's.Users with Windows 10 may experience issues with levels not displaying and even to the point of the characters not displaying as well the game experienced a major slow down while going into the display options.Someone may have to test it on Windows 7,8 and 8.1 to see if it works on there.Sound still works and the Camera behaves just as the character is there and is moving around.I can't say for sure if this is a issue with older display drivers or absent ones due to them being from the time that MDK was made and no longer supported and or avaliable.

												I loved playing these games on older generation platforms. However now both mdk and mdk 2 simply dont work. I'm not sure what the problem is with either game but they are unplayable. Even tried the fan patch for the first game, ran for about 5 minutes then crashed and couldnt get my computer running for about 30  mins. hopefully these are all problems on my end but I'm feeling that steam just did me out of a fiver			",35,3,1,0,4,0,0

												I'll start by saying the steam version doesnt work good at all.  You'll need to get a patch for itonce you get that though you get a fun primitive 3rd person action game with some bizarre charms and fun fast action. The only other real complaint I should adress is that the game is incredibly short. However it is short but sweet and worth giving a shot			",148,9,1,12,5,1,2

												A cult classic from Shiny Entertainment. This game is from a time when you played most PC games using the arrow keys for movement and the Crtl key to Fire, Spacebar to Jump. No mouse input required. No WASD.I first played this game in the form of a demo off a PC Gamer disc. A chapter of my childhood finally reached its conclusion when I played and completed this game as an adult. Thank you, Steam.			",368,121,4,38,24,4,56
