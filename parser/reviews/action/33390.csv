												I never ssen such great and unique mechanics in a shooter since Ikaruga. Besides this game has a great soundtrack, great artwork and for a 10 dollar price tag is will provide a a lenghy fun experience. Higlhy recomended, if you still have some doubt , just download the demo.			",465,199,12,75,44,6,72

												After you learn the controls this is actually a quite addictive game (I changed the controls to the five lower buttons on the numpad). You start out with an arcade mode which goes from easy to frustrating hard. After playing arcade you'll unlock a new mode, and a new mode after playing this, and so on. There's actually quite a few game modes to unlock, where the last is the most interresting; namely the Challenge mode. Some of the achievements can only be obtained through this mode, and some are very different from the usual bunch, such as ""get a better score than a randomly chosen person in a randomly chosen level"".Another fun feature that sets this game away from other side-scrolling flying shooters is the time-travel abilities. You can fast travel throw time, which gives you bonus score, or you can rewind time such that you can replay a few seconds (while your other timeline self's shots still count).An interresting twist on a classic game genre, and I can only recommend it.

												game works well., the game has a rewind and fast foward button.Is the game good, i suppose,in second level after the frist boss you will encounter energy drainers those are the killer for this game I totally hate them.I can understand why they did this but honestly they drain far too much energy which you need for your sheld and health.Your shield = health.Health = How many shoots you have Getting to second boss was okish.Got to second boss and found it far too crappy to even try to use the beam shot which you get before that level, boses move around like they are trying to dodge you but your too busy to even concentrate on them because of the bullethell type game you dodging bullets just trying to get though and survive long enough to kill the boss.Gave up, going to uninstall, Thanks for game..

												Ez to learn, hard to master...Zeit 2 is a great game for just a few bucks, its fast paced arcade style gameplay reminds of alot of the old rail shooters back in the day of arcade gaming.If you have a few mins to kill, or just want to test your reflexes, give Zeit 2 a try.

												An exquisite rendition of a bioluminscent trip down neon lane.  Quite expensive but in my opinion well worth the asking price.  A quality title; slick, polished and demonstrates there is a whole lot more than learning enemy patterns.  The time travelling element has been implemented well and adds to the dymanic bells and whilstles.  Yes Sir/Madame, I wholeheartly loved my time spent with Zeit Squared.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First time I play the game, I skip the tutorial and played one credit only. Well, first thought is the game looks awesome. The time mechanic is great for make huge damage on enemies wave and it's possible to make huge combos. The beginning of the game isn't hard, I lost against the second boss and it was easy to go at this point. I'll update the review if I change my mind after more playing.			",753,204,81,80,90,12,84

												I hope whichever cockgoblins came up with the idea that it's okay to start games at 1280x720 or 640x480 (or whatever phone resolution they can come up with) die a most unjolly death.Tolerable Ubi-published shmup-y game.			",3356,1275,127,341,492,39,547
