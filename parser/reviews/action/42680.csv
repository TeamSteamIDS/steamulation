												Once upon a midnight levy while I camped there prone and ready,Over many a quaint and curious streak of performance poor,While I aimed, clearly tracking, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one here attacking, then dispatched by my placed Claymore.`'Tis some noob,' I muttered, `exploding into bits of gore Only this, and nothing more.'Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the village tower,And each separate dying player wrought his corpse upon the floor.Eagerly I wished for ammo; - vainly I had brought the crossbowFrom my misses bursts of sorrow - sorrow for the lost streak scoresFor the rare and radiant rifle whom the gunsmiths forged from iron ore Bulletless here for evermore.And the thundering certain noise of each fired shotStrained me - enraged me with fantastic envy never felt before;So that now, to match the contents of my clip I stopped shooting`'Tis some noob below on the ground floor -A new player and not hardcore; -This it is, and nothing more,'Presently my angst grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I am camping, and so rudely you came attacking,And so carelessly you came backing, backing into my planted claymore,That doubtless was I that I heard you' - here I backtracked to the source; -Dog tag there, and nothing more.Deep into that hallway peering, long I stood there wondering, cheering,Grinning, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;But the silence was broken, and here appeared a notification,and the words spoken of kill confirmed, the points added to my scoreThus I pondered, and a gunshot pulled my mind back to the warMerely this and nothing more.Back into the tower camping, hand on mouse is damping,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.`Surely,' said I, `surely I should have taken scavenger pro;Let me see then, what thereat is, and this enemy  - my knife will soon goreLet my heart be still a moment and as I crawl out on the floor; -'Tis a drone and nothing more!'Over there I flung the flashbang, when, follow'd the blind and ear rang,In there stepped the soldier of the same username before.Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord or lady, ran hastily to the second floor -Proned upon my old position just around the tower doorProned, and aimed, and nothing more.Then this new player beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the lack of awareness that he bore,`Though thy gun is new and loaded, thou,' I said, `soon you shall be exploded.Consequence of so carelessly barging to that second floorTell me why thy thought to camp prior to thou explored!Cursed the player, which I ignoreMuch I thankful this player to bring me a gun so plainly,Though its attachments little synergy - little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no competent virtual soldierEver yet would refuse a firearm delivered to his front doorThough the munition in the chamber could have numbered moreTis was a blessing, I implore			",292,47,8,39,21,1,65

												After playing Black ops 2 for a year and trying Ghosts i have realized how much better this game is. Unlike the overpowered weapons in Black ops 2, I feel like most of the guns in MW3 are very balanced. Its nothing like the crap given to us in Ghosts. It alot better than what I orginally thought it was, you should try now that most of the un-trustworthy players have moved on.For the people who say it isnt balanced. Play Black ops 2 for 6 months, Then come back.The percentage of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things compaired to Black ops 2 is like compaired the wounds of a thumb tack to a chainsaw			",122,9,1,6,4,0,4

												Modern Warfare 3 can now be counted as an 'old' game, but it's online community is still large. Anyone who decides to buy this game will quickly realize that the only people who play anymore are experienced Prestige 2 - 5 players. Fun can still be had and the campaign is great with a good plot, characters, and soundtrack.The game also has survival mode, in which you everlastingly fight off against AI until you die with fun upgrades along the way.A solid conclusion to the Modern Warfare story.

												As someone who has played every single Call of Duty game aside from Call of Duty 2 and the new Advanced Warfare. Modern Warfare 3 was something I looked forward too but I had hear bad things about it. So I waited a few years and actually played in this order COD1,UO,WAW,4,BlackOps,MW2,Ghosts,BlackOps2,and finally MW3. I used to hate Call of Duty and it took me a while to distinguish the enjoyment of the singleplayer experiance from the twitch shooter that is the repetitive multiplayer that has really not changed since COD1, if anything it has lost amazing game modes (BehindEnemyLines,BaseAssault). When Bad Company 2 came out I basically said the hell with COD, BUT I came back to the franchise for what it does right, the enjoyable rollercoster that is the playable movie of the Campaign. I loved the story in ModernWarfare and the trilogy is pretty well wrapped up with MW3. A lot of questions about the story are answered if the ending itself is a little lackluster for all the work you have gone through in the previous games to get to the ultimate showdown of two dewds. Anyway no spoilers but the campaign was pretty well paced and enjoyable with some great set peices and the feel of WW3 was captured as well as this old engine can capture. I would not recommend this game to anyone to start with, nor if you are not invested into the ModernWarfare trilogy story etc. For fans of the series though its a must, to bring the story arc to a rather thrilling conclusion. I still think the Black Ops games have been the best COD games since COD united Offensive and the original MW. Hope this helps you guys. It gets a cautious recommend from me for fans of the franchise and story.			",266,30,0,24,24,0,46

												If you buy this game for the multyplayer you will be very dissapointed. I have yet to find a single game without atleast 2 hackers. The campaign is good and the coop is fun enough for me to still play it. Dont buy this game to play against other people unless you download hacks yourself because thats the only way you will survive. My score for this game would be about 7/10 but im rating this a thumbs down to warn you about the multyplayer. (oh and also there are something like 1000 people left playing this game and when you try and join a game theres a good chance that you will be put back into the same game you just left with all the hackers in it.) I hope this review helped somone out!			",127,10,3,8,13,0,6

												The game is awesome, and I absolutley love this series. Just one issue. Not any fun online. Way too many people cheating...(hackers) can't go one game without shooting through walls killing you. And people having you spawn on them killing you, and oh some people even use aimbot. No skill required, they just aim and headshot every single time. I'm tired of reporting people that are cheating, and nothing happening to them. I never do reviews. Never had to. The PC games are having too many issues with people cheating. This game is really putting a bad taste in my mouth. It shows .3 hrs on record for campaign, but soooo many hours on online. Wish Steam, or the people of Call of Duty will do something about people cheating. It ruins the game, and the fun. I don't go spending on a game, and can't enjoy it. What's the point of buying a gaming computer that i've had to work a lot of hours for, then the game, and to just get frustrated with people cheating constantly. I'm not the only one who thinks this.			",4,0,1,0,0,0,0

												This game is kinda good and i enjoyed it most of the time. Also this game doesn't use Ranked Dedicated Servers instead it's using IWNet like MW2 did. The Campaign was average and it takes like 5 hours to complete but it was a good ending to the MW series (If they make a sequel they are pretty stupid).The game also comes with Co-op missions and survival, The missions isn't really that hard if you know what you are doing and the Survival mode is kinda fun but gets boring after a while.Now for the Multiplayer that most of the Call of Duty players play anyway. I enjoyed it most of the time i played it, the maps were average in size, not to small and not to big. Most of the guns feel similar and the perks is pretty balanced except you are forced to use Assassin because of the UAV spam.I give this game:Story: 6.4/10Online: 7.2/10Graphics: 6/10Sound: 5.5/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall Score: 6.4/10			",238,56,3,45,16,2,14

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has already shipped and millions of eager fans are already playing. By now you already know whether or not you are going to be getting this game, which makes this review rather pointless. What can I possibly say that you haven't already heard; what tidbit of exclusive information can I pass on that you already don't know. It's not like Activision has been keeping their games a secret. I guess all that's left for me to do is share my personal experience with the game, what the designers did right, what they did wrong, and let the chips falls where they may.There are so many Call of Duty installments out there it's hard to keep them straight when it comes to the story. Modern Warfare 3 is the direct sequel to Modern Warfare 2, which was the direct sequel to the original Modern Warfare, so in essence, this is the third installment in the trilogy. We have our familiar cast of characters, Soap, Price, and Nickolai, and a new recruit, Yuri, the Russian member of your team who will be at the other end of your controls for most of the missions. Makarov is still up to his old tricks in his quest for global domination. After his failed attempt in Modern Warfare 2, Makarov has basically initiated WWIII with an assault on the USA as well as a massive simultaneous terrorist strike using bio-weapons.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 assaults you with its overpowering presentation, from the opening moment where your Humvee is taken out by an RPG in NYC and a building explodes and comes raining down on you until the bittersweet final boss encounter. Despite its aging graphics engine, the game maintains a fluid 60fps while pumping out graphics that are easily on par with Battlefield 3. Some scenes border on photorealistic, and when you set the entire thing in motion with sweeping cinematic camera moves things get real crazy real fast. The level of complexity in the level design and the amount of detail is staggering and surprisingly, especially in the multiplayer maps, and it only gets better on the PC.The sound mix is completely immersive with a stirring soundtrack that will fuel your adrenalin, great voice acting and in-game chatter, and some fantastic sound effects for all the weapons and explosions. The sampling rate has been boosted so these guns have never sounded better or more realistic, and there are plenty of shellshock and disorientation effects that will leave you breathless. Sadly, the whole presentation falls a bit short of console greatness since I'm not playing on a home theater, but with a good set of speakers or surround headphones, Modern Warfare 3 will still blow you away - just not as much.The game kicks off in New York City and thanks to pre-release coverage, you've probably already seen most of the first two chapters that has you destroying an enemy jamming tower then heading out into the harbor to cripple a Russian sub and launch its missiles on its own fleet. From there you'll need to rescue Soap from a safe house, then protect the Russian president and his daughter in one of my favorite levels that had me feeling like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. Then it's off to Sierra Leone, London, Somali, Paris, and Berlin as you try to foil Makarovs plans for world supremacy.Without a doubt, this is the best story in the trilogy, with each mission feeding into the next or at least having some parallel story thread. There are no missions stuck in there just because they are ""cool"", but every mission is extremely cool, a Hollywood set piece worthy of a Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer joint venture. The pacing is frantic, the energy and action nonstop, and yet they manage to work in moments of butt-clenching suspense when you are sneaking through enemy territory and one false move or loud noise can end your mission.The 15-part story, divided into three acts, will take you about 8 hours to complete on Normal and about 10 on Hard. Most of the Steam achievements are divided up into the story, completing each chapter, completing the game on the various difficulty levels, and there are even a few skill challenges that are mission specific and quite fun to tackle. Of course, the hidden intel are back; 46 in all and some are quite diabolical. I have mixed emotions on these egg hunts, since it really takes you out of story to have your men yelling for you to advance and you're scouring every nook and cranny for a blue monitor.Modern Warfare 3 brings back Spec Ops, a great co-op experience you can share online or local split-screen playing Survival mode or Mission mode. Survival mode basically puts you into levels and throws endless waves of enemies at you until you die, so your score and rank is based on how long you can stay alive. Things get downright evil when they start throwing combos like Juggernauts, Dogs, Choppers, and Bomb Squads at you.But for most of the world, Modern Warfare 3 is all going to boil down to the competitive multiplayer and frankly, it doesn't get any better than this. There is a large selection of maps and modes including fan favorites like Team DM, Sabotage, Domination, HQ, CTF, and Search and Destroy, but the game gets exponentially better once you play the new modes like Team Defender and Kill Confirmed. Team Defenders is basically CTF but you have no place to return the flag. There is only one flag and you merely run around with the flag while your team tries to protect you. The team who can carry the flag to the target limit win.Sledgehammer has taken the franchise back to its roots, or at least as far back as Call of Duty 4; the original Modern Warfare. Gone are all the unrealistic gameplay devices like Nukes and the Commando perk. Modern Warfare 3 is making the game more personal with a focus on close-quarters combat. Sniper rifles have been retuned, and air-support has been downsized. Modern Warfare 3 is all about teamwork and getting back to the good old days of Team DM; statistically, the most played multiplayer mode in Call of Duty.The Perks system hasn't changed all that much. You still choose three then complete the various challenges to earn the Pro version. What has changed, for the better in my opinion, are the perks themselves. They just seem to make more sense now, and they all contribute to a more balanced and team-focused gameplay experience. Unrealistic perks like Commando, OMA, Last Stand, and the game-ending Tactical Nuke are now only a bad memory.Modern Warfare 3 is going to offer all your favorite weapons and nothing much has changed when it comes to selection or balance. New for Modern Warfare 3 is the ability to rank up your weapons through continued use, so the more you use a gun, the better you get with it.Modern Warfare 3 also improves upon the existing Prestige system. After you reach the end of the 80th level and hit the Prestige button you get taken to the new Prestige Shop where you can choose from eleven different rewards. With each prestige you get a Prestige Token to spend in the Prestige Shop on whatever you wish as well as your complimentary Prestige Icon.Modern Warfare 3 is a shining example of refinement and improvement. It's familiar, sure, but here familiarity doesn't breed contempt, just respect and reward for those who've dedicated so much time to the series. And for new players, it's the perfect starting point, more accommodating and encompassing than ever. The series has always been renowned for elements like the excellent sound design, the gloss, polish and compulsion of its gameplay, but with Modern Warfare 3, Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer have created a game that not only lives up to the brand hype but exceeds it.

												Very fun CoD, but I don't recommend purchasing if you're new to the game. The game is rampant with hackers. Not only will they ruin the fun by using aimbots, invincibility, and other cheats, they will threaten to dox or ddos you because you're either using a gun they don't like or you're just dicking around in the chat. They run around the game like they own the place. Don't risk your safety by playing this game. Either play with a VPN or just play private matches with your friends. I tried contacting Steam about these two hackers that accessed my IP and said where I'm living but they did absolutely nothing about it and these two people are still able to play the game. Just asinine. Avoid the game.			",111,8,0,11,4,0,7

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the answer to those who say that the franchise is always equal to itself, changing little, or nothing, from year to year. The news are many, substantial and all perfectly integrated in the game mechanics. The classes and the development of the weapon give an unexpected tactical flavor to the gameplay, as well as new game modes. Really well it has done then the campaign, better than that of the second chapter, with good pace, very varied and that worthily closes the trilogy. Finally, a game package from great value: a campaign spot on, many and various Spec Ops, sixteen maps and numerous game modes of implanted mechanical magazines that work. Quality and quantity in short. ",201,16,11,18,15,0,14

												Good game RUINED by hackers..Honestly I loved this COD I remember when it came out on the 360. I would play multiplayer all the time (no hackers obviously haha). However on the PC it is CANCER. Most matches will have at least 1 hacker but sometimes I will be lucky and have a complete match without hackers.Tbh people only hack because they are really crap at playing COD. I just don't get it where is the fun in that? OVERALL campaign 9/10multiplayer 6/10 (Would be 8/10 if hackers didn't ruin it)If you just gonna hack the game don't even bother logging into steam next time..			",116,14,1,19,12,2,12

												Single-player: Except for the weird prologue, I thought that the story was a ton of fun. If it gets boring, pick a harder difficulty (and have fun dying if you picked one too hard). The fact that each mission isn't totally reset when you die is a lovely perk that (while I should have expected, I didn't) made the game much more enjoyable. The special ops missions are a lot of fun, but a few things should be pointed out:1). It can take a while to find people to play with, so if you don't have patience, bring friends.2). You can't play cross - server special ops with your friends, so if you have a Mac and your friends have Windows, you're out of luck.3). If you do have a Mac ( and Windows - loving friends), play multi - playerMulti - Player: A ton of fun to play once you can participate in the games in any meaningful amount (meaning that you don't get killed every time you poke your head out of the hole you're hiding in). However, a few tips: 1). There aren't any set noob maps, so if you're new, this can be frustrating. But, if I made it (and I sucked a TON at first), you can make it (unless you suck more than I did).2). There aren't any rooftop vantages or upper floor rooms that are protected to the point when sniping becomes a good option for new players. (Some maps don't have ANY  very elevated sniping spots) You have to be good (i would hesitantly say VERY good) in order to run and gun with a sniper, so avoid this unless you have a lot of practice in the single - player (harder difficulties) or in other games3). Many of the game modes don't have anyone playing them. The two that i've found to be most frequented by players are Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. Others are played, of course, but it will be harder to find a full room. 4). As always, playing with friends is a ton of fun, and if some of them are experienced, all the better. If you don't have friends, quit playing games and find some :). JK. I don't have friends either.A fun game in the FPS category, and I had a lot of fun playing. However, patience and time are necessary for the full experience. Despite the restrictions at first, the hackers (there weren't that many, actually, but they were annoying), and the limited gamemodes, I enjoyed my time, so I'll give this a (7/10).Actually, on second thought, I've remembered how much fun I had playing hide and seek with a bunch of guys (armed with Five - Sevens), playing arrow - chicken with C4 and Frag Grenades, and amusing my friends by making ridiculously macho comments, then dying a second later by more attentive players. So, I'll give it an 8/10. Always remember: If at first you don't succeed, you probably never will. Give up now and save yourself some trouble :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start. I finished the campaign a little less than an hour ago, thereby completing the journey that I've been on with these characters starting with the first Modern Warfare, a decade past in 2007. It's been quite a ride and after this last one, I find myself emotionally drained and deeply satisfied. The narrative was engaging as always, with its myriad twists and turns backed up with solid gameplay and gunplay. A wonderful cast of characters; old and new, friends and enemies alike. The visuals are nice and detailed, from the character models to the environments, even in 2017.Infinity Ward started something magical with MW and to see it's completion is bittersweet for me. Gaz, Roach, Soap, Price, Yuri, Sandman, Nikolai... and others I'm probably forgetting in the slight daze that I'm in, never has there been a more colorful rogue's gallery of lovable heartbreakers and lifetakers.I will miss you.

												This game had really suprised me when I first picked it up, although not superior to its more popular counterparts, the storyline was very dynamic and was not repetitive at all, the scenarios you go through are changing. As for PC performance, I have a fairly decent computer and was worried about it not being able to run, after turning all the graphics down, it ran fine, as for the multiplayer, it is lacking people, but is very challenging and a fun time, the community sucks, but that's expected for a Call of Duty Game. I have only seen one hacker in my time online, the servers will slightly lag every now and then, and I know it's not just me.In retrospect, this game is great, despite it's flaws, it is still a game well worth the money you have to pay for to get it.

Pros:The same great action of the previous games. Lots of multiplayer options.Cons:Not much changed since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Single-player campaign is confusing for people who haven't played the other Modern Warfare games. Modern Warfare 3 picks up where Modern Warfare 2 left off. I mean, exactly where it left off. Russia is at war with America, Makarov is at large, Soap's injured, and everything is blowing up. If you didn't play Modern Warfare 2, which served as a decent starting point and didn't require the first game to understand it, you won't have any idea about what's going on, and the game doesn't do much to get you up to date. It feels very much like the third movie in a trilogy, and the second movie ended on a cliffhanger. The gameplay, both in single player and multiplayer modes, is identical to that of Modern Warfare 2. You can carry two weapons and two types of grenades (one offensive, one special) at one time and you have to hide behind cover and employ tactical savvy in your approach firefights if you want to kill your enemies. It's an established and functional style that captures modern, ""realistic"" first-person shooter games. If you get hit a few times, you need to hide behind cover until you heal, or a few more stray bullets can kill you. It's unforgiving, but balanced.Multiplayer is the big draw of Modern Warfare 3, and it pays off just as much as it did in the other games in the series. There are the same seemingly endless customization options, with an experience system and the ability to build your own class with different weapons and abilities. The killstreak system from previous games has been refined into a points-based system that gives players more balance. Instead of getting points for each kill, players can choose Assault, Support, and Specialist modes that give them different rewards. Assault is the traditional killstreak system, where you get new abilities like missile strikes for more kills in a single life. Support counts your kills and other actions between lives, constantly moving up and giving you support-based abilities like UAVs. Specialist gives you more perks for your kills, instead of new weapons it effectively turns you into a super-soldier who's faster, stronger, or able to take more damage.The multiplayer options offer a benefit over Battlefield 3, which only has six cooperative missions compared to over a dozen in Modern Warfare 3. Competitive play is pretty evenly matched, with leveling in Modern Warfare 3 universal and steadily unlocking weapons and skills and leveling in Battlefield 3 and rewarding your class as you play it. The big difference between the two games is that Battlefield 3 has vehicles, which can change the nature of a game dramatically. To go to extremes, Modern Warfare 3 is more suitable for Counter-Strike fans, while Battlefield 3 is more suitable for Halo fans, but the distinction between the two modern combat games are far smaller than the rift between the two classic shooters.Modern Warfare 3 is a solid follow-up to Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, and if you loved those games you'll love this one. It doesn't change anything big, and the single-player campaign wraps up a story with most of the exposition lodged in previous games, but it offers a great multiplayer experience and a solid, if predictable and occasionally frustrating, single-player experience.

												The game in general is great fun. The Single player is good, especially if you've played the two predecessors, though I actually played this campaign before I played the Modern Warfare 2 campaign. You'll have your 4-6 hours of adrenaline pumping action or even more if you play it on hardened or veteran (which I recommend that you do). But wait, there is more. Just like in Modern Warfare 2 you have Special Operations with several additional missions to go through, either on your own or with a friend. A new addition in Modern Warfare 3 however is the Survival Mode in which you fight to survive onslaughts of enemies thrown at you, wave after wave.Moving on to the multiplayer. I have circa 500 hours played and it's great. This was my first Call of Duty multiplayer experience and I've loved every minute of it. A big issue however is the abundance of hackers and cheaters which is proven to cause general anxiety, flying objects (not by me personally) and hairloss. This can however be mitigated with buying the multiplayer map packs, mainly because the majority of people who decide to cheat can't afford these.Another issue is the price of DLC. I have bought the 3 multiplayer map packs myself on sales at insane prices. I wish they would have released a complete edition or similar, but no. The last con I'd like to point out are the limited graphic settings. However, you can alter the config. files to fix this. There are several guides online if you're unsure about what to do. There is also an officially backed Field of View-changer which won't get you banned.Tl;dr: The game is great fun and one of the best multiplayer shooters I've played in recent years. If you're tired of Counter-Strike or the later installments of Call of Duty, give this one a try, you won't be disappointed. Just remember to get the map packs to avoid the cheaters.

												I don't usually write reviews about games I cannot recommend, but I believe people need to be warned about this.MW3 was the first Call of Duty I've bought, and it will also be the last. If you want to know why, read on.I have over 600 hours played in the multiplayer, which you cannot see because Steam uses two different apps for this game, one for singleplayer and one for multiplayer. And I don't even know why, because much of it was more frustrating than fun. But I think I have experienced the best and the worst this game has to offer, and can tell other people with good conscience what they will get from this.CoD games have a history of receiving flak from dedicated FPS players for being bad games despite their popularity on consoles. Since this was my first time playing a game of the MW series, most of this, such as ""60$ map pack"", didn't apply to me. I went into it with an open mind free of prejudice, and here is what I got:At first, the game is quite fun. It is polished, the controls are sharp and responsive, the sound and keybinds work as they should. None of the things that usually accompany console ports such as mouselag or unbindable keys, it would seem. However, the FoV is locket at 60, so any dedicated player is forced to rely upon a certain 3rd party tool to fix this issue.SingleplayerThe single-player campaign is passable. In typical CoD style, you usually enter an area and have enemies respawn indefinitely until you move to the next checkpoint. Ignoring that the most efficient way to play is to rush through instead of actually fighting, the FPS key elements such as gunplay and movement are solid. The game is, however, heavy on scripted sequences and quicktime events. Despite being more of an old-school FPS player, I wasn't too bothered with the modern stuff such as bloody screen, regenerating health and checkpoints.MultiplayerSince most people play CoD exclusively for the multiplayer, this will be the major part of my review. And boy, you are in for something.Now, as stated above, the game itself plays pretty well. Unfortunately, the multiplayer part is plagued by a number of massive issues which outnumber the good parts a thousandfold.First off, this game is designed all around the famous skinner box. It compels you to play, even in times you don't really want to or are not having a good time. What this translates to ingame are a number of psychological features that would be an absolute no-go for any good gamedesign, such as leveling up, unlocking guns and similar. I'm sure the developers could make a game that was actually good instead of forcing people to play through psychology... if they actually tried. But as it is, MW3 is designed to keep you addicted for a certain amount of time, after which it starts to get boring quickly. That timeframe, who could have guessed, is a few months, just enough until before the release date of the next title in the CoD series.Then, there is this weird feature that is called ""lag compensation"". Now, the feature in inself is nothing new and has been seen in games for years. But in the way it is implemented here it actually gives players with bad connections an huge advantage over players with good connections. Dying the very instant you cross a corner before even seeing anyone, only to see your opponent had seconds of spraying your helpless body is a frequent occurrence. Since I had a fast connection, I would suffer massively from this feature, to the point where I had to actively limit my internet speed to be on an even playing field with everyone else.Now here is the main part: the multiplayer is infested with cheaters. Like you wouldn't believe. We UT and Quake players always used to make fun of CS for its amount of wallhackers, but MW3 is in an entirely different league. Cheaters are so prevalent in MW3 that finding a single game without a cheater is practically impossible, and I'm not exaggerating. Wish I was. More often than not, there would be 2-3 cheaters in any single game you come across.And I'm not talking about simple wallhackers. I'm talking about guys with godmode on, unlimited ammo, can kill you the very moment you spawn from the other end of the map through all walls and objects and even teleport all players on the map high in the air to fall to their death in 10 seconds intervals. Or outside the playable map, to have them stand around, being unable to do anything until the torture ends.There is no working anti-cheat feature in MW3 whatsoever. What is worse is, MW3 is designed in such a way that not only it is impossible to punish cheaters, it even encourages them through the use of a lobby system. There are no servers where such players could be banned, or even a vote system to kick them. If you end up with one cheater in a 20 player match, the only solution would be for the other 19 players to abandon the game and leave, only to be replaced with new unsuspecting victims until the cheater is satisfied to his heart's content.One of the players in the lobby would always end up as the host for a match. There used to be a 3rd party program which let you analyze the IP connections in the game and, with the help of another filtering program, you could deny certain IP adresses to connect to your PC, essentially banning cheaters from your games if you were fortunate enough to be chosen as the host. The sad part is that MW3 is so infested with cheaters that using those tools is practically mandatory if you want at least a few of your games to be actually playable. What's worse is that there are a number of players who also abused this. They would ban anyone they felt like banning, for reasons such as killing them, saying something they didn't like, using a weapon they didn't like or choosing to play in a way they didn't like.That, however, was before cheaters had hacks that could force them to become host of their games, every time. Now, cheaters were not only able to kill any players with the push of a button, but they had total control over their games, and gave everyone else a ridiculously high ping in the process.Cheaters are everywhere and anywhere, and it is impossible to avoid them. Playing MW3 online without being a cheater yourself is like bringing a knife to a tank fight. They turn the multiplayer into an unplayable mess, and the developer/publisher refuse to adress this problem. It's like they don't give a damn, once you've paid your 60$ you've ""done your duty"" and are now expendable, thank you very much come again next year with your wallet. I know, fire-and-forget port of a console game, but still. While theoretically it's the players ruining the game, the fact that those companies even fail to do as much as acknowledge a problem of such a degree that it turns a game into a basically nonfunctional product is borderline fraudulent. I refuse to support companies that treat their customers in such a way, and will never buy something from Actvision again. I gave them a chance to earn my trust (and money), and they blew it as hard as you possibly can. A shame, really, I liked the game in itself, and I wanted to play it, as you can no doubt tell from my 600 hours, but problems of such a scale completely ruin every aspect of it and turn it into nothing more than a♥♥♥♥♥♥fest.TL;DR: There are two kinds of people playing MW3 online: cheaters, and masochists. If you are neither, I suggest you stay as far away from this game as you possibly can, or you're in for a lot of frustration. ",71,3,0,7,1,0,2

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 was my first-ish Call of Duty that led me into the Series.When this Game first came out it used to be 80€ on Steam and 60€ in our local Store. Save to say I did not buy it from Steam. Since this Game has 3 Sections, my review also will be divided by 3.Singleplayer:The Singleplayer Campaign was in my experience a nice addition to the second Modern Warfare and I did enjoy it alot. It took me 10 Hours to complete it on Normal Mode, which is about the Average amount of time for a Triple A Singleplayer Game.Co-op:I'm not quite sure if Modern Warfare 2 had a Co-op Mode but this one is alot of fun that means, if its working. You can play Survival with a friend together, defending waves of enemies coming in & with each Wave survived you become a more powerful weapon, however the enemies will also be more powerful. Whilst this Mode is alot of fun it also is very broken as it comes out of sinc within the first 5 Minutes making this Mode almost unplayable.Multiplayer:As I Already said, this was one of my first Call of Dutys to get into the Series and also the Reason to get a Steam Account. Before I bought Modern Warfare 2 (2 Weeks before this MW3 got released) I had not heard of Steam before.The Multiplayer was at the time for me alot of fun especially with friends, I have spent over 1000 hours of Multiplayer Game time together and did enjoy my time.However for nowerdays standards the Multiplayer is not good anymore for the following Reasons:-No Dedicated Servers -No FOV Slider-No Anti Cheat (yes VAC is enabled but I dont think anybody gets banned anymore)-Mainly Hackers online-Hacked Lobbies (they can't get you banned)I surley did get my money out of the Game but I still do not recommend it as of nowerdays standards.I only recommend this Game for people that want to play the Singleplayer Campaign and see what happens after Modern Warfare 2. But do yourself a favour and buy it from a Keywebsite for 4€ Because even on Sale this Game is to expensive for what it gives you. If you are looking for a good Call of Duty on PC I do recommend you to get Black Ops 2 as it was the last good Call of Duty that still is to this day banning cheaters and having dedicated servers + a build in fov slider.

												This review is only for the Single portion of the game.Pros-Spec Ops is still really fun and the new survival mode can be fun especially with friends-The campaign still has the same over the top action.-Some compelling moments in the SP campaignCons-The ""No Russian 2.0"" feels even more forced than in the first game-Extremely samy, showing you footage of MW2 next to MW3 and you would be hard pressed to see the different.-A lot of things feels recycled in this gameNeutral-No fov slider.-Over abundance of set piecesUltimately I can only recommend Modern Warfare 3 to Call of Duty fans. It is very repetitive, recycles a lot of what was already done and add very little on top. At the current price ($40) you are better off with Modern Warfare 2.			",780,139,51,71,29,7,85

												Great last chapter of the Modern Warfare Arc.Basically feels like acting in a Michael Bay movie, basic scenario but with a lot of well delivered action.And if the campaign is not very long, the multi part continues the fun for long, long hours.Still feels like a notch under Modern Warfare 2 but definetely recommend it for any modern warfare fan.Story: 6/10 - not very original but easy to follow and well deliveredGraphics: 7/10 - effects and textures are not the best in trhe industry but still offers a good level of quality. Unfortunately, the game's texture don't take advantage of the 4k resolution.Gameplay: 7/10 - simple, nervous, efficient, fun. Personnally, I prefer much more the feeling of a Far Cry 3, with nice animations, which give a good realism level, and MW3 keeps its classic gameplay, simplier, but still fun.Music : 6/10 - some nice tracks here and there but nothing epic in my opinion. I do like however the guns' sounds. ",95,6,0,12,0,0,16

												Probalblly the second and the last best one Call of Duty after MW2.The storyline is amazing like in the other games from the MW franchise. The games where you really feel how hard, painful and self-destructable a modern warfare can be. Playing as different characters, from which a lot of them die for the cause to safe the world, which also makes the game really emotional. The multiplayer is also amazing or it was some years ago when the game was new release. The variety of game modes and the hard leveling up plus all the weapons you unlock and can customize in an amazing way. This game was something amazing for it's years and I still think it is amazing and worth buying even now.The last Call of Duty, which was totally worth it. ",120,18,4,7,12,0,7

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 a.k.a MW3 is one addictive beast of a game.Just like most COD games, it has 3 primary segments: Campaign: The story mode in this game continues from where MW2 left off. In all honesty, everything is pretty much predictable besides some small twists and turns. It's all linear. Although, the characters are very iconic and the voice acting accompanied by Hollywood-like direction do make it a pleasant one-time play.Special Ops: The spec-ops mode is Infinity Ward's alternative to the immensely popular Zombies mode offered in Treyarch COD games. However, instead of Zombies the player(s) complete co-op missions and fight waves of AI-based humans. Imo, it's hell lot of fun when played with friends.Multiplayer: The most important and most played segment in a COD game has always been the multiplayer. MW3 has a great deal of weapon variety and introduces players to the new Specialist strike package, which replaces kill streaks with additional perks. Oh, and the perks are nearly exactly the same as in MW2. Yes, there are lots of noob-tubing weapons in this game as well - Launchers and spray shotguns, but most players now play a lot more sensibly, especially in modes like Search and Destroy. The ACR 6.8 is undoubtedly the most dominant weapon in the game, given it has pretty much no recoil, great iron sights and the best range in class. Do not misjudge me by the hours you see on this account. I have been playing this game for more than 4 years and to say the least, I certainly have clocked in 2500+ hours in the multiplayer aspect alone.Conclusion:+ Variety in weaponry+ Sniping gives chills+ Well balanced perk system+ Great maps+ No micro transactions (The last COD to do so)- Hit detection has flaws- Campaign doesn't live up to expectations- Half the achievements require you to purchase DLC (For the 100% achievement freaks)P.S. The review is written with a general perspective. New players may not want to buy the game at a high price since there are many hackers in here and it just wouldn't be worth it. You can find clean lobbies too, but not as easily.			",54,7,0,3,3,0,1

												Game was great, and multi was awesomeBUTi havent played for a while, and this year, i downloaded the multiplayer a couple of times,  and every f-ing time i started the game there was always a cheater or more on the server (and im not talking about a better player with really high score or something like that)But some guy, giving headshots through walls as soon as you spawn, spinning people, spawning everybody on some place on the map in front of him... (it really sucks)This last time, a guy was called Clone 1.1 (older dude, i would say 30+ by voice. he was the guy killing everyone on spawn) and he was saying on the voice chat about how he was angry at the cheaters, and he only wants to ruin games)Cheaters are mostly in team deathmatch, but less of them are in free for all, i wanted to relax and play some dm.i also encountered a couple of modded servers, which i dont mind if the mod is fun, but sometimes its like, care packages falling everywhere, 100 of them, and everyone can use them... insane.

												Where to start... Okay, so this COD game is a good few years old but speaking as a person who has played most (not all) COD's I can honestly say this is in the top 3 of the BEST when it comes to Multiplayer. I'd even go so far as to say it's in the top 5 online FPS games ever! It really had/has everything. Back in the day I put in around 2000-3000 hours on the ps3 version, 700-800 hours on the 360 version..so as you can tell I was a fan of this game lol. Well, I had a few pounds going spare so decided to pick it up in the Summer sale to put in a few more hours of this once amazing game. Sadly, this is no longer possible, due to the emense amount of hackers that seem to have taken over the online game. When I purchased the game I was expecting a few hackers to be online as is with most online games. However, it seems impossible to find any matches/games on the weekends and week nights that are not filled with hackers and i'm not talking about ""Oh, he shot me through smoke. He must be a hacker"". I am talking hackers that leave other gamers in no doubt they're hacking and in a few occasions gloat about it. Maybe I have way to much time on my hands but i decided to keep a diary of the hackers hopefully stopping players, like myself, who want to buy this game to relive the amazing online game from buying this game. Here is a record of 12 consecutive TDM games on Friday the 1st of July 2016.    Game 1: 2mins after a fresh game started the nuke warning was given with no player having killed more than 5 players.Game 2: A user named HDK had a 30-0 kill streak. On every single kill cam he was seen looking at the ground and shooting. Half way through the match he was seen flying through the air and killing people. Left the que. Game 3: Joined a game and found 3 players flying around killing people. Game 4: No noticeable hackersGame 5:  Half way through the next game two players joined called HDK and ----. HDK (from one of the previous games) started flying around shooting people while the other is seen, on kill cam, following people through the walls and shooting them with the cursor locked onto their head.Game 6: Started the game was everybody died within 10 seconds. On each kill cam you see a player randomly shooting into the air and killing a player with each shot. Left gameGame 7: 2 players started flying around shooting other team members. Left game and logged off for 3-4 hursGame 8: Started playing TDM: No hackers noticed Until last part of the match when a player joined and started getting all headshot kills. On inspection of the kill cam you can see his cursor moving instantly to the enemies head while behind walls. As soon as the enemy becomes visible they were instantly dead. Left before the end.  game 9: 2 players from our team and 1 from the opposition started flying around the map. Game 10: Once again found myself in the game with the user named TDK. As normal he was flying around shooting people. Game 11: Joined a game halfway through and started getting killed every time I respawned.The player who kept killing us was stood fancing the wall shooting every now and thenGame 12: 2 players from my team were flying around killing. As you cans ee the game is now officialy at the mercy of hackers. DO NOT BUY unless you plan on using single mode only or know a trust worthy team you plan on playing against. ",249,41,4,32,27,0,21

												MW3 is the game when COD went downhill. It's pretty much a rehash of MW2 with some really bad design choices. The amount of improvements is minimal and they even managed to make the game look worse than the previous games.PlotWhat do i mean?Well, COD games have been linear shooters since their very first game. This game is no exception. I personally don't see a problem in that. That said, usually a COD game has a relatively good story and this one is far from it.The game events start right after MW2. US is pushing russians back to the cost line. Your first mission is in NYC. You hijack a mother submarine and use its rockets to sink all the remaining russian forces. You see what i mean now? Original's COD motto was ""no one fights alone"", but starting MW3 it's more like ""one man army"". That's pretty much how the whole game is played. You literally rambo your way through the whole game.The next mission has the russian president flying to Hamburg to sign the peace treaty, but his plane gets hijacked by terrorists (Makarov). President gets taken hostage and it triggers another war. I suppose the terrorist attack would make it seem as if Germany was the aggressor.Makarov plants chemical attacks in major european countries and the next day Russia starts invading Europe. Russia, a country that supposedly just lost a war with US in MW2. Where do they find the manpower and the gear to start another war? They do very good by the way. In a matter of few days they reach Paris.Meanwhile Makarov is working hard on getting nuclear launch codes from the russian president. He starts searching for the president's daughter, who happens to be in Berlin (she escaped the plane was it was hijacked). A group of like 20 men is sent to get her out. They fail to do that and Makarov gets the girl. But in the end they somehow manage trail them back to their hideout, where they rescue both the president and his daughter. The next day the war ends.The war started on 4th October and ended by 14th October.I would say that it was a very mediocre way of representing WW3. It doesn't go that much in depth and it has very big plot holes.Second of all, it was mostly about special ops forces rather than your regular front line soldier. Majority of the time you were fighting against your odds. The enemy would outnumber and you would still come out as a victor. As i said, this is a rambo game. The previous games had that, but they kept it in check. This game takes it to a whole new level. It just ruins an otherwise great trilogy.I suggest anyone who is interested in more to check this link:https://northatlanticblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/01/modern-warfare-vs-real-warfare-part-3-of-3/MultiplayerThe multiplayer is pretty much the same, with one big elephant in the room.First of all, it's pretty much a map pack, reskin, call it whatever you want. Pretty much all the things in MW3 are part of MW2. It has a few changes here and there. For example now there are 3 killstreak trees. You can choose a normal killstreak tree that gives killstreaks for kills but nullifies the score if you die, or a support tree that gives killstreaks but doesn't nullify your kill count upon death. Finally there is the specialist tree that gives you perks for every few kills. Also, i think the other big change is that weapons have a level and that's how you earn attachments now. But that's about all - everything else was pretty much copy and pasted from the previous games. It's very low effort.The elephant i was talking about is the spawn system. They completely messed it up by making enemies spawn right behind you after killing them. It was nicknamed as the revenge spawn system among the community.Example #1Example #2Example #3In the past COD games, maps had certain zones where you could spawn in. The problem with that is that it can create spawn killing. They were trying something new, but they failed. I personally really loved MW2 and since it's pretty much the same game, i would have played it to death, but this thing really makes it unplayable.That makes you realize how important stuff like maps, spawns or balance are in multiplayer games. SurvivalIn MW2, spec ops were kind of hit or miss. At times i would like the mission. At times i would not. There were certain types of levels in spec ops that required you to hold out for a certain amount of waves. Those were the ones that i really liked, and in MW3 they decided to make a separate mode out of it, named as Survival, except that the amount of waves is infinite and you can buy weapons, perks, killstreaks.It's amazing. I spent most of my time playing MW3 in Survival. It's really the only thing you should be playing if you are getting this game. It's a worthy contender to Treyarch's zombies and unlike zombies it offers a vast amount of levels to play in. The levels are taken directly from multiplayer - the maps. There are 16 maps in multiplayer, so you get 16 levels for survival.ConclusionWell, like i said, MW3 was pretty much a big disappointment. If you are gonna get it, get it only for coop mode. Also remember that the graphics are bad. In fact, i actually had a marathon, where me and my friends would play the modern warfare franchise. MW3 actually managed to look worse than the other 2.On a side note, i want to add that the development team that was working on Call of Duty games, Infinite Ward, had a big argument with the publisher and about 46 IW employees left the company. That was shortly like 6 months after MW2's release. All those people formed a new company named Respawn Entertainment, which is responsible for Titanfall.The writer for the game - Jesse Stern, was also replaced with somebody else. So really, MW3 isn't even a COD game to be honest. Every body who worked on the franchise that we loved were not part of MW3. That's all i had to say.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

												DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! the title says it all, but here's the reasons why you shouldn't get it1. about 20-30% of the players are cheaters/hackers2. you have a 1/80 chance of a VAC ban (for absoloutly no reason)3. just about no one plays most of the modes anymore4. SpecOps has no crossplatforming (ie; Mac users cannot play with Pc users)5. the gameplay is very slow			",148,17,0,15,9,0,26

												You know, I love this game to be honest. And most of the Call of Duty games were great. I've played them since they were on pc originally and I was young, and then later on xbox with friends. It gets a lot of hate now, and I'll admit they're far from the greatest games ever, but I'd say the whole series gets an 80% at least, for doing what they did right. There's really some cool, classic concepts in these games. Games are evolving and it seems like poor Call of Duty is struggling to keep up. Just wait till 2019, VR CoD is on it's way... But I had some great times with these games, I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I didn't really buy it for that. I bought it for the campaign(which isn't the best but it's enjoyable) and mostly for the survival and missions tab. I'll get some friends to get this too, and we'll play one day again hopefully. On that note I am worried. Mostly because of controller support.. Or, the lack there of. Seriously. A triple AAA title designed for the xbox controller, has no controller support? That's ridiculous. I understood even up to WaW. But after that one, you guys need damn controller support. Serious♥♥♥♥ingly please. And also, I realize that If I were say to wanna play co-op with my friend or girlfriend, I would have to buy the anniversary again to enjoy most of the titles. Honestly, i don't mind that. Because on sale the price is what i'd expect for the content. But I would love splitscreen honestly. I know that'll never happen but it was on the originals and a big concept, too. Surely it wouldn't be that hard... Other than those two issues, which I'm only expecting and even demanding controller support, I'm happy with this port (i think it's a port, right?) so far. I hope CoD makes that come back and starts to be good again. I would go as far as to say this may be one of the most epic series of fps games ever. But also in some ways it's like Battlefield for pansies or Counter Strike for the mentally handicapped. So I guess that if you've read up to this point you're pretty interested in the title and obviously you know that's it ultimately up to you to decide the quality of this game for your reality. I would like for you to buy it though. And then come play some co-op survival with me.			",1208,236,21,109,74,6,117

												This is an old game, but still one of the best in the series. Along with the two previous Modern Warfare titles, arguably the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series.In no particular order, some of the stand-out points: Outstanding sound design: explosions and guns feel like the real thing, something later titles in the series have lost. Superbly paced campaign [for maximum value/enjoyment, play the previous titles first] Variety in terms of roles within the campaign setting, and also in terms of locale. Spec Ops! Something I wish later titles would bring back. So much fun when played in co-op. Survival is also a lot of fun (wave based survival game). Awesome multiplayer (great hit detection, excellent maps, decent weapon variety, solid look and feel to weapons)That being said... there are some issues. A lack of dedicated servers can mean extreme P2P lag, and unfortunately the multiplayer is rife with hackers :/ it really does take all the fun out of it.If you enjoy Survival and Spec Ops modes, I would suggest buying the DLC packs as well, since they add missions and game modes on top of the already impressive package.Overall, highly recommended. I love this game <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												99.9% of the game population is filled with 12 year old little Putins  and Trumps running MP7s,  Assassin, and C-f*cking-4 left and right.And within that 99.9% are the hackers who also admit to having little to no life and little to no skill at all.Singleplayer is good. Because you don't have to shout at your idiot team to capture B and C flag on Terminal and not capture A, but instead indulge yourself in the story.Before I go on a total rant as to why the multiplayer community is more toxic than the Fukushima nuclear plant's waste that was poured into the bodies of water surrounding it, I'll say this.If you have the friends to play it, play it.If you want to get called ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" by the Russians, have a 12 year old say he was ""inside your mother,"" and have your tactical insertion camped harder than the Germans did the European people during the Second World War,This game is for you.7.3/10Update: this game makes me want to die.

												An Epic conclusion to the Epic Saga!The modern Warfare series has come a long way ever since the first modern warfare released in 2006. It has evolutionized the genre and changed the way we play and think of FPS games. Althought, the game adds nothing new to the already complex formula, it does adds smoothness to the game core mechanics and the fast paced arcade-style shooter, ranking & rewarding as well as unique kill streak system in which skillful players shall go on a rampage quite easily with the aid of air supports or ground fire powers.The thrid entry to the series does not dissappoint because the single player campaign is filled with action as well as intense sequences. The story is well written and completed the story in a consistent and well told narrative. It also did a great job on connecting all the previous games together while maintaining twists that will keep the player guessing with unpredictably deep story. The story mode does not have a good replayability unless you are a collection fanatic that will be interested in perfecting the game with enemy intels, other wise I'd say it is not worth the hassle. The music score is an honorable mention here as the composer Brian Tayler has really hit the score with the music on the battlefield as well as the impact of guns and bullets hitting different places. The sound track is overall excellent not only does it set a atmospherical environment but it also connects the emotional link between the players and the characters and maintaining this link is what gives us the reason to care about the characters.In terms of multiplayer, the same formula applies. It is still addictive and still fun as new weapons and maps being added but the only down side to that is that additional DLCs will cost a fortune. Overall I will recommend this game to all FPS lovers and action gamers in general.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												This was one of the last decent Call Of Duties before they took off (Literally) with the jump packs and Halo jumping nonsense. To me this is a real Call Of Duty and it plays exactly how an arcade shooter should in most ways. This is the last COD with pro perks, a feature that they removed for unknown reasons. Probably because players are too lazy to shoot down 40 killstreaks or destroy 50 enemy equipments (Lazy buggers). The guns in the game aren't at all balanced, but that's what makes it fun, how you ask? Well I will tell you how. There's nothing more satisfying than dropping a M.O.A.B against a full party of MP7/ACR using tryhards with an underpowered weapon. Recoil isn't really a problem on this game, 1 or 2 guns present a mini challenge but anyone with a brain knows how to pull down slightly with the mouse. The 3 killstreak options made this game very fresh and added numerous different playstyles to the game. The noobs get rewarded even if they die if they opt for the support package. Moab hunters get rewarded when using the specialist package. And the diehard MW2 fans get rewarded for using the Assault package. The killstreaks aren't that powerful in the assault package, nowhere near as good as MW2 but it can still be fun to use from time to time. Most of the maps on Modern Warfare 3 have decent design and stick to the same formula that was used on Modern Warfare 2. They promote rushing and movement most of the time and they try to stay small so you won't be caught looking for a gunfight for too long (Unlike Ghosts. Yuck). However, some players still insist on using Thermal LMGs in the most annoying ways. There are quite a few clans that scour TDM using this strategy. LMGs combined with a campy playstyle is almost impossible to beat considering they're deadly accurate with thermal. I would personally consider them to be overpowered. Almost everything has some sort of counter-play, minus the C4. If you have blast shield on and it's right next to you. You're dead, no questions asked, same thing with claymores and Bouncing betties. Your only saviour is a ballistic vest and this means you will have to play using the support package which is heavily looked down upon by most players.Quickscopers and proper snipers are a pain on this game yes, but you will find yourself surviving a shot from them quite often (If you really hate them, ballistic vests make sure you're always a 2 hit kill, even to the head!) however, a decent quickscoper can outclass any gun at any range and it makes things quite unfair. Quickscopers can easily outclass a shotgunner/SMG at close range which never makes any sense, but then again there are tonnes of things which don't make sense in COD, like another age old problem of shooting first, hitting them a tonne and somehow dying first? That's the problem with the extremely low tickrate that COD has. If we could have a tickrate above 100 then things would improve drastically. Or would they?The online support for this game is where things begin to go sour very quickly. Hackers are allowed to roam free and there are some days where you begin to forget what a normal lobby even looks like. You can run into the same hacker for months on end and report him everytime and nothing will be done, the report button is like the pointless button from ASDF movie. If you leave say a TDM lobby and go back to search for a TDM lobby, you will often find yourself back in the exact same lobby, this is another frustrating feature. Also there's the age old problem of joining a game where your team is losing by 60 kills and there's no way you will win and it goes against your Win loss ratio. Many players take pride in their W/L but most of the time there's nothing you can do to save it. Kicktool abusers are exactly what this game doesn't need and they're everywhere! This tool was released so the MW3 community could combat hackers by kicking them, but now it's used by good/bad players to kick decent players from the lobby so it's easy for them. Bad players end up thinking everyone who kills them has some sort of hack because of their God complex. Whilst the good players (With the hacktool) have no honour and kick the other good players as soon as they see their KD in danger.To conclude my review, I must admit that this game has been a lot of fun over the years and was definitely worth the £30 I spent back in the day on it. But it's not worth that now at all. The DLC is dead, half the multiplayer modes are empty, and the player base is dwindling. You will be lucky to reach above 100 hours before growing to hate the game and quitting it, never looking back again. Rightly so, Activision and co never continue supporting their older games and that's their downfall, it's sad but unfortunately it's a way of life. Why generate a loss by appeasing the players that remain on the old CODs when you can 'appease' the players on the newer CODs and continue generating revenue? I digress, time for the ratings out of ten.Multiplayer: 6/10 - It's broken and there's no denying that.Campaign : 7/10 - It kept to the MW formula that made the other MW games fun.Special ops/survival etc : 5/10 - I found myself getting bored instantly with both Spec ops and survival. They effectively copied MW2s spec ops, just badly.Overall: 6.5/10 - This is a very fun game If you can look past all the hackers, kick tool abusers, campers, overpowered weapon abusers and headglitchers. It still isn't worth the price tag however. £20 sounds more reasonable. Thanks for reading.			",40,1,3,2,4,0,3

												Modern warfare 3 was the first game i ever got for this steam account, altought it took me a lot of trouble to get this game after the release, it was really worth it and here is why .The single player offers a huge experience for storyline as russia invades the us .Yet fullscale warfare is seen unlike any other call of duty campaign , if your starting from the modern warfare experience I would not recommend this game to anyone to start with but start with cod 4 then move on until you reach this game. The game play is balance through both single and multiplayer and thisd is why this game is still populated.- The maps are designs grealty for TDM- Weapons are balance in classes and fire rate- Specialist is a new killstreak implemented into the game- They added dedicated severs as an options for custom games- Spec ops game mode for co-op- Resonable price for the game $40- Dont bother with DLC becuase nobody plays the maps or spec ops- Great story line to end the modern warfareIf your looking for a good fps shooter you came to the right place , the only modes you be finding is TDM as other game modes are unpopulated but its a good game !

It runs on my comp on extra at 1920x1200 and it runs flawlessly, and I can't say this about BF3, so for me Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 3 it's the best shooter of 2011, and I think no game can take this title fom him. 10/10.

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a first person shooter game from Activision. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a sequel to the previous game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 continue the story from the previous game. The single player campaign only has new storyline, but the gameplay are mostly the same, go to objective A, then go to objective B to destroy objective C. The Special Ops game mode made a return in this game with new missions. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 also introduce the new survival game mode that you can play cooperatively with friends. The survival mode is quite interesting part of the single player game. The multiplayer of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 doesn't change much also.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has quite improved graphics from the previous game, but doesn't have revolutionary upgrades, just small improvements. The water shaders are basically the same, I'm not even sure if those are shaders. Weapons models and characters has some improvements and changes in details. Performance are somewhat good, but not that good compared to the newer Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which on the same system has far better performance. I sometimes got very heavy stutters which lead to crash to dekstop.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, while not being a great sequel, the survival single player game mode is interesting to play, especially on cooperative. I still recommend this.Rating 6/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												The only reason I own this game is that I got it as a gift from someone else.Now, had COD4 and MW2 not already existed, I might be a little more enthusiastic about this game. I will admit that despite the blatant rehashing of MW2 assets (models, textures, even the bloody HUD), the campaign was entertaining enough to keep me going from start to finish. Soap and Price are both badasses. The scripted destruction events are admittedly well done and immersive. The weapons pack a lot of punch and feel satisfying to use. The plot, while predictable, is sufficiently intriguing and isn't riddled with cheesy dialogue. Still, it can't compare to the first Black Ops, which had quite a memorable campaign that I truly enjoyed.Unfortunately, the multiplayer, which was what kept me coming back to previous COD games, proved to be the same letdown that MW2 was.No dedicated servers if you want a ranked game. On a PC platform where latency is very noticeable thanks to everyone using a hyper-responsive keyboard and mouse, this is unacceptable. If everyone's connection is decent, then the experience is tolerable but still inferior to that of a dedicated server. Especially when a game supports up to 18 players, who don't necessarily all live in the same geographic region. It's most annoying when host migration occurs due to someone ragequitting or just experiencing an Internet blackout. There's a reason why even some co-op games like Left 4 Dead use dedicated servers despite the considerably lower player count - the performance is just so much better that way!COD also pretty much kickstarted the modern trend of charging $15 USD for a handful of maps as DLC, instead of letting the community make their own custom maps. Now, paid DLC isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all during the CD-ROM days we were happily buying expansion packs for games, which were smaller than sequels but added a great deal of extra content that made the price worth it. Starcraft Brood War, the original Half-Life expansions, Command and Conquer Generals, etc, all would qualify as ""worthwhile DLC"". However, COD's DLC is nothing but level geometry that any dedicated modder could slap together in his spare time. It's not an expansion pack and not worth it at all. At least when Overkill Software (Payday 2) does DLC, they allow non-owners to access the DLC if the server host owns it ,which keeps the community together. Not exactly my cup of tea, but a lot fairer than the COD DLC model that has sadly infected Battlefield and other once-great series.Garbage games like MW3 don't even deserve to be pirated. Pirating the game would send a message to IW/Activision that the product is popular/desirable. Unfortunately, looking at current trends COD is going to be here for a very long time.

												Very great campaign experience, nice graphics, nice solo game experience. But in the other way I had very very very bad multiplayer experience. You can find at least 1 hacker in 80% of the games you will play, and there is no reporting method I can use as they win their battles and rune your leaderboard. Well, DOTA2 is a free game with 3 milion online users and it have almost 0% hackers!! Is that so hard for you on a 60 USD game!? I always get connection timeout from server (the only game that dose that) and can’t reconnect, and I need to fix my NAT manually, wow guys.In the end I do recommend Call of Duty MW 1, 2 and 3 for their great story and campaign. Yet, no one dare to buy this game to play online, because you can’t, its multiplayer was built for hackers.			",23,1,0,1,1,0,1

												I wrote a review last week but my internet disconnected when I clicked ""post review."" Because of that, I am going to make this redo a too long, didn't read version.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is what you expect from the Modern Warfare series but with a more Transformer approach to it. Anything and everything will be done over-the-top and there are explosions everywhere. The single player is very cheesy in the storyline and does not bring anything new other than an all out war. It's extremely bland and has repetitive levels. The opposite happens in the Special Ops, where there is indeed some improvements. There is more co-op missions and a survival wave mode added. Not a bad addition to the game at all, however, it does use a ranking system in order to unlock new weapons. Multiplayer is the same as usual but with new maps and the reintroduction of the game list first seen in MW1. Guns have more attachments. Attachments have gotten a redesign that has reduced the size of the reticle, allowing a player see more and thus kill more. However, they have also increased the ""recoil/flinch"" when getting hit by an enemy. Previously when hit, the reticle jumps a little bit; now it jumps, I estimate, 1/4 to 1/5th of the total screen size. This means that, when hit, you will not be able to kill your enemy because you will be aiming into the sky. Overall, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is an ok sequel and finish to the story of Price. It brings a some old, some new features back.Obligatory Score: 7/10* * * Did a bit of searching and found my original review as it did not post correctly to Steam. Here it is, in all its glory. Originally posted on 24 October 2014 * * *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the first time I've played a Call of Duty game and though ""wow, this is so stupid."" I have played the first two games in the series and was finally able to get this a year after finishing Modern Warfare 2. In comparison, both games are highly similar in that the textures, storyline, voice, multiplayer, etc are all the same but with some tweaks. Modern Warfare 3 brings a continued storyline, a different style of Spec Ops, more guns and attachments, and the return of matchmaking. The storyline is what I hated the most out of anything. It's so over the top and ""Transformers""-like, where anything and everything will be cliche and filled with explosions. Every level is pretty much a repeat the of the last and it gets boring, fast. Spec Ops is revamped so that there's a bit of variety and not just the challenges from Modern Warfare 2. There are plenty of guns as in the last game and many have been improved to look better, however, recoil, when hit, has gone up by a lot. When playing on hardened or veteran, the huge jump in aim when hit pretty much means you are going to die.Overall, the game is just an updated Modern Warfare 2. That's really all it is. Modern Warfare 3 is still fun, but the storyline is too over-the-top.Obligatory Score: 7/10			",283,33,14,27,18,1,30

												Pretty great game, the graphics still look pretty good and the multiplayer still works fine. Obviously most people prefer MW2, but this holds up pretty well too.The price is pretty steep on Steam, so I got it from a third party key seller. I would wait until this is discounted before getting or do what I did since the price tag is far too much for a game released 6 years ago, other than that I'd recommend getting this game if you've never played it or if you have played it, since it brings back lots of great memories.

												Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is an action FPS singleplayer and multiplayer game developed by Activision in 2011.Probably the best singleplayer Call Of Duty game in my opinion. Singleplayer is a finale of the Modern Warfare campaign, with a satisfying ending, and lots of awesome missions. A lot of crucial plot twists and heartbreaking moments im not going to spoil.Multiplayer is a bit of a downside of this game. Because this game is a bit old, the multiplayer world has been over taken by cheaters and modders, which ruin the game. But if you manage to find a lobby without cheaters, you can still enjoy the multiplayer experience pretty well. You can be overpowered with pretty much everything. A shotgun, smg, rifle, launcher, pistol or just a knife. Community is a bit bad in this game, due to a huge amount of 12 year old kids that slept with almost every mother in earth. And if not the kids, then surely the tryhards, that dont let you to spawn, and they instantly kill you.Overall, I rate this game 7 / 10. Awesome single player experience, but Multiplayer is in a bad shape right now. Same with almost every call of duty thats older than Advanced Warfare.			",52,2,0,1,1,0,2

												Two years ago, I wrote a quick review. Now, I want to expand it.Modern Warfare 3 takes where the previous game left you. Soap, the hero of Modern Warfare and the captain of the former Team 141, is badly wounded. Price and him escape thanks to Nikolai but you're followed by the fanatics under Makarov's order. Makarov? He's a mad Russian terrorist, an ultra-nationalist that attacked his own people in an airport to trigger a war against USA - though Shepherd, the general commanding Soap's unit isn't really a stranger to that. Anyway, after Shepherd's betrayal and death, Price and Soap are considered as war criminals. But it doesn't mean that they're going to stay without searching to clear their name. They're helped by Yuri, a man that hates Makarov with a passion. And during that time, Frost, a US soldier, will also participate to the battles of his life in USA and Europe....To understand the settings of Modern Warfare, it's strongly recommended to play Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 as you'll find characters appearing in all these games. Or also just to understand the background.Modern Warfare 3 will make you play Soap, though briefly, Yuri, the Russian that will follow Price and Soap into their missions, Frost, battling against Russians in USA and Europe and under Sandman's command - Sandman being an ancient member of Team 141, Harkov, a Russian bodyguard for the President, Burns, a SAS member pursuing terrorists in London and Price for the last mission of Modern Warfare.As usual, the goal is to make sure your objectives are done, without being killed (you don't have an health meter, so the only way to survive is to retreat and let the screen coming back to normal), with  people to protect. You're not alone, you always have friends with you (Soap and Price when you're Yuri, Sandman and his squad when you're Frost, etc..).True, it's a Call of Duty, so don't expect anything making a full use of your brain (only when you need not to be spotted). And I still don't like a too nervous gameplay but you're getting used to it. Though good luck in Veteran...However, the places you're visiting are really great: from Paris to Berlin by New York or Siberia...A Call of Duty wouldn't be a Call of Duty if you don't loose some teammates or get your own character killed (will you be surprised that Makarov is also behind some kills?). The most shocking death will surprise you because you never thought that he would be killed off. Call of Duty, it's like the Walking Dead (the comic) or Games of Throne: you never know who will be killed or spared.The graphics are marvelous. The music is badass.And you still have the mode where you can play alone or with a friend.Modern Warfare 3 is really a good Call of Duty. Not really innovating, but the war seen by different points of view, knowing that each mission is tied to the previous one (ex: Price, Soap and Yuri got information, they've relayed it to the right people and Sandman and his squads are assigned on a mission based on that intel).Oh yeah, the multiplayer? I don't play. No way. The CoD community is too... competitive to my tastes.Go ahead, you can buy it eyes closed.... if you own MW and MW2. Else you will never understand the universe unless you read all the facts on the wiki.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												I finally got to play this a couple years after watching an epic demo at the launch of the game, it was the level in the London underground and I couldn't resist playing a war game in such familiar locations, like the actual London, Berlin and Paris but I had to wait for the mac port and a bundle price drop. In the meantime I played all the rest of the series and when I got to MW3 and was playing through the chaos of this WW3 modern mayhem I was increasingly afraid that the campaign would end prematurely (like in the MW series) when you start getting infiltration missions in random bunkers outside of the main cities where the action takes place. And it did, the campaign seems shorter than the one in MW2, which I didn't think was physically possible. I runs only about 7h on 'hardened' and doesn't have much versatility. Sure SPEC OPS is now fully fleshed out with missions that run parallel to the storyline (saving Elena, playing bomb squad in Berlin like in 'The Hurt Locker', covering your team mate with air support while he advances on the ground) but most of the gameplay is straight point, shoot, cover with very little strategy. The original COD games were about securing zones so that your troops could advance and take over the cities from the Germans in WW2, you felt you were progressing through the geography and everything felt grounded and cohesive. Here you're just running like crazy from checkpoint to checkpoint and everything seems rushed. Ultimately the game feels like a missed opportunity because imagining a WW3 scenario with similar mechanics of the original would have been grand (you get glimpses of it while covering in between tanks in Berlin or advancing through Paris) but the game remains as superficial in gameplay as in storyline. I'm well aware that many just purchase the game for the multiplayer, and shooting each other in the those city maps sure is fun, but if only the game was as good as it's marketing it would be truly spectacular.PS: Also Spec ops is not Mac/PC compatible (MP is obviously), which means mac gamers will have an almost impossible time finding a partner. Aspyr ported Bordelands 2 and it's cross-platform, not getting this mode right for all COD series really sucks.			",218,26,0,17,5,0,12

												I really enjoyed the Campaign and Special Ops but the multiplayer, I can't stand. The multiplayer are filled with players who uses hacks and aimbot. I had this game since 2011 and there wern't really much hackers because usually when a COD game gets released after a couple months, people can't really hack at all, but after almost a year, I find so much hackers and cheaters. I bet now in 2014 there will be more hacks then ever.So yeah, good Campaign and Special Ops. But, bad Multiplayer.(My Opinons)			",148,9,1,4,4,1,5

												I have played this game multiple times on the xbox360 when it first came out. So I decided to buy it on PC since my xbox is about to fall apart. I hop into multiplayer and I find an hacker. Next game hacker and it goes on. Now obviously I could just download the dedicated servers tool but no. I like the classic way the game is meant to be played. I have had a couple of lobby's that were legit. And I have been called a hacker because I was lvl 4 and won a FFA. Shows the community's braindead heads. The singleplayer is fine though. I personally play survival anyways.So if you want a good FPS without alot of cheaters, I would suggest something like cs:go (even though they're comm. is toxic too) or Overwatch.

												The gameplay is as good as all the previous CoD games I have played and the story and new gameplay mechanics (such as vehicles underwater) adds to the depth of the experience. The multiplayer is also very good. I recommend this for any casual gamer who enjoys games that have some story and enjoy multiplayer. For those of you running Intel Integrated Graphics, it runs very smootly with graphics set at medium to low :) Hope that helps...			",93,19,4,13,13,4,11

												The third part of the Modern Warfare series doesn't really stand out with anything new. The only thing to note is the big arsenal avaible in the multiplayer. There isn't really much to say to it. I enjoyed the multiplayer a bit after release. But soon the CoD community once again turned out as it always did. Overall a stable, standard shooter. If it's that what you're looking for go ahead. If you are looking for a good CoD, I recommend sticking with CoD4.    - V.Wassiliew			",78,6,0,11,2,0,5

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 uses a less appealing version of the graphic engine used in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.The spawns in the multiplayer makes the game impossible to play, you can never be certain that your back is secured. You can not rely on simple tactics like securing an area. The entire game franchise went from epic battles with realism in mind to a constant intensive scene in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Distances and weapon damages makes it impossible to move around in groups, rather forcing everyone to be a lone wolf running around like a complete maniac. The game franchise went down the hill after the release of Modern Warfare 2, and it has continued to fall ever since. There is much more to be said, how 95% of enemy contact is within a 5 meter range, or that they suck your wallet dry with unrealistic ""gun skins"" and rushed expansion packs. But the worst thing would be the maps. They are an everlasting Labyrinth of confusion. And why are the maps located at a mall, why would 18 special operation soldiers fight over a shopping mall?We who remember the epic desert battles on the Toujane map in Call of Duty 2 can comprehend what todays kids are missing out on. And, of course, the majority of the players are 8-12 year old kids who screams in the microphones and does ""trickshots"".			",9,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't say much about this game. Other than it's shabby storyline that sucked, there were little bits I liked. The survival was pretty okay, it didn't wow me. The Spec ops missions were slightly good, kinda changed how it was played. I still don't get why Infinity Ward make you play as mute characters right until a cutscene (e.g. In Black Ops, Alex Mason talked in between points and not just the cutscenes and even say little bits like ""Tango Down"" or ""FRAG OUT!!""). The scene after the friend dies [for reasons of spoilers, I'm not saying who], Yuri is grabbed by Captain Price and he demands to tell him about Makarov and Yuri does not talk until the cutscenes happen. It's a big WTF to me. So no, I don't recommend this game. You're better off playing the classic Call of Duty games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite multiplayer games in the COD franchise. Unlocking weapons, camos, and other things is fun and challenging. Unfortunatly, I do come across a hacker every once in a while, but it isn't anything too bad. The game still has a good amount of people playing daily, but you're pretty much limited to Team Deathmatch. Overall, a great game; it is probably the last good boots-to-ground COD game Activision has published.			",102,5,0,6,11,5,3

												I played Modern Warfare 3 on the 360 when it came out (2011) and enjoyed it a lot at the time. Multiplayer is great fun, and the campaign was a decent finish to the trilogy. But now. In 2016. I feel conflicted in recommending it purely because you'll find it hard to string together more than one multiplayer game because of a lack of players, and the campaign itself is definitely one of the weakest of the series. Bearing that it mind, and the fact spec ops can still always be done with a friend, I would recommend picking this up on a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: Its okay, more like a drawn out ending to MW2 rather than a progressive step forward. Overall: 7/10 Campaign, 4/10 multiplayerHere's a summary of the campaign without spoilers:-play as Delta-hide behind tanks, shoot stuff in the street-call in airstrikes-repeat-objective completed, cutscene-play as TF 141-go in stealthy-cover blown, go loud-repeat-objective completed, cutsceneMultiplayer: Few people play it, and the ones that do are using aimbots and some kind of auto-killstreak hack. There's no legit competition and no fun to be had there.Spec Ops: Decent and adds a few extra hours of playFull Review:There aren't really any alternative FPS games that come as close to a cinematic war experience as the CoD franchise. However, that's not to say Activision hasn't gotten lazy. MW3 improves on very little from MW2. In fact, many of the games resources and gameplay/map elements are blatantly recycled from CoD4 and MW2; to make up for this, the devs added several shiny atmospheric effects like jet fly-bys and national landmarks in the background to give the player a sense of large-scale battles/importance. Character development hardly exists in this one; it doesn't attach you to new characters and relies heavily on prior knowlege of events in MW2 and the relationship between Price and Soap. Yuri gets a small bit of background time, but you never really get to know Delta and that's where the devs missed an opportunity for a real impactful emotional experience. Its still fun to shoot bad guys and see large objects get blown up though, so buy it on sale if you've played MW2 and want closure. ",363,34,9,31,21,2,21

												To be honest, I didn't really like this one. Yeah, it's kinda good, but comparing this to MW2 or even MW1 we can see a decent difference. First of all, graphics, why so soapy, mate? All Call Of Duties have same kinda graphics, but now it feels really outdated. What to say about SinglePlayer? It...well a bit of interesting, but not so charming as in MW1, more global in a sense, but for me Modern Warfare is more of a hidden war than WW3 to be honest. Multiplayer seems boring as hell and for Call Of Duty unnessesarily complicated. The only thing I liked here, was Survival Mode, which tends to be interesting, I believe first 5 hours at most. So, yeah, I got Extended Edition with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ poster for 33$ and I say it's not worth that at all. Maybe for a game in general it's good, but total failure among CoDs. 5/10			",161,33,5,11,14,1,17

Before I provide my reasons for not recommending, let me provide you a solution to both Multiplayer & Singleplayer FOV:As Infinity Ward has ditched the ability to let us bind keys for commands such as FOV, Viewmodel positioning, No HUD, Noclip & such entirely from all modes of play (Unless you ""inject"" a custom program that enables Developer Console support, which I haven't managed to get working, so I'm not able to recommend it), there's now the MW3 FOV Changer, which gives you the ability to adjust FOV from 65° (Default) to 100° for both Singleplayer & Multiplayer equally. Instructions are simple: Just boot up the MW3 FOV Changer tool, launch the Main Game or Multiplayer from it, and whatever FOV you set it to in it's range, will always be played in the game. You can use the Numpad keys to adjust it in game manually if you desire, but simply typing your choice FOV (90.00 for example) will instantly apply in-game.This should not get you VAC-Banned, as Infinity Ward officially condones it's use: https://community.callofduty.com/thread/200397140#205674719I'd like to once and for all give Infinity Ward's stance on this subject.We do not mind if a PC user has the FOV changer mod.We also do not ban anyone that is using the FOV mod.EDIT: Just had confirmation that Valve also does not issue bans for FOV changer.You can download the tool from it's source here: http://www.mapmodnews.com/filemgmt/index.php?id=281And this video will demonstrate how to use it in seconds & spend about 2mins demonstrating it's effect:

Right, with that cleared up.My ReviewOnce upon a time, a friend kindly lent me his Xbox 360 copy of this game for me to try. I played through the singleplayer, and finished it bored out of my mind minus a couple of laughs here & there. And unable to log into multiplayer due to needing a Call of Duty Elite account (If I recall that correctly), I never even got to try what I wouldn't play anyway with Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mess very much in mind. I thought I'd never spent a penny on this game in my lifetime.But it turns out, I did. I found other value for the game on PC, notably in the extractable audio files, so I bought it & did my thing. Then, many months later, I decided to see if there was any PC specific features to give it merit like the Developer Commands did for Call of Duty 4 & Modern Warfare 2. Turns out, there isn't (Without third-party tools I haven't figured how to get working), although the FOV Changer tool makes it very playable for me as someone who gets eye-strain & headaches within minutes due to the limited 65° default FOV.It also runs well, it's visually satisfactory & I like the improvements in sound assets & design where it's been made.SingleplayerSo I played the singleplayer again. And I remembered why throughout the entire singleplayer, I was bored throughout. The sheer absence of novelty. Infinity Ward does essentially repeat Call of Duty 4's playbook a third-time, and forces in notes from Modern Warfare 2's playbook, which in itself followed Call of Duty 4's playbook while cranking it to 11. Although Call of Duty does often make for good dumb fun, this in particular was so dumb it was numbing.And such repeated ""stunts"" including watching a child dying, just to try to get that controversial factor ""No Russian"" got, falls completely flat on it's face. And on occasions where civilians enter gameplay to be a gameplay obstacle, they quite often are in enemy & ally's firing line and simply get mowed down by both anyway. I'd say how I found this rather distasteful (As well as pointless on numerous occasions), but I think it's better to state this as an example to the laziness in design behind this game, even when taking into account Infinity Ward was having staff troubles due to the Infinity Ward-Activision Lawsuit)I'm aware not many play Call of Duty for the Singleplayer, and have good reason to. But what has often made for good dumb fun, this time, it's just so utterly dumb it's unenjoyable. I personally consider it the franchise's worst single-player experience second to Call of Duty: Ghosts (Which I haven't played due to the fact I have zero intent on giving money to such an awfully running port).MultiplayerI can't offer much here. I never got access to it during my Xbox 360 play, and I'm not interested in trying now. I do hear it added some interesting game modes such as ""Kill Confirmed"", which did stick for future games and removed a number of trouble-causing perks such as Stopping Power. It takes very much after Modern Warfare 2, so if you did endup a fan of Black Ops' COD Points unlock system like myself, you'll probably be disappointed. I don't have anything further I can provide comment on.Spec Ops (Co-Op)I never gave this a try neither. I had my fun with Modern Warfare 2's Spec Ops mode, so I had no desire to jump into this again, even with the Horde-Mode like missions added into it.VerdictCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a game very much starved of novelty in comparison to it's predecessors & Treyarch's entries made before it. It was a game that bored me throughout every minute I played it.It may run well, be jam-packed with explosive visuals, crazy setpieces, grand audio assets, but there's just nothing here I haven't already seen before.Perhaps the Multiplayer & Spec Ops modes do infact hold more novelty & balance than I presume, but in the end, Call of Duty fans, there's plenty of far better entries in the franchise you could be playing instead, especially for the high-worth Activision maintains as long & relentlessly as it possibly can, until it does occasionly join a big Steam sale event or make it's own. So if you want this game, keep your eyes peeled for those sales.			",119,13,1,4,2,2,1

												This review is mostly for the single player component.The story started off engaging and fantastic (read: unbelievable but fun) in the first game, and became a little more ridiculous in the next. By this game, the story doesn't even make sense.It's as if someone thought up a bunch of neat things for a trailer, and then tried to weave them together with whatever half-baked excuse they could conjure.The entire campaign plays ""like a movie"", meaning it's bearable on a solid run through. There is no replayability in any campaign mission. No mission stands out as the ""I want to play that one again"" type (Even MW2 had a few of those). There are lengthy on-rails sections in every mission where you don't have control of your character, and are forced to listen to other characters talk at you while enjoying the beautifully constructed scenery.Ultimately, Modern Warfare 3 would make an average action movie, but as a game, it's forgotten that players should still actually play.

Lots to do, the story mode is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat a lot of the times ;) Multiplayer is a love and hate situation, sometimes ruined by cheaters, other times ruined by people new (or not very good) to the game who rage after being killed.

The worst Call of Duty game in the Modern Warfare series and my most dissapointing Call of Duty in the entire franchise.The game was not worth the full price when it first released and it's not worth the full price now either.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is not a bad game. It is very dissapointing however. Many flaws of the previous titles still remain in the multiplayer, the community seems to be even worse and the campaign...is just dull.CoD: MW3 is not the worst in the franchise *coughGhostscough* but it's the last CoD game i had high expectations for...and it just failed to deliver them making it my most dissapointing Call of Duty so far. I pretty much gave up on Call of Duty after this title altho i still enjoyed Black Ops 2 alot and i'm still planning on buying Advanced Warfare.But back to the review...The CampaignSurprise! The campaign is 6-8h long even on the hardest difficulty! Who saw that coming, eh ? I'd usually whine about short singleplayer campaigns but in this case it's actually a good thing.MW3 campaign is soo boring and tedious that after the first couple of missions it just feels like a chore not something you would do for fun.The storyline is trying to impress you too hard but it's actually just another shallow cliche story with one ""oh my god! did they really just do that to HIM"" moment.The only characters in the game are Makarov, Soap and Price. Everyone else is just your typical soldiers with no backround. The game also takes you all across Europe trying to mix up locations but every single country feels exactly the same. Modern Warfare 2 knew how to mix up levels: Stealthy snow section, hostage rescue on an oil rig, urban fighting in the U.S.A or guerilla fighting in shanty town. Sounds good ?Well, that's not what you'll get in this game. Just urban warfare in Europe and every city has the same looking buildings, same feel and...Well, the scenery won't change at all. The objectives are pretty much the same aswell. The campaign is bland and dissapointing.5/10 at best.The Co-opThis is where Modern Warfare 3 shines! It has different co-op missions with different objectives in it, just like in Modern Warfare 2.It also adds a whole new Survival Mode and a leveling system. You can level up and unlock gear for the survival mode.Each survival map has it's each unique waves and ""bosses"". Co-op is what makes up for everything bad in the rest of the game. It's just that fun! ...If you have a friend to play it with. Otherwise forget about it.9/10 - Could be better.The MultiplayerNot only is the singleplayer campaign worse than in MW1 and MW2. The multiplayer is quite similar to what MW2 had...Just a little bit worse.However, if you have to choose between playing multiplayer in here or in MW2 then choose MW3. Why ? It's easier to find matches in MW3, it has a (dead) server list and surprisingly less hacked lobbies. Modern Warfare 3 used to have more hackers / hacked lobbies than MW2 but the tides have changed. Sure, this game has it's share of hackers. I've encountered at least 5 in my 79h of multiplayer gametime. But i've only seen 1 hacked lobby so far. You can at least double the numbers in MW2.The map designs are pretty poor. The worst i've seen in a CoD game so far. There are like 2-3 good maps...Or should i say DECENT maps but the rest...They have nothing on the previous MW titles. Hell, even Blops and Blops2 have better maps in them.Noobtubes still remain as do last stand, riot shields, grenade spams and random knife ""OH MY GAWD"" kills. Russians and kids roam around screaming and yelling. If you do a bit better than everyone else in the lobby then you're a ""confirmed hacker"". It's easier just to mute everyone as soon as you get into a lobby. Save yourself from the headache.7/10 - It's the worst multiplayer in the Modern Warfare series but it's still good, it's alive, has less hackers than in MW2 and Nukes can't finish matches. Do you want to play MW2 in multiplayer but hate hackers ? Get this game!Overall score: 7/10 ",707,129,45,70,35,10,64

												as an FPS 3/5 starsas a COD game, 5/5Its adequate as fps go, amazing as COD games go.For some reason it can't be minimized, literally EVERY other game I've owned can be minimized, but this one can't, and it really bugs me. The weapon system unlocks are just so tedious, it feels monotonous and just not veri intuitive, the controls are overly complex and awkward, there are (IMO) way to many weapons/attachments available, its just an unlock fest, not particularly to my taste. I'm more a class based fps kinda gal, but still, the COD series in general just pushes my buttons, that being said this is undoubtedly the best in the COD series (at least recently).Per usual with COD games its overall community is awful, don't recommend using voice chat, just saying hello can get a whole crowd of people cursing at you, probably they hear me and go ""oh its a girl playing cod, ill go be a pervert to her"". I have personally been trolled, inappropriately flirted with, and even threatened to be hacked in this game just for admitting I'm a girl.I know I shouldn’t judge an entire community on a few (very) bad apples, and that the game can’t be held responsible for players actions,  but when I can’t play a game because of other players behavior its an issue.So overall a mediocre game with a largely horrible player base, don't buy it if you’re not an immature jerk (if you think you can ignore it then go ahead and try). If you’re a little less tolerant of creeps than you should buy another game if you want a good fps(/tps) with a nice fanbase of people who aren't bigamists.			",66,8,1,7,8,0,9

												SOLID ENDING TO THE MW TRILOGYThe COD franchise started a steady decline after WAW (in my opinion, the campaigns of MW2 and BlackOps were messy and over-the-top) but MW3 brought some of the magic of COD 1 , 2 and 4 MW back. The campaign really feels like a WWIII-type scenario (ultranationalist Russia vs NATO), many of the levels are EPIC, and, while the ending feels like an epilogue (yes, the Makarov's death controversy) the rest of the game is just so ♥♥♥♥in' streamlined and addictive.Solo operations are fun as always and multiplayer is solid if you can get past the geeks and weekend keyboard warriors.Possibly the last good COD game: BOII, Ghosts, AW are just bad, style over substance, and way too many futuristic nonsense; BOII being playable in my opinion, unlike Ghosts and Advanced Nonsense)For some reason (young teens?), the post-MW3 COD games sold-are selling VERY well, but MW3 truly marks the end of the line for me, unless the company releases something truly innovative and perfect.8,5/10 ",77,6,4,12,11,0,14

												It's hard to describe my overwhelming appreciation for this game, I honestly dont even know where to start.As stated in my reviews of the Modern Warfare game, I'm just going to say the multiplayer is great. However this one I especially spent a lot of time on as a kid on the Xbox 360. While I would assume at this point hackers are everywhere on this game, I cannot back that statement up because I do not play multiplayer on the PC. I can however say the experience with it I had on the 360 was great. This Multiplayer is the perfect equilibrium between practical and futuristic, which Isnt very ""futuristic"" at all tbh ;). Overall for Multiplayer its just a fun competitive experience, at least it was on the 360 for me.Now onto the kicker.The story is the part I have trouble expaining how good it is without repeating myself. So I will just say it is one of the most dynamic, interesting, suspensful, and downright outstanding stories I've ever played. While it does have it's flaws, it is completely made up for by the ending of this game. I can't stress enough how fantastic the Modern Warfare series is as a whole in the story department, so I will leave it at this...If you havent played it, you are missing out bigtime, it is far better than any other story in any FPS in my personal opinion.The game itself is fine, graphics are decent, engine is alright, and its easy to run on the card I played it on (GTX 750 Ti). I dont play these games for the functionality of it however, the story makes it not matter to me.Once again, great game here. If you dont have it you should. The story will leave you content and you wont regret the rage inducing gameplay if you play on a hard difficulty ;).10/10			",25,2,0,6,3,1,0

												The 8th iterration in Activision's long running game series, MW3 is a major letdown to all Call of Duty fans. The onrail singleplayer, the fun-stripped multiplayer and the lack of major innovation all contribute to this feeling. However, there are some things done right, if not many.Starting with the singleplayer, it continues the trend of mindless action initiated with MW2. This would not be that much of a problem, as even some of the best titles in the series (CoD4, CoD2) don't have the most complex storylines, but in this  game it feels like the developpers first thought of what cool set piece they should introduce and built around that, when they should've made something more contextually appropriate (the example closest to mind is the mission where you use an armed ROV to effortlessly destroy the enemy). Most of the gimmicks that you see in singleplayer are put there because Sledgehammer Games wanted to justify various killstreaks that you can use in multiplayer. Despite all this, there is one small flash of brilliance in the campaign of MW3 and that is its ending mission. While it may not be amongst the most memorable in the series (Hill 400 in CoD2, Heat in CoD4, Vendetta and the final mission in CoD WaW), it certainly stands on its own as a fairly satisfying conclusion to the Modern Warfare series and it is quite a fun ride.Moving on, let's talk about the multiplayer which is mostly a mix of good and bad. One major complaint I have with the game is the levels on weapons and the need to earn XP for each weapon in order to unlock Proficiencies and attachments for it. This is a step in the complete wrong direction, even after Treyarch nailed it with the ability to buy which attachment or camo you want. Furthermore, the Proficiencies you can unlock for each weapon create massive disparities between newer and older players. This is most visible when using shotguns which have 2 Proficiencies that are vital: Range and Damage. Both of these are gained at  the last levels of the weapon, a decision I find most absurd. You will have to play most of your first 40 levels without them, which makes it really hard for you to perform with shotguns, especially the weaker AA-12. To make things worse, deathstreaks have returned, worse than ever, there even being a killstreak that shows you were your killer is. However, there were quite a few ""innovations"" introduced, such as the new killstreak system and the new gamemodes (Kill Confirmed, One in the Chamber, Gun Game etc.). The former is a pretty big improvement, making it possible to set custom killstreaks for each individual class. Also, they are now divided into 3 categories: Offensive (identical to the previous system), Support (similar to the Offensive, but the streak is not lost upon death) and Specialist (instead of killstreaks you gain perks and at 8 kills you unlock all the perks). There is also the MOAB, which is attained by getting 25 points in a row (kills from other killstreaks dont count, making Specialist the best option for people who aim for this). In addition, the newly added Kill Confirmed mode is one of the best ever made in the series (you win by obtaining a number of points for your team; points are gained by collecting tags dropped upon death by enemies; enemies can deny you tags by picking them from their fallen comrades). The multiplayer is pretty fun for a while, but it gets boring much faster than its predecessors, making the initial investment less worth it.However, the best component by far is Special Ops. It has missions that have no connection to the storyline of the game, but they are very enjoyable and can also be completed solo if one would want a more challenging experience. These are a blast and made me reminisce about the missions in CoDs past, surpassing their singleplayer counterparts. There is also a sort of horde mode, which pits against opponents that become tougher with each round that passes and you can buy weapons much like you could in the zombie modes in CoD WaW, BO and BO2.Regarding technical aspects, the game ran fairly well, rarely dropping frames, but it also doesn't have much graphical fidelity to show, sporting the same recycled game engine since CoD2. It somehow manages to look worse than its 2 closest predecessors, MW2 and BO.To conclude, MW3 is a fairly mediocre game, even amongst its own series. Its campaign is shallow and painfully linear, the multiplayer is fun, but for a really short time and the game as a whole is hardly an improvement in any way over the games it succedes. If I were to rate it, I would give it a 6/10, a buy barely suited to the long time CoD fans, let alone the average gamer.			",114,19,3,10,8,0,17

General Information:Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is still one of my favourite games, I've spent over 3,000+ hours playing the game on the PlayStation® 3, playing it on PC has a much better experience because it doesn't lack the amount of quality compared to the PlayStation® 3.Additional Notes:I hope they make a remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in the future but make no adjustments to the game, any Call of Duty game made after Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 has really been a failure in my opinion, if they were to remaster it, I'd definitely buy it!Reviews: http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/gnade/recommended ",24,2,0,0,2,0,1

												Untill some months ago I really liked this game, and enjoyed playing it, but that was untill the hackers started to appear everywhere...Now the hackers have really ruined this wonderfull game, since they now appear in every single one of the servers. So I really hope the creators of this game will take up the fight with the hackers and do something about it, to make the game what it was before (a wonderfull game), and let the ones who does not use hacks enjoy the game again. At this point with all of the hackers in the game I would really not recommend the game....This would be a whole nother story if there were no hackers.			",6,1,0,0,6,0,0

												I have had this game on PS3 and have enjoyed it a lot. Unfortunately my PS3 got RLOD and I couldnt play anymore. I bought MW3 for 5 eur because it is one of the last interesting Call of Duty title.  Singleplayer: - The Modern Warfare triology has a best story compared to other Call of Duty. - The player would feel attached to mostly every character, protagonists and antagonists alike: Soap, Price, Makarov.- Classic american piece of proganda: USA got struck down but heroically fought back and save the world singlehandedly (the whole Europe is taken out easily), with of course, pure evil, warmonging Russians who wants to dominate the world but are brought to their knee while begging for peace treaty. Spec-ops/Co-op :- The spec-ops missions are carefully designed.- The survival mode has no story like in Zombies Mode. just survive wave-to-wave until you die. Also, the gameplay is pretty much straightforward: unlock armories, weapons, perks through progression and I expected a Zombies like gameplay with sci-fi guns. Multilplayer: - Much fun with the multiplayer: fast-paced, casual gameplay.- There are always something new but nothing really changed. Conclusion :- In the time, it was good, I enjoyed it a lot. Battlefield manage to surpass Call of Duty from that point forward, and I played Battlefield eversince. It is recommeded if the game is on sale and < 10 eur with a score of 7/10.			",73,2,0,3,3,0,1

												Great over-all game. Campaign, spec ops and mutiplayer were all great to play once again, I remember playing this when I was younger on console. It's just nice to get back into it. Hackers are not as bad on here as previous CoD games, so that's a bonus. But my overall rating would have to be a  7/10			",124,10,3,9,7,0,3

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 meets expectations. The core elements of multiplayer and the campaign remain fundamentally unchanged, but the game serves as a great example of how many subtle tweaks can add up to an improved overall product. Some will be disappointed by the fact that MW3 is not a drastic departure from previous iterations of the series and that is a very valid criticism. MW3 still offers so much content and still proves to be one of the best online experiences around. MW3 is a game that will certainly keep you busy until some new cod release. Snipers are awesome. L118A Bolt Cancelling <3 MsR is also pretty good though I prefer L118A. And,lastly VAC is playing a great part in banning cheaters.			",462,106,21,60,27,6,38

												I'm gonna start off this review with the word No.No, and before you call of duty lovers start hating on me for all this just take into account that if you like this game that is strictly your opinion and I know I cannot stop you from downvoting this post but this is what I extracted from my gameplay.*SINGLE PLAYER*Playing the campaign on this game is not as fun as slowly sawing off your testicles with a butter knife. The storyline was purely milked for grief with all the death in it. With soap dying and all these slo motion bulls*** death scenes, really created no badass moments for me personally in the game. I remember the campaign of MW2 front to back because of one small reason, it was actually good. Now you will see people crying over the death's of some in the game, but all the company will notice from me is 60 dollars less then their normal standard. The graphics are grainy and dissapointing to view. There was no uniqueness in any of the new guns and if there was any, it was a bad uniqueness. *MULTIPLAYER*Now the maps for mw3 to your surprise I actually didn't completely hate, as I watched how they urged a slightly 3-laned maps but slightly not was okay, but still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. They maintained some of their secret ledges and spots that were on mw2 previously. But the influence of so many hackers shows that the company does not give two walking cat craps about their community base and they just wanted to push the game out for money. Also considering that its the PC copy doenst help much with the overall give-a-sh** level. The pc servers are mostly laggy and not satisfying to play on. The characters move too fast and it feels like your health level is lower than my expectations for black ops 3. The gun camos are all crappy and sandpapery. Along with the guns and the changes to them, they all seem the same like I said earlier and don't exemplify the right work being done when fired. They all♥♥♥♥♥♥me off when I shoot them and half the time lag and glitch and make me reload a few times before it works. Its all sandy and seems like they are just paper guns with some low quality texturing on it. For the DLC portion, they were so out of ideas for good maps that they had to bring back old maps to make people like their new game more. Why not make new maps that people will want to see more of instead of bring back the old ones like Terminal.*Spec ops*MW2 spec ops was alright but you can't expect people to like mediokre a second time. The missions were kind of boring and annoying to complete. I did enjoy the rank up system though that was a pretty cool feature that ties in with survival.*Survival*I didn't like it but at least it wasn't an early access open world survival gamemode.This game is like dropping a cake on the ground and picking up all the pieces off the ground and putting it back on the plate and serving it. It seems like they just took the MW2 game files and erased the 2 and added a 3 but replaced the old maps with sh*t maps.4/10 Would rather play my Wii.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can choose shield or weapon to wore at once.Story 9/10The story continues from MW1 MW2 to MW3, the story is timeline, easy to understand, and reflects how the war should be. The story also filled with sad moments and plot twistsMultiplayer 5/10Very inbalance, many hackers, proceed with caution.Co-op gameplay 9/10I think the best feature of MW3 is it's co-op gameplay, not only you can play missions with a friend, but also play survival, and unlike other survivals, this is not against zombies, but waves of attack, from soldier, dogs, juggernaut, helicopter, etcOverall: 8/10If this is on a discount, and your pc is not so powerful, this game is worth it, but still good for powerful pc, tho. This is the last of COD (checked on Dec 2015) which the story are easy to understand, anything newer is futuristic stuffs that i could not enjoyUpdate: This game played at 60-100 fps, smooth, in all extra quality setting with 2x MSAA with my Asus X550ZE laptop, old gaming laptop, with old R5 M230. Even other 3D FPS AAA titles does not run this fast on my pc.Run it fullscreen from start.			",477,164,18,100,65,14,87

												I approve this game!. To begin with, Modern warfare 3 is actually its predecessor but with some completed features. Don't expect radically complex changes. But what do i mean with completed features? Well, for example, survival mode, new weapons, different spec ops, some with a bit more innovative stuff and experience than others, etc. This game is at least very entertaining. I had a good time spent at this call of duty. I recommend it.Multiplayer? I don't know. I usually prefer Single player mode.			",34,0,0,1,3,0,2

The story also filled with sad moments and plot twistsMultiplayer 5/10Very inbalance, many hackers, proceed with caution.Co-op gameplay 9/10I think the best feature of MW3 is it's co-op gameplay, not only you can play missions with a friend, but also play survival, and unlike other survivals, this is not against zombies, but waves of attack, from soldier, dogs, juggernaut, helicopter, etcOverall: 8/10If this is on a discount, and your pc is not so powerful, this game is worth it, but still good for powerful pc, tho. This is the last of COD (checked on Dec 2015) which the story are easy to understand, anything newer is futuristic stuffs that i could not enjoyUpdate: This game played at 60-100 fps, smooth, in all extra quality setting with 2x MSAA with my Asus X550ZE laptop, old gaming laptop, with old R5 M230. Even other 3D FPS AAA titles does not run this fast on my pc.Run it fullscreen from start.			",477,164,18,100,65,14,87

												Derided by some and often touted as a Modern Warfare 2 clone, Modern Warfare 3 is actually a very good cap off to a fantastic series. There's nothing cloneworthy about this entry in the Call of Duty franchise as you fight back the Russian invasion in the United States and slog through varied environments with Price and Soap while you hunt for Makarov across the globe. The visuals are crisp enough and the atmosphere matches the tone and pace of the game perfectly. It feels like a world on the brink of annihilation. The audio adds to the feelings. From the guns firing to ambient effects all the way through the voice acting, it is superb and reflects well upon the art direction of the game.The story, for me, was an incredible finish to a powerful story arc. From the battles in New York and Germany to the slog through Africa and the backalleys of Prague, the story is fast and powerful. The turn in Prague is especially gripping as two of my favorite characters, Soap and Kamarov, meet savage ends. It was at that moment I kept playing until I finished the campaign and killed Makarov. The decision to kill two key characters from MW and MW2 was powerful and gave me a sense of urgency to find the man responsible. Never have I felt such satisfaction from finishing a villain. The only other villian that gave me that much enjoyment from finally killing was Jack from Borderlands 2. Truly, the story board direction was top notch and I give them high praise for giving us a gripping, powerful and semi-cinematic experience to enjoy.However, I know everyone loves the multiplayer more than the story. Even in this department, there's no shortage of things to do. While nearly MW2 2.0, there's enough differences in perks, weapons and equipment to keep from being too stale. Thankfully, silliness like Danger Close and Stopping Power did not make a resurgence in this iteration. Overall, I've enjoyed the MW3 multiplayer more than MW2. There's more modes and arguably better balance.I fully recommend this title. If you play for the story, make sure you play Modern Warfare 1 and 2 so you're up to speed. For you multiplayer fans looking for a fast, furious game, this will not disappoint.			",275,33,5,27,14,1,24

												Modern Warfare 3 is the last Great installment in the COD franchise. The multiplayer is very well balanced. Most of the maps are very well designed, the guns have been balanced very well to the point that it now is based on the players skill with the weapon not his spraying bullets. Sure you can spray bullets but good luck on ammo if that is all you do. Gun damage has been well balanced, just about all the hackers have at one point or another been vac banned and therefore are no longer active playing. I know this to be true as i checked some steam accounts and found them to be banned along with the fact that there was no more activity in the game. The game has been out for a long time but has many many players still. It is second place in players in the COD franchise.Single PlayerStory is very good continuing in the MW series of the story. I would have to say that my favorite storyline in the MW series was COD 4: Modern Warfare. But the story in this installment is still very good.I have over 800 hours in this game and i still play it. It is fun and if you have not purchased it you are really missing out :-)			",69,4,1,2,13,0,18

												One minor problem (if you care about this sort of thing) no other reviewers seem to have pointed out: stats for Spec Ops Mission and Survival modes played solo offline will not upload/update online, i.e. if you want your mission scores to count for ranking, you must play them online (solo or co-op) or else your highscores will not be listed (in case you want to compare them with your friends'). Also, there is a small bug in which your score might not be saved after finishing Fire Mission (online co-op), but it will still award however many stars you selected for difficulty after completion and count toward the ""Tactician"" and ""Overachiever"" achievements.Everything else has already been said.

												Buy this on sale for the campaign, the multiplayer is in such a state and has no anti cheat, coming across a legitimate game without cheaters is extremely rare. If you want a Modern Warfare multiplayer experience, buy MW2 instead.Luckily, as with all of the Modern Warfare games, the campaign is pretty fun if you're not playing on an easy difficulty.

Only issue is it's over runned by hackers now since it's old. Thanks Dev's for the eZ code so they can hack the crap out of it. Over all It's an amazing game. I only recommend you buy it if you can stand the hackers. Also, recommend you try Teknogods client for MW3 (Has a bit less hackers than steam version by the looks of it).			",15,0,0,1,1,0,0

Even in this department, there's no shortage of things to do. While nearly MW2 2.0, there's enough differences in perks, weapons and equipment to keep from being too stale. Thankfully, silliness like Danger Close and Stopping Power did not make a resurgence in this iteration. Overall, I've enjoyed the MW3 multiplayer more than MW2. There's more modes and arguably better balance.I fully recommend this title. If you play for the story, make sure you play Modern Warfare 1 and 2 so you're up to speed. For you multiplayer fans looking for a fast, furious game, this will not disappoint.			",275,33,5,27,14,1,24

												I don't regret the time I have played it (72 hours on singleplayer, 450 hours on multiplayer). I really enjoyed every minute. Too bad there are so much cheaters now. This is the last Call of Duty that is still good. It went from awesome, to good, to meh, to sh*t. An honest note to the developers: please stop making new games. Untill you can find a way to completely renew the gameplay, Call of Duty is dead.7/10			",25,0,1,1,3,0,0

												A highly satisfying finale to a breathtaking series. Set in an authentic, believable environment, Modern Warfare 3 brings to bear open armed conflict in real life locales like never before. The streets, buildings, posters and magazines in the local vendors bring a new degree of realism to the monitor. The weapon effects are superb and the stealth is highly suspenseful. The group dynamics are nigh on perfect. Each squad member coordinates expertely with the other and if you follow their lead and pick off enemies as they do, you can be a valuable member of the team. The enemy AI is challenging and will give you a hard time if you let them take cover and spread their numbers. Fortunately, your own and the advanced weapons at your disposal help even the odds nicely.Modern Warfare polishes the game engine in all the right places and heightens the tension with expertly written sudden events that can lead to your death if you fail to act quickly enough. In story this installment helps to finally put an end to the Russian threat once and for all in a very satisfying manner. It can be tough, especially for those who are new to squad shooters, but to play the game and finish it is a very worthwhile and rewarding experience.			",265,7,1,7,6,0,35

												One of the best games for the Multiplayer out of the infamous trio of Modern Warfare games, the only issue now is that if you are good at the game, you get labeled a hacker, it's illegal to be good at the game, you get threatened by salty whiners and if their sore losers, they attempt to knock you offline using a DDOS program, if you however get into a non-salty lobby, it's amazing, an all out fun fest especially when everyone is working together to beat the enemy, I would recommend this game, just beware of the salty cry babies!

												Out of the entire Call of Duty: Modern Warfare franchise, CoD: MW3 definitely provides the best multiplayer experience. The graphics are highly realistic, the maps are diversely different and well constructed and the many multiplayer gameplay modes can be altered to create even more custom gameplay modes! Weapon loadouts are very clearly organized and changing or creating your own custom loudouts is as easy as a few clicks. The choice of guns are great and the numerous gun modifications and upgrades make your weapons more personal and suited to your needs. Servers are created based on online players within a certain region who become automatically grouped together and a host is randomly chosen - which is a great idea because you never have to manually browse servers and you won't end up in a server by yourself! Achievements are as awesome as they can get and the slow-mo final killshot replay at the end of each round is epic - especially if it was you who made the kill!			",35,1,1,0,3,0,2

												Do not buy this game if you are planing on playing online. Online is full of hackers. I promise you every game you join there will be a hacker using aimbot and wall hacks. The Anti-Cheat system doesnt even work anymore. You will get so annoyed with theses hackers that you will most likely use hacks yourself. Even if you hack or not you will most likely get Ddosed offline or doxed just for being host or using hacks when another hacker is in a lobby with you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL/DR REVIEWI only played the multiplayer, but not recently on pc so I can't comment on how alive or hacked the game is.. I really like this game, I played a lot of it on console as well. The pc port is acceptable, but with the FOV changer tool it's pretty good. It's cod, I think everyone knows what they can expect.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

												Let's be honest, anyone who didn't think this game was going to suck a fat one when it launched had either never played the previous game or lived in some fictional world where large gaming companies never try to ♥♥♥♥ consumers out of their money. Whatever the case may be, we once again find ourselves on our backs, bare-chested, with Infinity Ward humbly squatting over us, patiently waiting to give us our due.  You want more guns?  We’ll give you less guns!  You want better perks?  We’ll give you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perks!  You want memorable multiplayer maps?  Here, enjoy small run down village; not to be confused with slightly larger run down village.  They mock you every step of the way as you fall deeper and deeper into state of bitterness and flaccidity that no amount of Redtube can remedy.  If mw2 was 2% milk then mw3 is skim, which expired a month prior, and was then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in by a hobo with genital warts.  Save your money for Train simulator 2 when it comes out, a far better purchase.			",114,11,0,39,0,0,5

												This game deserves every ounce of hate it has against it. Simply put a bad game all the way from gameplay, graphics to multiplayer. There are so many better options out there; this game just feeds the droves of zombie n00bs that don't know any better. Basically the kids who must be playing ""the cool game"". Unfortunately for them, they are the only ones labeling the game as such. Everyone else abandoned ship a long time ago. At least this series does a good job of keeping the idiots isolated in their own game, COD.- Console port- Upressed graphics designed for underpowered consoles- Matchmaking- No mod support- Horrid linear map design- Uninspiring gameplay- Game idolized by 12yr old PC n00bs hogging their family computer- The series that we can thank for artificially inflating the price of the PC marketHow many of the MW3 players where 'BIG' COD2 players? NON! All bandwagon n00bs riding on a dead horse.I feel sorry for ppl who had to shell out money for this game. I didnt.			",443,30,13,28,32,5,46

												Call of duty modern warfare 3 is a great call of duty.  I have only played 4 call of duty's but mostly multiplayer.  Out of the 4 I can say that this one is my favorite.  Every level is amazing although you sometimes get the same guns over and over again.  If you don't like the gun you start out with I hope you like AK-47s because that is basically the only guns the enemy has.  I would give this game 10 stars out of 10.			",34,1,0,2,1,0,0

												Stuffy marasmus in which the Call of Duty series stays today, personally for me reached apogee in the second mission. During deep diversion over group of fearless marines the submarine with evil Russians floats. The commander of office it is squeezed hisses in a handheld transceiver: ""Not to move! "" For harm (and with boredom) I nevertheless decide to swim for a while slightly... and right there I learn that it is impossible to move — for the period of a scene management is disconnected. Call of Duty left school old kind the zaskriptovannykh of the shooters which have promptly become fashionable after Half-Life. Certainly, authors the most noble motives — beautifully to make to players directed and to tell juicy, coherent story moreover and about war. In years this desire didn't weaken at all, but the methods, which set didn't change never in nine years, as a result finished series to the point of absurdity and idiotic scenes like that that is described slightly above. Our today's task — to try to understand as it turned out and what to do farther. That Modern Warfare 3 was on sale huge circulation — isn't surprising. First, Infinity Ward have strong standing on the feet multiplayer, and secondly, in the world still there are enough aged people from seven to seventy which didn't play enough in war. But in this review we would like to address not to them (they made the choice, you won't overpersuade), and to those who, as well as we, I saw during a century not one and not two Call of Duty, to those who testified all contemporary history of series and quite I acquired simple rules by which it works. For all of us Modern Warfare 3 — a heartrending experience. Actually matter isn't that at Infinity Ward bad game turned out. Modern Warfare 3 — it by and large at all game is simple. Games assume interactivity, any dialogue with the user and possibility of the last to influence the world created by developers. In Modern Warfare 3 you have four options: it is possible to run or not to run, and also to shoot or not to shoot. The rest game does all. Itself lets out in the field of new supernumeraries, itself arranges between them fights, itself blows up houses and breaks furniture... You need to run only in time in the right places, activating scripts. Once I made experiment: during hot firefight I sat down in a corner, it is simple not to stand absolutely in the firing line then rose because of the computer and I left the room of minutes on fifteen. Naturally, to my return me not that didn't kill — I as though didn't leave at all the room, firefight proceeded at the same speed and, it seems (precisely you won't tell, enemies as like as two peas), in the same structure. Heroes of Modern Warfare 3 even refuse to die if nearby there is no player. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			",82,13,5,9,4,0,5

												Modern Warfare 3 is a really well optimized and fun game to play, the story continues on from the ending of Modern Warfare 2, it is very well written and the game looks really good considering it came out back in 2011.                      Pros: The game runs and performs really well, had a constant 60FPS!                               using Nvidia's DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution from 4K to 1080P),                               while also using MFAA (Multi Frame Anti Alising) and every other game setting                               maxed out.                               The story is great and it has a good soundtrack to it.                              Plenty to do: Intel Collectibles, Special Ops Missions, Survival Missions, Veteran Difficulty and                              Multiplayer if you are into it.                              Captain Price! (The Dude's A Beast!).                              Cons: Activision's price for the game and the DLC (even during the sales).			",94,8,0,7,2,0,1

												This one of the games I only played, 'cause it was Mainstream. Since it isn't Mainstream anymore, I deleted it from all my harddrives. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THE GAME.- Moderate Graphics- Moderate Mission/Map Design (both SP & MP)- NO SECRETS- Bad balanced, since they tried to Balance it- BAD Story (nearly the same as in the games before)- Way too expensive- The Multiplayer is the same♥♥♥♥♥♥like in nearly every CoD, since CoD MW2/BO there was nothing really new- Many very extreme bugs. e.g. Multiplayer knifing: if you hit the Player, there is no effect; if you don't hit Player, but the air 2m away from the Player, the Player dies)DL-Contents(DLCs):- unable to check, since I don't know whether there are DLCs			",255,38,10,35,35,1,58

												For the first review since recovering my account i have chosen Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. I played this game on both PS3 and Cpu. It is a great game and sums up the story for our beloved Modern Warfare characters. The game is not very difficult and has a decent replay value. Multiplayer has not suffered a hit as i find Modern Warfare 3 to be quite appealing. My main focus however is and always has been in the Campaign. To say the least it was great i realy enjoyed it, exempting a few plot twists but maybe im just sentimental. Also for PS3 gamers Modern Warfare 3 is a very easy Platinum Trophey. NO INTERNET REQUIRED. split screen play for 2 spec ops missions is all the help you will need.  If you want a quick easy Platinum go get this game! thats it for this one. I did not go in depth because of the age of this game but i will make more detailed reviews as i upgrade my game library. If you want more reviews or any help with PS3 titles please contact me via messege on Steam or PSN account cperkins110.  -Christian			",11,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Here we have it. Quite possibly the last of the Modern Warfare series. MW3 is kind of on the borderline between the good CODs and the bad CODs. If you wish to finish the series, by all means give it a go. However, if you are buying this just for the heck of it, don't (wait a few years). Instead, try MW1. I will not refer to the campain; I could accidently spoil something. The multiplayer is well rounded, although i do think that maps should be larger and spawns more reasonable (trust me; they are terrible). Overall, I believe that this is a well rounded game, again, right on that borderline.			",45,5,0,3,4,1,5

												How to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - Multiplayer:Step 1: Locate the game’s files and open config_mp.cfg with Notepad. Find ‘seta cg_chatHeight’ and change the value to ‘0’. This will remove the text chat from visibility.Step 2: After joining every single game, race the clock to mute every single player before the game starts.Step 3: Enjoy the game, completely free of the mind-numbing stupidity and hatred of a million degenerate mouthbreathers. Never again will you have to tolerate being called a fa***t s**t noob p***k mother f***ing d***head rotten a***hole c*** just because you got a kill with an MP7.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best CoDs EVER to be created, only to be surpassed by WaW, easily in my Top 2 CoDs. The campaign was amazing, really giving off the feeling of worldwide war and chaos. The multiplayer was fun, fast and chaotic, exactly like it should be. The Spec Ops mode was quite a lot of fun too, but lets face it: it definitely loses to Treyarch's zombies mode. I would go in-depth on why this is an amazing game, but whats the point since we all know why? I give this a definite 9/10.			",124,15,2,7,10,1,3

Single-player review I liked playing the story mode of Modern Warfare 3 than Advanced Warfare to be honest. Regarding the story, I'm certain it's really short. Overall, it's just like another Call of Duty game, there's hardly any new changes that (atleast) I could witness. At one point of time, due to subtle name changes, I was really confused when I checked Kamarov was actually pulling me up at one time, and then we were fighting Makarov.In the end, it's certainly not worth their asking price. Just buy it at its cheapest selling price. I haven't explored their multi-player yet. Not really going to do it, based on the reviews on Steam.			",86,7,5,6,4,0,4

												Despite having alot of hours on it is the worst Cod i've played. i Only played it for the infected mode which was fun the normal multiplayer wasn't that great and there were alot of invisible walls and you couldn't jump on as much stuff like in mw2. The Campaign is your usual cod campaign on an okay ending to the mw series but they could've done it better.  The game has a price at $40 and the dlc at $15 each but i guess it was worth the amount of hours i got out of it. Also as usual Call of Duty Games are usually cheaper out of steam and in a retail store. The Spec ops is pretty fun co-op fight waves of enemies and do missions i guess that's the high light of the game i would rate it an 8/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												-The SP campaign is like a popcorn action movie, entertaining and action filled. It delivers a good story, fun to use guns, and a theater of combat and action to fight through. You know what to expect in the SP campaign, the story & voice acting are good, the levels are entertaining.-Spec Ops originally had a problem with desyncing that has been fixed, making it possible to finish with an advanced option video frame sync option (can you believe the default choice is set to ruin the game?).-Survival is actually very fun, unlike boring♥♥♥♥♥black ops zombie mode.  The Spec ops missions are a lot of fun & a huge draw in this game, the first 3 DLC packs add more spec ops missions which are also lots of fun and a lot harder than the regular levels sometimes.For what this game aims to be, it accomplishes that.  Having fixed the desyncing spec ops issue, I can say it was a 10/10 for what I expected & what was delivered, but I understand a lot of people are sick of the CoD model.  I don't mess around in MP, so I rate this as someone who enjoys SP campaigns & coop.			",191,19,8,12,10,1,9

												I don't usually write reviews but this game really deserves it.Campaign: One of the best campaigns COD ever had besides the other modern warfares (cod4, mw2)Multiplayer: The single multiplayer I would play from COD... I love the multi-player, from weapons to equipment.I love the killstreaks, the deathstreaks, I really love the perks.The map detail is awesome, the background destruction is incredible. Something that you can't find in shi tty newer games like BO2..Infinity ward... YOU HAVE DONE A MASTER-PIECE!			",29,2,0,4,0,0,0

Posted: March 6, 2014
												An Epic conclusion to the Epic Saga!The modern Warfare series has come a long way ever since the first modern warfare released in 2006. It has evolutionized the genre and changed the way we play and think of FPS games. Althought, the game adds nothing new to the already complex formula, it does adds smoothness to the game core mechanics and the fast paced arcade-style shooter, ranking & rewarding as well as unique kill streak system in which skillful players shall go on a rampage quite easily with the aid of air supports or ground fire powers.The thrid entry to the series does not dissappoint because the single player campaign is filled with action as well as intense sequences. The story is well written and completed the story in a consistent and well told narrative. It also did a great job on connecting all the previous games together while maintaining twists that will keep the player guessing with unpredictably deep story. The story mode does not have a good replayability unless you are a collection fanatic that will be interested in perfecting the game with enemy intels, other wise I'd say it is not worth the hassle. The music score is an honorable mention here as the composer Brian Tayler has really hit the score with the music on the battlefield as well as the impact of guns and bullets hitting different places. The sound track is overall excellent not only does it set a atmospherical environment but it also connects the emotional link between the players and the characters and maintaining this link is what gives us the reason to care about the characters.In terms of multiplayer, the same formula applies. It is still addictive and still fun as new weapons and maps being added but the only down side to that is that additional DLCs will cost a fortune. Overall I will recommend this game to all FPS lovers and action gamers in general.			",634,142,21,113,30,2,44

												This review is based on my opinion, and you could disagree with me. Modern Warfare 3, a sequel to the previous Modern Warfare games in the Call of Duty series. Both Modern Warfare one and two were greatly reviewed and I must say that this game holds the pride of the Modern Warfare series. The multiplayer of this game is very well done. The weapons are well thought of, they are balanced pretty well and the maps were well designed. I liked the prestige modes as well as the weapon levels, which allows you to upgrade your weapon and get awesome colour skins (like gold). This all contributed to the fact that still a lot of people are playing this game online.I won't be covering the offline part of the game, as I've probably only spent half an hour on it. I don't know how Activision does it, but again they managed to make singleplayer suck big balls, big big balls. Anyway, based on the multiplayer part of the game: 10/10			",19,1,0,0,6,0,1

												This review may be long overdue but I'm going to write it anyways just for the record.MW3 is perhaps one of the best COD to be released by IW. MW2 had some rather annoying balancing quirks, and Ghosts was a dismal failure, as far as I'm concerned. But of course, one ought not to forget the modern classic in the form of the first MW, which was a true phenomenon.MW3 just like any MW had impressive map designs. Some may call it straightforward, but it's a proven philosophy as per the first MW. Contrast this with Treyarch's map design, which the word ""maze"" should properly sum it all up. Sledgehammer on the other hand seems to be taking the middle road but I reckon it's more identical to Treyarch's.Then let's talk about weapons and killstreaks. Recoil is pretty much non-existence so that makes it accessible to couch gamers on consoles. For the PC, do expect faster response time and reflexes as usual. The killstreak system is probably the best part of this game, allowing one to select how he/she would earn those killstreaks.Overall, MW3 is a commendable COD title. If you plan to pick this one up, well you're in luck to know that there are still players out there.			",96,2,1,0,2,1,4

												Spent 60$ on it. A mistake i will never repeat again. And if 60$ is not enough, they released the DLCs - 15$ each, just for a few maps? Really? Do they really think that their customers are that stupid? The developers never banned any hackers, the cheaters (aim botters / wall hackers) run freely in this game and ruin the multiplayer experience. More to it, there is always some swearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or screaming kid in every match...extremely annoying.Stopped playing it and deleted it from my library.

												Sooo...Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3! lets begin the review.Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is the third game in the modern warfare franchise and my personal favourite! This game , has everything what MW2 had , but this has even more.The Story starts after MW2 , and continoues the ""adventure"" of John Price and Soap.In this game , you play with tons of characters. Buut there are lot of problems! You only play Soap for like 3 minute or less :( , after that , he always gonna be an A.I. The Main playable character is Yuri and Frost ( hohohoho :D ). Yuri is an Ex-Spetnas soldier , who helps Soap and Price to hunt down Makarov. Frost is a Delta force soldier assigned to Team Metal. there are other characters like the british Marcus ""Burns"" , an another Russian operator wich i cant remember..the story is pretty good in the game! same as MW2 , there are lot of epic moments! In overall , story is awesome! now , theres the Spec Ops mode from MW2 , but its been modified a bit. now there's 2 kind of things you can do : ""Missions"" ( like in MW2 ) and ""Survival""both these can be done in coop , but Survival..man..that mode is a bless from the gods! About Multiplayer , i think this is the best CoD MW multi , i like to play it!Lets see the results  Positives :-Awesome Story and characters-Some characters from CoD4MW are in this game!!-Personal best MW-A nice end to the Modern Warfare seriesNegatives :-Graphics look outdated , even worse then MW2-Many questions unanswered-Only can play Soap for 3 minutes :(my final score for MW3 is a 9/10 ! i find this game to be good! get it on a sale or CD version :D on Steam every CoD is high priced			",60,3,0,3,1,0,0

												This game has been playing for a long time. I enjoy. There is a lot of motivation for playing through the day and week time tasks. Then, of course motivation enhancement and detection of weapons which setting is ideal. Unfortunately, they are in the game as well as negative influences such as hackers who use illegal programs that favor before the others. I am also sorry about the effectiveness of some weapons that act illogically see MP7. Now I've finished the entire multiplayer and threw the whole prestige mod. I'm sorry I did not get any credit for it that I finished the game to the end and play again. Otherwise it's a nice event where you can play a few games a day and a nice relax.

												По сути старая К0лДа, ток с чуть другим сюжетом и оружием. Весьма короткая. Лично мне, понадобилось около 6 часов, что бы все пробежать игру. При этом заглядывая по многим уголкам локаций.  Сюжет достойный американской публики. Ведь там, можно убивать русских. И весьма в больших кол-вах. При этом, слушая своих обреченных на смерть соратников, можно услышать акцент американского происхождения. Что порой вытягивает улыбку. Разработчики подумали, что русской публике, придеться весьма не по вкусу данное сюжетное новшество. И решили запихнуть ""пародию"" геноцида русских в BO 2. Где мы играя шахидом,убиваем якобы американсов. Но присмотревшись.. я никак не заметил ни одного намека на американских солдат. Модели фрагов были обычными шахидами, которым я и играл на тот момент. И то, разроботчики и тут не обошлись без подкола нас. Как муравьев, что они давят сапогами все чаще, и всунули нам игру в Афгане. Где мы играем снова восточными ""славянами"" снова убивая бедных русских. При этом крича какие мы ""няши"". Лично мне это не нравится, и уже игра не столь серьезна, как бы этого хотелось бы видеть. Вроде бы взрослые люди, а видна какая то холодная обида. ЧТо пропагандируется в таком вот виде игровой индустрии. Т.е. если раньше мы убивали немцов с въетнамцами, то теперь, русские заменили эту ""интилигенцию"".  Спасает только Мультик. В котором решает более или менее скил. Если он есть.			",133,17,1,3,4,0,4

												Here we have it. Quite possibly the last of the Modern Warfare series. MW3 is kind of on the borderline between the good CODs and the bad CODs. If you wish to finish the series, by all means give it a go. However, if you are buying this just for the heck of it, don't (wait a few years). Instead, try MW1. I will not refer to the campain; I could accidently spoil something. The multiplayer is well rounded, although i do think that maps should be larger and spawns more reasonable (trust me; they are terrible). Overall, I believe that this is a well rounded game, again, right on that borderline.			",45,5,0,3,4,1,5

												Despite having alot of hours on it is the worst Cod i've played. i Only played it for the infected mode which was fun the normal multiplayer wasn't that great and there were alot of invisible walls and you couldn't jump on as much stuff like in mw2. The Campaign is your usual cod campaign on an okay ending to the mw series but they could've done it better.  The game has a price at $40 and the dlc at $15 each but i guess it was worth the amount of hours i got out of it. Also as usual Call of Duty Games are usually cheaper out of steam and in a retail store. The Spec ops is pretty fun co-op fight waves of enemies and do missions i guess that's the high light of the game i would rate it an 8/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												Mixed bag here. If you're a fellow Single Player like me, there's really only 2 things drawing you to this game- that's the campaign and the Spec Ops Missions, many of which are playable as Single Player, with a few co-op missions added in as well. The campaign can be completed in around 4 hours, little longer if you're hunting intel or other achievements. Spec Ops missions are where the fun is at though. They require more skill than the campaign.*Now I don't play mp- but from what I've heard, it's a camp-fest full of aimbotters, quick-scopers and the like. Kind of an 'enter at your own risk' mode. I have heard of many gamers that strictly bought it for the mp disgusted with it and regretting their purchase - so 'buyer be ware' applies more than usual here.The ultimate question is, 'do you think you can have enough fun/time with this game to make it worthy of the price?'. For me, it was easier. This game shows in my Steam games, but I bought the physical disc- with coupons/cheaper.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best CoDs EVER to be created, only to be surpassed by WaW, easily in my Top 2 CoDs. The campaign was amazing, really giving off the feeling of worldwide war and chaos. The multiplayer was fun, fast and chaotic, exactly like it should be. The Spec Ops mode was quite a lot of fun too, but lets face it: it definitely loses to Treyarch's zombies mode. I would go in-depth on why this is an amazing game, but whats the point since we all know why? I give this a definite 9/10.			",124,15,2,7,10,1,3

												To me, I like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3, because have there own thing.  I like MW3 because it has great PvP and great gun balance.  Another thing about it is that it has its own vision of how they did Survival, because honestly, I like how they have that level system for Spec Ops, where you can gain streaks like knife-streaks, or kill-streaks and stuff, and also where you go to the boxes and pick out your equipment.  I like Black Ops 2 just because of the zombies.  And also I have two firends that have BO2 and MW3 for more then a year, and they say that they are both fun in PvP, but BO2 can get boring after a while, while in MW3, it will take you much longer to get bored. :D			",69,6,0,7,8,0,12

												Pros:The same great action of the previous games. Lots of multiplayer options.Cons:Not much changed since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Single-player campaign is confusing for people who haven't played the other Modern Warfare games. Modern Warfare 3 picks up where Modern Warfare 2 left off. I mean, exactly where it left off. Russia is at war with America, Makarov is at large, Soap's injured, and everything is blowing up. If you didn't play Modern Warfare 2, which served as a decent starting point and didn't require the first game to understand it, you won't have any idea about what's going on, and the game doesn't do much to get you up to date. It feels very much like the third movie in a trilogy, and the second movie ended on a cliffhanger. The gameplay, both in single player and multiplayer modes, is identical to that of Modern Warfare 2. You can carry two weapons and two types of grenades (one offensive, one special) at one time and you have to hide behind cover and employ tactical savvy in your approach firefights if you want to kill your enemies. It's an established and functional style that captures modern, ""realistic"" first-person shooter games. If you get hit a few times, you need to hide behind cover until you heal, or a few more stray bullets can kill you. It's unforgiving, but balanced.Multiplayer is the big draw of Modern Warfare 3, and it pays off just as much as it did in the other games in the series. There are the same seemingly endless customization options, with an experience system and the ability to build your own class with different weapons and abilities. The killstreak system from previous games has been refined into a points-based system that gives players more balance. Instead of getting points for each kill, players can choose Assault, Support, and Specialist modes that give them different rewards. Assault is the traditional killstreak system, where you get new abilities like missile strikes for more kills in a single life. Support counts your kills and other actions between lives, constantly moving up and giving you support-based abilities like UAVs. Specialist gives you more perks for your kills, instead of new weapons it effectively turns you into a super-soldier who's faster, stronger, or able to take more damage.The multiplayer options offer a benefit over Battlefield 3, which only has six cooperative missions compared to over a dozen in Modern Warfare 3. Competitive play is pretty evenly matched, with leveling in Modern Warfare 3 universal and steadily unlocking weapons and skills and leveling in Battlefield 3 and rewarding your class as you play it. The big difference between the two games is that Battlefield 3 has vehicles, which can change the nature of a game dramatically. To go to extremes, Modern Warfare 3 is more suitable for Counter-Strike fans, while Battlefield 3 is more suitable for Halo fans, but the distinction between the two modern combat games are far smaller than the rift between the two classic shooters.Modern Warfare 3 is a solid follow-up to Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, and if you loved those games you'll love this one. It doesn't change anything big, and the single-player campaign wraps up a story with most of the exposition lodged in previous games, but it offers a great multiplayer experience and a solid, if predictable and occasionally frustrating, single-player experience.

												Every year there's always new CoD. To be honest, from Infinity Ward it's still the same game. They made awesome titles like CoD 2, 4 or MW2. I liked it because the storyline was amazing. The engine upgrades and really cool multiplayer. It wasn't the same thing like now. But MW3 was just recycled CoD 4 with MW2 together. I liked it, enjoyed it and I also have +350 hours on multiplayer. It's really chatchy game.But I hate the community. Who wants to play with aimbotting kids, screaming in the voice chat and camping somewhere where you can't see them ? But that's multiplayer. Let's talk about campaign. It's the last Modern Warfare from thrilogy. What do you want to expect ? Awesome breath-taking missions ? Some kind of plot-twist in campaign ? Mindblowing actions ? No. They just killed the game. You will experience few ""stealth"" missions, shooting at some Africans, rescuing, and of course, grand finale. With few new characters, you will be basically for entire game, trying to save President and his daughter from Makarov's hands. There comes Chuck Norr..ehm..Captain Price with god-mode and kills everyone, without getting shot in the body. But what I enjoyed mostly is Spec Ops, which is also in MW2. Co-op missions are always fun with friend, but now there's brand new survival mode. But witout zombies. DLC 3 adds another game mode called Chaos, which is actually really big chaos and I like it. Kinda like survival, but faster. So I'm still recommending this game, but as I said, mostly for Spec Ops than campaign and MP.6/10			",155,25,11,18,6,1,8

												По сути старая К0лДа, ток с чуть другим сюжетом и оружием. Весьма короткая. Лично мне, понадобилось около 6 часов, что бы все пробежать игру. При этом заглядывая по многим уголкам локаций.  Сюжет достойный американской публики. Ведь там, можно убивать русских. И весьма в больших кол-вах. При этом, слушая своих обреченных на смерть соратников, можно услышать акцент американского происхождения. Что порой вытягивает улыбку. Разработчики подумали, что русской публике, придеться весьма не по вкусу данное сюжетное новшество. И решили запихнуть ""пародию"" геноцида русских в BO 2. Где мы играя шахидом,убиваем якобы американсов. Но присмотревшись.. я никак не заметил ни одного намека на американских солдат. Модели фрагов были обычными шахидами, которым я и играл на тот момент. И то, разроботчики и тут не обошлись без подкола нас. Как муравьев, что они давят сапогами все чаще, и всунули нам игру в Афгане. Где мы играем снова восточными ""славянами"" снова убивая бедных русских. При этом крича какие мы ""няши"". Лично мне это не нравится, и уже игра не столь серьезна, как бы этого хотелось бы видеть. Вроде бы взрослые люди, а видна какая то холодная обида. ЧТо пропагандируется в таком вот виде игровой индустрии. Т.е. если раньше мы убивали немцов с въетнамцами, то теперь, русские заменили эту ""интилигенцию"".  Спасает только Мультик. В котором решает более или менее скил. Если он есть.			",133,17,1,3,4,0,4

												Sooo...Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3! lets begin the review.Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is the third game in the modern warfare franchise and my personal favourite! This game , has everything what MW2 had , but this has even more.The Story starts after MW2 , and continoues the ""adventure"" of John Price and Soap.In this game , you play with tons of characters. Buut there are lot of problems! You only play Soap for like 3 minute or less :( , after that , he always gonna be an A.I. The Main playable character is Yuri and Frost ( hohohoho :D ). Yuri is an Ex-Spetnas soldier , who helps Soap and Price to hunt down Makarov. Frost is a Delta force soldier assigned to Team Metal. there are other characters like the british Marcus ""Burns"" , an another Russian operator wich i cant remember..the story is pretty good in the game! same as MW2 , there are lot of epic moments! In overall , story is awesome! now , theres the Spec Ops mode from MW2 , but its been modified a bit. now there's 2 kind of things you can do : ""Missions"" ( like in MW2 ) and ""Survival""both these can be done in coop , but Survival..man..that mode is a bless from the gods! About Multiplayer , i think this is the best CoD MW multi , i like to play it!Lets see the results  Positives :-Awesome Story and characters-Some characters from CoD4MW are in this game!!-Personal best MW-A nice end to the Modern Warfare seriesNegatives :-Graphics look outdated , even worse then MW2-Many questions unanswered-Only can play Soap for 3 minutes :(my final score for MW3 is a 9/10 ! i find this game to be good! get it on a sale or CD version :D on Steam every CoD is high priced			",60,3,0,3,1,0,0

												To me, I like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3, because have there own thing.  I like MW3 because it has great PvP and great gun balance.  Another thing about it is that it has its own vision of how they did Survival, because honestly, I like how they have that level system for Spec Ops, where you can gain streaks like knife-streaks, or kill-streaks and stuff, and also where you go to the boxes and pick out your equipment.  I like Black Ops 2 just because of the zombies.  And also I have two firends that have BO2 and MW3 for more then a year, and they say that they are both fun in PvP, but BO2 can get boring after a while, while in MW3, it will take you much longer to get bored. :D			",69,6,0,7,8,0,12

			Probably the best throwing knife kill in the game so far, and may be for awhile. I don't know how many ricochets off the helicopter, and then dropping on to the guy its supposed to be protecting.

												After buying both DLCs and having a massive attack of buyer's remorse (despite the fact that they were on sale), there can be only one conclusion: this game is not worth its price, even at 50% off. Absolutely no one from the 250+ people on my friends list has the DLC, leaving me with no one to do the new Spec Ops with, not to mention the buggy strict NAT in that game mode despite the NAT being open in MP.

												Bought it for 60$ at launch. It contains alot of content with his in depth Multiplayer and Co-Op that can easily suck you in. If you played the previous titles in this series you might end up like I did - getting that feeling the you already had a familiar experience before, the multiplayer felt pretty dull after the 40 hours mark so I started orginazing matches with friends and even against other clans, which has a pleasure - the good old shooting mechanics feel as good as always and never get's old. Still, the game doesn't feels worth it's value.The Singleplayer is a great additive, nice story that wind up the MW series with it's unforgetable ending, yet as expexted it's very short, but the Spec Ops missions and the survival mode got it covered, they a huge fun even on solo. A partner to the Spec Ops is a delight, but I felt the game lacked a 4-players Co-Op.I do reccommend the game, but if you are willing to buy it now, do yourself a favor and wait for a discount, and I seggust you to buy it with some friends.

												(This review's overview will be divided into two sections, one for Singleplayer, and one for Multiplayer)PROS: - Amazing campaign - Stunning high-graphic visuals - BEST Call of Duty Multiplayer experience ever - Tons of feedback to the playerCONS: - Cocky players - Unbalanced map layouts (Exception for a few)SINGLEPLAYER OVERVIEW:     As the third, and final, installment into the Modern Warfare series, this one does not hold back. It takes a huge leap and hits you hard. The campaign puts you in the eyes of many characters, making for a big experience so you know what all these people are like so you can understand why things play out the way they do. This game goes over the top in visual quality and storytelling, actually giving the most player-friendly story ever told in Call of Duty. It's an immersive experience, and pure fun to partake in. No mission is left to bore you and each one has it's own way of developing the story, which is normally lengthed to 2-3 missions in a Call of Duty game.MULTIPLAYER OVERVIEW:     In my honest opinion, if you want the fullest experience of Call of Duty: MW3, playing Hardcore is the way to go. Players don't rush and actually think. giving you a fighting chance since you both don't run at eachother. As for the gamemodes, this game provides the most ammount of gamemodes i've ever seen in any Call of Duty game to date. And these modes are not forgiving to you as the player. You're in to play, not ♥♥♥♥ around. As for maps, a lot of them seems unbalanced and don't really help the player in moving through a game smoothly. It all feels very choppy and poorly programmed. Some maps are an exception though, and in the end, its just how you feel about the maps.			",125,9,1,9,6,1,0

												This game is always a good game to have in your arsinal. I strongly recommend getting MW3. The only downsides to MW3 for PC is that there is a small amount of players. Half of the game modes don't have people queued. And the game modes that have players are few and far inbetween. But this should not sway your decision to buy this game.			",59,6,0,8,6,0,1

												Ok this ones a bit hard because i love just grinding and geting gold guns are easy but this call of duty is very fun sometime the severs are good and most people dont hack but over a few year ive seen a bit more but some will be mean and hack justt because they want to but some actaully just get big lobbies which is still bad but better than just having god mode on but. But lets acutally get to the review, the game is perfectly fine same old cod but run and gunning doesnt really get old with a rapid fire mp5 and a silencer and just beasting everybody that runs into you but a down side to this game is that not alot of people play anything other than tdm and some snd and infected which is fun you will most likely find nobody but this game i can say is one of the decent cods and im hoping that treyach and black ops 3 will be something new and dont buy ghost because there is literally nobody on it if you want to by a game with people on it go for black ops 2			",37,5,0,1,2,0,3

												A solid follow-up to Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops with a rich re-imagined multiplayer  with the introduction of ""Strike Packages,"" and new modes like ""Kill Confirmed"" and other gameplay enhancements. Another gem on the Call of Duty crown!			",48,5,1,0,3,0,5

												The fight the gaing industry has had to keep up to date, leaves me reminded of the exclusive play DICE and other game networks such as steam, had.  yet the modern  style of the game lets me think that we where playing for the future of gaming, which just happens to be know. there is a saying that in Osaka there is a place where time stood still so the future is clearer, i thin of this when i play MW3, the future of gaming became clearer to me now as we find the limits, back off, and enjoy the game more!

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was released in 2011. It’s a first-person shooter by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games. Published by Activision. A direct sequel to 2009’s Modern Warfare 2.Once again you play as different characters throughout the game. Continuing straight after the events of Modern Warfare 2, Captain John Price, and Nikolai evacuate an injured Soap MacTavish to a safe-house in Northern India. Makarov (from the previous game) has sent out a force to kill them. That’s where the game starts. The war between Russia and United States soon ends when the U.S. regains control of their military infrastructure. Meanwhile Makarov attempts to take hostage the Russian President who is brokering a peace deal with the U.S.The missions of the game are separated into Acts. With multiple missions in each Act. The combat system has not changed since the last game. Health regenerates quickly after being hit, showing a red splatter on the screen to show how bad you are hurt. The ammo is plenty with no real need to resupply during the game. Once again moving forward is how you progress through the game.Using the IW5 Game engine the weather and environmental effects are much improved as well as the visual quality of the environment. The story is overshadowed by the continuous action packed style of the game play.  I enjoyed this game more than Modern Warfare 2 but not as much as the original Modern Warfare. I like how you get to control modern military equipment like helicopter guns, UAV’s and laptops that control air strikes etc.There are many locations throughout the game and the change of scenery kept me interested. I thought the story was getting a bit old in the tooth and boring after three games. Voice acting and cut scenes were all done well, same can be said from the performances of the soldiers who accompany you throughout the game.Overall I found this game enjoyable to play and worth the money I spent. Rated Mature.I give it 8.9/10			",81,11,13,3,7,3,0

												(This review's overview will be divided into two sections, one for Singleplayer, and one for Multiplayer)PROS: - Amazing campaign - Stunning high-graphic visuals - BEST Call of Duty Multiplayer experience ever - Tons of feedback to the playerCONS: - Cocky players - Unbalanced map layouts (Exception for a few)SINGLEPLAYER OVERVIEW:     As the third, and final, installment into the Modern Warfare series, this one does not hold back. It takes a huge leap and hits you hard. The campaign puts you in the eyes of many characters, making for a big experience so you know what all these people are like so you can understand why things play out the way they do. This game goes over the top in visual quality and storytelling, actually giving the most player-friendly story ever told in Call of Duty. It's an immersive experience, and pure fun to partake in. No mission is left to bore you and each one has it's own way of developing the story, which is normally lengthed to 2-3 missions in a Call of Duty game.MULTIPLAYER OVERVIEW:     In my honest opinion, if you want the fullest experience of Call of Duty: MW3, playing Hardcore is the way to go. Players don't rush and actually think. giving you a fighting chance since you both don't run at eachother. As for the gamemodes, this game provides the most ammount of gamemodes i've ever seen in any Call of Duty game to date. And these modes are not forgiving to you as the player. You're in to play, not ♥♥♥♥ around. As for maps, a lot of them seems unbalanced and don't really help the player in moving through a game smoothly. It all feels very choppy and poorly programmed. Some maps are an exception though, and in the end, its just how you feel about the maps.			",125,9,1,9,6,1,0

You have a campaign continuing the things that happend in MW2, And also 4 dificulties. The dificulties are: Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and veteran. The dificulties have little mesages to: Recruit= For players who are new to first-person action games; Regular= Your abilities on combat will be tested; Hardened= Your Skills will be strained; Veteran= You will not survive.You also have a Special ops witch includes survival! and you can play missions too. The real fun is when you get a friend to play a friend to play over with you (Don't know if it works localy though) all the missions and survive with you. The survival is basicly you or your friend choses a map and then you get waves thrown at you (Not sure if wave limit exists though). The multiplayer is what you expect from a call of duty game. Custom classes, game modes (A lot of them), killstreaks or scorestreaks and thats it. It improves allot on the multiplayer from MW2 bit i still find MW2's multyplayer fun. The game is challenging in a good way, exept for multiplayer. Hackers rule in multiplayer while we are just a little guy getting killed over and over again, So heres some advice for InfinityWard: Add anti-cheat stuff! Anyways the game is good.Graphics: 7/10Challenge: 8.3/10Fun:8.5/10Everything: 8.5/10			",50,10,10,1,2,0,2

												I believe I have the knowledge and experiance as an avid call of duty player, on PC & Console to judge this highly acclaimed and commerically successful first-person-shooter game; it is known as the 8th instalment to the Call of Duty franchise and 3rd to the Modern Warfare series, COD: Modern Warfare 3. CAMPAIGN:Pick up the story right where Modern Warfare 2 ended and continue the intense single-player experience. Also, gain hidden enemy intel as you progress through the missions. The story is split into three Acts, each with 6 missions apart from Act 3. Total = 17 Missions. Each mission played will be by the opperatvies: Frost, Yuri or Price. Also, The each mission has at least one support character to assist you much like Cod 4. The game  Avg completion time is 7 hours; but completion time varies dependent on difficulty setting and PC specs. I would Rate the Campaign a 8/10MULTIPLAYER:You get to: Rank up, unlock new weapons, perks, killstreaks, play on servers and much, much more, online or locally. Possibly the most addictive multiplayer game in my steam libary of games. Quick scopping is very enjoyable and is satisfying getting multiple kills. Ui is solid, Hit detection is good. In comparison, games are ruined by hackers if you get into a lobby with one then you can expect, God mode, aimbot, wallhacks, high jump, unable to move etc... I would Rate the Multiplayer an 8/10 SPECIAL OPS:playing solo or co-op, rank up to unlock new weapons, tactical support, levels, and more in Survival mode and in a variety of challenging Missions. Survival:Survival mode is fun with a friend, its is waves of enemies, much like zombies from black ops 1 but with guns, helecopters, dogs, juggs etc... All maps are coppied from multiplayerMissions:Missions are really fun imo, I would say the best part of the game.  I would Rate Special ops a 9/10Conclution: The graphics seem rushed when developed and i have noticed they look better in multiplayer, the gameplay is very climatic and filled with imersive moments and you actually feel upset for when soap dies. I would recomend getting this game, although it is far from perfect, it adds retail value from the last game. Unfortuanely to add, the Game is unfortuantely filled with hackers. Special ops is really good, its in my opinion the best game mode out of the three!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another return to the great COD franchise before Treyarch took over.Although Sledgehammer games took over after Infinity Ward got shafted, this game I feel best mirrors the previous greatest iteration of the COD franchise which was CODMW2.Not a fan of Advanced Warfare or Black Ops, but of this game yes.Looking for the game closes to the previous Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2? This is it.Trademark blockbuster explosions and action? Check.Trademark graphics? Check.Symphonic score and full orchestra to accompany explosions? Check.No silly spacesuits, jumpsuits or gravity guns? Check.Missions take place in a variety of locations, from Sierra Leone to the UK.Notable missions include:-  playing SAS at the warehouse. Love those hammy British accents and LIttle Bird Helicopters.-  Operating the Hind remote machine gun.-  fighting through Paris-  calling in artillery strikes with purple smoke-  operating the AC-130 Gunship in ParisThe Special Ops section is where things get stupid fast.The Solo survival missions are beyond dumb. The AI are bullet sponges and you barely have enough time to buy new weapons and ammo. It gets boring fast.Playing Advanced Warfare for me meant a big break from what COD meant. Not a fan of the newer releases which are too tech-oriented and futuristic.The campaign is a bit short but given teh amount of explosions, battles, cinematic cut scenes is well worth it, but only if you manage to buy it elsewhere on sale.Got this for 9$ onsale on♥♥♥♥♥ Not worth the 43$ on steamb but if you find it elsewhere definitely consider getting it.

												Briljant spel, echt veel beter dan battlefield of iets dergelijks, speel het elke dag. Vooral het aspect van de multiplayer spreekt me erg aan. Veel professionele gamers die op de top van hun kunnen een potje team deathmatch spelen. Ook moet ik zeggen dat PEGI hun werk ook fantastisch heeft gedaan. Er zijn geen kinderen in dit spel te bekennen en dit is natuurlijk heel erg logisch, oorlog voeren is geen spelletje en al helemaal niet voor kinderen. Dit spel is uitermate geschikt als je even een relaxed op een zondagmiddag een leuke shooter wilt zonder dat je gestrest raakt. Ik hoop dat u mijn review informatief danwel nuttig heeft ondervonden, zo niet, dan hoor ik het graag van u.Met vriendelijke groet,Kikkers.			",37,2,4,1,3,0,2

												I've bought this game in the U.S. when I was on a trip there. It was on discount (now Iknow why). I usually start playing in multiplayer mode after I finished the campaign, so my article is mostly about the multiplayer experience. Let's see the Pros:-Call of Duty game-Lots of weapons-Usual Call of Duty graphics-good Single player campaign story (at last they've finished it!)And now let's see the Cons:-the worst Call of Duty Multiplayer game I've ever played (played almost all the episodes)-You will be angry even before the match starts-Lot of connection problems (If you've played even 10 minutes with it, you understand what I'm saying)-Annoying Kill Streak rewards-Lots of campers and kids who don't even know what this game is about-lots of people who can't play and start cheating, ruining all the game and fun of others.-at least 10 game modes (but 99% of MW3 players use the standard TDM...)-If you don't have at least a 1 Gbps Internet connection, don't even try it!-Lot of DLC-s which would be essential if you want to play (these costs about 3 times the price of the game)I think that's all I can say about it. I spent many hours trying to find what's good in this game, but in the end, I always quit with the anger and the dissapointment with the question in my mind: Why the hell did i just buy this? (the answer is: franchise advertising). People nowadays (unfortunately me too) only looks at a cover, or advertising, and if the name is familiar, we go and buy it. We shouldn't!			",44,10,4,7,3,0,3

												Continuation of a series mw not as quality as the engine ""polished"" to horror, should not have done because it looks all ""soap"" (just like a battlefield 3 on consoles). Company is quite interesting and you can go through.Multiplayer is also interesting, but there are many cheaters out there and play becomes no longer interested because of this phenomenon. New in this mode, a lot has been added so you can say that it is updated mw2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright lets see, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is like anal sex, sometimes you like it sometimes you dont. But overall if you are looking to spend $40.00 I`d say spend it on this game. This♥♥♥♥♥♥will have you locked in your room and have you isolate yourself from the real world making you play this all day. In terms of gameplay the game won`t really get boring. Most of the guns are pretty balanced (except the ACR and the MP7) and you should like most of the maps. The best part is,is the game isnt dead. Most of the gamemodes are still populated (with 12 year olds). It still has a pretty big community and if you use a toaster and a laptop then goodnews you can still play this game on decent settings. Listen I know I suck big balls in writing reviews but I hope I convinced you to buy this game and if not then an other suggestion on what to spend with your $40 is to upgrade to a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥premium account. It never hurts! But seriously buy this game its worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Usually I would introduce the game, but I don't thing I have to do that this time.  What I liked• I actually remember something from the story• MusicWhat I disliked • Predictable stuff in the story• Price of the game (It's been almost 5 years, come on Activision)• Overpriced DLCs for multiplayer VerdictIf you buy it for the story, its overpriced. If you buy it for MP, it's overpriced. If you buy it for both, also overpriced. There are worse games out there, but they don't cost that much.2/10 - If bought on Steam for ful price3/10 - If bought on Steam sale5/10 - If bought outside of Steam / received as a gift ",121,12,9,7,3,2,6

												This game is absolutely riddled with cheaters and I'm not crying because some guy got 30 kills in a TDM. They'll got 50-0, switch TDM lobbies to ground war dom, and all their kills are unlimited ammo godmode noscope headshots through walls (aim/walls). It's not even subtle. VAC doesn't pick it up and Activision obviously won't do anything about it. Community is quiet and the only players left are veterans or newbies. The campaign was very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in my opinion, pails massively in comparison to WaW, MW and even Blops.I wouldn't buy this unless you can get it for very cheap and are a big fan of the series.

But the reason why I do not suggest download it today is it still cost 40 USD now and the graphic are  kinda outdated  (but the good thing is it support OS X and integrated graphic card) II will  pay 50 for a remastered  version no doubt			",13,1,0,0,0,0,0

												I've bought this game in the U.S. when I was on a trip there. It was on discount (now Iknow why). I usually start playing in multiplayer mode after I finished the campaign, so my article is mostly about the multiplayer experience. Let's see the Pros:-Call of Duty game-Lots of weapons-Usual Call of Duty graphics-good Single player campaign story (at last they've finished it!)And now let's see the Cons:-the worst Call of Duty Multiplayer game I've ever played (played almost all the episodes)-You will be angry even before the match starts-Lot of connection problems (If you've played even 10 minutes with it, you understand what I'm saying)-Annoying Kill Streak rewards-Lots of campers and kids who don't even know what this game is about-lots of people who can't play and start cheating, ruining all the game and fun of others.-at least 10 game modes (but 99% of MW3 players use the standard TDM...)-If you don't have at least a 1 Gbps Internet connection, don't even try it!-Lot of DLC-s which would be essential if you want to play (these costs about 3 times the price of the game)I think that's all I can say about it. I spent many hours trying to find what's good in this game, but in the end, I always quit with the anger and the dissapointment with the question in my mind: Why the hell did i just buy this? (the answer is: franchise advertising). People nowadays (unfortunately me too) only looks at a cover, or advertising, and if the name is familiar, we go and buy it. We shouldn't!			",44,10,4,7,3,0,3

												The Good: Slight visual upgrade for PC, multiplayer is fun an addictive as always, new weapons, a couple of favorite maps from the past returnThe Bad: Campaign lacks the thrills of past games, not much has changed in multiplayer, too many cheaters due to lack of dedicated servers, feels like Modern Warfare 2.5Modern Warfare gets the bad rep of being the game that sheep flock to. “Only morons play it” some people say. “The only people online are 12 year olds”. The problem is that those are true, but it doesn’t mean that it isn’t a fun game. Sure, the game became too mainstream to everyone and their mom has played this, but it doesn’t make it is a bad game or series. What makes the game tiring is that nothing really changes. Modern Warfare 3 feels like Modern Warfare 2.5. Not much has changed from the second game other than the campaign and a visual upgrade. There are even recycled maps from the second game!The campaign is a disappointment because it just doesn’t feel as awesome as the past two games. It feels like a gallery shooter more than ever and has very little challenge. The epic set pieces aren’t as grand as previous games, and have great potential at first, but no climax ever happens. Levels are really short without the varied gameplay clips that are thrown in. The story is confusing if you haven’t followed the games until now, but you aren’t missing much. The story between Captain Price and Soap MacTavish are interesting, but it just falls flat in the end. The campaign is entertaining at best and a lot of fun, but it isn’t solid like the past two games. What you are mainly here is for multiplayer because that will keep you coming back for more.The layout is like all previous Modern Warfare games without much change. You can customize your loadout, callsign, emblem, and unlock new items through ranking up. The only new additions really are how you score. Things like rescuing people and a few other things. To be honest the controls and feeling of the entire game haven’t really changed much. There’s a few tweaks here and there but it doesn’t feel like an actual sequel. The weapons are a little different, but everything is just the same when it comes to how you unlock them. There are a few different kill streak rewards like the IMS and a few others, but if it ain’t broke don’t fix it right? There are a few different perks and that is really it. The maps aren’t designed as well as the past two games and aren’t as memorable. There are a couple of maps in here from MW2 like the Airport map which is a classic, but the others have to just grow on you. There are a lot more modes in this one, but I was missing the modes from Black Ops which I felt should have been included. One in the Chamber was a favorite of mine, but the whole money system from Black Ops is also missing. I would rather buy upgrades than wait to unlock them, but what can you do?The graphics received a huge upgrade and look decent on PC, but look pretty bad on the consoles. There’s a slight texture upgrade, some SSAO effects, and anti-aliasing but they are all very minor. You don’t need a powerful rig to run this game maxed out. There are a few cool scenes in the campaign, but overall this doesn’t feel like a true sequel, but more of an expansion. Multiplayer is super fun and most players will pour dozens of hours into the addictivness of it. There are a few complaints about the multiplayer such as when you start. You are fighting people who are level 80 prestige and have all the best stuff, so don’t get discouraged. Quick scoping is a thing people complain about where you can look down your scope almost instantly which is considered cheating by some. They fixed this by making it a perk, but if you play Battlefield 3 you will notice the difference.Modern Warfare 3 has a lackluster single player campaign, and not much has changed in multiplayer. The new maps are fun but not as memorable as past games.--Score: 8.5/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												Alright lets see, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is like anal sex, sometimes you like it sometimes you dont. But overall if you are looking to spend $40.00 I`d say spend it on this game. This♥♥♥♥♥♥will have you locked in your room and have you isolate yourself from the real world making you play this all day. In terms of gameplay the game won`t really get boring. Most of the guns are pretty balanced (except the ACR and the MP7) and you should like most of the maps. The best part is,is the game isnt dead. Most of the gamemodes are still populated (with 12 year olds). It still has a pretty big community and if you use a toaster and a laptop then goodnews you can still play this game on decent settings. Listen I know I suck big balls in writing reviews but I hope I convinced you to buy this game and if not then an other suggestion on what to spend with your $40 is to upgrade to a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥premium account. It never hurts! But seriously buy this game its worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the last game from MW trilogy. In this game developers tried to remove some of the things that players didn't like in previous CoDs (kniferunning, noobtubing etc.), but in my opinion they picked wrong ways how to do that. For example Marathon perk gave players unlimited sprint in MW2 and it was something usefull, in MW3 they wanted to remove kniferunning so they decided it will be only longer sprint and it made that perk totally useless, because there are much more usefull perks now in that category, like Scavenger. But these things doesn't matter that much, MW3 is one of the best CoDs with classic style (no flying suits etc.) and it's still played a lot. If you are looking for some good old CoD then i recommend this game for you. Result: 9,5/10 (just because of those limits and other things that should remove some stuff from the game but it doesn't and it did more bad than good, otherwise it would be 10/10)			",19,1,1,0,1,0,0

												This game should be $10 at this point. The story and mechanics of the campaign are almost a downgrade from Modern Warfare 2. The multiplayer has a decent amount of cheaters and is not much fun in comparison to the previous titles. I would strongly recommend COD4 and MW2 over this for someone who has not played any of these games.TLDR; DO NOT SPEND $40 on this game.			",80,17,0,12,6,2,10

												Call of Duty: Modern War Crimes is a fun arcade shooter for anyone who is a fan of crappy graphics and the same guns copy and pasted over and over again. This game includes everything, from killing militant children in Sierra Leone to having WMDs bomb major European cities.CAMPAIGN     I didn't play much, but it's essentially a huge coalition trying to take down one very evil dude who controls ""other-but-lesser-evil"" dudes who do evil stuff to the protagonists. I don't know...SPECIAL OPS     This gamemode is fun if you've never played Zombies in World at War or the Black Ops series. JK. It's fun to a certain audience, mainly the people who get frustrated after being destroyed by 14 year olds with Doge profile pics and ""MLG"" anywhere within their names. Survival is a gamemode where the player is inserted into a multiplayer map alone or with a single partner and defends an area against waves of enemies. The players can buy support options unlocked with XP earned during each round.MULTIPLAYER     The multiplayer is the game's most re-playable feature. The ACR, MP7, and Strikers are the most overpowered weapons in the game. Killstreaks are ""revamped"" and the ""Create a Class"" system doesn't use currency. ""Kill Confirmed"" and ""Team Defender"" are modes not previously found in older segments of the franchise. The maps are all based on campaign missions, so it gives you a sense of ""I've seen and done this or that."" The glorious PC master race also gives us dedicated servers (which are really fun), and the options to increase the FOV (not built in to the game, but you won't be VAC banned for third party mods.)FINAL THOUGHTS     Infinity Ward might make the next Call of Duty. Given their history, it might turn out good (COD 4) or bad (Ghosts.) But lets hope it's not ""MW4."" This game may suit your playstyle for your first COD, and if you're thinking about getting this for the PC, you should also consider there will be hackers and the problems of your opponent having a better computer. This port doesn't live up to the memories I had on the Xbox, but it may be a good way to fill your Steam library with variety.			",17,1,0,3,1,0,1

Add to that, the fact that there is no option within the game to report a cheater... and u have  brilliant game that's just gone to the dogs because the makers are too lazy to do something about the cheaters.

Its just soooo impossible to get a moab with russians or with a hacker. But still i enjoy trying to get a moab. This game is 9/10 for me . But the hackers and russians incluuded its 6/10. Also i wish that infinity ward could look back at old call of dutys and ban some hackers. It would make my day or even my career in this game.			",55,2,4,2,3,1,0

I played this game for 2 hours, 2 ♥♥♥♥ing hours, and that is all of my time I will give to this game. Multiplayer is full of hackers, and you will find them in almost every single lobby, and nothing will be done to punish them so they will just keep going, and that destroyed this game for me. I havent played ONE match that I can say I enjoyed playing. And all that fun can be yours for only 39.99 euros.Dont buy it! Dont. Rather buy Black Ops 1 or 2, MW2, eh rather buy Bejeweled than this.I would ask for refund, but like I said I got it for free, so that is not going to happen...			",112,15,3,17,10,0,5

												Still better than Ghosts, and Black ops series, Better mehanics, the game is in present no future bulls**y gadgets, and no oldschool stuff, great map sizes, not too big not very small. Good sniping mechanics still there's minuses. Hate those OP guns, guns are evend bad, mp7 and fmg9 akimbo still should have a damage decrease and mp7 should have more recoil than nothing, let the newbies to burst guns like in real life not just hold the trigger and point it to the enemy, thats not fun at all.

												You have heard it was repetitive, you have heard it was nothing really new .. Well, you have heard it right. It is still the good old multiplayer fun, but it goes nowhere beyond that - the game won't surprize you with anything, but it will do what it does best - deliver you in the middle of the CoD action. How soon you will decide to turn your back to it, it is all up to you.			",1132,423,68,153,136,16,215

												In-depth multiplayer & singleplayer, endless hours of insane fun with friends online or even by yourself  playing through the captivating and enchanting campaign. This innovative game really sets the bar for all future FPS games to come, with plenty of new content and crazy amounts of things to do. With graphics to match content, this game will not dissapoint if you're looking for an amazing, immersive and gripping video game layered with original content and ideas, just for you! At an even more affordable price on Steam, this game is a must-have for any gamer (casual or hardcore) looking for a gaming experience they will not  forget.10/10			",181,21,7,25,14,1,18

												You are probably buying this for the Multiplayer, as of July 29th, 2016, the MP is still pretty well populated depending on what time you are playing. Has more hackers than MW2, but it is still fine.Not worth 40 though, wait for a sale or something.			",358,78,10,52,39,5,43

												Just a quick review at this statement - 16.7.2016.Such a great game.This is real Call of Duty and really really great war game.Such a brutal shame that people dont want to respect this game.This game is now - 16.7.2016. the worst  CoD game included MW2 MP too..I play all CoD games and I am pretty good at it, and I play it legit and in normal way without cheats, but this, this is really wow, this is brutal brutal shame.Game got about 3000 players, and 85% of them are at least wallhacking with fake master prestige lvl 80 and XP boosted servers...Such a rude and shameless move by PC community for this game, even A.W. and Ghosts dont have a cheaters and they are actually more playable than this game!I only recommend this game for SP, but for now, stay the hell away from MP, its a complete mess and its destroyed (aim hackers, wall hackers, spin bots, flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with spin bot)..S.P. - 9/10M.P. - 1/10Such a shame, I am PC gamer and I play on consoles too, but for my gaming experience and everything that other people do to some PC multiplayer games, I really want to Steam or Activision actually remove MP mode, to punish those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for hacking...

												So far I'm  very impressed with   the overall feel of MW3.  As you'd expect with C.O.D. games this is a non-stop in yer face  killing fest, full of action and  amazing visuals.  The developer has added some interesting and varied missions that involve several  scenarios such as   scuba diving and manning a mini gun from a chopper while making your escape from  the first mission.  I've yet to explore the multiplayer aspect of the game (co-op for me), but then I tend to concentrate on the single player   parts of  a game first.  It's hard to  make a real comparison  between  MW3  and Battlefield 3, but  IMO  so far Battlefield 3  wins.  Although both single player campaigns are  rather scripted,  the battlefield  experience left me  feeling  lot more satisfied than the COD experience.  BF3 is a harder game with more of a feel of a real military sim than COD:MW3.  If you're into FPS games then both should be on your shopping list (if you don't already own them.  . Acvtivision rocks!  :)			",4947,1933,224,565,877,79,758

												You noob!Omg you suck!U mad?These are only few examples, of the fascinating language common midst Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 players. On a linguistic side of things, we have come far from our ancestors, the primates. In Modern Warfare 3, you still can have that primal feeling and rage within, which is very common amongst our hairy friends. When you’re on fire, and only need one kill for your AC-130 gunship, this kind of language feels the proper way to express yourself. It might not be suited for every Modern Warfare 3 players. You can use terms like; owned, haxor and cheater too. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is first person shooter, developed by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, with Raven Software having assisted in development and published by Activision. Sales figures for Modern warfare 3 in US and UK,  reported by Activision, being more than 6.5 million copies sold on launch day and grossed $400 million alone in its first 24 hours. This fact alone proves that humankind has progressed from primates. Apes and monkeys didn’t have currency available. French site TF1 News reported of two masked individuals, hijacking a truck transporting 6000 copies of Modern Warfare 3, using a teargas and vehicle as a battering ram, on November 6. 2011. I’m quite sure; they were masks to hide their hairy faces from the truck driver. They were ape-men capable of complicating task of hijacking a transport vehicle. Modern Warfare 3 is a game for men and women, who want to see blood spilled. You could argument Modern Warfare 3 might be used to numb human masses, to receive better understanding concerning our ancestors. Primates didn’t have high tech toys of war, like unmanned aerial vehicles or intelligent munitions systems. They weren’t able to use other than simple tools against each other. Within these sidelines, I can recommend Call of Duty: Modern of Warfare 3 to all humans, of all races above the planet earth. If you are too young to play this game, you might want to study the behavior of primates while waiting.Before you go, imagine yourself as a super soldier, capable of dominating every human being on this planet, with your weapons and perks like recon pro, and extreme condition pro. Your bullets and explosives becomes your all seeing radar. You are running two marathons in a day easily. Suddenly you start to sing Mc Hammer’s song, U can’t touch this. You see something moving from the corner of your eye. You turn, and you’re facing the biggest and baddest looking juggernaut, equipped with the M60E4 LMG and Mp412 handgun coming straight at you. Your mouse hands starts to shake and sweat. Your mouth is getting dry. You shoot. You hear a loud bang. Smoke everywhere. Juggernaut is dead. Mighty juggernaut has fallen. And you write to the chat; U mad bro? ",287,47,10,51,37,5,78

												DISCLAIMER: I do not play the competitive multiplayer mode at all. My review is based solely on my experience on the single player campaign and the co-op multiplayer game modes.The single player campaign is still one hell of an awesome game! This time it wraps up the story of the modern warfare franchise, and the ending is super awesome! Similar to their prequels, you switch roles in-between campaigns to play on different settings and experience different play styles. One moment you are an army boy in a warzone, another moment you are playing stealthily while infiltrating a fortress. There are not much new game mechanic from the old games, except a few new guns. But this time you can finally play as the juggernaut in one of the later stage!When compared to the previous modern warfare games, this one has the easiest single player campaigns. It has very little solo stages, and your ally AI is pretty good. When playing the hardest difficulty, I feel like playing an escort mission from the start to the end, with me being the escortee and the NPCs are my bodyguards!Special Ops have some interesting co-op missions. This game mode however, is very susceptible to poor network connection between players. When you have a poor network condition, the game will kinda de-sync by itself, where both player don't even notice they have disconnected from each other. This is very frustrating and game-breaking. I recommend using either Steam voice chat or 3rd party voice chat client like Skype while playing with a friend. The in-game chat is very bad.For achievement collectorsThese DLCs are required for 100% completion.Collection 1 DLC Collection 2 DLC Collection 3 DLCYou will also need a co-op buddy to complete some of the Special Ops missions. All achievements are not difficult to obtain, the hardest ones just need some practice and patience.My score: 8/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												Terrible on PC, even for a CoD game. Multiplayer match making is bad, the bad CoD singleplayer is even worse on PC, so many things with it's multiplayer are screwed up on PC. The only reason anyone should consider getting this is for the Survival Multiplayer, and it isn't worth the money, even at a reduced price. Note: I'm not a CoD fan in general, so if you're one of those idiots who spends money every year on the same game that they did last year, and you missed this one, you might as well pick it up at reduced price now, but it's not good on PC.

												This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Here are some problems: lots of hackers, sometimes you wont get a good host,      you can usually only play 2-3 gamemodes because there aren't any others. I like to play HC S&D, but if you go to mw3 you can't just join a game, you have to wait for it to try to find a server. Most likely will look like this: Searching..... SERVER FOUND!!! JOIN NOW AND HAVE AS LOW AS 500 PING! lol but it does really get annoying. I hope call of duty stops making all of these fails of games.			",33,4,0,5,4,0,0

												The current generation of gamers mainly consist of people who dislike innovation and are looking for the same thing over and over again. It is companies like Activision we can blame for the recent decline in the Japanese games industry we have unfortunately witnessed. CoD brought the sequelitis disease into gaming, which basically means a franchise bringing new installments annually with no significant changes. Modern Warfare 3 is the third time the same game has been released, only with a few online changes that would prove little challenge to have released as DLC or a patch for the first game, and an even more absurd, generic plot ripped from a low budget action flick filled with painful cliches. It saddens me to see CoD do so well in an industry where a lot of hidden gems do not recieve such recognition, while they are ones who truly deserve it. If you are a mindless child whose pea sized brain can handle nothing more than easy to follow shooters with about 6 hours of true gameplay, then you may enjoy this mediocre game. If you are even remotely intelligent, then save your money.			",355,118,6,31,33,2,23

The only thing I hope for is for Activision and the next producers to take out lag compensation, we were doing fine without it, as they say, ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"", it might unintentionally make it worse. ;)			",79,11,0,9,9,0,7

												After 4 years, when I bought the retail copy of the game in seven days after release date of the game, it is still extremely boring to play. Gamma is too gray, action is too weak, scenario is collected from teared parts, OST is just sucks. Only explaining story of Makarov and the ending is good enough.Co-op? It is not that good as in previous games and also I still can't buy DLCs, because they are actually not costs their prices.MP? I played it before. It is decent, but simple, linear and still with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamma, which automacilly brings you bad mood, while you are playing it.After 8 years of Steam gaming, it is still one of my biggest abomination in my library.

												I cannot believe this game's original price is still $40. It's about half a decade old. If you like call of duty at all, buy the games by treyarch. The original Infinity Ward Developers have moved onto mkaing Titan Fall.I know there's cliche phrase, ""all the call of duties are the same thing"". I'm here to tell you that it is true. The only new features after every games are weapons and perks. They bring back the same engine, voice actors,  and textures after games for years.However, if you're a player that has tons of money to spend, loves to play with the mainstream community, and games that are fast pace, then I'll understand why you like callofduty. But don't buy this game. It's like I said, half a decade old and are other better games after this one.			",73,8,6,16,8,0,3

												I'm here to type a review, that's also exactly what I'm gonna do.This game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is definitely better than some other Call of Duty games, (looking at you Call of Duty: Ghosts) personally all of the Modern Warfare games are great! If you ask me Modern Warfare 2 is somewhat more enjoyable than Modern Warfare 3 but as many of you probably know or have heard, that game is full of hackers and force host cheats and so on, I do however see that alot of hacks have been outdated or detected (causing a VAC ban, making you unable to play the game) I definitely have alot more play time overall than you see on this account, 38 hours as of 18/4/2016 starting somewhere around 800+ hours right now. Would I recommend this game for you to buy and play, 85% this game is also starting to die out like Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 1 is practically dead now.There will not be a new Modern Warfare (4) since the campaign story died in Modern Warfare 3, hopefully they are considering a Remaster of the Modern Warfare series, would be lovely :) -anyways thats it for me, bye all :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly it's not worth it's price. While the game itself is very smooth, there are better options out there if you're looking for a Call of Duty game. The price is what really makes the difference. You can get Modern Warefare 2 for $20 cheaper, or any new(-ish) Call of Duty for only $20 more.			",114,9,0,14,14,0,30

												The single player game is quite fun, but the multiplayer sucks completely.   If you want a game to play by yourself, this is fine.   But if you want game you can play with friends and have a replayable experience... this is not the game for you.   Cheaters are all over the place.  Hackers are a constant.  Hacked lobbies are routine.  You can't hardly get into one single game, where there are no cheaters.  You are pretty much required to download an admin tool, that allows you to kick and ban cheaters, but the tool only works if you magically end up with host.   If you don't have host, you are at the mercy of other players who do.      The game could be easily fixed, but the company isn't going to, because there is no profit in it.  I have spent 2 hours, to play only one ten minute game that was actually worth playing.    The rest of the time, all you do is try and dodge hackers, get host only to lose host, and get kicked, or spend time kicking cheater and hackers.   The game is miserable to play as a multiplayer game.   I wish I had not spent the money on this game.  I would gladly delete it for a refund.			",78,3,0,8,0,0,23

												It's a literal gaming masterpiece, played it on 360 and now getting it again on PC and reliving the good old days, nastalgic and a great game. Looks good graphically as well.  Game is capped at 90fps though unfortunately so you high refresh rate monitor guys need to look out for that. Probably a console command to fix that though. Also the community has died down considering the game is 4 years old, so you can only really play TDM. Other than the great game.			",233,32,17,12,19,0,15

												i hate MP games, and i would buy Cod products if the single player was sold separately and in a good sale day.most people buy COD for its MP.so why would i buy this (even on sale) when i can buy an open world, never ending game like lets say for example '' just cause 3 '' for the same amount of money ( full price ).even the old COD games are still Expensive and ONLY sold in German language ( in germany ) with low violent version.(i dont care about the low violent version coz its the law) but when some one pays a (one use) 60 euro product, at least he can choose the language.i never bought this one, i got it as a hard copy gift. and MP is downloaded as a separate game from the single player one. and the game wont download from the DVD, you have to download it online. so why did they sell it as a hard copy?but again Activision have ONLY COD as a ((( successful* )) (( game** )).and thats why men play minecraft for example and children play COD. > because no logical adult who works hard for his money would buy this.* = expensive** = interactive movie that you play it once.

												What can I say that I haven't said about the CoD games before?  Like Far Cry 2  the scenery is beautiful but the progress is a dire slog.  The setpieces are sharp with lots of variety and attention to detail but you can't stop to appreciate it without becoming swiss cheese.  The whack-a-mole shooting gallery is very tiresome because it forbids you from playing smartly or carefully.  You shoot one guy and another instantly replaces him.  Crysis combat is SO much more satisfying.  There's some fun breaks when you pilot drones, remote turrets, and the AC-130, but what I really want is a greater sense of accomplishment.  I can't appreciate the story because it's so fractured from too many POV's and I get annoyed by the game taking control away from me to deliver ""dramatic"" moments.  Who is Yuri?  Or Frost?  Why does Makarov have a hate for Price when his motive was to start WW3? I'm supposed to care when teammates die?  A better game to watch than to play.  Audio is A+ however.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												If you compare an orange with an apple, it's just a question of personal taste right?But then if you compare a sh** to 5 dollars.Well, it should be logic to say that the 5 dollars is worth more than the sh**.In this case, Modern Warfare 3 is the sh** but people still pay for it and way too much, I paid less than 30$ and I feel cheated as heck.Even if they would have gave me this game for free, I would still have feel cheated.-2/10.Honest review, honest facts, if you can't stand it then uninstall Steam and never get on Internet again.

												One of the best games I've ever played. I got 600+ hrs on this Account and atleast 2x that on the Xbox. I really like it. I got banned though for using the FPS unlocker. Kind of a dickish move by IW but I'll take it. The weapons are fair and balanced and the maps are really enjoyable. The campain is good too.			",71,13,0,8,2,0,0

												Honestly it's not worth it's price. While the game itself is very smooth, there are better options out there if you're looking for a Call of Duty game. The price is what really makes the difference. You can get Modern Warefare 2 for $20 cheaper, or any new(-ish) Call of Duty for only $20 more.			",114,9,0,14,14,0,30

												Great game storyline but the multiplayer is another thing.... TOO MUCH ONLINE MULTIPLAYER CHEATERS about the place ruining it for all those who enjoy a good game of skillful gaming war. The cheat detection is crap to catch the cheaters at their game and the report service suck and totally ineffective at banning reported cheaters even when there are proof of it. Maybe there is no budget left to hire a team to look after all ther reports. Possibly the developers has made their money and want you to buy their newest and latest Call of Duty, so they totally ignore this aspect of the game and FORCE YOU TO BUY THEIR NEXT ONE to make even more money. It's not really their fault. It is JUST BUSINESS.			",52,6,1,5,4,0,7

												The end of the Modern Warfare franchise. The campaign has epic moments and a very good ending. If you want to play a cooperative gamemode, you can play the Special Ops missions or you can try the Survival gamemode, where you have to survive against multiple waves of enemies, also you can buy weapons, perks and equipment to make your survival easier. The Multiplayer is very good, maybe some weapons and some perks are too overpowered but still a great multiplayer game, in this game you can prestige pretty fast so its kinda cool, too bad this game is filled with hackers, i would still play this game if it was clean of hackers. Even if this game is ruined by those idiots, i still recommend it for the Campaign.			",26,0,1,3,2,1,1

												Мне не очень понравилась. Одна смерть Соупа, чего стоит, портит впечатление от игры. Когда играешь в MW 2, ""ВАУ"" на каждом повороте. По сравнению с COD 4 MW в MW2, масса нововведений, а в MW3 нет такого, что могло впечатлить. Конец истории, мягко говоря ужасный, карты в мультиплеере очень тесные. Проделанная работа по сравнению с MW2, чистая халтура. Единственное ради чего можно играть, так это кол-во человек в мультиплеере, и режим выживания.Оценка: неплохо 6/10 ",118,9,8,7,4,2,8

В Multiplayer все серверы забиты читерами, детьми и неадекватами всех возрастов, рас и вероисповедания. Игра превратилась в мусор (так и была с самого начала, т.к. не успела появится, как в ней появились читы, а за ними читеры) только из-за того, что в отличий от MW2, кол-во читеров в MW3 зашкаливает.

												Best car racing game ever in my opinion, you get to choose from a big varity of cars. I like the nissan gtr best it is really fast and you can tune it more than you can tune other cars and it is not that expensive either. This game got my attention when I saw the trailer for the first time and i like soo much that i cried myself to sleep, my mum came in and gave me sum cinnamon buns and milk then I instantly felt better and thoght that evrythin will be better. The next the game launched and I went to the store to buy it, I payed for the game and got home and started the game and it took my breath away and i cried myself to sleep and then my mom came in and gave me some cinnamon buns and milk and then I instantly felt better. I wpuld really reccomendd this game if you want a good car racing game beacause it is so realistic and it requries so much skill that it seems like it isnt from this world. If you would compare this game to need for speed or somethin other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game this beats the crap out of them, so buy it !!			",40,0,1,2,1,0,1

												The single player game is quite fun, but the multiplayer sucks completely.   If you want a game to play by yourself, this is fine.   But if you want game you can play with friends and have a replayable experience... this is not the game for you.   Cheaters are all over the place.  Hackers are a constant.  Hacked lobbies are routine.  You can't hardly get into one single game, where there are no cheaters.  You are pretty much required to download an admin tool, that allows you to kick and ban cheaters, but the tool only works if you magically end up with host.   If you don't have host, you are at the mercy of other players who do.      The game could be easily fixed, but the company isn't going to, because there is no profit in it.  I have spent 2 hours, to play only one ten minute game that was actually worth playing.    The rest of the time, all you do is try and dodge hackers, get host only to lose host, and get kicked, or spend time kicking cheater and hackers.   The game is miserable to play as a multiplayer game.   I wish I had not spent the money on this game.  I would gladly delete it for a refund.			",78,3,0,8,0,0,23

												Great game storyline but the multiplayer is another thing.... TOO MUCH ONLINE MULTIPLAYER CHEATERS about the place ruining it for all those who enjoy a good game of skillful gaming war. The cheat detection is crap to catch the cheaters at their game and the report service suck and totally ineffective at banning reported cheaters even when there are proof of it. Maybe there is no budget left to hire a team to look after all ther reports. Possibly the developers has made their money and want you to buy their newest and latest Call of Duty, so they totally ignore this aspect of the game and FORCE YOU TO BUY THEIR NEXT ONE to make even more money. It's not really their fault. It is JUST BUSINESS.			",52,6,1,5,4,0,7

I'm not keen of FPS games and this game was daft over the top in any cut scenes. It reminded me somewhat of Red Alert type videos. Well, Im probably the 1% on this but I'm not a fan.

												At first, this game was fun and kind of exiting, but after playing it for a while, it started feel just like the modern warfare 2, even thought I really am not surprised about this, but at least some of the perks and noob tubes are not as overpowered as in mw2.Also it looks like they are not doing anything about the hackers that are ruining this game from others so I really advice you to stay away from this game.Well at least the campaing in this game is decent.

												Bought the game primarily to play Spec Ops with myself and 2 friends, but they forced it to only allow 2 players for no reason at all so we can't all play together at once. Good job Infinity Ward on screwing over your fans who all wanted the ability to play with multiple friends in Spec Ops, i'll be sure to do my research next time before ever buying a COD game to see if it supports up to 4 player co-op.

												Here is my review for Modern Warfare 3. Single player is AWESOME just like Modern Warfare 2 AWESOME story TOP NOTCH... The only problem I have is with the multiplayer side... That game play is SO screwed up with SO many HACKERS it sometimes not worth playing. 75% of the gamers HACK the game with all kinds of MODS and HACKS. Once in a great while you will get in a game when game play is almost fair.. The multiplayer is almost entirely ruined by people that want to ruin it for others. Your K/D doesn't really matter due to all the hacks going on. It's just a shame that we pay hard earned money for a game and the owners can't even stop the hacking... Thats not just hurting the guys that want fair play but it hurts the company owners eventually with less gamers willing to buy their product. STOP THE HACKING			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty good ending to the Modern Warfare games. I'd still say my favorite CoD is CoD4, you just can't beat it. The campaign had some really nice touches to it, such as decent graphics, pretty good story plot, and fun Specs Ops too. The Specs Ops I feel like is a lot better in MW2, than MW3. To end this, its a Modern Warfare. You can't go wrong with the Modern Warfare Games! Buy it now!			",84,14,2,8,2,1,3

												This is probably one of the best FPS games out there.  The campaign aspect of the game is well put together.  The graphics and gameplay is smooth and very stable.  YMMV with online game play.  I highly recommend a good internet connection of at least 75 Mb (Megabits, not bytes) down and 15 Mb up for good game play.  Anything less will give you a decided disadvantage.  The only real drawback to this game is all the hackers and cheaters.  That is to be expected in just about all online games.  But, the fact that this game does not have dedicated server support makes it a favorite target for unscrupulous players.  I highly recommend using an approved Server Admin Tool to help deal with cheaters (it's only good if you have host).   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Campaign sucks, not even gonna discuss that. It's no surprise in an IW game. Survival is really fun though, atleast with a friend. You can level up in survival to be able to buy better things like new weapons and equipment, also perks.I've put 370-ish hours into this game's multiplayer so you're probably thinking ""Wow, what a CoD kid"" right about now, but I really hate this game in most aspects lol. There's sooo many hackers in this game, you wouldn't believe it. IW doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥s about their games so they don't really do anything about it. When there are no hackers this game is really good though (If you're good at fast paced FPS atleast). The weapons are unbalanced as hell, although IW has actually boosted some weapons (not nerfed any of them tho) to make them atleast slightly up to par with the dominant weapons (the M16A4 used to take 3 bursts to kill, now it takes 1-2, an ACR takes 2 bullets to kill). Pretty much all weapons are fun to use, only a few exceptions like semi-auto snipers and the PM-9 which is like an UZI. Weapon levels eliminates the need to play with attachments that aren't good for your gun in order to unlock the best attachments, and it also eliminates the need to perform X amount of headshots to get camos, although level 30 to 31 (gold camo level) takes a looong time to unlock.Overall, this game is really fun but only fun on others accord. I usually own the pants of most people but only because I use so overpowered weapons and tactics most of the time. People can't really get mad at others for using those tactics either so everytime I get killed by someone when I'm using an average weapon I think ""Damn him for using that weapon!"" but I always use it myself to make people angry just like he made me angry by using it. It's a fun game, it's just really frustrating and unbalanced.I recommend it if you can stand the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the ever so many hackers.			",151,13,2,23,16,0,20

												I recommend this game as I like this game. I like this game because it offers a much better graphic than what most of the games can offer. It is the finest of the fines even if ""finest"" isn't considered a word. I was hoping that this game can give additional features and perhaps even extend of what it is right now, approve it. Then if so, this game would be totally wicked. In the game, when we hold knifes, I believe is too simple as in when I press ""e"" to slice enemies, it just brings out a slash and puts the knife right away. I think it should be more realistic like perhaps putting the knife away for additional time or putting the gun away and having the knife instead of the gun, and just a slice from a knife. It will then be the person holding the knife the entire time instead of just a slice from a knife, doing much more combos; being creative. Anyways and overall this game is wicked and I recommend it as it is but it can still improve far more but I believe it is beast from my honest opinion.			",33,0,0,0,2,1,0

												It's great. It's the mostly simple and easy-to-play FPS series to date. There is no skill involved so anyone can play it.It's exactly the same as Cod4:MW and Modern Warfare 2, just with a 3 in the name. So you don't have to worry about learning curve if you've already played those games.Given how old the game is now, I'd imagine the price would fit nicely at £10-12, especially given how often these games come out, so you collectors would probably want to wait until a price reduction of 75%.Having said that, we all know how Activision are barely managing to pay the bills and cloth little Jimmy, so we can all forgive how every single CoD game releases at £40 and stays that way for as long as possible.If you want to play CoD Ghosts but don't want to deal with the bugs, the lack of any optimization and not have to spend £40-60, then get this game at 50% off! It's a steal when you consider how it's the EXACT SAME GAME but better!Wow!Or you could play Planetside 2 and not spend a dime, but yeah.			",423,42,18,31,32,3,72

												This is a pretty good ending to the Modern Warfare games. I'd still say my favorite CoD is CoD4, you just can't beat it. The campaign had some really nice touches to it, such as decent graphics, pretty good story plot, and fun Specs Ops too. The Specs Ops I feel like is a lot better in MW2, than MW3. To end this, its a Modern Warfare. You can't go wrong with the Modern Warfare Games! Buy it now!			",84,14,2,8,2,1,3

												This is probably one of the best FPS games out there.  The campaign aspect of the game is well put together.  The graphics and gameplay is smooth and very stable.  YMMV with online game play.  I highly recommend a good internet connection of at least 75 Mb (Megabits, not bytes) down and 15 Mb up for good game play.  Anything less will give you a decided disadvantage.  The only real drawback to this game is all the hackers and cheaters.  That is to be expected in just about all online games.  But, the fact that this game does not have dedicated server support makes it a favorite target for unscrupulous players.  I highly recommend using an approved Server Admin Tool to help deal with cheaters (it's only good if you have host).   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Мне не очень понравилась. Одна смерть Соупа, чего стоит, портит впечатление от игры. Когда играешь в MW 2, ""ВАУ"" на каждом повороте. По сравнению с COD 4 MW в MW2, масса нововведений, а в MW3 нет такого, что могло впечатлить. Конец истории, мягко говоря ужасный, карты в мультиплеере очень тесные. Проделанная работа по сравнению с MW2, чистая халтура. Единственное ради чего можно играть, так это кол-во человек в мультиплеере, и режим выживания.Оценка: неплохо 6/10 ",118,9,8,7,4,2,8

												 Игрушку, если вы хотите получить удовольствие, лучше не покупать. Смело скачать себе пиратку, пройти Сингл и забыть, что вы видели эту игру. Почему? В Multiplayer все серверы забиты читерами, детьми и неадекватами всех возрастов, рас и вероисповедания. Игра превратилась в мусор (так и была с самого начала, т.к. не успела появится, как в ней появились читы, а за ними читеры) только из-за того, что в отличий от MW2, кол-во читеров в MW3 зашкаливает.

												Campaign?: 11/10Multiplayer?...Oh boy. Hackers, cheaters, where ever you turn your head, there are hackers.In at least 3 on 5 games there is a loser using mod menus to give himself godmode, rocket launcher machine gun, flying, high jumps, wallhacks etc.It's really sad, i can't play a whole session without finding a lowlife loser that ruins the game for everyone else, the situation is just out of hand. I wish the devs gave a single flying ♥♥♥♥ about their game banning the cheaters even if the game is old, because it's still a valid game. But for now, only the campaign is worth the money, all the rest is just a steaming sh*t because of the community.			",74,3,0,1,5,0,0

												This is game was pretty fun when it first came out, but now, it has turned into a mess.I have nothing against Campaign, it has a beautiful storyline and is worth playing.This is mainly for the people who are here for multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, but multiplayer is an amazing game-mode where you get together with your friends and play some TDM, S&D, ect. So this by far the BIGGEST reason why I don't recommend the game to the people. There are WAY TOO MANY HACKER in the game itself. Everytime that I queue up for a game, I always come across one if not the whole team full of  hackers, hacking their a**es off. It is literally nerve cracking, and literally annoys any players who are legit. The risk is yours...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ALL THE SAME!Constantly getting called a ""noob"" by the fellow underaged kids that swarm the mw3 servers.MW3, YOU could of been BETTER then THIS!You have let me down, its about time the modern warfare series meet extinction. Im sorry but BF4, LOADOUT, CS:GO and ALOT MORE other games beat this game by FAR!The Modern Warfare Series has let me down, especialy ghosts, and I can not complete the last mission because the game will simply crash.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I feel they just pushed acouple of buttons and realesed it as a full game.The MW series has let me down. I will not be purchasing anyother games that the modern warfare series will be releasing.UNLESS IT TURNS OUT TO BE A GAME GAMERS WILL LOVE!Sorry for the harsh words, but this IS what I truely want to say.Black ops 1: zombies is as good as it gets.Goodbye MW, You could of been much better then this.*Due to respect, you have to respect the gamers for what they actualy want, and expect in a game.That is Pretty overpriced, for it's limited fun.Someone purchases a game, they expect it to be good. Thats somthing the MW Series does not respect and know.(I Prefure no responces, for I no longer care what the MW Series has to say)""BECAUSE IT DOES NOT MEAN CRAP TO ME, LIKE HOW DEVELOPING GOOD GAMES DOES NOT MEAN CRAP TO THE MW SERIES!""Sincerely decayman123			",196,6,3,8,11,2,12

												Ok, I finished the SP campaign, and can officially comment on it. Generally the campaign is thrilling, with some fantastic sequences we've all wanted to experience, like swimming through a devastated lincoln tunnel, or running though a building on the verge of collapsing.  However, this is the most restrictive COD to date in terms of player choices... some scenes require a specific path or key sequence that sometimes just require trial and error to discover the path or timing.  The story is a bit predictable with no twists to speak of.  I also played some Spec Ops and Multiplayer, a refinement over the previous version.  I would say that BLOPS is a better effort overall but MW3 was still a thrill to play.  Wait for it to go on sale... $60 is too much.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												I completed the solo once, forgot about it immediately, and finished all spec ops missions in co-op with a friend. I barely tried the survival mode, and mainly played MW3 for its multiplayer. Of course. If you liked MW2 multiplayer, you'll like MW3 multiplayer. At least I did. They share the same ingredients, and (almost) the same recipe. Expect no more, i.e. small maps & fast pace: spawn, run, shoot, kill, run, shoot, die, rage. And start all over again. Personally, I liked the addition of the Specialist class, which fitted better to my play style. However, there were far too many kill streaks spamming every game. Spawn kills also remained an issue, evidently. Desertion to the new title every year, leaving empty lobbies after one year, may also be a show-stopper. All in all, it's an ideal game for releasing the pressure & frustration after long days of work, and blaming everything and everyone for each of your death in a deluge of bad faith arguments. Good old times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Single-player:The single-player portion of COD somehow disappointed me a little bit. I don't know why. I guess the story went a little overboard as well. Still, there are some really cool set pieces and the action never stops. In the end the game ended on a satisfying note. But I do hope they'll drastically update their engine for the next COD or create a new one altogether. Let's just hope it will perform the same as these CODs then (60FPS solid).On the other hand, the co-op part is really awesome. The Last Stand campaign really is brilliant, and hard. Plus, there are lots of maps. Only downside is that it's limited to 2 players max. So finding a buddy that doesn't disconnect halfway through or even knows how to play it at all is difficult. But when you do find one it's most of the times great.The co-op missions are in there as well. They start off pretty easy, but get harder quite quickly. Also limited to 2 players unfortunately. But fun nonetheless, especially on Veteran mode.Multiplayer:Still king of the FPS multiplayer. It's MW2 all over again, with some much needed change all around. Well, change is a big word, but there are some updated mechanics, new modes, perks and uncountable unlockables. Remember how Black Ops played somehow differently ? Well, MW3 plays exactly like MW2; fast-paced and without stuttering. It's brilliant ! I guess 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' really applies to the COD series these days. I don't mind though since it gets better with every MW.I'll be playing this for a long, long time.Insta-buy ! [Rating: 90/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Did I like it better than MW2? Not sure, I honestly dont think so, sadly so many hackers almost right after the game was released and like usual lame people using lame tactics (akimbo FMG9s) . Still awesome game to scrim and play with friends though, just wish the PC version had more attention.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												This is totally not a recommendation. I played the game on the 360 and LOVED it. Didn't have too many friends on there, though, so I decided to get it on Steam (after trading in 360 version). Big mistake. TDM was the only game type that had a decent amount of people in it. Ground Wars (my favorite) was sparsely populated and every game I played had a hacker in it. Would not recommend.			",494,141,6,50,40,6,63

												Loved it: Fast-paced and exciting campaign, great multiplayer headlined by Spec Ops Survival, great production values.Hated it: You’ve experienced much of what this game offers before.Grab it if: You enjoyed the first two “Modern Warfare”games.			",1115,382,38,118,94,13,163

												One of the worst Call of Dutys ever created. Everything taken from MW2, which was bad anyway, and just threw it inside of this piece of software. I hope they will lose all their fans because I somehow have a feeling that they will go to far with that low quality crap.			",208,22,4,8,7,0,4
