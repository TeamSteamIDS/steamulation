												When I first played this a few years ago, I didn't know too much about Batman. I didn't have to. This game serves as an excellent introduction to both the licensed LEGO titles by Traveler's Tales and the various interpretations of the Batman mythos from DC Comics, and if you're a fan of either, I'd be rather stunned if you didn't enjoy this.It's your standard Batman plot. This one is not ripped from any existing film or comic, but is instead a new situation made to send you through as much of LEGO Gotham as it can, as both the Dynamic Duo of Batman and Robin shutting down the evil plans of Arkham Asylum's escaped supervillain denizens, and those iconic villains themselves going out to cause trouble. It's a very bright and colorful Gotham, though still quite dark. I guess it'd be more accurate to say it's a high contrast Gotham, and this leads to a rather gorgeous visual design heavily influenced by the Tim Burton films, a place that's beautiful when it's not being creepy as all heck.It's much more the campy, silly kind of Batman than the darker Dark Knight of late (Arkham Asylum totally nailed that shortly after), though like I said, a few places are still certainly creepy. There are some changes for gameplay's sake, such as all of the villains being shipped off to Arkham Asylum (instead of some going to Blackgate Penitentiary, as Arkham is a hub level). Instead of constantly changing characters, the Hero missions have our heroes constantly changing Suits found within the level. Some are really cool, like the Glide Suit allowing you to soar or the Attract Suit allowing you to vacuum things (it's oddly entertaining), while others are just kind of a hassle or quickly forgotten about, like the Heat Protection Suit (good luck remembering it's a thing) or the Magnet Suit (have fun walking up walls very, very slowly every other level). You're able to switch between these as though they were separate characters in Free Play, and the villains don't have such gimmicks, so it kinda evens out in the end. You're able to unlock suit upgrades, and many of them, like speeding up the intolerably slow Magnet Suit to tolerable speeds, feel like they should've been available from the start.The levels are very distinct, and for the most part, I would say very fun. This was, however, just before they started handling vehicles properly again in the LEGO games, so there are some completely infuriating moments where you have to tether your vehicle to mines and slam those mines into things, but they don't and they just slide around wildly until enemies blow them up and you have to start all over. When this is not the case, they are entertaining and explosive action sequences, but dang are they a pain to 100%. (Admittedly, I still boot up the game exclusively to play the Batmobile level, because you get to drive the Batmobile and just tear through the streets of Gotham.)So, fans of the LEGO games, this was the game that set the par for the course, bringing in targeting mechanics, 32 levels, and a long list of increasingly obscure characters (Batman fans probably won't believe ""Joker (Tropical)"" made it into a ""kid's game""). Fans of the Batman series, you'll find that much as the game takes liberties for the sake of humor or gameplay, they did really do their research first before intentionally making these choices. And you can play as Bane, Alfred, Batgirl, Nightwing, Hush, and one extra at 100% you're bound to geek out a bit over. Bios for each of the villains appear in the levels where the heroes fight them, so if you're new to the series and know very little about it, you'll come out quite well-learned.All in all, it's fun. Campy, creepy, and stuffed to the gills with little nostalgic nods, atmospheric combat, and iconic characters. For once, it's exactly what it says on the tin. LEGO. Batman. There you have it. If that sounds good, go for it.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

LEGO Batman (Action-Adventure)I had not planned to try another LEGO game so soon after the Harry Potter games, but my eldest really wanted to play this one on her computer, so I decided to play, too.  I reached 100% completion last night, just a few minutes ahead of her :DThis game is nothing like the Batman: Arkham games that I so adore, nor is it like the story-driven LEGO: HP games.  Gameplay is standard fight, explore, build, destroy everything possible and grab all the coins (studs) possible.  There are three chapters from Batman & Robin's perspective, plus three chapters from the villains' point of view, with each chapter spanning five episodes for a total of 30 levels.Collectibles:- 300 mini-kit pieces (10 per level)- 30 red bricks (which unlock new abilities - don't forget to turn on in the Extras menu once you purchase!)- 24 hostagesWhy are there only 24 hostages when there are 30 levels?  Because one episode in each chapter is done entirely in a vehicle, and there are no hostages - only shooting, exploring, simple puzzles, and collecting. Vehicle types:  Automobile, watercraft, aircraft.Our home base is - not surprisingly - the Batcave for our heroes, and Arkham Asylum for the villains.  Once you unlock and purchase the extra characters, you'll find them wandering around in their respective area, and can switch to them when they are nearby.  You can also choose whichever character you wish to play as when you enter a level in Free Play mode.Characters are mostly unlocked during gameplay.  For instance, you may want to play as The Joker, but you won't be able to unlock him until you complete the villain level that has him as a playable character.To be honest, I found the stories and combat to be a bit on the ho-hum side, especially when we were playing only as Batman and Robin (the first three chapters).  True, they both have a variety of suits with their own unique abilities, but Story Mode was still kind of boring.  Once the villains started unlocking, though, things got more interesting.  Once unlocked, Nightwing and Batgirl were my preferred characters on the heroes side (they have the same suits as Robin and Batman), and Man Bat my favorite villain to play. Not only is Man Bat interesting to look at, but he is a powerful fighter, has super strength AND and the ability to glide!There are a couple of minor annoyances along the way, with finicky ladders, and glass that just did NOT want to break when using the sonic suit unless you were standing the right distance away from it.  There's one glass window that will not break unless you bomb it - something that will not work on any other glass window in the whole game. :\LEGO Batman is not an amazing gaming experience, but I really had fun getting my 100% once I got past Story Mode and had everyone unlocked for Free Play Mode.  The puzzles are pretty easy, but there's something satisfying about mindlessly demolishing everything in sight and collecting all of the coins and hidden things.  Recommended for all LEGO game fans!			",520,547,5,64,35,4,42

												This is a very typical Lego game, with the same gameplay featured in all the other Lego titles. So simply put, if you like the other Lego games, you'll like this. Being one of the older titles, the cut scenes don't feature any dialogue and personally i think this suits the Lego games much better than the likes of Lord of the Rings, Marvel Super Heroes and The Hobbit which DO feature dialogue. It doesn't suit the game. This means Lego Batman is up there with the Lego Star Wars games as being the best of the Lego series and the ones i recommend the most.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												Wow, I really must recommend this game! This first Lego Batman game is a little bit more closed doors that the second  since its more level based instead of being open world. Much like the Star Wars Trilogy by Lego. But its still awesome! Full of content from the Batman movies and universe. This game has all the villans we see in Arkam Asylum and City. The game uses Music by Danny Elfman, so we instantly get the Tim Burton Movie feel of the 90's. Its set up into 3 episodes. The Riddler, Pinguin and Joker. Over the course of all these levels we fight Two Face, Poison Ivy, Bane, Scarecrow etc. First I thought the game was fairly short but then realized that after unlocking Episode 1 you can go over to Arkam and play the game from the villans point of view. Changing the game completely. The set pieces lock beautiful and are very gritty and dark. Sound and Music are just perfect. I recommend this game to kids but also grown ups will have a blast with this game. Specially when you play with a friend or girl.Its great that these Lego games have a certain charm girls dig, so if you think your too macho to play this at least do it for some game time with the Girlfriend. Overall this game is amazing. Cant wait to play Lego Batman 2 with all the DC characters.10/10			",770,119,31,28,18,9,49

												Lego Batman is a cute Lego-ish take on the Batman franchise. Unlike other Lego Games, where a universe and story was created in lego-fashion, Lego Batman has it's own original story. You play from a third-person perspective, and can play as one of a number of different characters once you unlock them. You can also control the Batmobile, Batwing and a boat, which is pretty cool. As with previous Lego games you can play in two-player co-op mode. In Lego Batman, you face off against The Riddler, Clayface, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Two Face, Penguin, Bane, Killer Croc, Man, Bat, Catwoman, Scarecrow, The Mad Hatter, Killer Moth, as well as Joker and Harley Quinn. All of these foes have escaped Arkham Asylum and will need to be rounded up to make Gotham City safe once more.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Before I pick this up, I always assume Lego games are for kids. The reasons I picked this up are because of The Lego Movie and a Batman fans. After I played this, my assumptions are never correct. Ok, this game is amazing. It has good level design, great game mechanics, characters ability, and decent of puzzle solving. There's one thing I'm not satisfied is the A.I. Their inteligence meter is like them bots in Payday : The Heist. Sadly, there's only local co-op. Control wise, I'd recommend a controller. If you're going to enjoy the story and atmosphere as an adult, you're going to have a bad time. (Not much cutscene and voice acting).High replay value, you cannot retrieve all the hidden stuff on your first attempt. There's this free mode which you can control all sets of Batman and Robin suits along with other villians with exclusive abilities. There's a lot of stuff you can unlock as well. Characters, Fun Facts about Batman and vehicles.Performance wise, I keep getting 30 fps on my GT650M. Occasionally random 60 fps for few seconds. The PC port is damn good. There is no bug. I never got the crash to desktop or any not responding stuff. There's are glitches though. (Spoiler Alert) : This one may happen if you leave Robin too far away during Story mode. On the Zoo level, do not attemp to jump to a stair while riding an elephant. The animal will block your exit. On the 1st level pursuing Joker, do not return and use the last 25 parts on the first machine.So far I've encountered those 2.10/10 would recommend. A good buy during sales.			",164,22,2,5,4,1,7

												If there’s anything that can be easily compressed into a simple slapstick style in which plastic figurines beat one another to a pulp, it’s comic books. Realistically, that’s a lot of what comic books are in the first place. All you really want to see in a comic is two or more people with their perfectly-shaped bodies shrink-wrapped in spandex pounding one another into the dirt, and that’s pretty much what Lego Batman: The Videogame delivers.The basic premise is identical to the previous Lego games from Traveller’s Tales. You have to traverse a series of levels set within admittedly pretty standard Batman settings—mostly based on the Tim Burton films of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Within these levels are a bunch of puzzles, most of which follow the not-so-grand tradition of these games, revolving almost entirely around choosing the right character to pass a certain obstacle. They have, however, solved a major problem that Lego Indiana Jones had—in that game, a lot of characters were very similar visually, often making it difficult to identify who was needed for a certain task. Thankfully, there are rarely two characters that look alike in Lego Batman, which is extremely useful in instant recognition, which is important for a style of game like this.However, the puzzles themselves are really quite mundane. While they haven’t changed for the negative since Lego Star Wars, it’s mostly because they haven’t change at all, which made the whole affair a little more dull than it strictly speaking could have been. It is an expectation of this series, however, that the core gameplay does not change at all, as the whole thing is carried based on which particular franchise’s skin has been stretched over it. I can personally look past the total lack of innovation in this instance, though, since the difficulty level and general tone make it seem like more of a laid back affair than any type of game you’d actually take seriously. What has been done fantastically is adherence to the tone of older, campier iterations of Batman. The style gels really well with the Lego brand, and I was contented just to sit back and enjoy it all.That said, these Lego games are sorely in need of a general gameplay update just to keep everything running smoothly. Fighting with guns is such a hassle that it is genuinely easier to get in there with fists, and the vehicle-based levels are just awful to play—everything feels floaty and out of control. It might even be worth introducing a combat system that uses more than one button—a way to block incoming attacks would go a long way to enhance the experience and just make fights less of a mess.Lego Batman is without question better than Indiana Jones. It seems that Traveller’s Tales have really cemented how important it is to adapt IPs that have unique looking characters and a variety of different environments. I’d recommend Lego Batman for it’s great tone and atmosphere, even if it is all getting a little bit stale.My review of Lego Star Wars: The Complete SagaMy review of Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures ",266,26,0,24,5,1,16

												Great lego game, it is everything you expect from a lego game like characters with special abilities and secrets around entire map. I Didn't finished the game yet but I'm sure I will go back to every level just to get everything, no studs left behind.My first thought when I got to the Bat cave was: ""what the heck? only 3 chapters??"" but then I discovered that there is 3 chapters as batman & robin and 3 chapters as villains (which I think are the best missions because you see what happened before Batman's chapters.I Recommend this game to everyone, to batman fans, to non batman fans, kids, adults, granpas and grandmas... It isn't hard, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. To myself the great challenge is to get everything from every mission and the max amount of studs I can get.			",229,24,6,18,19,0,11

												This is one of the best games I ever played. It has that special ""just one more mission"" feeling. I‘m currently at 78% after finishing Story and replaying several levels and one day I will release every hostage, collect every canister and red brick. Story has 3 campaigns with 5 levels and then you do the same with villains i.e. in total 30 levels and they are not exactly the same (location is but level design is different). Game is filled with outstanding humor. Almost every character has its place. Level design is the impressive combination of platforming, puzzling and fighting. In every Story level you can collect enough studs for Super Hero/Villain achivement mostly without major problems. Yes there is always part(s) of level where you can die to overflow of enemies but only if you are careless. Compared to SW games, it‘s nothing. And then there is your co-op AI which is not passive i.e. he/she kills other AIs, too! There is one negative and that is like in SW games – flying. It‘s not terrible as is in SW games, it‘s clearly better but still not good enough. But there are only few levels with it so no big deal.All in all, worth every cent!			",299,63,23,45,36,5,95

												LEGO Batman is the third game in Traveller's Tales's LEGO videogames series. If we count Star Wars games as a single game, yes. And it was released in 2008. And wasn't based on any movie for first time ever. And it was as multiplatform as it gets, being also released for PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, NDS and PSP. None interesting difference compared between consoles and PC. PSP is like big brothers versions but beaten up badly. NDS has to be remade from scratch engine-wise and it seems to be worse, smaller and clunkier.Technically, there is one nasty major glitch. Just like Lego Indiana Jones game, this game will glitch, bug and hate you, unless V-Sync is turned on in options. So turn V-Sync on, Robin, and one day you will be as cool as Nightwing.Game still crashed on me rarely though, weird.And well, what do I say. Holy Batman, it's yet another LEGO platformer game. It the kind of repetetive casual game that is a dreamgame for collect-a-ton players, as you collect many many studs, buy all characters from franchise, collect more stuff, unlock bonus, collect. You can't even die properly, you just lose some studs. Combat is simplistic button-masher, instead it has more focus on casual puzzles. You still can't collect all stuff from Story mode, have to come at Free Play, where you can select another char during gameplay itself. And well Yet Another LEGO Game!Well, ok, today it's actually yet another old-style Lego game. Though now with better graphics, yay better lighting and watery-water.The big difference this time is that it wasn't based off a movie. That means that it's not going to parody your favourite scenes, which may kill humor for some. All characters still don't talk, only make silly sounds with mouth, but cutscenes are still slapstick.The plot this time is simple: Criminals, psychos and clowns on strike had escaped Arkham Asylum along with famous Batman villians and are causing havoc. Batman and Robin must go and beat them up. One by one.But hey, at least it brings more of game quality into it. You get to beat bosses at the end of each hero mission.Yep, game is divided into 15 hero missions and 15 villian missions. Which are connected plot-wise, villian chapters can be played after beating hero ones and explain what baddies were doing before Batman and Robin came in and punched them into blocks.Hero missions in story mode always see us controlling Batman and Robin. Nope, it never changes, but they are quite interesting pair. Here they can change to certain suit at special powerup rings, which gives them abilities of suit. Like, gliding for Batman. Or walking on the wall made of metal surface for Robin. They also got ability to throw batargan. You just hold attack button and move cursor over baddies and objects you want to be hit and then release button and watching it fly. Or get busy in meantime. It both lets you get enemies outside of your reach and makes it less repetetive to destroy many things. Dark side missions are more on level of Lego Star Wars. No suit, no batargan. You may get different characters for each chapter, but there is always only two of them. It's still a bit less repetetive than Star Wars, but could use more, like pickable objects from Indiana Jones. It even has those occasional moments where too many enemies respawn too fast and you get killed while trying to solve puzzle and it gets frustrated.Both of them have few additional things. Most characters can now pick enemy and throw. It's just for variety, you can't aim where you throw at. Shame. Another thing is that you build up combo number while melee fighting enemies, up to 10. It's actually score multiplier, so as soon as you build it up, go and grab some studs, quick! Melee combat also feels more funny, with some enemies flying out comic-like.AI teammates is sometimes does more stupid things than usually. Like, he can even sometimes not figure a way to get to you and you will not be tag back easily if you go too far, making you backtrack quite a distance.Also, no one told me that Scarecrow is counted as Riddler when it comes to in-game locked gates.Eh, in the end, it's yet another Lego game. Good for those who love collecting stuff and want to relax with some very casual relaxed platformer. And for people who find Adventures of Batman and Robin for Sega Genesis just a bit too hard.Ok, that game is hard as hell, so don't be ashamed. I am just ending review on silly tone. This game is still too repetetive to recommend outside of niche market. Even if it's kinda good.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

 Extremely fun!  If you're looking for something you can just kick and play with full controller support, it is well worth your time. Playing with another human you will get a bit more out of the game than by your lonesome though regardless it is a great buy either way. The best part? No two player dynamic splitscreen!

												Well this game start with a problem, it was easily fixed by switching V-sync on.But after that I did enjoy myself its a nice game, best bought on sale that is.I bought all 3 Batmans as a package so it's hard to go wrong.This game actually had something that I wish the real Batman had.You got 3 episodes with each 15 levels you can play you use Batman and Robin to solve puzzles and fight of allot of enemy's. You also can/need to change to other outfits that have different powers its nicely done.But what I wish the real Batman game had and this game has.You can play as the Bad guys :PGives another extra 3 episodes with another total of 15 levels.It well done and gives a different view on the good guy missions.Every episode also has 1 epic mission in which you get to use an aircraft or boat those are my fav. Should offer plenty of gametime as I'm not done yet.The only silly thing is they didn't give the guys voices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The video game where it started it all. I personal have played this game growing up, and playing this game today I'm stuprise that I have the same fun I have as a child. This game is fun playing alone and more fun playing with a friend, This video game is open with hidden areas and collectibles and music that goes along with it. I recommend playing this game first before playing the others in the series. 8/10			",12,3,2,0,3,0,1

												Lego Batman The Videogame is a nice game for the younger audience but also for the older audience and of course every Batman Fan. Unlike Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 it does not crash up on start up and runs all in all perfect. The Main Story itself is 6 hours long. But if you are really looking into it there is actually alot more that you can do. Once you complete a level you will unlock 'Free Play' which means you can once again go back to the level and do all the things you missed the first time you played it to 100% complete the game. Now the game doesn't have steam achievements but it does have a ingame gallery where you can see everything that you collected. Although I myself would off liked steam achievements a bit more this game was mainly aimed towards kids which means they got all the time in the world to collect every little piece in the game. Unlike the newer Lego Games this one has hardly any voice acting in it, meaning the only time you hear a voice is when they make a noise. At first it bothered me when I got the game a couple of years back but now it just add's to that comedy factor they were aiming towards and I love it.For the fact that this game came out in 2008 it is a gorgeous game that runs without problems! I can recommend this game for every Batman Fan and every Lego Fan. However if you are just interested like me in playing the main story I would recommend getting this game on Sale as 20€ is a bit heavy for 6 hours.			",329,157,4,49,23,2,28

												LEGO Batman serves as an introduction to the Batman Universe and is a superb cross between the LEGO franchise as well. It offers many playable levels and about 23 hours of gameplay. The game also offers the hub of the batcave and Arkham Asylum. Overall, what makes this game different than other LEGO superhero games is that it offers levels that are a villain basis allowing the player to delve deeper into the world. Against the other LEGO Batman games, I would choose this one everytime. This is where they had perfected it.			",83,3,1,9,2,0,1

												A series I play exclusively with my wife, I am eternally grateful that travellers Tales have made so many Lego games, as they are almost the only couch co-op PC games available. After playing Lego LOTR and the Hobbit, and all the Harry Potters, this game came as a funny and enjoyable disappointment.The game doesn't follow any batman films, and each of the 6 episodes has very little story, and I really prefer the speech of the later games to the Lego moans and groans of the older ones. But the real disappointment occurs in the execution.Climbing up ladders is frustrating, and both of us were often falling off. A few bugs stopped us dead in our tracks too. After 20 minutes of searching around I looked up some guides... oh, another bug. Reset, and go through the whole level again and progress.The camera angles are simply some of the worst I have ever seen. The screen never splits into two, and some of the camera pans don't even allow one character to reach his ""action"" place without the other character being knocked out of the screen. This led to a massive bug.Sometimes when the 2nd player was knocked out of the screen, the game wouldn't let my wife rejoin. This bug happened 3 or 4 times and meant I had to play alone until the end of that level, before resetting the entire game. This has nothing to do with my xbox controllers as the keyboard wouldn't work as well when this happened.Nevertheless, we had a lot of laughs at the quirky buggy nature. Jumping felt so much harder than later games, and some of the puzzles are unfair. My wife would give it a 7 out of 10, but that is over generous. From me, 6/10. Worth a punt when on offer, and you don't have anything better to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You got the good things:The childhood memories (We're talking LEGO's and Batman.)Controller SupportBest part is, it kinda has that LEGO Star Wars feeling. (Kinda, because it's another Tt game.)Not only that, but it has humor.But it's not fully epic because:You can't make it windowed, no matter what. Don't believe me, get it and see if you can get it windowed. $5 of Steam funds says you can't.It's another Warner Bros. LEGO game. If you REALLY want something from LEGO. Choose LEGO Racers. (N64, PC [Non Steam}, etc.)(All the way an opinion) I'm not a huge fan of Batman, let alone even HEARD of him in my childhood.Overall, I'd say this is worth it if you can snag a good deal.

												Woo! Just finished Lego Batmanz. It's a lot of fun and of course, the Lego charm is brilliant. However, I found it to be quite samey throughout. And I must admit, that was a bit of a shame.Yes, there was a Batmobile chase with guns and the same kind of thing with the Batwing, but then, it's straight back to running around on the ground punching up scenery to find the items you need to progress. Now, I'm not saying it ruined the experience. Heck no! I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't fun. It's just that the progression seemed a little too formulaic, e.g. need a certain suit to progress, start bashing scenery to find a costume changer. Or the one I mentioned before where, you come to a seemingly dead end, well, time to bash some scenery to see if there's a ladder or something in there.Apart from these moments, it's a nice little Batman game for kids. Maybe I expected too much with the challenges, lol. :P Otherwise, I can see this being a lot of fun with a 2nd player in tow. But in single player, it's decent.

												Woo! Just finished Lego Batmanz. It's a lot of fun and of course, the Lego charm is brilliant. However, I found it to be quite samey throughout. And I must admit, that was a bit of a shame.Yes, there was a Batmobile chase with guns and the same kind of thing with the Batwing, but then, it's straight back to running around on the ground punching up scenery to find the items you need to progress. Now, I'm not saying it ruined the experience. Heck no! I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't fun. It's just that the progression seemed a little too formulaic, e.g. need a certain suit to progress, start bashing scenery to find a costume changer. Or the one I mentioned before where, you come to a seemingly dead end, well, time to bash some scenery to see if there's a ladder or something in there.Apart from these moments, it's a nice little Batman game for kids. Maybe I expected too much with the challenges, lol. :P Otherwise, I can see this being a lot of fun with a 2nd player in tow. But in single player, it's decent.

												Wow. I've known these LEGO games were buggy, but it was usually an issue with some obscure missing piece that wouldn't let me get to 100%, so I could deal. LEGO Batman (on the PC anyway) has a bug that won't even let you finish one of the levels in Story mode. (Breaking Blocks, the last level in the Riddler chapter - you jump on a plunger and your AI buddy is supposed to jump on the other one, but won't do it.) I guess no one play tests these games once they're ported from Xbox.			",41,12,0,17,7,0,21

												I played this game as a kid on the Nintendo DS, and I enyojed it a lot. So I saw it on a sale and decided to buy it on PC, but I regret it. The controls are so horrible (even with a XBOX 360 controller) that you find yourself constantly falling off cliffs, losing some of the studs, and then respawning on a wrong place where the character is already falling again, and that might happen two or three times in a row. I had to uninstall before finishing the second level.			",162,18,7,26,16,2,29

												This is the first game in the LEGO Batman series and features the gameplay which caracterized the first games in the LEGO series, so its gameplay might feel somewhat dull or repetitive in comparison to the other LEGO Batman videogames, it is still worth playing.The game features:-Three campaigns to play as our heroes Batman and Robin.-Three campaigns to play as the main villains in the game.-Many unlockable extras and characters you can swap while playing.-Two hub worlds being the BatCave for our heroes and Arkham Asylum for our villains.Each campaign features five levels, which sums up to a total of 30 levels if you count both campaigns (32 if you want to complete the bonus levels) and the fun collectible hunt for which the LEGO games are so well-known.Would I recommend this game? I would definitely do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like other Lego games I have played, this one is a lot of fun, funny and the people working on it clearly know the source material very well. An example is the opening is the classic batman music from the animated series and the opening is similar to it with two random thugs on a roof top, batman jumps down, leers at them, they draw guns that get knocked out by his batarang before he beats them down and then poses ontop of a building with Robin joining him.Almost every single batman villain is in this one. I can understand not including every single damn one, but they did a good job in getting many of them from the famous joker to the infamous Mad Hatter and reletively unknown, Killer Moth. As it's a Lego game all the characters are representing in a comical way and at times the characters act more like the 1960's batman TV show with Adam West, however at other times it's more like the show where in the sewers a Crocodile jumps up, Batman leers at it and then it runs away because Batman, he's the man.I also enjoyed playing the villain side, doing the stuff before Batman arrives on scene and doing the freeplay missions are quite fun. Most things are obvious to find hidden, but others are so damn well hidden it takes a while. Thank god for guides on the internet.Overall, I'd say go for it. It's a lot of fun and is one of those perfect games to play to cut off the edge of the day and can get very addictive too. Like all Lego games it's easy and this one has adaptive difficulty too. I can't wait to play the second one as that one is meant to have the DC heroes in it too, though for some reason it's still called LEGO Batman 2, perhaps it takes place in Gotham and is focued on Batman? I'll have to wait and see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LEGO Batman: The Video Game. Loved this on the PSP. Still own them actually. Plus 30 other titles. Anyway, why is this a negative rating if I loved the game so much? Isn't this an exact replica of the PSP version, except controls?Yes, you are correct. The default controls are a bit weird in my opinion, but they're easily changed.My problem? Well, I have 2. The game got stuck at certain points. It also made the Steam Overlay not work when I accidentally hit SHIFT + TAB. The sound randomly stopped. My PC plays sound, all my settings are correct and NO I DONT HAVE IT ON MUTE.I'm not sure if this is just me or anyone else, but reviews are what I think of the game based on how it runs for ME. If I find a fix I'll change this.Robin is still annoying af though. ♥♥♥♥ing Robin...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the reassurances of all the other positive reviews I cannot recommend this game. The other reviews are not wrong, the game contains classic lego gameplay mechanics. It runs smoothly with no frame rate dips, or texture issues. In the performance category it is a well made port.The reason I cannot recommend it, is because using a controller is near mandatory. Keyboard binding is horrible and even after remapping I found myself fighting the controls more often than I fought the villains leading to the game becoming tedious and boring.If you plan to play this game with a controller and want that classic lego game feel then I recommend this game. If you are going to use a keyboard just pass on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fine game for the most part.  The design sense is fun.  The puzzles are interesting and challenging but fair.  Navigating menus is awkward and annoying but not terribly so.  (To quit from a level to Windows you have to quit and confirm your choice 4 times, with 2 loading screens.)Where the game fails, and badly, is the combat.  It's obtrusive, unwanted, and interferes with playing the actual game.  I understand this game is designed for a variety of ages, and a 4 year old may find it rewarding to be able to fight bad guys while daddy beats the level.  Bad guys are plentiful (in some cases, infinite) and trivial to defeat.  That's great, but as a single player experience the game suffers.			",232,112,0,29,11,3,15

Under Windows 7 the game frequently crashes and there are various bugs that require compatibility settings and specific options enabled.It's obviously a console game first which was hastely ported to PC. Very disappointing when the Lego Harry Potter games were superb and played without issue.Some of the early hero levels are just not playable.

Would recommend just getting one of the sequels instead, you're not missing out on much in terms of the story, which is (deliberately) kept simple and straightforward (bad guys escape, catch the bad guys!).

Lego Batman gets 2 of these right however the last one it fails at. I have had to look up several times to figure out exactly what I am supposed to do. I wish the game would have a big arrow that tells you what your supposed to click on or at the least lights up so I dont have to go online and look up the answer on youtube. Its so annoying.  Other then that the game is fun and a breezy fun joy ride. Also if your using an xbox controller Hold down the Y button to drive cars and such.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really fun game, but I've encountered so many bugs I don't think I can recommend it. Despite owning a pretty high end gaming PC, I've encountered multiple crashing issues, screen tears, etc. Sometimes the sound refuses to work or puzzles are bugged, making it impossible to progress without restarting the game, which is extremely frustrating. There's also an issue whenever you have to control the robots or remote-control cars, they move at around 1-100th of the speed they are supposed to. I'm really not sure why this is or if anyone else has encountered these issues, but they are definitely problematic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Couldn't get *any controller to work in the very first level to control the remote vehicle. I tried my wireless 360, logitech F310 (both Xinput and DirectInput modes) and even tried just the keyboard. Very disappointing. Running Win 7 Pro x64, so YMMV. Please PM me if you can find a workaround.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming off of a pretty big Lego high after beating Lego Marvel Super Heroes I was quite excited to dive back into Lego Batman for the first time since it’s release. I had never beaten it back then so thought now would be a great time to do it. However, the game really hasn’t held up since it’s release in 2008. The best thing about the Lego games is the cast of characters that you get to play as in each level that while obviously falling within specific archetypes are at least cool to see in Lego form and to control. Lego Batman has two playable characters in the Story mode - Batman and Robin. Instead of other playable characters they both get different suits which unlock unique abilities such as gliding as Batman or walking up magnetic walls as Robin. You can play as a multitude of characters in the free play mode but I have no idea why they went with the former in the story mode. There are fifteen levels, most of which are your standard 3D platformer Lego fare with a handful of vehicle levels thrown in which adds a bit of variety to the standard formula. Each level has their a unique boss fight which more often than not I found to be uninspired with a very basic puzzle required to solve the fight. At least a good portion of Bat’s rogues gallery is here, Scarecrow; Two-Face; The Joker; Killer Moth etc. The levels themselves tend to be a lot of fun even if they all tend to look a little too similar due to the Gotham city backdrop. I find Lego Batman really difficult to recommend with much better platformers and even better Lego games available. If you are looking for this specific type of game then try Lego Marvel, I have yet to play Lego Batman 2 but I hear that is a big improvement over this. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Literally spent about 20 minutes with it and I will not touch it again. The camera and controles are horendus. While doing the tutorial my daughter and I would simply get stuck in areas we could not get out of. This could have been rectified by adding a respawn button but they couldnt even add that. I loved lego star wars, it was infinately better than this. I wont spend another cent on a lego game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, I keep having to look up on YouTube how to get past certain parts; and then I discovered that it didn't work because it glitches out. Endless amount of glitches, controls are terrible (unorthodox). I would have rather got an indie game instead, as that would have more polish than this piece of crap.Pros:-Infinite lives-batman-LegoCon's-Robin-glitches that prevent you from figuring out how to solve the puzzle (if you keep trying, it eventually works)-their idea of replayability is making it such that you cannot get 100% on the first passing-no tutorial or instructions, or indicator arrows on which way to go-no dialog, just a bunch of grunting at each other-single player AI (this is actually a two player game)-unplayable without controller			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be blunt, this is one of the worst games I have ever played. That is quite an achievement considering I like both Lego and Batman. The controls are appalling, with no option to use a mouse that I could find and the game failing to recognise a controller. The AI is terrible (which, considering one of the characters will be under AI control at any given point if you play it alone is a problem). The game occasionally crashes and some of the control prompts do not display, making it difficult to know what you can and cannot interact with, and meaning it took a long time until I discovered how I could exit the Bat Cave. A terrible port of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game on PS3, so I figured with the sale, I'd pick it up on Steam. It's still as fun as I remembered, except for the whole horribly optimized bit. My rig can run Fallout: New Vegas without going above 40% CPU, yet just sitting at the start menu, this game uses 35% CPU. Then there's the issue of crashing. I have yet to beat the first level because in the less than half hour I've played, I've already crashed three times. Though this seems to be a common issue, I have not seen any fixes besides updating drivers and lowering graphics settings, which allowed me to make it 5 minutes farther than my last attempt without crashing.

												Frustrating bugs remain. This is another fun Lego take on licensed material. Lego continues to excel on content. However, as mentioned in many forums that discuss the Lego games, this one was, and is, buggy/frustrating. As such, it just doesn't ""feel"" up to the other Lego games. Not certain what TT did differently on this one, but it's a bit of a let down.Tips:- Windows 7/8 users DISABLE Enhanced Graphics to avoid crashes- Be patient with vehicle controls, they are completely direction pad driven- Be patient trying to jump off platforms, you do a strange hop unless you jump through or get right to the edge. So try to time the jump through platforms. If you stop, keep hopping until you get to the edge and it frees up your regular jump.- Switch characters when you get stuck, and be prepared to kill the alternate character to free them			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The PC version of this game is riddled with bugs. The most frustrating of which, deals with reliance on the AI CoOp to do things simultaneously with the player in order to complete levels. The AI, unfortunately, does not always help you accomplish tasks and would rather hinder you at times by pushing you off a cliff, for example.The game itself is simple as are most of the LEGO games. The ""built-in"" challenge remains with you fighting to keep your sanity and PC chassis in one piece as you battle the ridiculous bugs plaguing what should have been a fairly solid LEGO game.

												From random crashes to text being stretched and distorted across the screen to out and out game busters such as not being able to make the remote controlled vehicle move forwards on the first level and therefore stopping future progress, this game is unplayable.There are a number of positive reviews on Steam so perhaps these bugs aren't affecting all users but there are also enough negative ones to suggest that it is a widespread issue.What's really frustrating is that there is definitely a great game in here if only you were allowed to play it!So, if you want to take a gamble that the game will work for you, by all means go ahead and buy it, but be warned that you will probably be uninstalling the game about an hour later.

												Pros:-LEGO-BatmanCons:-Everything else that matters in a video game.This game succeeds by combining LEGO and Batman, and that's about it.  It's got all the quirky fun of every other property LEGO has churned out a game for, but it's frustratingly broken in so many ways.  Collision detection is unpredictable, the AI is moronic and will often fall somewhere between dying during or immediately after a two person puzzle (requiring another attempt) or straight up just failing to cooperate, the camera angles can be incredibly deceptive, and as a result of all this, the level designs, while aesthetically good, are terrible.I don't know how many times I've fallen because I was looking half a degree to the right which caused my character to overshoot the platform by 5 feet.  Or all the times I jumped and went nowhere because I guess my toe was stuck on some invisible ledge in front of me?  Or the times I held ""A"" for a quarter second too long so Batman would glide instead of jump, causing me to completely miss the mark.  Or all the times I stood on the stairs instead of walking up them--something I would expect to be possible since they're STAIRS.*This game should be good, and the first level plays fine for the most part.  After that, numerous levels have constant issues that aren't in any way a result of gameplay mechanics or otherwise poorly conceived concepts--those are all as good and familiar as you'd expect if you've played any other LEGO games.  It's the execution that makes this game borderline terrible.  I don't understand the problem.  I might chock it up to being the first in the series, but this is merely the first Batman game in the series.  This is not their first rodeo with the LEGO games property.  Then again, maybe it's just an issue with porting to PC.  Who knows?I haven't played the rest, but I can only hope and assume they at least fixed these problems.  Then again, maybe they didn't.  Unless you're like me and insist on playing through game series from the beginning, there's no reason to grab this one.  Skip ahead to 2 or 3.  It's not like you're exactly missing out on important story elements or character development.  I'll no doubt complete this game before I move on, but I won't enjoy it.*Edit: Having completed the game (story-wise; still only about 70% total completion with regards to secrets and unlockables), here are a few updated thoughts:Regarding the stairs issue, it seems that turning on V-Sync is a fix for this.  Most of my previous criticisms still stand, but certain almost game breaking glitches (walking up stairs, driving remote controlled cars up ramps, etc) seem to be resolved by turning on V-Sync.  If you're having issues, try that as a quick fix.The villains storylines are FAR better than the Heroes storyline.  The lack of boss fights is a bummer, but some of the boss fights are painfully bad.  Harley Quinn, for example, will backflip away if you get close.  How do you beat her?  Just chase her around the circular room until she gets dizzy, hit her a couple times, beat up some baddies, repeat.  That's it.  I know LEGO games aren't known for their difficulty, but there is ZERO challenge in this fight (and many others).  It's like they designed it to be a waste of time.  So missing boss battles isn't really always a bad thing.Where it shines is that the two villains you get are chosen specifically to navigate the level.  There are plenty of secrets that must be accessed with other villains in Free Play, but you can make it through with those two characters.  The Heroes levels with Batman and Robin, on the other hand, require different suits.  The idea sounds good, but it becomes more tedious and annoying than anything else to constantly have to change suits just to solve a single puzzle before rendering that suit and its abilities worthless until the next suit change.  Plus, rather than seeing some cool classic (or at least established) suits from Batman lore (like the armored Batman from The Dark Knight Returns, for example), we get lame ""magnetic"" suits and ""heat resistant"" suits.Ultimately, my recommendation isn't changing.  Even though V-Sync fixed game-breaking bugs, the other mechanics are still very poor.  And while I really enjoyed the Villains storyline playthrough, it hardly offsets the tediousness of the Heroes storyline.  Ya know, with Batman, the part that everyone bought this game for.  The main storyline should not be worse than the unlockable storyline.  I love the LEGO games and I have high hopes for the sequels, but I still can't give this a positive review, despite generally enjoying the second half of the game.  Too little, too late as they say.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would be much better if they got the simple things right like not needing to jump into the same ladder 30 times before Batman grabs on to it and immediately jumps off it as soon as I try to climb. Then theres the problem with not being able to remove the remote controlled vehicle on the first level, which means that I can't move forward in the game. Robin/Batman KEEP getting in each other's way when you're using the other character in single player mode. They also get stuck and don't have a warp to current positon feature if the other character has moved off screen. Then there's Robin who keeps dying getting blown up when a detonation bomb is dropped by batman because he's standing there like a retard instead of moving away, unless I switch to him and move him away manually.The game was also made in 2008 and it stutters on my modern machine.All of this and I've only managed to play half of the first level (until I couldn't move any further because of the remote controlled vehicle not working properly).This looks like a great and fun game, but it's coated in crappy basic bugs that should have been ironed out during testing!!

												One of the worst LEGO games ever made. I love LEGO marvel superheroes, but this is not so nice. Simply the font explains the whole game aswel. It might seem crazy, but it really looks bad, the game looks older than it is. And of course its old but comeon. LEGO Batman series aren't good at all. Even the new Batman 3 game. Batman ones aren't interesting.4/10 ""Boring, bad looking, old.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game suffers from the same issues all old Lego games do, which are easy to forget in light of the newest gems. Awful level design, repetitive boss fights and a dull fight mechanic break the few interesting features this game brings to the collection. The humour falls flat, the characters are inexpressive and some mechanics, such as having to tow mines with the boat, are extremely frustrating and poorly implemented.The levels and boss fights are so poorly design that by level 4, I had already resorted to a guide three times because what you have to do is so unclear - a problem I never faced in the Harry Potter games. Other typical issues also purvey, such as no sense of depth for accurate platforming, slippery edges around pits and one-hit kills – annoying, but not game-breaking. Unfortunately Lego Batman also suffers from ugly shading issues on the characters' faces (making them look very polygonal) and absolutely aweful AI. Make sure your buddy is always on-screen, because if he isn't, chances are he's stuck on something and you'll have to backtrack to get him - there is no catch-up-teleport or switching to the other character when you're that far away. Even some puzzles are made very frustrating because of the AI's broken behavior. That being said, there are some very nice features - the Batmobile level was some of the most fun I've had in a Lego game, and for each of the three Batman story arcs you complete, you can go to Arkham Asylum and play from the villain's perspectives (this isn't a bonus, it's the second half of the game). The highlight of the game for me is Danny Elfman's fantastic score from the original Batman movie, which I will never get tired of hearing. Everything else is there: millions of studs, a fair number of characters/vehicles (think the original Lego Star Wars), forced replay to unlock everything and custom characters, if you're in to that.If you're hankering for some Batman and don't mind the clunkiness of old Lego games, then this offers exactly what you'd expect. Having now played Lego Batman 2, I can EASILY say the sequel is FAR superior in every way. That said, this stll contains all that lego-y co-op goodness you love from the series and makes for a fine casual game. 5/10 for Gameplay, +1 for Soundtrack			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was kind of a mis-fire in the Lego series.  Not being based on a movie, there weren't as many cute jokes for them to make... the only 'joke' in the whole game is that Robin is a doofus (again and again).  The different Bat-suits are more annoying than fun.  This is one of the only Lego games that felt like a grind to get through.  Instead, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Lego Batman 2, where they really figured out the gameplay, variety, and all that ... Lego Batman 1 is like a bad concept version of Lego Batman 2.  it's not TERRIBLE, but there are better, more fun ways to play Lego Batman for the same money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes, it's Lego Batman, and you can just shut up.I've always had a rather rocky relationship with the LEGO games. Mainly because the developers fail to see all the horrible horrible problems with their games, but I buy them because my brother likes to play them and it's %@#%@%@ LEGO.But since this review can be copypasta to pretty much any LEGO game, I'll just list the faults of the engine itself.Co-Op camera is powered by tethering. Everyone must be on the same screen all at once. If you have an ADHD kid, this will not happen. Various gameplay breaking bugs are everywhere, normally in the form of ""get to this objective"", only to have that objective not even be there. You'll reload often. There will also be times where the path to something is not clear. There is no hint system. Good luck.Verdict: Skip			",650,177,40,79,76,8,92

												This game is one of my favorite games of all time and it will probably always be!! In this game Batman (and that green guy) have to stop the escaped villains including (but not limited to): The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler, Bane, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Two Face, The Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze!! Whew! That's hard work just saying it! Anyway, you start of in the batcave go to three chapters: The Riddlers Revenge, Power Crazy Penguin, and The Jokers Return. You (and that green guy again), get to take the Bat-Mobile, Bat-Sub, or Bat-Plane to each of the 3 chapters. The levels are fun and rarely seem repetitive and the boss fights and the end of each level (Yeah, you saw that correctly, one in each level! 15 Bosses!!) are extremely fun. The only annoyance is at some parts, you have to use Batman's Glide Suit, and (espacially at the begining of Man Bats level) there's some hard gliding parkour. Nothing too hard, but it is annoying when you fall and start over. Anyway, after you stop the villains and swing into the screen LIKE A BOSS!! you think it's over right? Wrong!! You get to do the whole storyline over again from the villains point of view!! Those levels are really fun, but they barely have any bosses. In fact, I think the bosses are only in vehicle levels. (Aside from the helicopter in the Stealing the Show chapter) But they are still really fun!! Now let's talk about the music. One word: 1989 They use the original Batman soundtrack!!! Over all, I give this game an eleven out of ten. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's LEGO and Batman.Okay, there's more to it than that, this game is charming and a lot longer than I expected. I hadn't even realized there was an entire villain mission area until after I beat the Penguin, who is the 2nd main boss. So there is more to this game than meets the eye, unless you watched a trailer, the villain missions might have been mentioned in one of those.But the game, it plays like a Lego game, which is good. It's charming like a Lego game, which is good. Has a bunch of Lego collectibles, which is always fun. So is this game good? Most certainly! Specifically if you're a Lego fan and a Batman fan.8.3/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												LEGO Batman was really fun for me. I was having fun from the moment I started playing it. Even if you play the game to 100%, you still have fun. The two things I didn't like about this game is that when you are playing as the bad guys, why can't we have all the bad guys in the asylum? I would also like to have had a Batman and Robin boss for the bad guys where you beat them but in the cutscene you lose just the way you beat them as Batman and Robin.			",27,2,0,2,1,1,2

												Good game. Fun, addictive when it comes to collecting all the minikits and stuff. If you liked the other lego games, you'll liek this one. Parts on the PC version can be annoying though - bugs and the like. Seems I'm not the only one who had this problem with LEGO Batman either. I have still to work out how TT manages to basically make the same game every time (different story though) and still the game is good.majic......			",8,0,0,0,2,1,1

												A very enjoyable lego game indeed!It's really nice to play some of your favourite heroes and villians in one game and this this one of those games where u can sit back,  and play a very simple fun game (sometimes a little frustrating with waves of enemies). The soundtrack is great. It gives the ""Batman"" feel, just like how the soundtrack gave Batman: The animated series the ""Batman"" feel. For story, you play as both heores and villians. 8/10			",179,27,2,17,10,2,39

												If you like Batman, this is a great game, pays homage to the source material, with its tongue firmly in its cheek.The Riddler gets a gang together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The Penguin gets a squad together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The Joker gets a team together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The end......but wait, there's more.After all of this, you can then visit Arkham Asylum where you can replay each story, but as the villains, setting up their schemes.The end......but wait, there's still more.You can then replay each level in Freeplay mode, where the goal is to find all the collectables that you missed the first time round with the added ability to switch between all of the characters you have unlocked, each with their indivual abilities (Metroidvania-style, you can't get most of these until you unlock Freeplay). Definitely plenty to do, each level can take a good half hour if done right (or five mintues to whizz through). Each level is played as a pair you can switch between, or leave the AI to control, and the game is fun and silly enough that mid-fight when you try to get the Joker to shoot a cop but accidentally kick the Scarecrow in the♥♥♥♥♥ you don't really mind.The end...

												As the first entry in the LEGO Batman series, it is a fairly decent start with limited character options and varied level design. Power-ups work well and are satisfying, the story mode enjoyable and the puzzles challenging enough. Sadly some of the levels are plagued with awkward glitches, notably with local multiplayer having sections that would repeatedly disconnect a player if they strayed too far from the zone on-screen. As an aside it can be repetitive at times to collect all the items, but this seems standard of most LEGO titles, especially if you're hoping to beat them 100%. The biggest downside is the vehicle portions, which are awkward to control and restrictive in progression. Overall a fun title and numerous hours of enjoyment to be had, but not the strongest entry in the LEGO series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing LEGO games since childhood and each one has something great about it that makes it worthwhile. For LEGO Batman this isn't different. I never got to play it until now and I must say it was fun and exactly what I wanted it to be which was hours of enjoyable gameplay with an awesome layout. You not only play as Batman but can play as the Villans as well so imagine two separate type of games but combined into one. I say this because it takes separate amounts of time to complete each side of the stories. If your a completionist like I am also well then... it takes more than that. Hours of fun and it never disappointed, recommeded for casual gamers who just want to lay back and enjoy something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my third time editing this review and all I have for this game is it's ok. I love the LEGO videogames and have always enjoyed playing them, but for me the problem was the not the story, but the game itself. Since the first level I've run into numerous bugs involving the physics of the characters, to distorted text on the screen. I had to lower the game to its lowest settings to fix the text problem but the physics, particulary those of the batmobile, left me incredibly frustrated with the game. I managed to bypass the bugs and so far the game itself was rather enjoyable, but be aware of the rather annoying bugs within the game.			",99,10,1,5,8,1,5

												Save yourself the trouble and buy an appropriately sized PC-compatible game controller for your child (my daughter prefers X360 wireless over the Logitech non-rumble, wired).    All of the Lego games are a refreshing take on childhood platforming video-games.  The realization that children must know when blocks are bouncing and must be assembled adds a great deal of educational opportunity for the young ones who are fortunate enough to spend a reasonable amount of time exploring all that Arkham Asylum, The Bat Cave, and Gotham City have to offer.  Run-on sentences aside, here are a few of the pros and cons as mentioned by my nearly six (6) year-old daughter.Pros - Plenty of Interesting Characters (Catwoman being her favorite)        - Great blocky interpretation of all the classic Batman locations (she has grown with comic books)        - Controls are fairly easy to master, two pick-up sessions and she had them down pat        - Sounds are a Pro, but mainly the background noises and additions are what really sparked her imagination Meh - Sounds in General, why do metal blocks sound like green/blue/brown blocks, she asks?        - More playable characters in the same levels would expand the story side of gameplay immensely (DLC missions in     existing locales maybe?)        - Freeplay is really limited to bouncing around collecting more and more tabs of assorted value, pointless once all the unlocks have been, well, unlocked.       - The ""one way"" through the level, scripted occurences take away from the open feel of the locations explored.  Where is Grand Theft Lego:  Ultimate Building Mayhem?!Cons - Batman and Robin's suits are not very intricate.  Heavy Suit for rockets, and so on and so forth.         - Batman and Robin aren't up to my daughters understanding of continuity in different books.  Why is Batman not hurt and still fighting Bane?   I know some of these are niggling complaints but from a five-year-old child they show a depth of thought that I believed at least a year or two away.  All of the Lego games are a great diversion and special treat for someone who is limited to one (1) hour per day of digital entertainment (Netflix, Video Games, etc...) The varied stories and game situations suprise her with every new release and I am pleased to say that on-sale, the titles have been reasonably priced.  If you can pick them up on sale, I  ]i] highly  [/i] reccomend that they be added to your children's  and  your own Steam libraries.82/100B8/10**** out of ***** (4/5 Stars)Two Thumbs up from ""Medium Me"" even with the minor complaints.

												LEGO Batman is a very entertaining game that I beat on my PS3 years ago. I bought it on steam to to hopefully re-live the joy the game once gave me, but it doesn't seem to like the fact that I play with a second player. Every 10 minutes or so the second player is set to inactive and sometimes they aren't allowed to re-join. The camera isn't friendly to the environment, and will get you killed in co-op. Overall, it is a good game that could be skipped for the less buggy LEGO Batman 2.			",128,11,4,19,7,1,27

												After a few hours of playing this game it seems to be fine and absolutely worth of 5 euros. Like all the LEGO-games, LEGO Batman is also initially for younger gamers, but it is very fun to play for adult gamers also. If you have played other LEGO Games earlier, then you know what's the name of the game: you beat up enemies in Lego environment, collect coins and other stuff and solve somewhat simple puzzles using the different abilities of characters.Gameplay is quite straightforward and it is going to repeat itself after a while, so someone might get bored with that. The storyline is very simple: The well-known super villains (like Joker, Penguin, Riddler etc.) are messing in Gotham and Batman is supposed to kick their asses. So you don't need to worry about too complex plot. For true Batman-fan (as I am) the very positive surprise was that there are also many ""not-so-well-known"" villains to take care of.Graphics are simple and colorful and system requirements are quite low for good gaming experience. I had a few minor bugs during my play, but otherwise the functionality of this game was smooth.Controls are very simple and easy to learn, but I would recommend gamepad here, although keyboard is not bad either.I can truly recommend this game for Batman(and/or Lego)-fans, but for other adult gamers this game does not have much to give. But I bet most of the kids would love it due to it's easy-to-learn gameplay, funny characters and simple plot.			",45,2,1,3,0,0,1

Unfortunately, we haven't done the Free Play yet where you can be any character so he keeps changing his mind on whom he wants to be. If you like the LEGO series, or want something that you can play together with children - pretty much any of the LEGO series seems to fit the bill!			",500,103,6,68,36,3,53

												LEGO Batman is what i beieve to be one of the best LEGO games. Now, there are many other great LEGO games but this does top the list in many ways. In this game you can experience the story on two different sides. The good and the bad. Be Batman and Robin foilling the plans of the Riddler, Penguin and The Joker or be one of them creating their master plans. With many different and unique characters this is a must have game. I have over one hundred friends on my steam and not one of them have this game. However, there is three downsides to this game. ONE - For this game I must recommend a Controller, the gameplay will be alot more difficult when using a keyboard and mouse.TWO - This game is better when playing with friends, yes you can play by yourself and still get an enjoyable experience from it but like most LEGO games, its better with a companion. THREE - (Which extends on the last point and can see either good or bad) No online co-op. So yes to play with your friends you better get ready for some couch co-op as thats the only way you will be playing this game with friends.Basically, this game doesnt take aot to run. I dont have a over powered gaming computer but I can still run this smoothly. Good sstory and gameplay when using a gamepad. This is a MUST BUY.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Batman, this is a great game, pays homage to the source material, with its tongue firmly in its cheek.The Riddler gets a gang together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The Penguin gets a squad together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The Joker gets a team together, devises a plan, but is foiled by Batman and Robin after five levels.The end......but wait, there's more.After all of this, you can then visit Arkham Asylum where you can replay each story, but as the villains, setting up their schemes.The end......but wait, there's still more.You can then replay each level in Freeplay mode, where the goal is to find all the collectables that you missed the first time round with the added ability to switch between all of the characters you have unlocked, each with their indivual abilities (Metroidvania-style, you can't get most of these until you unlock Freeplay). Definitely plenty to do, each level can take a good half hour if done right (or five mintues to whizz through). Each level is played as a pair you can switch between, or leave the AI to control, and the game is fun and silly enough that mid-fight when you try to get the Joker to shoot a cop but accidentally kick the Scarecrow in the♥♥♥♥♥ you don't really mind.The end...

												This is my third time editing this review and all I have for this game is it's ok. I love the LEGO videogames and have always enjoyed playing them, but for me the problem was the not the story, but the game itself. Since the first level I've run into numerous bugs involving the physics of the characters, to distorted text on the screen. I had to lower the game to its lowest settings to fix the text problem but the physics, particulary those of the batmobile, left me incredibly frustrated with the game. I managed to bypass the bugs and so far the game itself was rather enjoyable, but be aware of the rather annoying bugs within the game.			",99,10,1,5,8,1,5

												First, let me start by saying this game came out in 2008, as that's a very important aspect.This game is a ""cartoon"" image of the actual cartoon Batman: The animated series.  That is to say, all the characters are based off that TV show, but their personality and the overall theme and tone don't match the TV show which is absolutly fine because if they did I don't think the characters would have translated as well.  There is almost no dialog (there is a small amount of story given during the loading screens when playing as the villians), most of the story is conveyed through actions, a few sounds, etc.This game is often on sale and I would recommend getting it only when it's $5.The game is charming, play sessions can be short (30 minutes +- a few), it's easy enough for a kid to play but there's enough there to keep an adult entertained.Even though it has a few short commings, they are understandable and none of them are game breaking mostly mildly annoying.The BadSo strait to the point, whats wrong with it.  The graphics are simple (they are just lego pieces) so that asthetic holds actually well, but the cut scenes are pre-rendered and look awful.  Also, there are a few textures that (and by few I mean in all the game I found it in two places) either were bad from the start or didn't age well.The controls are not the greatest.  B is your all purpose action button and Y is your all purpose character switch button.  What happens is based on context which should be fine, but handles terribly.  You can't do anything quickly as the game will not register what you mean to do properly.The 3D level platforming is frustrating at times.  And the vehicle combat sections are the absolute worst thing.  Like above all, the vehicle sections have to be the single worst thing about this game.  Thankfully, there are not many.A good portion of the playable characters are re-skinned useless characters (all of the henchmen, police, etc., basically anything that isn't a main character).  And some of the main characters are awful (Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Scarecow, Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Man-Bat, etc.).  [spoilers]Catwoman outside of having double jump has no special functions for any puzzles, and her whip doesn't use the same mechanics as projectiles meaning you have to be spot on, not to close, not to far and aim perfect.  Poison Ivy is better, her poison will arc to destructable objects.  Scarecrows fear dust is a weak stun same as Riddlers mind control cane.  Mr. Freeze would be good except it's effect seems spotty, and you can freeze your teammate.[/spoiler]There are times, the game will lag up.  I've noticed this happens only when near a puzzle and computer is calculating if the action your taking influences the puzzle.Lastly, durring combat you can and will attack your second character.  This makes combat more difficult then it needs to be as well as several puzzles.  And when the second character is AI controlled, they don't help much in combat anywho.  The only upside is when they get destroyed (and they will, often) it doesn't count against you.The GoodNow I don't want you to think this game is bad, I just wanted to list some of the downsides.A lot of story is convyed very well through the sets and the actions of the characters.  Without saying a word you know what they're thinking.  To me, that's great story telling.While sets are partially re-used for the Hero/Villain portions it's not an exact carbon copy.  It's often a different angle and different starting location meeting up somewhere.  This makes all the levels far more fleshed out.All the characters are here, and are well portrayed.  Considering the game came out in 2008, you can see a lot of influence this game had on the Lego Movie.  And you can play as any character.  Theres even plenty of characters that aren't actually part of the game that are options.  You get additional playable characters that you unlock via playing the game instead of paying for DLC!There are plenty of secrets and puzzles that award you for exploring and thinking.  All of which is needed to achieve the 100% completion (where youa are again, rewarded).I was actually surprised I could play as the villains too.  I think this is was a great move.  However when you play them is kind of odd.  To beat all 5 stages in a chapter (3 chapters), then you can switch to the villains.  When playing as the villains you see how it started, prior to playing the hero.  Basically, the sequal, is actually a prequal.The free play mode is nice as you can just rotate through characters and the game does it quickly.  Even your side kick will change if there's an obstical it can't pass (like poison) so it can.  Most of the time, you don't have to babysit the AI (there are a few times, when trying to speed through you can get away from the AI and it doesn't know how to path to you.)Local coop.  (I didn't actually test it, but I'm giving it a nod as many games overlook this)There's a lot of attention to detail (saddly, wasted).  All the main characters are animated individually which brings a special personality to them.  The acrobatic characters if you press back and jump will actually do a backflip.  There's 3 different walk animations (creep, walk, run).  Characters will press up against walls to strafe against it (however, this is never required.)Suggested game playIn the event you pick this game up, let me give you some suggestions to save you some time and frustrations.First off, just play the game through, start to finish.  Don'y buy any upgrades, characters, etc.  (Henchmen are plentiful, they are all the same and are bad).  Once you've unlocked free play on all stages as well as all the main characters, that's when you want to go through and collect everything (still, don't buy upgrades).  This will save you a lot of time switching characters as a good portion are bad (special attack is poor, or non-existant and\or they offer nothing to help solve puzzles).A controller is far better then keyboard.  I didn't have a second controller to test if the local coop allows for dual controller of it you have to use one player controller and the other keyboard.			",159,31,2,28,15,2,20

												I like how the game is entertaining for both kids and adults and still retains solid gameplay as well as humorous cutscenes. The game isn't hard to max out at 1366x768, hell, you can do it with a potato. Being a Lego game, I recommend playing with a game controller, although you can play with a KB+M if you want but the controls probably suck, so use a game controller.			",151,13,0,11,3,1,2
