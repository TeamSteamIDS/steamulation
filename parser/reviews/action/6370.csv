												Great to see Stunlock finally take this back. Hopefully they can salvage the glowing embers of this game Funcom left behind and relight the fire of one of the most fun PvP experiences I've ever had. Highly recommended for anyone with even the slightest interest in competitive fast-paced PvP arena. This game could not be a more accurate representation of the MOBA genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PLEASE RE MARKET THIS GAME! Re-brand and Re-market it. It needs to BE SEEN BY THE LARGE SCALE MOBA COMMUNITY! It is a game of true player skill reminiscent of Oldschool WoW arenas with actual pvp balance. Gems and other in game items only add very small variables to the true playing experience. Overall this game has the potential to be the number 1 E-Sport game as it is the most fast paced and exhilarating (no idea how people can play Dota or LoL, personally I can't do 45minute matches as I have responsibilities and it would take too long to master the game) but in terms of BLC You can learn at your own pace like first person shooters because games are quick matches and usually always intense. The reason people don't like BLC is because its TOO DAMN HARD for them. This is where Funcom needs to learn how to create A SIMPLE matchmaking system that incorporates rank. They overcomplicated their entire ranking system and it was ♥♥♥♥in stupid. anyway, now theres no players adn it ill soon phase out unless they REMAKE and REMARKET this game In todays MOBA friendly environment. no one knows about this hidden gem now :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All skill shots, no RNG, most skill based PvP and ""fair"" PvP game I've played. To elaborate, it's like you take the fun teamfights of Dota (or a similar game), every attack is a skill shot, remove crits and random numbers, fights are won based on who plays better (lands their attacks, doesn't break CC, dodges enemy skill shots) not which team is more farmed.

												Bloodline Champions is BY FAR the best pure PvP arena game, possibly ever, and that's not an exaggeration. Biggest thing I have to stress is that while BLC may look like another ""Moba"" (Dota2/League of Legends), it its essence and spirit it's a lot closer to fighting games or even fast paced first-person-shooters like Quake or Unreal Tournament. Yes, you've heard that right. That's a very important distinction which a lot of people don't realize. Unlike ""Mobas"" you don't need to have a huge collection of top tier heroes at your disposal, some of the best players in the game mastered 1 or 2 bloodlines and play them exclusively, similarly to fighting games.For this reason the game certainly isn't for everyone, there's very little downtime where you can casually stroll back to your lane while considering which item you should buy next, there's no mana so you never run out of things to do in the middle of the battle. You don't level up - you have full arsenal of abilities (that's more than twice as big compared to ""Mobas"" AND are all skillshots) at your disposal from the first second you enter the arena (with an exception of energy that allows you to cast your ultimate and EX abilities and is gained by hitting your opponents). Reflexes/mind-games/ability to coordinate with your teammates in the matter of seconds is far more important than theorycrafting.Every single ability is a skillshot and that applies even to your basic attacks AND heals. That means that it's possible to miss even your basic melee attacks if you don't position yourself correctly or anticipate your opponent's movements. Each bloodline has the basic attack that has no cooldown (in the case of the healers, they also have a ranged healing ability with no CD as well) + 5 other skills + Ultimate + 2 variations of other abilities (called EX abilities which cost energy). That's a lot of stuff to do, at all times.The amount of control you have over your bloodline is extremely high, your bloodline is controlled by WASD movement, similarly to FPS games - most bloodlines also have multiple ways to dash/jump/knock opponents away and maneuver around the battlefield, leading to a very fluid and fast-paced gameplay. There's also the fact that you can try to actively dodge your opponent's abilities, creating a huge potential for mind-games.There are a lot of cool skills like: Counterattacks - for a duration of let's say, 1 second, your bloodline is put into a defensive ""trance"" and if your opponent hits you while you're in said trance, your bloodline counterattacks in some fashion, teleporting behind their back and applying a debuff or just allowing you to teleport yourself to safety. Reflects - you can knock opponent's ranged projectiles back at them if timed correctly (though remember, they can dodge them as well, nothing's guaranteed!). Pulls - ability to grab opposing team's most fragile bloodline and focus it down. Knockbacks - ability to push your opponents slightly backwards, cancelling their abilities cast times and repositioning them. Dodgeable silences called Disables - when hit by such ability, the first ability you use in the period of about 1 second is ""silenced"" for about 3 seconds - timing these correctly and disabling opponent's critical escape abilities or heals can win you the round. At the same time it means that if you pay attention, you can either wait that 1 second out OR use a less important ability to ""eat"" the Disable debuff, allowing you to keep up pressure.Very important part is that there's VERY little Hard CC like stuns - you won't be locked out for 3 seconds with no chance to do anything while enemy team focuses you to death. Your teammates can always use their defensive abilities like shields on you as well.Because every skill is a skillshot, mind-games are extremely important - for example, if you're about to hit your opponent and they use their counterattack, you can cancel your own attack and wait until their counter-attack timer finishes (called trance baiting). If they relied on that counter-attack to survive, they might just die! Overall, while BLC is certainly not for everyone and has a steep learning curve, once you get over it, there's a lot of fun to be had.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions is probably one of those amazing games that will never get the attention it deserves.This game is a very fast-paced 3v3 MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) with 4 diffrent classes which are: Healer, Tank and 2 damage dealing classes, melee and ranged. BLC is so intense that playing for 1 hour is like playing any other action filled game for 8 hours, it is that intense. It will give you alot of adrenaline rushes and you will feel like the king of the world when winning!There are some downsides about this game though:-Low playerbase-Have to farm a bit to get all the playable Bloodlines-Also some farming for Traits (are like passive bonuses) and Medalions (are 2 active kinds of skills and 1 passive)-Does have a tendency of bringing rage :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Bloodline Champions Review 

			Views: 15,770		

			Download - http://store.steampowered.com/app/6370 Review out of a more classic MOBA game called Bloodline Champions (BLC) game thats still alive after 5 years with decent playerbase playing the game.		

 A Game That has SurvivedBLC is a game that has rather loyal fanbase sticking around with the game for over 5 years and the game still has decent playerbase and you get qued into games, while its away from its true peak its still decent. If you are looking for a MOBA hybrid thats 100% Skill based no RNG (Crits, Chance to X, Miss/Dodge) this might be the game for you. Sure some of the interface is outdated and graphics aren´t on 2016 level, but its has aged somewhat wellPositives Still Alive Community 100% Skill based Game Variety of Characters to choose from Bot support  Three different game modes that offer variety to gameplayPositives Interface is bit outdated & menu page Perhaps not the most fun game if you are not great at it, but offers great tutorials and doesn´t have super high learning curve. Only EU/NA servers, everyone outside that may got some issues ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can say this for how much I have played so far.Cons- + Very Toxic community. New players have a hard time learning the game because of this.+ Servers arent that great.+ It is a dead game, not many people are playing it.+ Pros-+ Very high skill cap. You can't just go into it the first day being able to out dps a veteran,+ Amazing Moba that is very underated and is alot of fun.+ Easy to earn new bloodlines. Not alot of grinding needed.+ Easy combot system to learn, but hard to get good at.+ Tournemants every week , if youa re like me and love competitive play you love this :DI mean i couldn't really put much together for the reason that i dont have alot of horus played, but if you love Ranked play, and or competitive . This is your game. I love this game and everything about it and my experience has been great. Although it can be dead at times , i promise you that the wait is worth it. It does take awhile to get pretty good at this game but the time and effort is so worth it for how fun this game is :). I really wish this game had alot more players and alot of the community wishes this , but right now there is noting we can do.Give this game a go and i promise you that you wont be let down :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions (Henceforth known as BLC) is a fantastic fantasy MOBA arena game. It does not include the standard: Shop, minions, towers, or jungle area. It is designed to test the player and their team with skillshots. The more skilled the player and the team, the better chance of a positive outcome. Don't forget team synergy. While some of the skills may feel similar from champion to champion you can be sure each champion has an original design and playstyle. This is probably the best or close to the best arena pvp I've encountered so far. I have not played in about a year now, and from what I hear the community is dead :(.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply unique. A Multiplayer Online Battle Arena in its most strict sense (if not the most traditional), you and your team have one and only objective: surviving the enemy team and slaughtering it.Bloodline Champions bears a nearly infinite competitive potential that is often sadly overlooked because of the mistakes of its publisher and developer team, which do not seem to invest enough in the stability of this shiny, hidden gem. The community is mostly unusually nice (compared to your average MOBA - you can't expect *everybody* to be nice on the internet, can you?) if somewhat sparse in numbers.The peculiarities of the gameplay lie in the total lack of randomly generated numbers, the importance of tactics, the interesting diversity of the characters and last but surely not least, the extreme fast pace of the game, which makes quick decision-making, knowledge of the game and instinct and reflexes key factors to prevail.It is worthy of notice how despite it being a free to play, there is no obligement to buy anything in order to be good at it - the progression system can be slightly accelerated at the very start, but due to the extremely skill-based nature of the game, the ephemeral advantages make no considerable part in the winning: this one is most assuredly not a pay to win. Most of the buyable features are merely cosmetical and those that aren't, are always purchasable with the in-game, generously earned currency.I guarantee you, you have never played anything quite like it. If you can resist the initial frustration of a hard-to-learn game and the occasional lag due to the developers' (hopefully temporary) lack of dedication, you'll have an experience you will not forget.

Posted: February 6, 2015
TL;DR: BLC is an awesome game and you should try it, but it used to be more awesome and I'd like to bring that back with your help.BLC, BLC, where do I start with you?I played this game from very early on, back when the game was brand spanking new and advertised as the one true PvP arena game where only skill mattered. The one game you could pick up and play without having to spend several weeks of grinding for levels or runes/masteries in order to actually start being competitive. In theory, a team of new players who were just completely at home with the game as soon as they started could beat a top competitive team who had played the game religiously half a year in advance.And it was glorious.Of course such a situation rarely happened. Since skill was all that mattered, veteran players were almost always set to win over newcomers, but it was as it should be. Those moments where I as a relatively new player were able to out-manouver players who were obviously better than me are memorable even to this day. The free Bloodline rotation was satisfactory and the fact that you could try them all out in single player vs bots is something I for my life cannot understand why every single F2P online game has done as well. That particular move is a stroke of genious.Every Bloodline feels and plays differently. The only time it feels bad playing a particular Bloodline is when you're being outperformed by another which leads you to wanting to try that one instead. That is the beauty of the game. Nothing stops you from learning every single Bloodline in comfort and privacy against bots. No fees, no need to purchase the Bloodline. This means that if you were willing to put time and effort into learning the Bloodlines in-and-outs, you could prepare yourself to stand an even better chance when playing against real people. And really, Hard mode bots are way more difficult than many players!There's practically always been a leveling system. Your level, however, was mostly just a measure of how long you've been playing the game. It had no impact on the game what so ever. What really mattered was your rank, which showed at what skill level you belonged (again, skill was all that mattered as advertised). It's important to note that at this time, it was also advertised that you could obtain most every single thing in the shop, even cosmetic items like skins, weapons and emotes, with the use of Blood Coins as well as Gold Coins, the former being the currency you earn by playing and the latter being the one you purchase with real money. Sure, the Blood Coin prices were discouragingly steep, but it really helped me customizing my one favorite Bloodline (Psychopomp btw) with some cool, non-standard gear and emotes.The only few items that were only purchasable with Gold Coins at this time was things like the Replay system that only very serious and competitive player had any real use for.Every single thing with this game, at that time, was geared toward easing newer players into this awesome community and experience. Stunlock knew in their heart that few people would start the process of grinding another game for points, levels, masteries and runes in order to be competitive when they've most likely invested their time heavily in other games. What they did, supplying a theoretically even playing field for new and veteran players alike, was game design ingenuity pure and simple.FunCom however never had that much faith in the game, and it was horribly undermarketed. This is a story most of us familiar with BLC before Steam know of.The fact of the matter is that when Stunlock introduced traits, medallions and masteries into the game, they deviated from their very own core design philosophy. When this new system, trait points unlocked by leveling and heavy Blood Coin investments in crystals and medallions hit Live, they lost a capital h Huge part of the loyal playerbase. The game, suddenly, wasn't new player-friendly anymore. Because when you tried to introduce your friends into the game in this state, all they saw was another huge time sink they had to fill in order to even have a chance. Skill was still central to the gameplay, of course, but the entire sight of the traits and nigh-mandatory medallions that you had to fill was daunting and off-putting. Suddenly, BLC seemed to be on the way of becoming every single other PvP game by mimicking the competition, when its one biggest appeal was its differences from them.""I'd rather just keep playing League, cba BLC grinding"", many of my friends said.Combined with the much smaller player base, the Match Making system were acting strangely. There simply weren't enough players so uneven matches like 3 boneys (lowest grade) vs 2 doubleskullies (grade 5) 1 friggin Arbitrator (grade 16) wasn't an uncommon sight. Thus, even the gameplay suffered.One would think such an immense community outrage and hit to the entire game's ecosystem would make the developers falling over themselves trying to roll back their newly introduced system. I don't know if FunCom advised them against it or if it was pride messing with them, but the system stayed. Its still there, despite the fact that it single handedly ""killed"" the game overnight. Well, the release of the Grimrog Bloodline, which was morbidly OP at launch, also played a role of course.The release from FunCom made me feel hopeful. Maybe they could finally start moving back toward their roots, I thought.Sure, there are more players now. Probably brought on by the recent media coverage the game's been getting with this step. The level-dependent traits were still there to my disappointment, but I could live with it. I still have my old medallions and gems. I also noted that I have a small size of Blood Coins and a couple of hundred Gold Coins left over. I entered the market place to refresh my mind on what things cost.What met me there turned me off a lot.Another core design philosophy had gone down the grave, the one where you were supposed to be able to earn everything with Blood Coins. Every single cosmetic item have had their Blood Coin price removed and were now only obtainable with Gold Coins, i.e. real money.This may not sound like a big deal to those of you who didn't play the game before it was this way, but it really just gives me the impression that Stunlock is in it for the money and wants to do what everyone else is doing and milk the game before it dies off completely. Sure, I guess the system is fair compared to other games, but it really just feels like they're taking their design decisions without feel for what the game has come to symbolize: a realistic alternative game that you can play alongside others without having to spend a huge amount of time in order to start being competitive.I had absolutely no trouble recruiting friends to this game before the trait and medallion system. When they were bored of playing other games, they'd say ""Hey let's fire up BLC"", I'd gladly oblige. They didn't hesitate buying Gold Coins (at that time called FunCom Coins I believe...) because it just felt awesome customizing your favorite Bloodline when at the same time feeling you had an alternative if you didn't want to spend the money. That's the exact kind of business plan we all wanted to support.Gameplay? Jesus christ, I love the game, it's lovely in its simplicity, its ""easy to learn, hard to master"" way. But if you find that you like this game as much as I do and want to spend more time, please, engage yourself in the community at its subreddit (r/bloodlinechampions) and  its forums[blchampions.com]. Stunlock Studios are finally in position to make this game Awesome again. Help us make them understand we want that too. Help us make them understand that we want the even playing field between new and veteran players back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline champions an online arena game that looks like a moba but plays fast and fun with action from start to finish (no items, creeps, or towers). there are quite a few game modes to play and a pretty good size collection of classes (heroes or in this case champions) and I had fun playing the only draw back I could see was a relatively low playerbase, but we can fix that, so come on over and give bloodline champions a try, its not that bad			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions is hands down the best venue for displaying player skill through accuracy, dexterity, intelligence, spatial awareness, teamplay, and knowledge. It'll ask you to execute pitch perfect combos via your abilities, aim them true (everything's a skillshot), weight in the benefits of your situation and adapt on the fly, coordinate with your team down to the second, and most importantly, learn every little detail about every bloodline in order to best counter it. Barring Quake and CS, you won't find a better title to test yourself as a gamer - BLC will flex absolutely every important gaming muscle of your being and give you the grounds to prove your worth. It should be mentioned that as of the last few days the game is now being fully operated by Stunlock Studios - the actual creators of BLC - which is certainly a step up from its previous publishers who were seemingly running it down the ground with poor marketing and cheesy design implementations. Some time ago the progression system was accelerated, the bloodcoing yield increased, and the cost of bloodlines decreased - meaning you can now more easily acquire things in the game, including the much dreaded amulets and gems to slot. The benefits from leveling and statting up were always very marginal, but were the cause for much ire back in the day, for no good reason. Do try to disregard any people saying that the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥solely because there's a progression system - it is an annoyance at worst and if you're dedicated you won't care for them past setting your own builds.The playerbase might not be very large, but it's a very dedicated bunch, which is why you'll often run into people with thousands of games and hours under their belts. During the past few years I haven't played that much myself, but made an effort to log in every once in a while to check out activity, and it's always a pleasure seeing several channels still filled up with players to this day - alongside the weekly tournaments still running with dozens of teams taking part. It's a sad defect of modern gaming communities to declare games as dead based on a seemingly random set of factors like whether they found a game within a minute after queueing up at 4 AM or something of that sort, but I can guarantee you that as far as competitiveness goes, you'll find a very healthy scene, that has miraculously endured through Funcom's mistreatment during the years. Today, with most regional locks gone, and (hopefully) with Stunlock maybe putting some life back into the game via content updates, I can see BLC emerging back into the mainstream, for as long as people are willing to give it a chance and stick around.

												Used to play th guts out of this game back when about 2k people played. The game dropped in players and the company no longer supports the game. No new heros anymore or anything really... I even cantacted Funcom about their obvious poor showing for the appreciation of this amazing game, and they lied straight to my face. Queue times take a very long time with only a hundred players (or less) especially if you are queueing for alternant game modes. If this game regrew in population, and the company started releaseing new material I would gladly start playing again. I cannot reccomend this game to anyone in the current state. R.I.P.

												Legitimately the Best ""MOBA"". Every Champ has 5 ability plus Ult, though every Camp also has a get away (think like Sprint in wow or a Rocket jump to run away from enemies in TF2) and literally EVERY SINGLE ability is skill shot, even ur auto attacks, and no, there aint no ♥♥♥♥ing tower wars crap like in every other moba, you got CTF, CP/KOTH 1v1-5v5 Arena (like ACTUAL DM no re-spawn) and more, there is only like 15 camps, so no ♥♥♥♥ing garbage lern new character every week, ect, and its ReAlLy not you're traditional ""moba"". Sadly its dying, the skill thats needed to play high play in this game is far beyond LoL, so every baddie just gave up and ya know, 99% of the internet is nothing but baddies :(. seriously give this game a go. if u can get into a match/play with friends its fun as ♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've marked this as a positive review. But please, read on:)While I didn't play this game on steam, I did play it the millisecond it was available to play, several years ago.Within literally hours of game being released, lvl10 people started bashing on, like, lvl6 people. It was fascinating, to say the least. I have never seen a game brought down in such a quick manner by its own community and with such efficacy. I played bunch of hardcore, ""unwelcoming"" games, but BLC is the only game that managed to develop a ridiculously antisocial atmosphere within mere hours and to totally devolve into a complete toxic mess in the matter of days. I have yet to see a game that has a player base near BLC's when it came out.It usually takes a relatively long time for a game to develop the unwelcoming atmosphere and some don't develop that at all. Usually, the more skill-based game is, the more divisive and aggressive the community will be. But that won't happen until at least a few months after the game's release.Technically and mechanically, the game is a masterpiece. I will dare and say that's an objective assessment. The feel of the game, the gameplay, the champions, it's all executed responsively and flawlessly. This game had an unfair fate, because of the bad economic approach and also bad marketing, but nothing rivals the absolutely attrocious player base it somehow managed to acquire in like two days since it was released.Hearing some time ago that the game will come to steam, I hoped that it would finally receive the recognition it deserved. I have yet to install it, but sadly, it seems that the situation is even worse and that its player base will singlehandedly murder it for the second time. I can't understand the notion behind it, but if a game you love and play gets a second chance on a new, popular platform such as steam, it is very counterproductive for you to get defensive and not let people in ""your game"". For a multiplayer-based game, the ONLY chance is for it to have a healthy and relatively large player base, especially if there's a MM necessary, to provide even matchups.But now, browsing through the comments, I see a pattern: unwelcoming community. Regardless of whether the review is positive or negative, this seems to be the only constant new players perceive and isolate in their reviews.If this changes, though with the player base fiercely opposing the idea of the game getting new players it certainly doesn't seem it would (but one could hope), I would recommend this game possibly more than any game ever made. This might be an overstatement, but all things considered, BLC is a masterpiece in every way.That said, remembering how it was only hours after the game's release, I actually don't know whether I'll install it or not. It seems that today's situation is only worse, which is hard to imagine.All in all - game is superb. Player base, well, isn't - and don't take this lightly. It's not your standard dota, lol, wot etc. notion. We are all used to that. This is something very extraordinary.So, basically, I will mark this as a ""yes"", because the game is fantastic. Would I advise people to play it though? Not really, but you are free to try and see for yourself. This might seem paradoxical, but it's not - if we talk about the game per se, it's wonderful, but it's the only game I've ever played out of thousands of multiplayer games I've played, that can effectively sour the gaming experience of even a full-fledged rhino-skinned lobotomized psychopath.

												As far as I can remember, this is the first time I've reviewed a game on Steam. That's not because I'm new to Steam. It's because this game holds a place in my heart that no game has before or since. And I've played many, many games.Bloodline Champions is the purest PvP game that has ever been. It is so unique in that sense that there is literally no game out there like it. People will compare it to other games using terms like MOBA, which will invariably conjure images of massive maps with jungles, rivers, monsters and all the things that artificially infuse what we have come to think of as MOBA's with their complexity and depth.But BLC doesn't need any of that. Its depth comes naturally, as a result of its actual complexity. BLC is what a MOBA should be: an arena in which players do battle--not one in which players level and shop and kill little monsters until they are ready to do battle. There is no avoiding battle in BLC. And when it happens, it's determined entirely by the skill of the player on the keyboard.There is a lot to say about BLC. Perhaps, the most important thing to say is that it's a shame that one of the worst game publishers in existence got its hands on what you can tell is the work of a passionate development team. But I'm eccstatic to see what appears to be a revival now that Stunlock has taken it back.In the mean time, if you are reading this and thinking about playing Bloodline Champions, this player couldn't possibly give a more sincere endorsement. If you like PvP, you absolutely must try BLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A gem of a MOBA, BLC was a ridiculously fresh take on the genre. Even today it's a super innovative game, focused on small scale, high skill based arena combat. The art style is eclectic and distinctive, adding to the games' charm. If MOBA's are your thing, or you just have fond memories of War3 Hero Arena's, definitely give BLC a shot.

												This game requires a HUGE amount of skill. Legitimate skill. You need to know your bloodline and a lot of esoteric information in order to even get by in this game.I've played since shortly after post-beta and I bought most of the characters I wanted back then, and I maxed out my level and all my stats and have nothing to worry about... but for people joining now, you're going to have to either pony up some cash or play for a long time before you can unlock all the bloodlines you may want to play, the minmaxing medals and stat slots, etc.This game is PLAY2Win, meaning the more hours you have put into the game the better you'll be at it. The upgrades you get from leveling up make you strictly and objectively better than someone who has just started out, so new players WILL start at a disadvantage.It's an extremely fun game if you're willing to put in time and effort, but it can be discouraging at times.I of course strongly recommend it (and I'm always looking for people to play it with) but I also strongly suggest that you understand what you're getting into before you join up. There's not a huge influx of new users daily like other more popular free2play games, so you may very well be a small fish in a very large pond.It's hard to get into, but once you're into the game it's the most fun and addictive game I could ever recommend to somebody.

												Love PvP?Like arena style combat?Don't like the length of DotA/LoL games?This game is for you. Bloodline Champions, is a moba style game with a cast of 16 + heroes, or bloodlines. Matches are set in 3v3 format and take usually no more than 5-6 minutes.  There are 4 archetypes of classes, Tanks, Melee, Ranged, and Healers, each with a set of unique characters within them. There are no minions, no farming, just a 3v3 slaughter fest where skill triumphs all. I'm not going to go too deep here, its better for you to experience this thing yourself. There are two very large issues with this game. The first, would be the severe latency spikes and or, even total game freezing. I cannot count how many times the game freezes up at clutch points for no reason at all. I can still move my mouse, but the screen is totally unresponsive. Stunlock has not, as of 3/6/15, not given any sort of comment on the matter, which seems to be a lot more common than you would think.The largest issue with this game remains to be its playerbase. The playerbase isn't that bad, its the number of players. This game isn't as dead as so many players make it out to be. Nowhere near. You'll still find matches, but theres a good chance you'll be playing against some vets that have been playing for a very long time. If you find yourself getting beat in actual pvp matches, go against the bots.  I can't stress this enough.They're surprisingly well done and are very good for getting the hang of your chosen bloodline.So, come, play a few rounds, bring your friends. Revitalize this game. Don't allow the one unique MOBA out there to go off into that silent night.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions is a very fast paced MOBA game with a heavy emphasis on player skill. Every ability, even the standard attacks are skillshots, meaning they are direction-targeted and can miss. The pool of playable characters is diverse and well balanced. Each bloodline looks, feels and plays unique. Same goes for the maps. Games are short and intense. On top of that your account progresses pretty fast allowing frequent unlocks.There is only one downside: The game was poorly advertised and shut down for several years before the recent re-release on steam resulting in a small playerbase leading to a sometimes poor matchmaking.If you are interested just go ahead and try it. Bloodline Champions is free to play and the installalation is about 400 mb. You won't lose a cent and not much time if you don't like it. For me the game is a great fun and holds an insanely high potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions is a free to play PvP battle arena game.  It worked on Win 10, played ok, looked ok, sounded ok.  It is SKILL Shot based combat, if you have terrible mouse dexterity and timing, you will suck.  Has some scripted tutorials and a solo mode where you can play 3 different map modes against AI and have AI teamates.  Matches are pure 3 vs 3 combat with 3 kinds of heros: Tanks, DPS, Healers.  There are No towers and minions, in-match leveling or in-match gear. Not many people playing this game, they are playing Battlerite instead.  Battlerite is from the same developer and is a paid game that is the same game as Bloodline Champions.  Sort of felt laggy as i was trying the solo battles.Try it, if you like PvP MOBAs but hate DOTA2 clones.  For more info:

Short Summary:Bloodline Champions is an a-typical experiment in the MOBA genre that manage to transcend the overused formula with true innovations and skill based gameplay. Highly recommended to people who wants a different MOBA experience and aren't afraid of investing the time in a hardcore skill-based game. For the casual gamer I would say BLC would pose too much of steep learning curve and a lot of frustration of losing to veteran players.Extended Review Been playing this game since early beta, clocking hundreds of hours before the integration to steam so I thought I should give a review of what I consider to be one of the best MOBA games out there, which sadly doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Bloodline Champions (BLC) isn't your typical garden variety MOBA, in fact it so different that some people don't consider it a MOBA at all because it isn't stylized after DOTA and its clones, but since MOBA is Multiplayer Arena Battle - BLC fits the bill. What you'll instantly notice is the FPS-driven (top down perspective), WASD movement, mouse-target aiming, heavily skill-based mechanics that aren't to be found in most MOBAs today. A good FPS gamer would have an easier time learning to master the different champions in the game. The 2nd quite noticeable thing is the lack of lanes, creeps or a base for that matter - did I mention that this isn't DOTA?! - if you cut all the fat from a DOTA game, leaving it with just the characters, their abilities and how they work together in a team you'll get BLC. This is a clash of your team with the opponents team without anything interfering - no RNG, no creeps, no turrets. It's just kill or be killed. There are no levels or items, so all of the micromanaging (which I hate honestly) in other MOBAs and ""best builds"" is out of the window - the cards you're dealt comes with your chosen champion and don't change during the match, it's all about knowing how/when to use them (note that there is some customisation to be had outside matches but it has almost zero effect on the actual game).All of the above translates to matches that are: 1) short (3 rounds that lasts 3 minutes max each), 2) very intensive, 3) 100% reliant on team-work and knowing how to work with your champions. This reliance on team-work can lead to very frustrative games when even 1 player in your team doesn't know what he's doing. It will affect your odds of winning immensely.There is enough variety of champions to fit any style of gameplay - you got your ordinary melee (assassins, self-healing etc'), tanks, range and support (healers) champs. All champions got their own 6 unique abilities (5 regular and 1 ultimate) that serve different goals - space for example, which is used to jump in shooter games, is a maneuverability action, given you speed or blink you to a destination, R key (for most champions) is used for defense or a reactive ability. Champions are very flavorful, in artistic manner and in how their abilities work-together and for that I salute the developers - they are all so fun to play and explore. So in conclusion this is obviously a game I highly recommend to most players (with a fair warning to casual players), in an ideal world this game would be played by tens of thousand of gamers and rock the e-sports scene.PROS+ A unique MOBA experience that any MOBA fan should try+ Great variety of champions with streamlined interesting abilities + Team-oriented professional players will find a new home with BLC CONS- Very reliant on your team which means very frustrating games when even 1 player is bad- Low population of players (not really a con with the game itself) which means you'll see a lot of the same bad players - Steep learning curve for casual players will lead to endless frustration when facing veteran players. Not casual friendly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best pure pvp games I have played. It's very well balanced. As a newb a lot of the game is learning what bloodlines you wanna play learning there moves and how to set them up and aim them best. The 2nd part of the game is learning your opponents moves and how to dodge them. very fun game great change of pace of either moba or fps for competitive play aswell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Used to play it off steam when it was still region locked.Great arena based gameplay. Teamwork is important but at more casual levels good aim and understanding of your character goes a long way.While the character purchasing model may be a deterrent to some, new players do get a freebie for completing the beginner quests (I remember getting two when I was starting out), the prices have been lowered with the reboot, and ALL characters are unlocked for single player vs. bots, so you can explore/experiment with any of the characters before deciding which to purchase. If I can enjoy the game with 250+ ms, then anyone with a local server has no excuse!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the boldest experiments in MOBA genre and just great game with some considerable flaws. It's fun, It's fast-paced and it depends heavily on player's skill, not on gear/level/amounts of money donated. Though at first glance it may seem like another DotA clone, in truth Bloodline Champions share more similarities with classic multiplayer shooters like Quake 3, blending to genres together and attempting a whole new approach to old ""hero arena""-type of games.The biggest flaw comes from its obscurity - Bloodline Champions never got aggressive promotion like, for example, League of Legeds, thus game comunity is fairly small and cramped. But that's the flaw that we - YOU! - can correct. Bloodline Champions need you now!In conclusion, I'd give that game 8/10 (9/10 if you, like me, really love the design). Give it a shot, you probably won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot recommend this enough.Literally; go open the steam store and switch the ""Free to play"" and download this game. Now.It's an arena game based entirely around skill with knife-edge balance, every death will feel like it's YOUR fault as opposed to knowning dying was because of a unbalanced Champion. You might make connections to League of Legends; and to be fair it is similiar when you break it down... But it's like League of Legends in an small arena with no creeps, no runes, and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (I'm look at you, Trynhardamere). It's based entirely on how skillful you become at your champion.The only flaw with this diamond is the fact there isnt a incredibly large amount of people playing it so it's match making is a little... wonky at times, but it's not to bad usually.

												I have been playing bloodline champions since beta. Nothing can replace it. I havent yet found a game that is similar. BLC is pure skill. There is a medallion/trait system that gradually unlocks as you gain levels (a bit like LoL), but you get to the top level much faster. BLC is FAST PACED, action packed, really fun. It is a game for all those who loves PvP but that thinks that games nowadays are dumbed down and p2w. BLC is simply skill to win. It is really really fun and it is free. Hop in and try it out. I bet you will get smashed in the face and think wtf. And that is the fun part - Overcoming your opponents by gaining skill, not by spending money. As you play you earn ""blood coins"" which can be used to buy hereos and medallions and gems. There is alwasys 4 heroes on rotation each week. Bloodcoins are earnt really fast. It does not feel grindy at all. 10/10. Will never stop playin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you enjoy playing intelligent, highly demanding games where whole progress depends on player's skills only? That's what BLC is, AND it's packed with action!

												A fantastic example of what free to play games can give to players, this game wonderfully makes use of the top down view type gameplay along with enclosed arena combat. The variety of avatars and the customisation that is given to players through asthetics and battle skills is quite wide, and the amount of things that can be brought with in game currency compared to most is quite large. Fantastic game, make sure to give it a go! Its a worthwhile game to give a go at, after all it IS free!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sincerely *THE* greatest Arena-based PVP game EVER. Literally demanding a higher skill/ability from any gamers who choose to play but not without a great method for teaching/learning the mechanics. Sadly, this game is dead. Politics. Let's be real, if there were at least 1-more server here in America, it wouldn't have died as horribly as it did.We might be able to revive this beautiful masterpiece if we can get more people to download/play.

												Game with a lot of potential that unfortunately lacks a good playerbase. It's a solid arena-type game with interesting ultimate ability mechanics but can get a bit repetitive if you take long gaming sessions. With a bit of love and better advertising this game can most definitely be one of the more well known semi-ranked top-dogs such as SMITE, DotA2 and such.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Match length in Bloodline Champions is short, relative to other games in the genre. Rather than spending an hour or longer hoping for a game to finally come to an end, matches are often decisively ended within 20 minutes. There are outliers that drag on beyond 40, as evenly matched teams may have trouble managing to end the game against one another, but the game's rapidly scaling death timers generally enable one team to end the competition before that point is reached. Usually, games are over quickly enough that you'll convince yourself you always have time for one more game.If you wish to shine individually, you may not enjoy Bloodline Champions; the game is very team-centric, to the point that even experience is shared across an entire team--all players on the same team are the same level during a match. An individual's power to affect a match is limited. Grouping up is essential to winning matches, and attempting any sort of heroic 1-vs.-5 play will likely be met with death. This serves to reduce the amount of rampant toxicity the genre is rather notorious for bringing; most game and chat experiences feature very few instances of nasty epithets, and with cross-team chat disabled outright, there is no opportunity for insulting opponents.The environments, animations, and sounds of combat all evoke a mental investment in the action. Animations are simultaneously flashy and elegant, and ability animations feature enough clarity that it's rare to be confused about what killed you. Gunners gun crackles and flashes for each enemy it hits. As Flameman The Flame God leaps into the fray from across the map, a burning fire signals his landing. The comical Ranid Assassin mounts up into its longboat when activating a heroic taunt (unlockable for $10), and he sings a merry tune as he shoots his darts. And the sound of a dead hero (with which you will become very familiar) features a bass ""shoomp"" to draw just the right amount of satisfaction for each and every kill your team secures.League of Bloodstorm Champions is a must-play for both MOBA players and Blizzard enthusiasts. It avoids stepping into the exact footprints of the games that paved the way for the genre, and delivers a beautifully graceful, unique experience with familiar characters. And should you not fall into either category, it is still a fantastic casual-competitive game that offers untold hours of enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game where you chose a champion or hero with max level directly (no character leveling up required) and battle other opponents in a small map (arena) . Think of some maxed out heroes in DotA doing a battle on a small map. The huge good difference that this game makes :All the skills and normal attacks are casted on a line, in a AOE attack zone or directly on a character AND there are no chances to stun or to crowd control something - it either happens if you hit or not if you don't - which makes the game 100% player-skill based and also makes it HARD to master at the same time.Where the game fails is in the art style chosen for the entire game... In my opinion it isn't very catchy and pleasing to the eye (some kind of dark-tribal-cartoonish slightly unpolished aspect) - I believe this is the game's biggest problem.It's a good game for people who like to challenge themselves and test their eye-brain-finger coordination and also for people who like a good fair coop game.

												Note: First off my played Time in Steam isn't correct, since I mostly played this Game before it existed on Steam.Bloodline Champions is the best PvP Arena Game I am aware of. Essential it is a Mix between a regular MOBA and WoW Arena.In the Standard Game Mode you will fight 3vs3 in a Arena until one Team reaches 3 Wins. Each player picks a character from one of the following Archetypes: Tank, Meele Damage Dealer, Ranged Damage Dealer and Healer.The players will fight to the death using the 7 Unique Skills each Character possesses.Who wins depends only on the Skill of each Player and how good they work together as a Team, since all ranged abilities are Skillshots and its essential to use each Skill in the right Moment and actually hitting one or more enemies.Anyway this Game is great for anyone intrested in skillbased PvP Arena Gameplay. The only existing Problemis the low Playerbase. But there is Hope because the Playerbase recently seems to have picked up again, after Stunlock Studios took over the Server Hosting from Funcom.PS: The Free-to-Play Modell is quite fair as well. So try it out now while there are actually People playing the Game. xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is really the best ""direct PvP"" skill-based game in the world!! Very fast & intense.  I had played it at the very beginning of it's Open Beta (and followed the news from time to time since then), which is obviously a very long time ago, even before Steam release. It had many more players back then, so the matchmaking worked REALLY well, because it was divided into a lot of differnet ""divisions"" (based on skill) already. Tournaments did already exist in the game client, too! :) But then the playerbase dropped. (I guess most players were just too bad for it's fast, competitive gameplay.) I don't even know how many players still play it, I guess very few. Which is a shame because such a low player-pool ""breaks"" the matchmaking (which had been great before). :( I really still hope this game will be re-released or advertised to get the attention it deserves, because in a competitive way this game was way better than ANY other PvP-Arena game, even at the beginning of it's Open Beta already!! It should have been more successful than League of Legends in the eSports scene!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short- super fast paced, pure PvP arena action with a MASSIVE skill ceiling. They essentially took the standard MOBA format and took out everything that made it bad- RNG (ciritcal hits for example), auto-aim skills (everything from basic attacks to heals are skillshots than can miss), mana (your abilities are only limited by your cooldowns, with the exception of your ultimate), and objectives which slow the game down and take away from the PvP focus. There's no item shop, no ""feeding,"" no pay2win nonsense, it's balanced and perfectly suited for competetive play.And then they added to it. Each character has autoattacks bound to LMB, basic abilities bound to RMB, Q, E, R, movement ability bound to space, ultimate bound to F, and 2 alternate ability variations which can be triggered with a key combo, meaning that each character has essentially 9 abilities at their disposal. The game also has a great atmosphere, with a tribal theme, well represented through both visuals and audio.One of the few games that I would say is 10/10. Can't reccomend more. Only downside is the playerbase, but you can always find a game after a couple minutes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline champions is one of, if not my favorite game of all time. It's extremely skill based with a limitless skill ceiling. World of Warcraft arena without the grind crossed with Dota2/League of legends with amazing balance. Anything can win at the highest levels if you're good enough. The only negative aspect is the small playerbase which disuades a lot of people from giving it a shot.Do yourself a favor, give it a shot, I'm taking time enough to write a review of a game on steam, that should be enough to tell you how amazing this game is.

												The best competitive PvP game that was ever made!      10/10  if it had a playerbase and still 2s/3s/etc. team-modesLoL, WoW, CS, Dota and what not can't compete with BLC at all.Sadly BLC never gained much recognition, because it's not a casual game where you can do ""chill"" PvE and farm all the time like in LoL and also because of bad marketing resulting in a small awareness level. The average player who did hear about BLC or whom I tried to convince to play it actively deemed it as too difficult and stopped shortly after. You actually have to be good yourself in BLC and the skillcap and teamplay possibilitys are way higher than in LoL or other games. The solo carry potential is way higher and the chance that you disappear in the mass, making your actions insignificant, resulting in you losing the game, although you personally really deserve a win is way less likely than in other games, if it had a player base that is.You have to aim EVERYTHING and you can counter nearly all abilitys in a certain way you often have multiple ways to counter it.I just hope that ""Battlerite"" (the yet to be released successor of BLC) will be a success and will get the recognition it deserves, but it's not likely. The cycle seems to repeat itself. The development of Battlerite is already known for about 5 months and doesn't even have 4k facebook likes and just above 2k twitter followers. Speaking about bad marketing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing, amazing game with serious potential for competitive play.  If you like challenging, fast paced, rewarding competition in a PVP setting, this is a must play.-Games are short and sweet, reliant on skill and teamwork.  -Tournament system built into the game client with regular events.  -No early game laning/farming or creep play like in other mobas.  Entirely teamfight oriented.-No mana.  Game is all about managing the cooldowns of your 7 abilities in order to maximize your damage efficiency and mobility.Hopefully BLC will make a comeback now that stunlock took over.  I encourage anyone with a competitive mind to explore this game and spread the word so we can give the devs a good reason to further support this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't play this on steam but I had to write a review about it on here. It's super fun, the dynamics of the gameplay are still pretty unique, with the exception of XAM that kind of mimic-ed most of the controls and ideas. This game requires high levels of skill and the gaming curve is super high right when you get in (similar to LoL but much harder), but once you master a few characters and get in the hang of it, it's gives you really good gameplay. You play mainly as 3v3 with several different bloodlines and you can upgrade youself slightly out of game with gems and whatnot, but the beauty of the game is that it focuses on the actual teamfights, not farming or solo-laning, which means that each match is usually very fast to finish (maybe 15-30 minutes). The only bad thing about it is the playerbase. NO ONE plays it anymore, which is unfortunate, so Funcom should remarket it and get it on its toes again. But the last time I played was months ago, so the situation might have changed by now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite some of the design choices that changed the game radically from what I played months ago, this is still the purest arena PvP game I've ever played. If you ever enjoyed WoW arena or Guildwars style PvP, play this game. It's a balanced, polished, entertaining package. The main game mode is a fast-paced, two-minute best of five arena slugfest between two teams of three. It plays more like Counter-Strike than DotA or LoL, so don't think there will be any items or creeps or towers in here. All you will find is pure combat. It's a MOBA in all sense of the word - an online battle arena, more like an Isometic Street Fighter than anything else. This game is unique, its own genre - give it a chance and you won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodline Champions is a unique, fast paced, action packed arena game that will get your heart pumping every single match. Unlike a traditional MOBA that requires you to farm NPC's and level up to make your Hero/Champion more powerful, there is nothing of the sort in this game. It is just 100% Player vs. Player action, from start to finish. Anyone looking for a nice change of pace from the traditional MOBA setting should try this game. Especially if what you love is fighting other players, rather than the boring and reptitiveness that is the ""laning phase"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mostly 3v3, as it is the most common one and has ranked play in it. There are also tournaments in the game that give rewards. The normal 3v3 games are fast 3-15min depending on how good the players are. Learning the game is quite easy and if you don't have a lot of time this game is great. Come play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome  action and skill-based arena game.The focus on short matches, limited skills and small teams of 3 make it a great game to pick up and enjoy, even for a short game.How I picked it up is picking one champion I enjoyed, learned him in 2 bot matches, and have been playing only him ever since. That way you don’t really need to learn a lot and can enjoy even shorter games. For that matter I unlocked that champion from the points you get with the first achievements (first game and such).It is free to play, thus nothing lost if you try it. The pricing model itself, with 2 retail/packages is not very clear and understandable though - or clearly fair. It was too complicated for me even at launch, and didn't improve with the switch to F2P - hence I have not bought anything yet. Otherwise I would have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was probably pretty fun when it first came out, but coming from someone who tried out Battlerite over the free weekend there is no comparison. The majority of my review is going to be comparing the two games for all those that want to know what is different. There are a lot of the came characters, sure, but the things that make battlerite fun aren't in this game. This game is slow and cluncky versus Battlerite's fluid movement and attacks. Same goes for the attacks and abilities.  I am not saying that this game isn't fun, it's just not a good replacement for Battlerite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun, fast paced, minorly addicting gameplay. every class plays with a unique twist allowing you to master one, but not so complicated that you can't be useful if you try them out. Every week they change classes around to let you try out a new range of classes. their are healers, damage dealers Melee, Damage Dealers range and tank classes. Definitely a fun game if you are into DOTA but want a more fast paced version.Also, everything is unlockable through play, it just takes a really long time (blood coinds gained per match can be increased with boosters, or you can just buy their tokens to buy their items/classe straight-out, everything is cosmetic once you unlock the class.)

												Non è un gioco per femminucce. BC è un MOBA incentrato totalmente su un PvP cattivo che non perdona errori, con pochi, ma bilanciati personaggi difficili da padroneggiare. La visuale dall'alto e il controllo tramite WASD lo rendono preciso ed estremamente divertente, assicurando una pulizia grafica e di controlli che supera di gran lunga i moba più blasonati.L'unica vera pecca è la mancanza di giocatori, una volta superato lo scoglio delle prime partite, quando si comincia a padroneggiare un personaggio abbastanza da voler provare a mettere la testa in un torneo, le code di attesa possono diventare estenuanti, nonostante questo le dimensioni esigue del download e la componente ""un'altra partita e poi smetto"" lo rendono, insieme alla gratuità del titolo (con i soldi si comprano solo upgrade grafici), un must da provare a tutti i costi.

												Bloodline Champions is an underrated game made by Stun Lock Studios.  It currently doesn't receive much support from it's developer, mostly because they're working on Dead Island: Epidemic, but that shouldn't stop you from playing this wonderfully exciting game.It's a 3v3 format played on very small maps.  No creeps, no grinding for cash to make your Champion stronger, you just go in and beat the crap out of the other players.  Matches take upwards of 5 minutes so there's no huge time committment.  It's brilliant in its simplicity.The only real issue, and it's a rather large one unfortunately, are the servers.  The servers are of poor quality and lag spikes and packet loss are frequent and can sometimes even make the game unplayable.  Even with this rather large flaw the game is still worth playing.  It's free after all and if you're looking to kill 30 minutes and get lots of games in it's totally worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a good game, by all means. It's just very difficult to get in a match, because of the dead servers. It's also displeasant to see the huge money cap for unlocking new champions or playable classes being 9000 to the lowest being 6000, and only gaining 100 currency each succesful game. However if you don't mind trying it out on singleplayer and or get lucky to find a game. You should definetly try it. I'd give this game a -6/10~Good system and fun controls, however poorly executed with detrementing skill caps, farming and dead servers. It could've been a greater game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that I once claimed was the best competitive game I ever played. I played this game for countless hours before it came to steam and I loved it.That being said, this game was ruined in development. Each hero used to feel very unique, but balance patches made a lot of characters a lot less fun than they used to be (Seeker, Glutton, Blood Priest to name a few).And the nail in the coffin - the talents/gems/medallion system. Back when heroes had a static amount of health and these numbers were low - about 150 to 200 health - the game was much better. You knew if an enemy used an ability, it would be a certain amount of time before it came back off cooldown. Now with the wonky stat system you can never tell their cooldown, their movement speed or how much damage they are going to do. Game feels very pay to win and was practically abandoned with no updates from the old studio.This used to be an amazing game, and you might still enjoy it if you didn't know it in its former glory. But regrettibly I cannot recommend it anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun take on the arena combat genre. Very different to the millions of dota clones and a fresh experience from things such as league. Has gamemodes such as team deathmatch and capture the flag. GET GET GET. Very fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're like me and are bummed that the Battlerite free weekend is over, this game isn't a good substitute. The best thing about battlerite is the way the movement and animations are, and this game (which has aged pretty well, to be fair) just doesn't give that same feel. I'm sure if I wasn't already spoiled by what does feel very much like a sequel, it could be pretty fun. But if you're looking to experience Battlerite, just wait for the real game to go F2P. I'm pretty sure it will.			",25,6,0,1,1,0,4

												Decent gameplay, if you could ever get a game going. Log in during peak times and you might be able to match up with same crowd of snobs that don't want you playing their game. Seriously, just starting out, and I was repeatedly told to go play another game, because I sucked. Gotta start somewhere, but you know what?  Not here. The game isn't good enough to keep playing with the toxic community that exists. Avoid this game like the plague if you like to play video games for fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People say this is kind of like DotA. It's nothing like DotA. It compares a little more to WoW arena or the upcoming Diablo 3 arena stuff. With that said, this game is a lot of fun and the only downer about it is the small population it has. Features spectator mode, replays, capture the flag, point control, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v5 and 5v5 combat. Now that the game is available through Steam hopefully the small player base problem will be resolved!			",175,28,8,18,22,3,35

												although not for everyone, this is just the best competitive free game I've ever played. it's so clear that it's made by smart people who listen to the community a lot more than MANY other software houses. Not only it's a very well made, polished product, but it's an original one too: there's no game like this one around, it sports a very unique gameplay with free targeting spells and abilities. Not for everyone I said, because it's a very skill-based, really fast-paced game (in fact, I kind of suck).Moreover, hardware wise it's a very light game which runs smoothly on almost every machine. Sure, graphic is not cutting edge, but still it's enjoyable, clean and polished.btw, I've so few hours of playing cause I recently put it on steam, but I've been playing this game since its first days.

												I have played Bloodline Champions when it came out, but it felt pretty uneven and unbalanced. The tragedy is, while they may have did a lot to balance the champs and eradicate bugs, they were simply too late. When it came out, LoL, HoN Dota were the main mobas and drew a lot of attention. While the idea of Bloodline champions is nice, there is little beginners playerbase imho. Games you play as a beginner are either vs ridiculously stronger opponents (e.g. having weeks or months on their profile) or...hm... no you always play vs stronger opponents. i tried it at various times, opponents were always way stronger and more experienced. I cant even blame it on the matchmaking because there is none for beginners. Simplay put, you either have already played the game, or go through a long and tedious period of learning, constantly getting owned with little success moments to motivate you. Apart from that, the champs are not all free to play. Another disadvantage considering the small hero pool.tl;dr if you consider getting this game, dont, you are too late. Let it rest in piece as a pioneer moba idea that came at the wrong time.			",29,6,1,9,9,0,6

												I played hundreds of hours of this game before it game to Steam.Unfortunately the previous Publisher ""Funcom"" ruined this game by pushing the very thing the developers were set out to avoid: RNG, unethical Microtransactions (p2w).If you remember the first April Fools patch note back from the closed Beta, were the developers made fun of the RNG in League of Legends and Dota2 and all the grinding and farming ... unfortunately that's exactly what this game has become.After this most players abandoned the game and it later was introduced to Steam.TL/DR: NEVER buy or play a game that was published by FunCom they are money grabbing cu*** that will ruin all your fun. It's basically like countries with Democratic in their name they almost always are dictatorships ... there is ""fun"" in the publishers name so they are obviously pieces of sh**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, don't let the playtime fool you, I played A LOT of this game when it came out. Before it got to steam.It was a great game. An incredibly fun, competitive, top-down brawler. It felt good to play - controlling the characters felt very robust and proper, the characters themselves were interesting and so were their abilities. It also had quite a bit of depth combat-wise. Sadly, at some point they decided to release what for me ended up being a game breaking update. It was basically ""memes and league of legends runes"" the update. I kept on playing it for quite a while, I really forced myself but it just wasn't the same. The whole element of farming for these pointless (mostly passive if i remember correctly) upgrades, figuring out the one optimal build to go for, etc. just kind of ruined everything the game used to be: an adrenaline fueled, skill-based, FUN brawler.If the idea of farming for upgrades for quite a long time or just flat out buying them, figuring out which to use on which heroes in a competitive top-down brawler doesn't seem repulsive to you and what I described in the first paragraph seems like something you'd be interested in, then sure, give it a try. Otherwise, I recommend you stay away. This gem has been sullied.			",405,104,15,50,36,5,60

												Here let me write a review for anyone playing west coast USA. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!The servers are not latency friendly, I'm playing on Charter 60MB fiber optic cable internet with a Asus Diamond, and Motorola gaming router. I download and upload at 80mb down and 25mb up. So let me put it in a nutshell. This game would be sweet, because it's highly skill based and was awesome during when they actually took care of server placement. BUT if you live west coast USA, forget about it. You will only get frusterated with the latency and losing all the time due to lag.			",29,0,0,3,1,0,0

												I´ve played this game a lot and I have to say that I never played more ""skill"" game. I mean you can play this game nonstop and you will still have somthing to learn. The mechanics of this game are awesome everything is smooth: movement, projectiles hitboxes are on point. This game just couldnt be more perfect (imo). Graphics are cool and the game has some pretty cool mechanics like trances, various kind of shields interesting projectiles aoes. And if you play with your friend its double the fun and you can explore all these kinds of compositions and mechanics. Althought this game as I said is rly skillbased so it will take a lots of practise so dont give up on the start and try to learn from your mistakes.			",40,2,2,1,1,0,4

												From what I've seen, fun game and an interesting concept of a different style of MOBA. However, if you're a new player (like me) it's almost impossible to get a game going with other people. Waiting in the queue time ""Searching for other players"" will most likely be your most game time play unless you do singleplayer. You're also not going to get placed in any games with lower experience as you so be prepared to get demolished for your first few games. Good game, just a dead player base for lower levels.

												Rating: 10 out of 10Genre: MOBAThoughts: Just simply the best fuhking MOBA ever.  Flat out a game that takes skill to a whole new level, every spell and skill is a ""skill shot"" and extremely addicting and fun, it is just sad that the game doesn't have a huge player base otherwise it would be nice to see this game evolve and get upgraded more such as graphics, characters, etc... also can be listed as one of the first ""hardcore"" casual games because games generally last under 5 minutes usually unless the battles pull the players to the edge of their seats and last full round times.Additions: After playing its sequel game (Battlerite) i had to bump up the rating from 9.5 to... 10 out of 10 because of how much better this game is to its second coming...

Granted that is normal for most moba's but this seems to be unjust and not even remotely cared about. I would think if it was in global a moderator would be watching but I guess not. The game it's self is simple in concept and honestly for the amount of hatred in the community is to me not worth the effort for such a simple game play.			",182,40,1,25,9,2,9

												Not really worth the time. This a MOBA based on the WASD movement keys, QERF keys for abilitites and Left and Right Mouse buttons for attacks, Spacebar for movement spell. F1,F2,F3 to use a magic item.PROS1. Semi-NovelReminds me of a Warcraft II mod where players were mages who created spells and leveled up.CONS1. ReviewsThe reviews from the game all follow a line of ""OMG greatest PvP game ever, too bad too few players, call your friends to join"". If I didn't know better, I would just say it was just botted with the same script.There was even a player that claimed to play 500+ hours in this game. He only played 46 hours. 2. Fun?What's so fun about this game? I'm sorry what's you fun factor?3. Tournament LeaguesYou have tournament leagues and e-sports channels even before you've gotten a sizable player base? I think you're jumping the gun here. They've got a league that goes all the way from Iron to Diamond. Extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.4. MusicHorrid repetitive background music that you can't turn off.5.

												I dont recomend this game for the simple fact that you spend more time in que than playing. Which in itself is incredibly unappealing. why spend 25-30 min waiting to play when you dont even play for half that. Its just not worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had played this game before it went to steam and it had problems (those problems still exist)I went in expecting a game where u can only buy heroes and cosmotics (like any decent free to play brawling game)but it isn't People will pay and get the same charcter but stronger with extra crap and stronger spells.If u want to play a balanced game this isn't the one.however if u don't mind being forced to puts out lots of money so u can play with stronger charcters or spend tons of hours grinding (while losing because your charcter is weak) than sure go ahead .

												This game has been passed around more devs and publishers than a drunk girl at a frat house. When it first came out, I loved the hell out of it and even purchased the hero pack which gave me all current and future units, as well as several skins. Well, now that account is gone and so is all my money I spent on it.Players be wary of spending your money on this game, you might catch something.			",121,31,2,32,15,1,15

												I'm not at all compelled. The difference in abilities between all the characters I tried seemed shockingly minimal. Basically everything is a skill shot or an aoe, and it will either do damage, do damage and slow, heal, or do damage and heal. Most characters have a mobility skill that works nearly identically. The only variation seems to be in healers and tanks, but it's still just healing or applying a shield to yourself or your teammates.Having all the abilities at the start feels weird. I know there's no way around that in this format, and I've even enjoyed other games that do this such as Heroes of the Storm. The difference is that you have 6 abilities (8 if you count heal and revive). This makes the basic control of your character much less approachable than other arena combat games. It's not the number of abilities that is the problem here -- I'm completely comfortable playing DotA with 6 active items for a total of 10 abilities -- it's the fact that you start with all of them, and again, how similar they all are. I think the characters would be much more compelling if they had fewer skills and more specialization.That's my main problem with the game. The characters are very generic, and this is likely necessary to the format of the game. Keeping 3v3 blind draft balanced requires giving every character a certain variety of skills, which made it feel far too homogeneous for my liking. I could get used to the keyboard controls and mouse aiming. I could get used to having 8 abilities out of the gate and learn how they all work. But, after 2 or 3 games of it, I'm not at all interested in trying.			",133,6,2,12,4,0,11

												Don't let the game tags fool you. This game is essentially a ""speed MOBA"". Take games like DotA or League of Legends and strip the game of the farming phase and map control and you get games like Bloodline Champions. Combat is action oriented with a control scheme identical to typical MOBA games. Heavily Pay-to-Win because free character pools are rarely useful and in-game currency takes too long to grind relative to character costs. Skip it.			",204,27,3,22,9,0,13

												Bloodline Champions is very hard game to learn personly. However, you should play this game.                              When i played the game it really reminded me of Magika Wizard wars. The game does have a sightly hard learning cure but pretty good. You should consider playing this game and its free so if you dont like it delete it. I guess its all depends to the gamer's playing the game.			",10,2,0,0,1,0,2

												Bloodline Champions is a unique moba in my eyes to be one of the only games of the genre to fulfill the MOBA term. The game is centred around two or three champions on each opposing team with one main goal; to defeat the enemy team. There are no objectives or items in the game so you don't have to worry about last hitting or farming for a lategame composition, you are the champion you play and nothing more. There are a few things you can add onto your account to help you ingame such as masteries, gems to socket into your medallions which can buff, damage or even protect. The game is very fast-paced and skill based almost every skill in the game is a skillshot played through an isometric camera. The game has four main roles of Tanks, Healers, Melee and Ranged. There's a lot of champions and each have strengths and weaknesses, there are tournaments as well as PvP seasons for you, the game is very satisfying however the only real problem with the game is the lack of updates from the developers and the rapidly decreasing playerbase.

												This game is good but not great.My friend and I were browsing through steam to find a decent free multiplayer game that we can play.And so we found this.Bloodline Champions is a multiplayer arena fighting game where you can select various types of 'bloodlines' to play as.The main gamemode is typically 3v3, but you can have 5v5, and play with different gamemodes and maps.I've only played a couple of hours with this game, but from what i've seen i find it pretty enjoyable.PROS:+ lots of different bloodlines and playstyles to choose from+ Colourful art style and smooth graphics+ Different combos/attacks each bloodline can perform (also there is an epic ultimate move!)+ Fast paced and short rounds.+ Great for playing with friendsCONS:- Can be a bit chaotic and confusing at times- Alot of the cosmetics cost real money (but that doesn't effect the gameplay).- The virtual currency (gold) is over priced.Overall the gameplay is great, but most (if not all) the cosmetics for your bloodlines cost gold (virtual currency). 6.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had played this game back when it was in beta. Back then the game was outstanding, however I feel that the devs may had dropped the ball when adding content and updates to the game.When I had stopped playing was in between beta and a few months after it had been released. During that period it alot of the changes that had taken effect seemed to have caused issues with the community. From my personal experience I decided it was not worth it because of the traits, gems and medallions system as it kinda took away from what I liked in this game in the first place.To be honest if another developer came out and made a game like this exactly how it was in Bloodline Champion's beta stages I would play it in a heartbeat.

Great mix of MOBA and Slash'er.Quick games - for example 3 rounds per 2 min each.This is not pay to win game! Everything cost standard ingame's money except skins and XP/Cash boosts.Level your account, upgrade your ""talents"" and buy medalions (something like runes and summoner spells in League of Legends - yes active and passive medalions are there) and champions.If you like MOBA/slash'ers or something like arena in World of Warcraft and don't like to play 40+ min at one time, just play Bloodline Champions.

												Bloodline Champions (BLC) is amazing fun! If you've played DotA or League of Legends, you already know the play style. The free aspect lets you cycle between characters (you can't use the same character all the time) but a few can be unlocked over time.Imagine LoL but as a Player Vs Player arena. No objectives other than own the other team! It isn't as simple as that, though! Combine amulets powers and the gems for stats that you balance to your playstyle. Top it all off with the skill and reflexes you'll need to win. Having said that, a healer can own anything if played properly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games I've ever had to most fun playing. Easy to pick-up (I recommend you start with Glutton), very hard to Master. Has an very high skil curve, with no RNG involved. It's easy to join tournaments and leagues with your friends and the leagues are even scaled to your skill-level (scaled Iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum). It is probably one of my favourite games ever. This game is for everyone who is a heavy PvP fan, whose looking for some balanced action. It's a game where your own skill level is everything that matters, and the longer you play, the better you get and the more fun it becomes. There are about 30 classes to master, each easy to pick up (because each one only has 6 abilities, however it's about learning WHEN to use them correctly).The only downside is that developers has left it, and so has a large amount of the player base. This results in long queue times during low hours and something the matches aren't scaled due to the long queue times (newbies vs. 100+ hour players).I really hope this game gets picked up again and generates a new player base. Best game ever.			",50,5,0,3,2,0,2

												Haven't played very much, but it has all the things I missed in Dota:- Short rounds, so less pain if you (or your teammates) suck-> Results in a more chill community- No PvE boredom (aka farming)-> It is always skill vs skill, not gold vs gold- You have high impact on team performance (no classic selfless supports for instance)-> MMR rating is more fairThis seems to be much more of a fun game (even though it is very skill based) than a sport like Dota that is more built for watching than for playing. BLC provides fun even when learning.EDIT: I dont play very often because it's pretty fast paced and I prefer games for people with reaction times of a sloth. If you are open to fast-paced combat, go for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Free to play, this is a really fun game and requires a lot of skill in arena style combat. There is no pay2win mechanism, except unlocking some new heroes, which you can do via ingame coins that you earn each match anyway, though it takes a while. It does have a fairly high skill bracket the better you get, but each hero has skills fully available at the start of the game and different heroes are available each week on a rotating policy. All of the different classes have similar skill sets but are unique, and you may prefer different hero play styles. I would fully recommend giving it a go, even buy the starter pack if it goes really cheap on a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is nice and colourful. The graphics may not be photo-realistic. But it is very good looking overall.I've been impressed by the gameplay of it most. In Single player It's mainly fighting against bots. It's the multiplayer that makes this game fun. There are lots of players online, lots of action, etc. You've got different spells and weaponry to choose from to combat against enemy forces. The goal to win is by capturing flags.For a game like this that's free and only 963 MB in size, you won't regret giving this a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty cool concept. I initially was interested in this game by the unique concept and was captivated by it. After playing it for a few hours the concept starts to lose it's initial appeal and you're left with the actual gameplay which to be honest is pretty good. The gameplay is fun and fairly well put together and balanced. I will say that much like any team based game the players can ruin games for you and make it a hell however that doesn't make the game itself bad.My only real problems with the game are the difficulty to buy a new bloodline and the grade system. The grade system seems to be pretty unique but not in a good way. Unlike a typical mmr system that most competitive games have this game has a grade system which gives you a grade based on how well you played ranging from 1-25. This would be fine except for starters it doesn't really explain how it gives you a grade very well and it took a bit of research to get a general idea how it worked. From my research I believe it gives you a grade based on your maximum achieved scores which is a pretty lame way to do it rather than using an average. The other problem is that it takes a fair amount of time to farm up enough to buy a new bloodline but I guess that isn't really that bad so I won't say don't play because of that. The player base is also a little low so sometimes finding games can be a bit of a hassle but that can easily be changed.They do a lot of tournaments that any team can qualify for simply by signing up which I think is a fantastic idea and more games should implement this. The tournaments reward the winners with certain prizes that let them get special reqards. The tournaments also range in skill level so that you aren't playing with a grade 2 and a grade 25 in the same game, they try and even it out so that you can play in tournaments with people of your own skill level. They also have a ranked system so that you can achieve certain ranks for the season and get little rewards for that as well.All in all this is a good game for killing some time and certainly worth a look.

												100% skill based combat similar to the most interesting fights in MOBA's. The action is incredibly fast paced with low cooldowns and ultimates that build from connecting with attacks or heals. Really hope this gets updated or someone runs with this idea, I feel its popularity would have exploded if it got more attention from the MOBA community. Sadly, the game was always far more popular in the EU.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The battles are intense and fast. Good thing theres a small pool of characters to learn. Bad thing is theres a small player base. There's some grind involved for the long-term in the form of Medallions and socketed gems. Outside that you have to save up in-game currency for permanent access to additional characters. Bloodline Champions suffers from a small playerbase and a steep learning curve. If you enjoy fighting games or battle arenas, you may want try this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games I've ever had to most fun playing. Easy to pick-up (I recommend you start with Glutton), very hard to Master. Has an very high skil curve, with no RNG involved. It's easy to join tournaments and leagues with your friends and the leagues are even scaled to your skill-level (scaled Iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum). It is probably one of my favourite games ever. This game is for everyone who is a heavy PvP fan, whose looking for some balanced action. It's a game where your own skill level is everything that matters, and the longer you play, the better you get and the more fun it becomes. There are about 30 classes to master, each easy to pick up (because each one only has 6 abilities, however it's about learning WHEN to use them correctly).The only downside is that developers has left it, and so has a large amount of the player base. This results in long queue times during low hours and something the matches aren't scaled due to the long queue times (newbies vs. 100+ hour players).I really hope this game gets picked up again and generates a new player base. Best game ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Don't bother because the game will be unplayable for you due to latency issues, impacting on almost every bit of play. Movement, attacks and spells, hopefully we get a server one day, but there would need to be a stronger community before hand. However if you live in the EU or US.

												Haven't played very much, but it has all the things I missed in Dota:- Short rounds, so less pain if you (or your teammates) suck-> Results in a more chill community- No PvE boredom (aka farming)-> It is always skill vs skill, not gold vs gold- You have high impact on team performance (no classic selfless supports for instance)-> MMR rating is more fairThis seems to be much more of a fun game (even though it is very skill based) than a sport like Dota that is more built for watching than for playing. BLC provides fun even when learning.EDIT: I dont play very often because it's pretty fast paced and I prefer games for people with reaction times of a sloth.

												I like the single player aspect. A lot of neat ideas presented here. But the multiplayer is just bitterly awful. The game doesn't have enough support and those who do support it are already jacked up with items and skill. I do understand that I could just grind bots for the rest of my life, but the fact remains that balance should be exactly that, balance. I don't want to face ridiculously unbeatable people. I'd like to face people around my skill level, and there just aren't enough players to make that a possibility.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game could have becomed the next big thing in the eSports community but developers thought otherwise. Bloodline Champions was tons of fun, high-skillcap battle arena.

LoL requires 3 skills and a ulti, this requires 8-11 skills, aiming, faking, dodging, awareness.  Battles are fast, ranging from 2-10 mins max, average being 3-4 mins.Really if you think you got gaming skills, this is the true game to test that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Free to play, this is a really fun game and requires a lot of skill in arena style combat. There is no pay2win mechanism, except unlocking some new heroes, which you can do via ingame coins that you earn each match anyway, though it takes a while. It does have a fairly high skill bracket the better you get, but each hero has skills fully available at the start of the game and different heroes are available each week on a rotating policy. All of the different classes have similar skill sets but are unique, and you may prefer different hero play styles. I would fully recommend giving it a go, even buy the starter pack if it goes really cheap on a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong I love Bloodline champs, I've played it a bunch pre-steam release and its a really cool fast paced arena fighter. But, if you live in Australia as I do. Don't bother because the game will be unplayable for you due to latency issues, impacting on almost every bit of play. Movement, attacks and spells, hopefully we get a server one day, but there would need to be a stronger community before hand. However if you live in the EU or US.

												Give it a try. Really.It is the most unique and refreshing MOBA of ...ever. Don't lose me yet — I am calling it a MOBA since it means ""Multiplayer Online Battle Arena"" and, well, if Bloodline Champions isn't a MOBA, no game is.It is nothing alike League of Legends or DotA2. There are no minions and no lanes. This right here is the Quake 3 of MOBAs. Rounds take around 1-3 minutes, and a match is 3 rounds.No levels. No items. No chance dependent skills. All ""spells"" are skillshots. ALL SPELLS, even melee ""autoattacks"" are skillshots. Usual classes apply: Tank, Healer, Assassin, Nuker, ADC, etc.Brilliant class design with fun spell synergies. Excellent camera (takes a bit to get used to if you come from regular MOBAs).Several game modes: Deathmatch, CTF and others.The developers have recently (Jan-Feb 2015) taken control of the game from the publisher and, with it, the game now fully supports steam.This is a little known pearl, one which I hope will finally shine. Play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Out of all the games I've played, this is by far the best PVP experience for arena style combat. It's simplistic yet challenging. I've been playing game off and on since it came out. I would've played continuously, but funcom drove away most of the player base. Even with a small player base and ~2-5 min times in between games, I can't stay away. If you're thinking about giving this game a shot, please play. That's the only way this community will grow again. Don't be intimidated by the learning curve. Go into practive mode, find the right champions for you, and play around with the hardest level bots before going into the public games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Don't lose me yet — I am calling it a MOBA since it means ""Multiplayer Online Battle Arena"" and, well, if Bloodline Champions isn't a MOBA, no game is.It is nothing alike League of Legends or DotA2. There are no minions and no lanes. This right here is the Quake 3 of MOBAs. Rounds take around 1-3 minutes, and a match is 3 rounds.No levels. No items. No chance dependent skills. All ""spells"" are skillshots. ALL SPELLS, even melee ""autoattacks"" are skillshots. Usual classes apply: Tank, Healer, Assassin, Nuker, ADC, etc.Brilliant class design with fun spell synergies. Excellent camera (takes a bit to get used to if you come from regular MOBAs).Several game modes: Deathmatch, CTF and others.The developers have recently (Jan-Feb 2015) taken control of the game from the publisher and, with it, the game now fully supports steam.This is a little known pearl, one which I hope will finally shine. Play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Out of all the games I've played, this is by far the best PVP experience for arena style combat. It's simplistic yet challenging. I've been playing game off and on since it came out. I would've played continuously, but funcom drove away most of the player base. Even with a small player base and ~2-5 min times in between games, I can't stay away. If you're thinking about giving this game a shot, please play. That's the only way this community will grow again. Don't be intimidated by the learning curve. Go into practive mode, find the right champions for you, and play around with the hardest level bots before going into the public games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty decent pvp arena game. There is quite nice characters pool but sadly people are playing only 2-3 of them. Also, some of them have too similar skills. If you got bored with other arena pvp games then you might want to check Bloodline Champions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would recommend to everyone above age of 16. Nice strategy game with a lot of awesome abilities, personally don't have time for all games, but this is a worthy game. Get someone to play with you so you can have someone to blame on! ^.^Game itself deserves a lot of time spended on learning spells range, auto attack range, mana costs and a lot more.  Thanks for reading this :DEnjoy the game and take care!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												'Expected moba type game. Got faster gw/diablo/wow type arena game with aiming instead. . Theres some objective based modes(ctf and conquest) but barely anyone queues for them. You should try it if you like arena pvp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the absolute best PvP Arena game I have ever touched. It's Free, It's way more skill based than League of Legends, or anyother game with comparison. I don't have to ""build"" my champions to fight per battle. It's just all skill shots all the time, the winner is the last man standing ofcourse. It's ARENA! It's FREE! It's really one of the best PvP games I have played, and I have played a lot of games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really fun free, non-pay-to-win arena game.The skill and practise you need to be any good at it is enormous though and there aren't very many lowtier players.This is the reason I'm quitting it, when actually having had fun times. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have over 1000 hours in this game. It wasn't always on steam.Fast, furious, intense. Entirely skill based, 3v3 arena combat.A match typically lasts only 5 minutes.Think of this game as a MOBA, where everyone is already max level, has a full build of items, and are already positioned for a teamfight... This is where a match of BLC begins, and also where the similarities end. Because this game is so focused on the intensity and fast paced action of those teamfights, it goes above and beyond anything you've ever encountered before. Magic bolts flying everywhere, explosions all around you, split second juking and dodging, careful timing, focus, and precision.Simple enough layout/gameplay that you can pick it up in 20 minutes.But, a ridiculously high skill cap means you can always do better.Top down, WASD to move. Each character has 6 basic abilities, 2 special abilties, 1 ultimate.Every ability is a skillshot. You have to actually aim to hit things. Every time you hit things, you gain energy which can be spent to cast your special abilities for a small amount or your ultimate for a much larger amount.It's free to play, and I can not recommend it enough. Funcom drove the playerbase into the ground, but they have since been removed, and the players have come back in droves. It only takes a minute for matchmaking to find people for a game now. (Perhaps longer for new players that have no in-game rating yet.)In-game tournaments every other day (which cater to even low skill players, so everyone can join in!) with great rewards.As a free to play, there's some things we have to cover:Q1) How long does it take to grind a new character to play?Less than any other f2p game I've ever played. Between a large daily coin boost pool, really short match times with high rewards, low cost characters in the shop, and two quests unlocking a character each for free, there's just no comparison. There are 27 characters to choose from, all free to play/try against bots before picking one up in-game.Q2) How's the real world $ to in-game currency rate?First, you can unlock every single character (all 27) for $20. So that's insane.Second, those in-game tournaments reward you with coins for skin unlocks/etc. So that's awesome too. Third, the devs give out free skins/avatars/titles on holidays just for logging in, which is unheard of in f2p games. Otherwise, if you wanted to buy a cosmetic with regular cash, it has about the same going rate as other f2p's out on the market. So, there's lots of freebies and character unlocks are super cheap, but cosmetic items are of usual prices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
