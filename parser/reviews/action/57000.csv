												Basically NyxQuest is a nice but quite short puzzle-platformer. In this game you take control of Nyx, a winged girl from the realm of gods in mythological Greece. The world is ending and you have to find your lover, a mortal named Icarus.A slight detour: In the Greek mythology Icarus was a guy whose dad built him wings out of feathers and wax and warned him not to fly too close to the Sun; then he basically died.Nyx can fly and soar for short distances. She has to avoid environmental hazards like hot sand, pylons, fire balls and falling to pits, and also monsters like harpies and giant fire-breathing snakes. The ultimate goal of each level is to simply reach the end. Fortunately there are several check points each level.There are two bonus goals: you can try to find all the hidden relics (holy artefacts) within each level and also speed run the levels. There are 12 levels (+ secret level that unlocks after the main quest), along which Nyx learns new skills. These include the ability to move objects and hold them still, control winds and finally shoot lightning. All abilities add new challenges to the game.It's a nice platformer with a atmosphere that grasps the feeling of ""the end of times"". The levels are full of ruins and statues and, of course, sand. For me the completion took some 3 hours, the rest of the 6,6 h experience being taken by trying speed runs and finding the relics I had missed.			",3011,1260,77,374,381,26,452

												NyxQuest is a great puzzle platformer. Sure, there are better looking games out there, but I like the style and the setting. I do admit they could've used more detailed textures, but it's a Wii port, so I can't really complain. Other than that, I can't really tell you much more about it. You have the ability to fly to get to higher places and during the game you earn extra powers so that you're able to move big statues and blocks for example.There's a bug that prevents the game from saving, so you need to do a little bit of work to be able to save at all (or you have to restart from the beginning every time you play it). Despite that I say: thumbs up. Definitely worth it.[Rating: 74/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A puzzle platformer that starts out a bit too simple and starts getting repetetive during the latter parts of the first hour until it starts switching things up by giving you more varied powers and obstacles.The setting is a post-apocalyptic version of ancient greece which is something you don't see every day.The graphics and music are both fairly simple but they stay consistent and work for what theyre meant to do.Overall an alright game, pretty short.

												Amazing art style? Check.Greek Mythology inspired? CheckUnique approach to platforming? Check.Requirements that would fit the 90s more than today? CheckBasically, what you're getting here is a game which is very underrated and that many people don't know of, but that shouldn't be a reason as to why you shouldn't try it yourself.There's not much storyline, but Greek Mythology makes this an enjoyable experience that any history fan would like.There's also physics source-engine elements that I haven't seen anywhere else, which make it an interesting approach to the platforming aspect of it, but in all honesty you need to try it out for yourself to like it.9/10, would buy again, only downside as to why it's not 10/10 is that it doesn't have multiplayer.Seriously, the desert landscapes and all that remind me of From Dust and that other PS3 game that was at E3 this year.

												NyxQuest is a basic puzzle platformer where you fly/glide a pixie across Greek lands on a quest to find Icarus. You get a few very simplistic powers like lightning. wind control, and the ability to move certain objects. There is a story, but it wasn't worth remembering. The music was the highlight of the game. There wasn't much else to really get excited about and I expected a little more. I'd say it's an okay dollar menu game, but you wouldn't be missing much by skipping it.Note: I was not able to get the game working with early Soundblaster Audigy cards which caused immediate blue screens upon clicking any menu option. More modern Soundblaster cards seem to work fine.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												this is a cool interesting platformer with some very nice level design that you don't see very often in video games.the game is based in some sort of ancient greece kind of setting where♥♥♥♥♥♥has gone down and the world has become a wasteland.The game is kind of short and shouldn't take more than 4 hours to be honest , ( and can be finished a lot quicker if you know what your doing). However what nyx quest lacks in quantity it makes up with a quite high level of quality. Nxy quest did however come out in 2009 for the wii i believe so don't expect HD graphics or anything, not that the graphics are bad or anything in my opinion and to be honest i reckin they are suprising good ( we are talking about a wii port here).overall Nyx quest is a short but solid platformer set in ancient greece and is well worth your money as it is only $3 at full price :)			",112,32,1,14,7,0,23

												I wasn't a fan. My biggest gripe, which you will think is insignificant until you've played it all the way through, is the spawn system. You die and restart from your last checkpoint then for a few seconds you can't jump or glide. This leads to quick deaths and frustration if you do get stuck.It lasts about 2 hours with the main game but it also has collectibles you can go back and get so there is some replayability but nothing changes. I'd recommend it middle of the road, if you want a side scrolling platformer, it's cheap and does get much cheaper, but if you just think IT'S ON SALE LET'S BUY IT then I wouldn't bother.

												The first time I saw this game was several years ago on the wii shop channel, I was rather surprised to find it on steam, let alone for only about 3-4 bucks CAD.The gameplay itself is simple enough to understand and rather easy to get used to- it's a sort of puzzle platformer that can be enjoyable for people like myself who don't really like having too many difficult puzzles- the puzzles are there, and they require a bit of thought, but are still rather casual and easily enjoyed. (except for maybe the last couple of 'puzzles' but i wont go into that since its spoilers for the storyline)The graphics are pretty good, you can optimize it according to your PC and it has options for anti-aliased and non, so it can either be more pixelated looking, or super smooth (both of which look rather good imo) It runs well, and the background music is calming- it isn't overbearing or nonexistent, it does it's job and does it well.The story is alright, it isn't bad, but I definitely wish they had dedicated a little more to the game overall, as the storyline can be finished rather quickly. A character round mid-game says something that seemed to imply a much more exciting final puzzle, but when it came time to solve it, it fell a bit short. I wasn't hoping for anything grandiose, considering the games age and original platform, but something a little better than what was there definitely wouldn't have hurt. Don't get me wrong here, the overall story is pretty interesting and definitely enjoyable, I just wish there was a bit more playtime involved in reaching the end of it.The only real thing I can think of that was a for-sure negative in this game is that there are a few spelling/grammar mistakes here and there, but they aren't overly noticeable, or terribly commonplace, so I can forgive it.Overall, a very good game, easy controls, not too difficult and thus very enjoyable for people looking for a more relaxed/casual platformer (though it can get intense at times, it's nothing too bad). Wish it had more gameplay between start and finish, but a good and fairly inexpensive game nonetheless			",74,48,0,13,13,2,5

												The Good: Challenging platforming/puzzle combo, uniquely uses both the keyboard and mouse, some novel level ideasThe Bad: Floaty physics, no upgraded visuals, gets repetitive about 3 levels in, doesn't get better until the end, paper thin storyYou are Nyx who is a winged goddess that falls in love with Icarus, but the sun-god Helios releases rage upon the Gods and burns the Earth into a fiery apocalypse, but you insist on defying the Gods to save Icarus. While the story isn't very deep there is one there and you do want to see what happens to Icarus at the end. Not very often will you run into ""cut scenes"" that have just some text across the screen and gibberish being spoken. This is an indie game after all so you are probably coming for the unique game play.While originally designed for the Wii it works well on a mouse and keyboard. You control Nyx's power with your mouse and her with the keyboard. You can jump up to five times and also glide for about 8 seconds and these are key to game play. Jumping around is the main part of the game and you must time everything carefully. The game is not a breeze and even the platforming is tricky thanks to the game making you multi-task. With the mouse you can move certain blocks around, shoot lightning, move fireballs, and pull around pillars. There is a lot to the game play so you have to really play it to understand how deep it is. You have to be able to move Nyx around while also manipulating the environment with the mouse or you will never get anywhere.While the unique combo works well it does get very difficult at points. The first couple of levels are novel and neat, but then the game quickly feels repetitive and tiresome until you start learning new powers later on in the game. While the game play is unique and deep it's really the same thing over and over again. Jump around 50 platforms and move this block or pillar around. Each level looks the same, and the art style has a Greek mythology theme to it, but the textures are flat and no visual upgrades were given for the PC version. I also felt the physics were a little floaty because everything moved like there was little gravity.The checkpoints are a little unfair because they are put at weird spots. Instead of sticking them right before a really hard section you have to go through an easy section to get back to where you died. There are also only a couple of boss fights and they are fairly easy due to the better accuracy of a mouse over the Wiimote. Overall NyxQuest is a fun little indie game that really challenges your multi-tasking skills.~Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												NyxQuest is a graceful little platformer with exceptionally tight control, a unique and detailed aesthetic, and a wondrous little score that not only surprised me, it delighted me almost the entire way through.  The platforming with flying and floating controls combined with using the mouse to move various objects in the environment  just feels fantastic. The level designs and puzzles are cleverly built around all the skills at your disposal, and the game's pacing is such that it builds upon previous challenges while it doles out new mechanics and powers for you to play around with very quickly. The only real sticking point is the stage entitled ""Field of Argos"" which may drive you up the wall in frustration with its somewhat unfair randomness, but perseverence and quick reflexes should see you through with enough practice.For the quality of game you're getting here and the price point, you absolutely can't go wrong with NyxQuest.

A large part of the hours I logged on this game is from leaving it on all night and resuming in the morning. Also I forgot to save and exited half way through the game, and I had to start over. The exit menu is a little tricky stating ""Do you really want to abandon Icuras/Quest"" (i forget which Ic or Qu). But if you choose yes it actually does save.			",245,34,3,53,13,1,25

												Very good game..  short and sweet. Not much of a story, but quite atmospheric with good music. Puzzles aren't too difficult and the game wasn't too challenging (may be a good or bad thing depending on what you prefer). Good game physics. Visuals are very ""spartan"" :) Good game overall, definitely worth it. I got it on sale, so got more than my money's worth.			",334,197,7,43,30,0,81

												Very unique platformer.  A bit short (about 4 hours to beat once without doing time trials), but very pleasant; I'm surprised this game isn't more popular.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun puzzle platformer, it reminds me of Trine but with only one character.			",459,92,11,61,21,2,105

												This game is definately one of my favorite indie-games.If you like solving puzzles, go get it. Great physics, superb soundtrack and extraordinary gameplay that you wont find in any other game.			",2312,838,105,247,316,37,393
