												Orcs Must Die! 2 is the follow up to Orcs Must Die 1, and is a third person tower defence game, developed by Robot Entertainment.  The game was released on PC July 2012. The main difference with Orcs Must Die 2 is the addition of co-op gameplay. Everything else is virtually the same. You play either as a War Mage or sorceress in the story mode. You have to defend at one or more rifts which open at the start of the level. Each level has a varying amount of waves of enemies continuously spawning in order to reach said rift. Your aim is to stop them by building traps whilst also using your own character to kill them as well. Before each level you choose your load out of traps that you want to use. You start out by only being able to take 4 or 5, but work your way up to being able to take 10 traps on a stage with you.  Before jumping into each level too, you can upgrade your traps to do more damage, have a lower cool down time, or some other ability such as slowing the enemy if they are hit by it for example.  You'll notice from the very beginning that there are a few traps that you'll always want to take with you, such as the slowing trap - but included in your loadout, is your characters weapon, so you have to choose carefully. You are given an infinite amount of time to build your traps at the start of each level, and you are also given a healthy amount of time between waves to allow you to build more. You are granted extra coins after each wave, and for killing enemies, and you use these coins to purchase more traps. Whilst you can also place traps when enemies are spawning, this isn't always a good idea as your main focus should be on killing enemies then.  A large portion of this game is actually you spamming your left mouse button using your main weapon, whilst you aren't able to destroy everything with this weapon; it is more used as filler for your time as most of the damage will come from the traps.  There is a huge variety of traps as well, and you probably won't even use them all even by the end of the game, leaving you plenty of chances to experiment. The graphics in Orcs Must Die 2 are really nice. They are in the cartoon style that many of us really enjoy, but they aren't so childish that they can't portray the maturity of the title. There are some really nice special effects, such as the lava and ice traps, they all look marvellous. Everything is perfectly animated too, whilst a lot of the enemies are copy/pasted, that is to be expected from a game of this type.Orcs Must Die 2 has a very catchy sound track too; the song is played constantly and it will be driven into your head and you'll be whistling it without realising it. Other than the soundtrack, the rest of the game's audio is brilliant too. The game is narrated in the cut scenes by the male character; it would have been nice to get voice acting on the female though. This game has varying levels of difficulty, the regular easy, medium and hard mode. You only unlock hard mode after you have beaten the game. There is one other form of difficulty, and that is endless mode. This will pit you against an endless stream of enemies, meaning you have to constantly upgrade your traps and the enemies will not stop until they either kill you or destroy your rift. This mode will really test your metal but is extremely fun to play in. Most players should really be playing this game on the Medium skill level, the easy mode is too easy and will not really offer any challenge to any tower defence veteran. All of the levels in Orcs Must Die 2 are so well designed; I cannot find any faults with them at all. The early stages of the game are a tutorial stage really, allowing you to test out your traps to work out how they are best used, so the levels are pretty simple, but once you reach the end levels, you'll really be putting your trap building skills to the test, as you have to defend multiple rifts from multiple entry points of enemies. Some of the bigger levels offer a bit of support in getting around quickly in the form of teleporters, these will teleport you to the other side of the map once stepping in them. I have been playing Orcs Must Die 2 for almost thirty hours, this is because there is absolutely tons of content in this game, not only is the single player story mode eight hours of gameplay, you also have the added replay ability of playing the story again as the other hero (with different skills and abilities), and then you also can replay the whole game again on co-op which adds a whole another level of content as the enemies are all scaled up to match you and your friend - and finally, we have the endless mode, this is the part of the game that I have spent the majority of my time and I am absolutely hooked on it. As you play the story mode, once you reach the final waves of a level, you'll often feel like you wish you could carry on and see how far you get, you can do that in endless mode; you just keep building traps, and facing more and more enemies as they just keep coming. This mode alone has given me about fifteen hours of gameplay. Orcs Must Die 2 can be played on all resolutions. I played on 4k with everything on max settings and was able to get 60 FPS constantly. I did however have a few crashes, this mainly happened when you minimize the game too many times, and it gives you a message something regarding DirectX. Although this was annoying, I only had it when minimizing and not whilst in the midst of gameplay. The game can be played with a controller, but as it has elements of aiming with a crosshairs, the game is highly recommended to be played with a keyboard/mouse - it just works so much better on them. This game is an absolute must play for any tower defence fan, if you had any sort of enjoyment out of the first, you'll get more of the same out of this, and the added edition of co-op makes it even more appealing to a wider audience. Not to mention the hours and hours of content on offer in this game. The regular price tag of Â£10, 99 is fairly marked and should be considered a must play for me.

Fast-paced & addictive // Recommended for a killer co-op team+ Co-operative play is available, a feature that adds tremendously to the experience+ Plentiful available upgrades; can make a hefty difference in play-style+ Massive variety of usable, upgradeable traps; adds a lot of depth to the game+ Myriad weapons and trinkets; used to customize loadout before combat+ Includes an 'endless mode;' basically a wave feature, though it works so well with the game that it adds significantly to its replayability+ Well-planned traps can net some very satisfying combo-kills; results in many memorable moments+ Range markers make it easy to coordinate kill zones and trap combinations+ Movement and shooting mechanics are simple and polished+ Visuals, though unimpressive graphically, complement art design adequately+ Campy voice-acting and audio design (though certainly not my cup of tea, personally) admittedly add to the game's theme and atmosphere- Plot is barebones, and little is done to reinforce or advance it; seems intentionally placed on the back-burner, so this observation may ultimately have little weight on the player's experience- No automatic match-making for co-op- Only 2 playable charactersLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												A coop sequel, this game takes the first and ramps it up.  Some of the traps you used to love suck now, as they've actually been balanced to not be god-tier.  (I'm looking at you swinging mace a.k.a. roof pendulum of win.)  Each character gets their own unique trap and weapon, but beyond that they have the same access to traps, weapons, and spells.  It's a funny and fun tower defense game with a lot of shooter elements that allow you to solve missions in a number of ways, with some great survival challenge maps to have a blast with.  Best experienced coop, but still enjoyable single player.			",164,21,0,36,34,1,38

												With its fast-paced multiplayer, completely redesigned spellbook, and extensive replayability, I'd say if you enjoyed the original Orcs Must Die! then I'd highly recommend Orcs Must Die! 2. However, OMD2 is shorter than OMD in terms of the campaign and only seems to expand on the original rather than offer a new innovative experience for tower defense fans.There's nothing wrong with the design of the levels or the gameplay in and of themselves. It's just that OMD!2 feels more like a sizeable update complete with co-op integration. It is a good game, though, which manages to live up to its predecessor. Soloing veterans of that game should think very hard if the amendments are enough to buy this sequel at launch.The absence of new levels, no in-game editor, and too close a resemblance with the original title make Orcs Must Die! 2 look more like an expansion pack than a fulfilling sequel.However it's still a thoroughly enjoyable experience that will charm newcomers as well as veterans of the first game.

												I was a big fan of the original Orcs Must Die, mixing the Shooter genre with Tower defense in a perfect way. so i was very excited for the sequel. and this game does not disappoint while it improves over the original in every way. expanding the traps and weapons selection. You get Story Mode, Endless Mode, and 10 Classic maps from the first game. a weekly challenge, I have played over 70 hours of this game, solo and co-op, and I feel I have a pretty good feel of it. I've also purchased and enjoyed both DLC packs which each introduced 3 new maps and new monsters. + Great mix between a Shooter and Tower Defense genres.+ improves over the original in every way+ lots of replay value+ Co-Op is so much fun mighty addictive and highly recommended.

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is a Tower Defense game, where you play as the Sorceress or the Warmage defending the Rifts from relentless waves of Orcs, Trolls and other uglies by setting up traps.Both heroes have different playstyles, while the huge variety of unlockable traps, upgrades, weapons and perks offer plenty of room of experimenting and finding your unique strategy.PROS:- Tons of unlockables: weapons, traps, accessories, costumes etc.- The CO-OP gameplay is a lot of fun.- Lot's of variations and solutions for all maps. You can find the tactic that suits you most, thanks to the large arsenal at your disposal.CONS:- It's highly recommended to play in CO-OP. Playing alone isn't that much fun.- Only 2 player CO-OP.TLDR:- Do you like Tower Defense games? Do you like CO-OP action? If you do, then Orcs Must Die! is a must-buy!			",608,144,15,60,34,7,68

The game does not take itself too seriously, offers casual and serious gameplay at different difficulties, and gives players of all skill levels a run for their money.This is an absolute must-have for any avid gamer.

												After the great fun I had with the first one, I was really excited to play Orcs Must Die 2 but was disappointed by the gameplay. The levels are clearly designed for two players so (for me at least) they are not fun in single-player. The problem is not necessarily that they are difficult, but it is simply tedious to constantly run around the map trying to cover all directions. This is further aggravated by the lack of local co-op and any public matchmaking. I heartily recommend getting the first one if you have not played it. Get this one only if you have a friend that owns it and is willing to play.			",135,50,3,15,10,0,30

												If you aren't going to play this game Co-Op with a friend, don't bother with this game. Orcs Must Die! was a great game and could be played alone. When you play Orcs Must Die! 2 alone, you notice something almost immediately; the design of the new levels is clearly built for Co-Op action with a friend. The early levels are easy regardless, and there are some fun new mechanics that you can play with (funneling the orcs along minecart paths) which is a nice change from the first game, where you just look for the best place to place your Swinging Maces. Sadly, once you get about midway through the game some of the interesting levels seem to have already passed. Most of the time through barricades or planning you could get 3 or 4 doors worth of orcs to run through one setup of traps, which is about what was needed to clear the levels on War Mage difficulty. Sadly, about midway through OMD!2, it seems someone decided to make a whole pile of symmetrical levels in which there is no common area to filter all of the orcs through. Fair enough, it must still be possible to do it alone right?If you've played the first game, you can picture what I am going to describe now: Imagine a 6 square wide path. There is only a buildable wall on one side. The other side of the path has a few blocks of lava, which cannot be used because if you try to throw them into it they just fly clear of the lava river onto the symmetrical path on the other side (past the point where your traps would be). There is a small section with a ceiling on which to build ceiling traps but Swinging Mace now basically does no damage and just throws the orcs away from your other traps. If you spend all of your money on one side of the level, you might get lucky with a setup that can stop the first 2 waves using all of the right traps in the limited possible building areas, but what do you do on the other side? Fight the whole waves yourself with no trap assistance? Goodluck, it works for a few levels and then you just get completely overwhelmed, You never end up with enough money to defend both sides, and you need to spend what you get to build up your untrapped side, and the original side that you built to start is leaking orcs (a lot of them) every level.There are a few levels like this in a row probably about 75% of the way through the game. You clearly need 2 players, so each can play their own separate game on their own side of the level. How is that fun?The first game was great. This one, not so much. I've had enough.

												I enjoyed the first Orcs Must Die! and I enjoyed this one too. I would strongly recommend this game to just about anyone. Even if you're a bit unsure about getting Orcs Must Die!, you should definitely try Orcs Must Die! 2. It fixes many of the cons of the original game, so here's a list of pros and cons.PROS-Great and easy to learn gameplay.-Two unique characters with arsenals varying enough to effect gameplay while not have too much difference between them.-Improved graphics from the original game.-Funny dialogue and commentary that serves both the entertainment value of the game and the story aspects of the game (which is surprisingly satisfying given how little there actually is).-Unlike its predecessor, there's multiplayer (albeit only dual multiplayer). And, even better, it makes sense in the story's context.-Tweaks the traps and weapons from the original game to balance them more.-Has great DLC that you should definitely try out.-Much more dynamic currency system (concerning the skulls) than the original game.-Keeps the Nightmare difficulty and adds the new Endless levels.-Expands the player's equipment to include trinkets and cosmetics.CONS-Multiplayer is limited to two people. Not a con for me personally, but it might be for some.-Tweaks the traps and weapons from the original game. Again, not a con for me personally, but I have heard some complaints concerning some of the changes.-DLC costs money. Depending on who you are, this might be a con. I personally didn't mind. The DLC was great.So, yeah, that's it. Not much do I have to complain about, and though I am sure other pros and cons exist, I can't think of them off the top of my head. Regardless, though, I highly recommend trying out this game. Odds are, it'll be a blast.			",87,49,0,11,11,1,13

												Updated review:Orcs Must Die 2! is a 3rd person game that involves the many slaying of orcs, while either working with a friend or just by yourself along with the aid of the many traps and weapons this game provides.The levels are unique in every way possible some levels are small and simple while others are huge in terms of how many entry points and also how many different routes the orcs must take.This game also supports Mods however there is this bug that makes the game null and void so if you try to play it once after hours and hours of using a modded version of the game, sadly all of that will be gone in an instant. I think there is a fix  for it but i wouldn't risk it.The modes that are offered in this game is nothing but plain super awesome, you will lose hours and hours playing with game with either a friend or by yourself.I recommend such a game if you like killing orcs and seeing orcs getting killed by traps or by the hands of your co-op partner and you.

												Definitely got my money's worth out of this one. Some of the levels were a bit too chaotic for my taste, as I prefer more tightly-controlled mob paths. And I'd prefer if the game didn't scale monster stats with each successive wave in the late waves.Apart from that, though, I had a blast with it. Some really good meat-grinder levels to min-max. Some interesting tactical choices to make. And some levels had me daydreaming about new layouts and tools to try ""next time.""Worth a buy!			",63,14,0,18,27,0,19

ORC MUST DIE! 2 A ReviewINTROOrc Must Die! 2 developed and published by Robot Entertainment[www.robotentertainment.com] is a continuation for the original Orc Must Die which includes the original cast but is now expanded with more maps, more items/weapons, and above all MORE ORCS to kill.Anyways this is a tower defense game with the difference is that you are on the ground with weapons to fight off the orcs as well so its a hybrid of third person tower defense action game. A mouthful I know but it actually works! And its fun with friends as well since it has coop now! So lets get this review typing.GameplayMake Character>Choose Map>Choose Difficulty>Choose Loadout>KIll Orcs>Win [or not]>Buy Upgrades>RepeatOrc Must Die 2 happens to feature a narrative like the first one in the form of you getting more story context by finishing a level and unlocking the next one with a cutscene playing at certain point. Also in game dialogue between the two character serves as a story context.Anyways, first you choose to either play as the male Warmage with more HP but less mana or the female Sorceress with more mana but less HP. Loadouts also differs slightly between the two with the Warmage having access to melee weapons along with shotgun while the Sorceress is more spell based with more staff and so on but the towers are mostly shared.Once thats over you can then proceed to choose your map, difficulty and play either solo or coop. Maps for the main campaign are unlocked by clearing the ones before it and clearing it also unlock more tower type and more loadout slots.Once in game you can then choose between a lot of weapons and towers provided you have unlocked them already. Initially you only have 3 slots but more are given as you clear map and the slots are shared between accesories. weapons, guardians, and traps so its prudent to choose wisely for the enemy type you will be facing which is indicated on the loadout screen.You have a limited funds at start to build your first few traps with more funds gained from killing Orcs, collecting coins, and achieving combos by killing several orcs at once or quickly. Traps ranges from the typical spike and arrow trap to the much cooler acid and ice traps but there are lot more kind with some serving a more utilitarian functions. Orcs spawn from predefine points on the map and they will charge straight at the limited life teleporter that you must defend. The path they take can be influence by putting traps that block their path although if the map have several brancing paths or there are two teleporter at once they will split up. Initially only 1 spawn point will be active but by the 4th wave usually all are actively pouring in. There are a lot of types of orcs from the typical grunt all the way to elemental monster that can split up to 3 times. Also flying enemies are also present with some weapons and traps can not be use against them and they will ignore all blockade that you made.Once you placed the traps and start the round it will continue until all orcs are dead which will give you a  10 second breather to sell/build more towers but while you can build during an attack you can only sell during these grace period in between rounds. At the middle point and right before the final round the game will give you an indefinite break until you trigger the wave yourself but the timer that affects your ranking still runs so its imperative to build/sell/break quickly and resume.Alright provided you won all the round you will then win the game and be presented with  a stat screen showing how well you did then everything is tally up and Skulls which are currencies are then dole out to you to spend. The main factor I see that affects is how fast you finish a map, letting no orc get to the teleporter, and not dying.Skulls can be use at the shops to unlock more weapons or upgrade an existing ones to be better. Same goes for traps and guardians and the good thing is that you can reset your build at any time you want at no cost whatsoever and its actually quite common to jump into a new map only to restart it because the build you have are not up to the task.Then rinse and repeat until you beat every single one of your friend's score.GraphicsOrc Must Die 2 uses a cartoony style approach to represent their game and it works well with the goofyness that the orc has [along with the idiocy of the Warmage]. Funnily enough if you turn on gib mode to high they will literally explode into chunks of meat when they die.SoundI suppose the sound are acceptable for all the weapon/spells and trap effect although the voice acting is pretty stellar for the orcs, guardians, and player character. A shame for hard hearing people though as explain below.Option Menu and ControlRebindable keys check, resolution anti-alias vsync windowed mode check although graphics setting are limited to high and low with no advance option. All the usual audio stuff check along with some gameplay options. No disability options though.Runs smoothly and if you ever need this for some reason it runs at  60 fps.So what is the issue? The dialogue options is only for the cutscene not for when the character talks in-game or quip something when they perform an action and such. That means you can barely hear it if you have hearing isssue.As for controls I used the keyboard and it is solid, no issues there.ConclusionOrc Must Die! 2 is a solid action tower defense game that does a humorous spin on the classic formula, abundant of maps, nice enemy selection, and a great amount of traps and weapons are sure to entertain you. It gets even better when you play coop. Overall an excellent game in its category. A F***KING SHAME THE SEQUEL IS A MOBA.Scoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank - Awarded for giving out many fun time in its category.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No drama, Just Reviews ",369,114,11,51,52,1,74

Very nice game!Similar to their first game, you control as one of 2 characters, laying traps and fighting orcs to defend your base. The 2 characters have very little but noticable difference in starting setup.All the traps and weapons have different effect and usage, and there are many ways of completing each stages using different approach. You can invest heavily on weapons and trinkets so you can kill the orcs yourself, or you can spend your upgrades on traps and let them do the job for you.Coop WILL make a lot of stages so much easier because you will have 2 more extra total slots to start with (6 slots each instead of 10 slots solo), double the attention from players, and double the amount of upgrades you can use! Even the hardest game mode is a piece of cake if both players have enough skulls to upgrade their traps.You can refund your upgrades infinitely, so you can plan your upgrades every wave. I only wish that the upgrades can be done BEFORE the stage start instead of after the stage end.The story/plot is unimportant nor adds any value to the gameplay, but it has some funny conversation on the beginning of every stages. This makes me look forward to starting the next stage on my first playthrough.To complete 100% achievement, you will need 2 things: the first game Orcs Must Die (for the Classic mode DLC), and a coop buddy. If you meet the requirement, all the achievements are quite doable.One thing I'd like this game to have is a way to save progress on co-op game. My personal experience, the game crashed on me on wave 39 of the endless mode coop, wasted almost 90 minutes of our time. Another time, my friend got disconnected from the internet for about 30 seconds and we lost 42 waves of endless mode time. Because of this, we don't really play endless mode online anymore because of the fear for the risk.My score: 9/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												Maybe you won't play it 4ever, but it has a lot potential to be fun for a long time. The fact is, Orcs Must Die! 2 is more or less a pretty great game, because Fun tower defense gameplay with some third-person-shooting, jumping and and neat magic tricks. Co-Op for 2 players - extra fun. Story-Mode (quite okay), Endless-Survival Mode, Classic-Levels (Orcs Must Die! Part 1), other good stuff. Different approaches and efficent tactics to every map and trap/trinket set-up Fun physics that make orc say and scream funny things (for laughs)Tbh, this game has absolutely no downsides. Everything plays out at least okay. Also better than the first part,  because Co-Op. Not an epic masterpiece, but an instant classic. Go for it. ",232,56,3,27,18,1,35

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defense type game in which you play one of two characters (male/female) in order to top the Orcish hoard from getting to their destination (of which there are sometimes multiple points to protect.)  To assist you there are numerous upgrades for your character, minions, and traps that are unlocked as you progress.  You get an action bar where you can put a set number of these things and then start the level.  Using some of these things (like minions and traps) costs coins.  Coins are independent of each level (they don't carry over so don't be shy about spending them.)  You get more as the level progresses and there are other items you can unlock that increase coin drops.  For me, survival mode was the most fun.  Still haven't made it to wave 30 of any level yet though (it's hard!)  Essentially it's progressively harder and harder waves until you're finally overwhelmed (or make it to that legendary 30th level.)  The fun factor is through the roof on this one and I highly recommend picking it up!			",118,31,2,17,13,0,7

 Overview  Orcs Must Die! 2 is a tower defense game in which you must construct traps to defeat an ever-increasing wave of orcs and their minions. The game can be played in single player or two person co-op. For those familiar with the formula, the game follows the standard idea of building defenses, weaving the path that the enemy must follow and defeat them before they reach the exit. The game itself is set in a 3rd person view, allowing the player to control one of two characters that you may use to fight along-side your traps. During setup, the player may choose from a variety of traps: spike traps, arrow traps, teleporters, acid traps, barricades, guardians (AI), character weapons and trinkets for passive and active buffs. There is a healthy amount of customization what you can bring, making level design easily tailored to your play style and choice.During the matches, the goal is simple: Do not let the orcs, or their minions, past the rift (exit). Each level has a set amount of waves, enemy types and number of rift points (essentially lives) that can be expended before you lose the round. Depending on your success, the player(s) can earn bonus points in the form of skulls. These skulls can be used to upgrade your weapons, trinkets and most importantly, your traps, adding active and passive abilities and increased damage.The game has several different game modes, including story mode, several smaller DLC levels, a weekly custom mode and an Endless Mode, which, as you'd have guessed, goes until you lose or quit the level. Aside from different game modes, Orcs Must Die! 2 has three difficulties: Apprentice (Easy), War Mage (Normal) and Nightmare (Hard). As someone who has played very few tower defense games, War Mage is a nice middle ground for those just learning the game or the genre.  The game will probably provide anywhere from 20-30 hours of continuous gameplay, more so if you explore the different modes and difficulties that it has to offer. Orcs Must Die! 2 is enjoyable, yet challenging. It blends old features with new content very well. if you're a fan of tower defense games, then I think you'll enjoy Orcs Must Die! 2.  Pros   Interesting enemy types and level design. Character artwork and overall visual effects are very well done. The customization of your arsenal is fleshed out and provides a lot of variety in your build. Voice acting - While there is minimal, what is there is cute. I enjoyed the back and forth between the characters. Replayability - With the weekly challenge and the Endless Mode, the game offers a nice bit of replayability for fun, or to challenge yourself after you've finished the story.  No broken achievements - They are all obtainable.  Co-Op - the game shines if you have a partner to play with. Cons    Story - It's there, sort of, but it isn't really fleshed out aside from a bit of dialogue and a cutscene here and there.  Orc Mages - Their ranged attack can, at times, feel a little cheap (they home in on your character...a lot...)Overall, Orcs Must Die! 2 is downright fun. It's a challenge without being irritating and a ton of fun if you're able to play co-op. It's a great installment to the series and feels improved in every fashion. Check it out. I completely recommend it!			",640,213,19,74,88,12,80

												-This game ts like Dungeon Defenders and is a sequal to orcs must die -This game has the same placing system as orcs must die which is the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors). -This game actually has co-op but does not have matchmaking so inviting people is a must when trying to play co-op-You can upgrade you items using skulls that can be recived during and after a map/game-Skulls can also be recived by replaying a map-Controls can be remapped---My Rating---8.5/10 -would recommend to my friends			",79,7,1,7,3,0,4

Sometimes when your playing you hear a charater saying something about a weapon or trap, most of the time something funny. I really like this game, funny and easy gameplay.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Orcs Must Die! 2 Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Action; Coop; Strategy; RPG; Casual   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWOrcs Must Die! 2 is an amazing take on a tower defense/3rd-person action combo. Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.Orcs Must Die! 2 does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the gameâ¦ and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. Itâs definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours. There is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.There is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.Orcs Must Die! 2 is a step forward from the already amazing first game.  All the good aspects return, with some new ideas sprinkled in. There are many more traps and abilities, and a more extensive upgrade system.  There are many new enemies.  Thereâs a new extensive campaign, new game modes (like endless mode), and with the Steam Workshop there are now limitless possibilities for maps.  Also the addition of cooperative mode makes the experience exponentially more fun if you have a friend to play with.  I would say practically everyone should enjoy the Orcs Must Die! games.  Many hours of fun to be had with the games in this series, I recommend playing both.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

In Orcs Must Die! 2 (OMD!2), the player must set traps and other tools to defeat waves of orc minions, as well as fend them off with various weapons and trinkets; it is a castle defense title that could possibly be described under multiple other categories given its abundance of firearms, skills, traps, and melee weapons. Of the many castle defense-type games I have played throughout the years, however, OMD!2 has to be my absolute favorite. It is extremely difficult for me to choose the components of this game I believe to be the most outstanding because it is just so enjoyable and well produced. With varying modes of play, said orcs must be deterred from reaching a Rift in either a solo trial or in two-player multiplayer mayhem; combined with a heart-pounding soundtrack of heavy metal Rifts (pun intended) mixed with more traditional themes, blasting away orcs has never been more entertaining! (This previous statement derives from an upcoming Ork player in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game.)Here are just a few reasons I still enjoy every second of Orcs Must Die! 2:Main Protagonists - When beginning OMD!2, the player has the option of selecting between two characters: an imbecile unnamed War Mage turned Miner who fans of the first game hail as the gameâs protagonist and a seductress Sorceress who acted as the prior titleâs antagonist. Obviously, these two characters-one being new to the âgood guy clique-differ in both stature and basic weaponry, but playing as each of these individuals reveals another mark of comparison: their unlockable traps, weapons, minions, and skills are unique. For instance, the War Mage begins the game with a scattershot blunderbuss, tar traps that slow enemy minions, and a device to be placed on the wall that fires multiple arrows at crossing enemies; later in the game he can place panels that fling enemies (""These orcs must fly!"" -Neosho and myself), and other damaging traps. On the other hand, the Sorceress starts with a projectile launching staff that has the ability to convert orc forces into allies for a limited time, ice vents which freeze hostiles, and acid-spraying wall machines.Humor - Though mostly from the War Mage than the Sorceress, the dialogue is very enjoyable. Whether a quip from the former villain to the witless hero or a pun directed after a combination kill by the player, each line may at least provoke a snicker from the player. There are also a few cinematic victory dances that may occur after a stage is completed, which is silly enough to be one of my favorite end-of-level treats out of any game.Gameplay - As described previously, the player deters waves of antagonistic orc brutes using a variety of set traps, weapons, trinkets, and-if available-a partner. There is a loadout system implemented to where the player can only select a given number of traps at a specific point in the story; however, this âtrapacityâ (do you see now why I am not permitted to make jokes? It should be court-ordered!) increases as the player progresses through the main campaign, and causes the player to select carefully before engaging the enemy. Each item retains its own unique upgrades, which allows players to partially dictate how they want to play. The usual shooter control layout is utilized (e.g. W, A, S, and D to maneuver, Space Bar to jump, LMB to use the equipped toolâs primary action) but there is no weapon zoom unless you are using the Steam Workshop modification for it; instead, the RMB functions your equipmentâs secondary fire button, which-as an example when using the blunderbuss-fires a ball of energy that explodes on impact to damage and scatter hostiles.Skull Currency System - As explained prior, the player has the option of purchasing upgrades to their existing items; additional equipment that can be purchased include character skins and new weapons and trinkets. Though the described system of âplay your wayâ intrigues me, how you obtain the in-game currency is even more interesting. OMD!2 utilizes Skulls as a spendable asset, and are either dropped as a mark of achievement for scoring a high combination kill or for mastering a certain campaign levelâs par, such as completing it within a given amount of time or not allowing any orcs into the Rift. This system is based more on performance than anything, which drives the player to achieve more advanced level scores and objectives for a more desirable Skull payout. It also entices players to attempt new trap and weapon combinations to try and best their previous scores.Overall Feel - Whether orcs are flying due to a well-placed spring trap or are blown meters back by an enhanced blunderbuss blast, OMD!2 melds the player together with an overwhelming sensation of hectic bliss. It is a purely indescribable impression that can be felt while playing either with a friend of solo. I honestly cannot exactly pinpoint single thing that makes this game as good as it is a cohesive punctuation of elements involving the thrill of every lightning bolt strike, every orc cartoonishly erupting in flames, every upgrade purchased; the game just feels right.TL:DR - There is not much I can truly say against this game. I have an immense amount of fun whenever I play Orcs Must Die! 2, as it a truly unique gaming experience. From my perspective, players take the role of a comedic, naive sorcerer or sensible sorceress while attempting to prevent many orcs from reaching a rift using their upgradable weapons, equipment, and traps. I must admit that this game would be better to play with friends, but is just fine as a single-player experience. Have fun with this awesome game. Also, I will happily play cooperatively with anyone wishing to do so. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			",223,50,2,28,18,2,28

												Orcs Must Die 1 was a great game. I had so much fun with it, I love tower defense games, and this game just made tower defense funner, more intimate, and funnier. I had thought that Orcs Must Die 2 couldn't improve on the first game, all they could really do is add more traps and maps. But then, wham, MULTIPLAYER! Now I could share my joy of endlessly building crazy trap rooms with complimenting traps. I love to just zone out and set it to endless mode. Nothing funnier and more satisfying than for a horde of unwitting boobs to slog through a room of whirling, flaming, death that my teammate has created, only to be flung ragdoll right back into it. I love this game. Right now, this game is only $3.99 on steam. How the hell can you turn that down?			",80,3,1,10,6,0,4

 Orcs? More like dorks!	Orcs Must Die! 2 is a pretty cool Third Person Tower Defense game where you take control as either the War Mage or the Sorceress. It's higly recommended that you play it with a friend, but you can also play it alone ofcourse. Pros	-Various traps and weapons-Weak, strong and annoying enemies to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over-Gets more challenging the longer you get-Some may say that the grafics are kinda bad, but I actually like it Cons	-The pathing doesn't always work properly with barricades 8/10Great game	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. Mixing defence, strategy and skill, this third person game simply blew me away. You can play with family, friends and/or by yourself. This game is worth the money, the time and effort I and others put into it.I would 100% recomend this game to anyone that loves fantasy and games in general.			",17,1,0,3,0,0,0

												Orcs Must Die 2 continues right where 1 left off. The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.To start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.Gameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.Amazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.I'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.Endless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.If you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

Personal rating: 9/10DLC: Adds a lot to the game without putting any game breaking stuff. Complete Pack is very worth it.About Orcs Must Die! 2:It is a fast paced, tower defense game which requires you to be crafty and resourceful from the beginning until the end. But unlike most common defense tower games you actively participate in the battle, you are main defense, your towers, or rather traps, will hinder, soften or thin out the horde, but you'll still have a lot of heavy lifting to do by yourself.About the gameplayOrcs Must Die! 2 is more refined than its predecessor, it fixes little tweaks that were very annoying in the first game and balances weapons that back then felt a little too powerful and buffs weapons that were otherwise almost useless or felt too weak to be of proper use.There's a lot of variation in your towers, or rather, traps. You can out them on the ground, walls and ceiling and some traps requires certain strategies to work well. Obviously there are traps that works better with others, but nothing is truly impossible to combine, you create your own set of traps to watch enemies get brutally pierced/crushed/burnt/frozen/stripped to the bones.The game makes sure to bring new foes and tricks to ensure that you will always try something new, something you hadn't thought before or to show that your old tactics will eventually stop working. Improvements over the first gameOrcs Must Die! 2 fixes a lot of little things that were annoying in the first game some are noticeable such as clunky physics with Wind Belt, other are more subtle like not being able to place Boom Barrels too close to enemies and removing fall damage which was completely needless.Another big change was the improvements over control customization and options overall which was seriously lacking in the first Orcs Must Die!All in all once you play the first game you'll realize how the differences can affect in your game style.How difficulty is it?Orcs Must Die! 2 can be difficult, a bit overwhelming at first, but you will rarely feel that the game was unfair, that it did something ridiculous that you couldn't counter before it happened. It is a rewarding experience and you will feel great whenever you pull a maximum rank victory, especially on Nightmare (I'll talk about it in a moment).The game was tailored for co-op action and after the first stage you'll be facing two enemy spawn points to defend and it can feel unfair, especially in the beginning when you barely have anything to deal with them, it can be difficult but it's still manageable.While not something I truly appreciate, you'll have to go back to certain levels when you have better equipment to ace it (5 skull). Sure, you can start playing from the get go with a friend, but damn if it doesn't make you feel like a complete pro player when you get that maximum rank victory in a difficult map all by yourself.Nightmare?The Nightmare difficulty, unlocked by finishing the game once, is far from being a numerical difficulty where the game merely ups enemies health or their numbers (something that plagues the games ever since they were made), it ramps up the difficulty to above the roof showing even tougher enemies and giving you puny three seconds to sell traps/units. You'll be forced to rethink your strategies and sometimes change to things you never ever thought before.Bring friend to kill orcs. Have twice as fun.The co-op is just plain fun. Even more enemies to kill with a friend is never enough and being able to share strategies and putting up your traps into synergy is pure glee. If you don't have friends to play with you can always ask for others in the multiplayer groups.Orcs Must Die, sure, but there are few problems...There are two complaints about this great game I have: grinding and character selection.Grinding is bad enough (maximizing traps, accessories and weapons is expensive), but having to do twice because you have to create two separate game files for each character is just increasing the longevity of the game in a bad way, especially since it can take a while to notice the differences between both characters aside from the obvious.Changing characters requires you to return to the main menu screen, which wouldn't be such a hassle if you didn't have to leave the Party you made for multiplayer which can be very annoying.There's also the fact Orcs Must Die! 2 is MUCH shorter than it's predecessor. While the first game has whooping 24 maps in the main campaign, the second game has only 15. Of course with the Classic levels DLC (earned by having the first game) the second game is longer, but I'm was never a big fan of having to rely on DLC to have a game with good length.Final commentariesOrcs Must Die! 2 is an excellent game. It has tons of replay value and is balanced decently for both co-op and solo play. It does feel like it's an ""Orcs Must Die! 1 v2.0"" but with so many new traps, a new character and a good amount of changes, fixes here and there, it's worth every penny.Let us only hope Robot Entertainment will some day make the Orcs Must Die! 3 after they finish up Unchained and let more characters, more traps and, of course, more orcs appear to amp the fun. Maybe even boss battles?			",222,43,3,24,9,0,13

												This is a wave after wave of orc killing madness. There are many ways to kill the orcs and each way seems more pleasing than the next. This is a tower / hero defense game that is very amusing. I would recommend this to kill time or play with friends. It's not my favorite co-op game but it is fun. There's nothing about this game that screams I MUST have, so if you like the previews, the art and just wanna kill orcs, then this is the game to have. Rating: 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Orcs Must Die! 2-Orcs must die 2 takes on the tower defense genre, which to many incuding myself have always ignored and just seen as a 'play for ten seconds then wait around for a wave to go by while you watch your defences do the work.' But considering refunds are now an option I thought heck this game is ranked as 'Overwhelmingly Positive' I may aswell tryi it.  And what a great decision that was.The game is still a tower defense game but with all the fast paced third person shooting, and mindless comedic slaughter of orcs you could ever want. It breaks away from the bog standard tower defense where you feel you are controlling the outcome of the wave rather than the AI controlled defences. One minute you are blastiing down an ogre with your blunderbuss and the next you are trying to quickly decide within the time limit what traps to put down to get the best possible rating. This game is lovingly crafted with a quirky art style incredibly optimized gameplay creating a nicely packed game that suits even the the biggest haters of tower defense.Oh and not only this it comes with an astounding co-op that allows you and a friend to take on the entire campaign together with th difficulty cleverly scailed to the amount of players in a mission. To ensure balanced gameplay among other things.Truly a star studded preformance from Robot Entertainment!9.5/10			",65,6,0,3,6,1,5

												Tower Defence game where u play as a really strong warrior or a mage against a horde of weaklings. The enemies aren't very strong it's only the fact that they have alot of hp that some of them manage to switch through. Cartoony art syle gore and humourous content. The game gets boring really easily but it's not a bad game to grab whilst it's on sale. The dlc is alright. This game tried to be like dungeon defenders but isn't as fun. It's always more fun to play with a friend so if you have a friend who has it play with them. stop the orcs from going through a portal by genocide. You sometimes feel like a lord of the rings character killing Orcs 7.5/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												Orcs must Die 2 is the sequel that fans of the first game (which I also recommend that you play first) were waiting for. It keeps all of the fun aspects of the previous game while adding plenty of new things as well as addressing the criticisms of the original, the largest of which was lack of multiplayer. The game now has full Co-Op, as well as a new character in the form of the Sorceress. The game adds new levels new enemies, and an arsenal of new weapons and traps to massacre the hordes of orcs with, all while keeping the theme of the original, including the FANTASTIC soundtrack. I would say this feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel, but then you also have to take into account that both this game and the original were very cheap in price on release, and both have been on sale countless times since then. A great deal of fun, and if you like the idea of slaughtering huge hordes of orcs with hilarious trap combinations, you NEED to buy this game.			",162,10,0,18,10,0,41

												Yet another game somehow I found myself addicted to.It started off simple - got this as a gift from a friend, was bored didn't have anything else to play. Okay why not - she got me the game may as well try it. I am extremely glad I did because this simple tower defense idea became Orcs Must Die. The gameplay is simple which follows a tower defense sort of idea. Instead of bland towers and a bird's eye view of watching the action, the game puts you as a player in 3rd person view capable of unleashing an array of weapons. Some weapons included are a bazooka and a spear. All weapons have secondary attacks such as turning orcs into stone or unleashing a proximal blast. On top of having a variety of weapons to choose from, the player is also able to deploy a variety of different traps or towers. Deploying defense mechanisms is very simple; it is easy to remove and add defenses almost anywhere on the map. Some of these defenses include arrow walls, tar pits, blocks, giant swinging gates with sharp cone pointing things, floor spikes etc... Basically there isn't a shortage of what to choose from when it comes to beating up the orcs. Defenses and even weapons can be upgraded with the amount of skulls you collect per level. The amount of skulls is dependent on how well you do throughout the level. Visually this game is fine. It doesn't need over the top graphics but provides enough graphic for the atmosphere that is created. Sounds and music is quite reasonable and suitable to the atmosphere. The impact noises that the weapons produce are accurate and hearing the orcs and player go off while in combat is enjoyable to hear. Running is also possible in this game (shift) which makes life and the game all that much more beautiful. You'll realize how much you use it when you play.Overall I'd have to give this game an average RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-although be it so, if this game does appeal to you - you will like it guaranteed and you will have fun playing it like I do. If you have a buddy to play with online as well, it will be even better. This game would have greatly benefitted from local-coop.ScreenShots  My favorite part about this game is the floor traps Over time, you are able to purchase different weapons which have a primary firing setting and an alternate firing setting. The alternate fire for this wand is freezing opponents ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

You shall not pass!Orcs Must Die 2 is a very safe approach to the sequel. The creators decided not to change too much, adding just what clearly lacked in the first one. By the way, they didn't overwork at the making of this game - I don't want to be mean, but it could be called Orcs must die+ or Orcs Must Die: Prepare to Die edition.Now, quite honestly - Orcs Must Die 2 provides a few hours of fun, especially if the first contact with the series. A little worse if you're an experienced player - the game can end very quickly and the changes in the game doesn't seem to me to be big enough to attract longer. Unless you can find a partner for a joint butchering of orcs. Then the long hours of listening to the plaintive moans of beasts storming your dungeon are waiting for you.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												This game is such an unadulterated fun time to game. From the time I saw the trailer for Orcs Must Die! I knew I wanted to play. So, when I saw a humble bundle that included both Orcs Must Die! and Orcs Must Die! 2 I jumped all over thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I really enjoyed the slight twist of the traditional concept of a tower defense game by throwing you in the middle of all the action, it made even that much more visceral, tense and fun.I think the only flaw in this game is that fact there is not match making system in the game despite the fact the game pushes you in some aspects to play with another person. Luckily I have a few friends that have the game so I didn't need to deal with that issue at all, but I do see how it could be annoying for someone looking for someone to play the game since you will have to do it the hard way by checking the forums for people to play with. That in no way makes this game not fun, this is totally worth buying if you love have a fun time.Want to read me saying more positive things about the game? Then have a read about it on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/03/orcs-must-die-2.html.			",101,42,0,14,8,1,15

												I'll start off with saying this is a very hard review for me to write. I'm still not entirely sure whether I like OMD!2 or not.I played through the base OMD!2 campaign with Kataztrophik. Playing games with others always makes for a better experience for me.Unfortunately I found myself getting bored on more than one occasion. The maps all looked pretty much the same, the variance in enemies is limited, and I found the traps to be uninspired and mostly useless.I'm a huge fun of TD games. They can be repetitive. The strategy in a TD game comes from playing towers/traps/units in best places, and finding a balance between upgrading and placing new units. Then there's the diversity. Do I need to deal with fast enemies? Maybe they're cloaked? Those ones are flying. Wait! There's a group that are resistant to a certain damage type! Oh no here comes the boss!!! OMD!2 has none of this. You place a trap and that's it. You can sell it in build phases, but there's no upgrading as the level goes on. Therefore the only option is to spam defences everywhere with your spare cash.The enemies in OMD!2 are very limited. It has some flyers, some high health hard hitting Ogres, some exploding Kobolds, some fast little buggers, Trolls that regenerate health and then the general mob. Even so they all seem pretty much the same. The game just spams you with more and more mobs as the level progresses. You counter it by spamming more and more traps. There's no real strategy. Sure the traps filter out some of the bad guys, but you'll be doing most of the killing with your weapons.This is where the game shines. The action gameplay in combat is pretty good. It's fluid and the weapons are fun to use. However, whilst this is certainly fun it offers nothing ground-breaking or unique. With the lack of variance of the enemy one faces it can also get pretty boring fast.The biggest thing the game seems to lack for me, is bosses. There should be an epic fight against a might orc, the likes of which has never been seen before! There should be a dragon! A dragon would fit into the games style nicely, and there's no reason why there isn't one.Overall OMD!2 is a mildly fun action game, with underwhelming TD elements. It's worth playing through the game with a friend, but there are better options available.Bottom line: Good in short stints with a buddy.			",1314,465,45,230,179,17,254

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! 2 then skip to Results and read from there.Robot Entertainment makes a fantastic addition to their brilliant tower defense game. Orcs Must Die! 2 adds new elements of gameplay to the tower defense genre by mixing FPS, TD, and RPG games.Story:The War Mage has seals the final rift taking magic away from the world, but forever protecting it from the orcs continually onslaught. The world begins to crumble as magic no longer influences the weather i, sickness, and food. People are realizing the harsh world that they inhabit as magic is taken away. The Sorceress no longer has the ability to control the hordes of orcs, as her magic is gone and she has not long to live before they finally dispose of her. But The Master with his last fleeting breath hopes to give the kingdom one last chance opens a rift bringing back The Sorceress. The Master hopes The Sorceress will learn from her mistake and join The War Mage to restore the Order and bring back magic to the world again. Campaign:Orc Must Die! 2 offers two acts, the first consist of seven levels and the second of eight. They start out with each level only being a few waves, and then gradually increasing till you get to the last level which is about twelve waves. Similar to the original you cannot save half way into a level, meaning you need to make sure you have the time available to beat a level before you start it. The game also offers Endless Mode, which includes a variety of levels, some seen in the campaign and others that are unique. Endless mode allows you to obtain skulls (the currency used to buy upgrades) while at the same time getting to practice strategies. The campaign is played similar to the first one where you must place towers to defend rifts from being attacked, but incorporates more RPG elements. If you own Orcs Must Die! the original, you will also be given ten special levels in classic mode. Classic mode essentially is the best parts of the original campaign that can be played co-op and with the new features. This also allows you to earn more skulls and develop your character. Gameplay:Orcs Must Die! 2 allows you to play as one of two characters: The Sorceress and The War Mage. The War Mage has higher health while The Sorceress offers more mana. As such one is focused more around using melee and non-magic weapons and the other is based more on magic and spell-casting. This allows you to change how you will play right from the start of the campaign. Unlike Orcs Must Die! you can no longer upgrade your character with coins through the weavers. Instead you buy trinkets using skulls that offer your character passive abilities, upgrade your towers with skulls and unlock unique abilities for the towers, and upgrade weapons with skulls. Each level allows you to get five skulls, plus any additional bonus skulls you pick up as result of enemy drops. This gameplay is focused much more on RPG style gameplay and beating the campaign on War Mage with 5 skulls for every level is near impossible if you donât grind yourself up in Endless Mode.Multiplayer:Orcs Must Die! 2 offers multiplayer, finally you can play co-op as one player is The Sorceress and the other is The War Mage. I personally never played multiplayer, but its nearly self-explanatory that this adds all new elements to the game. A lot of the levels seem as though they are designed for two players, requiring you to essentially run from one side of the map to the other during waves. Adding multiplayer takes Orcs Must Die! and combines it with Sanctum taking the best from both worlds.  Fire and Water:The first DLC pack for Orcs Must Die! 2. The levels include new levels (Traffic Jammed, Double Decker, and The West Wing), new enemies (Fire and Water Lords), and new traps (Web Spinner, Dart Spitters, and Floor Portal). Double Decker is one of my favorite levels; it is a two pathed level where you get to use minecarts to stop your foes. The new enemies Fire and Water Lords offer all new challenges, if you donât kill them quick enough they evolve. They can evolve two times starting at Firelings and becoming Fire Lords. The Fire Lords are similar to Ogres and have a lot of health while the Firelings are like Orcs. I personally liked the Dart Spitters came in handy on levels where I wanted to concentrate traps, but ran out of space.  Family Ties:This DLC further expands Orc Must Die! 2 offering loads of new content: three new levels, two new weapons, a new trinket, and even some new enemies. The levels include: Rush Hour, Breakneck Triad, and Triple Threat. The new levels are really well designed and can be played easily solo or with a group. One of the new weapons, Stone Staff, was actually my favorite weapon as it allows you to essentially freeze enemies then do increased damage to them. The Hobgoblin Healer is a very good addition and requires you to focus your strategy differently as they can cause a simple attach to be very difficult. The Ball and Chain is essentially just a stronger Ogre. Overall this is a great addition to the game, and the new weapon in my opinion is the best in the game. Are We There Yeti?:This is another exciting DLC pack offered with Orcs Must Die! 2. The pack includes three levels: Yeti Den, The Hive, and Chilled Cavern. These levels introduce new characters (Yeti and Goblin Sapper) and offer a new weapon/trap/trinket. In my opinion these new levels are the hardest ones Iâve played in the Orcs Must Dies series, specifically âYeti Denâ. I played the levels on War Mage and beat them solo, but definitely could not do that on Nightmare. The levels are set up to be played with multiple people and this pack would probably be a lot more entertaining on multiplayer.Results:Orcs Must Die! 2 is a fantastic game that combines RPG, FPS, and TD into one single game. With co-op play you can mess around with your friends and play the maps to a whole new level. Orcs Must Die! 2 also integrate Orcs Must Die! campaign into the game (if you own the latter) allowing you to play the original levels with the new elements of the Orcs Must Die! 2. There are way more weapons to mess around with, loads more spells, trinkets, and special tower upgrades making Orcs Must Die! 2 a great addition to the first game. With loads of DLC to add to it this game is a must buy. If you are unsure or maybe just frugal, such as myself, then wait till the complete pack is on sale and grab that. As you will want to buy the DLC once you really get into the game.  Pros:+A campaign consisting of 15 new levels+Addition of endless mode that lets you go nuts.+Loads of new baddies (including the Orc Mages and Shaman from Orcs Must Die! DLC)+Co-Op play so you can mess around with a friend and have a great new experience+Incorporating RPG elements to the game+Three DLC packs+If you own the original you get Classic mode which includes ten levels from Orcs Must Die!+Loads of new spells (including spells from Orcs Must Die! DLC)+Loads of new towers (offering different play strategies)+Trinkets (which give you passive and active abilities)+Character customization with new costumes.+The story picks up right where it left off.+Two heroes which allow you to choose your play-style. +They added weekly challenges, which get you to play maps in order to earn extra skulls.+You can refund your skulls without any penalties as many times as you want. Cons:-Orcs Must Die! 2 seems to focus too much on grinding. (in order to beat the Campaign on War Mage you essentially need to play Endless mode to get skulls)-The guardian limit is still incredibly low.-There are no levels that corridor enemies so you can just build one long defensive run and have fun with the game.

YouTubeâ¢ Video: MOB Review: Orcs Must Die! 2Â 

			Views: 71		

			Orcs Must die is a 3rd person Tower D game. Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/201790/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Orcs Must Die 2 is a third person tower defense game with a well integratedco-op mechanic.  To begin with, the music matches to the gameplay seamlessly,and does a great job of drawing you into the mood of each battle.  The storyis brief, but is enough to set the scene for the game.  There are two characters to chose from, and while the selection is limited, they both have their own play-style that are well balanced in the game.  It centers around using traps, trinkets, weapons, and strategy to prevent themonsters from reaching the end gate.  The majority of the traps feel useful due to the level design, and it's up to the player to  select which to use based on their preference and how well they synergize with each other.  Each level gets more complex and intricate in its difficulty as you progress through the game, and it's importantto understand the available traps each level offers, and take advantage ofoptions like portals that help you travel from point to point more quickly.There is also a variety of creatures that the player is presented with, andeach one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and I go over this in moredetail in the video.  With regards to the creatures and traps, you have to beaware of what these creatures do, and plan accordingly.The large variety of levels, weapons, traps, and trinkets really personalizes the game.  The leaderboards offer an incentive to perform well to see howwell you place in comparison to others.  The co-op mode also increases the difficulty by offering more troops.  The only issue I really had with thisgame was that it offers a level of difficulty only up to a point, and whilethere is an endless mode that presents more and more troops, sometimes itfeels a little lacking for the more hardcore players.  I would have liked tosee a bit more of a challenge aspect for the more advanced players.Overall this game was very well done.  The different options add to the value of this game, and I found it entertaining and fun to play.  I can easilyrecommend this game.  For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												Orcs Must Die 28.5/10OVerview: Third Person Tower DefenseThe Good:+ Graphics fit the style and theme for the game+ Plenty of traps, weapons and trinkets (passive/active abilities) to fit your own playstyle. Seeing the orcs getting killed by the traps is very satisfying. Each trap, weapons and trinket can be upgraded by completing levels. + Variety of enemies, some with their own unique abilites ensuring that no trap or weapon is overpowered. Some enemies can run over your barriers, others can disable your traps, etc. You really have to be on your guard if you want to be successfull+ Lots of different maps spread across story,classic and endless mode. + Good SoundtrackThe Average:The game has co-op mode but sadly its very difficult to find anybody. ConclusionIf you loved the first game then you should love this as well as its just more of the same, and if you haven't played the first game I recommend you do so because its also an excllent tower defence game. I would have liked to have seen even more game modes and maps but more 'orcs must die' is never a bad thing. This is probably the better third person tower defense games on Steam.

												For fans of the original OMD, especially if you ever longed for co-op, this is a must. However, co-op aside, the other improvements are all solid as well. The main difference (aside from the addition of the Sorceress as a playable character) is a new upgrade/unlock system based on skulls earned by completing levels. It works pretty well and allows you to customize your characters with the traps and weapons you like the best. Other than that, this is pretty much the same game as OMD1, only with new campaign levels and a series of ""endless mode"" challenges... so, essentially this is more like OMD1.5 than a full on sequel. That said, I am fine with that at the low asking price. I guess the only negative thing I found was that it seemed like levels were designed for co-op. I was able to complete the game solo, so it's not impossibly difficult, but it definitely would have been easier and more fun with a partner. OMD2 provides a solid few hours of fun, plus lots more for high-score hounds.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												If you enjoyed the first game, then you will be most likely disappointed by it. Remember how you could create a corridor of death and let the traps do all the work? Well, this is no longer the case. Most of the traps were nerfed to the ground, while the maps were designed clearly with co op in mind.At one point, it becomes too hard to complete a mission by yourself, due to terrible design. Not to mention finding someone to play with you is terrible.If you enjoyed the first game, go back to it. This one is not worth your time. Third game is similar to the second one, so even more co-op.However, if you love Co-op those games can be good. Other than that, not really.			",8,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through this game after completing the first part in the series and I have to say that I am somewhat disapointed with the game in several ways that I will list down below.1) In the original game the crossbow was your bread and butter, the game was really a blend of true TPS and TD but I feel like actual marksmanship has been removed from the game. Projectiles fly off in random directions unless a special focus has been met making the use of the crossbow highly impractical compared to the first game.2) Throughout the game you are reminded that you need to farm skulls in endless mode in order to beef up your traps so you can proceed in the campaign. Granted that it is still possible to complete the campaign levels without dowing this, if you want to play the game solo then it is impossible to get perfect scores in certain levels without farming up a bit.3) The heavy emphasis on coop play shows in the level designs, while most stages are perfectly doable on your own it is sometimes extremely difficult to work around in later stages.4) The original game had Weavers, certain skill trees you could use in a stage to enhance certain aspect of your character or traps, this has been completly removed from the game in favor of upgrading individual traps and weapons using skulls.5) Last but certainly not least: This game has a terrible amount of bugs. It crashes frequently upon completing stages giving you the strange state where you have unlocked the next stage but have no registered high score. While playing coop (something this game has seemingly been designed around) the game has even more oppertunities to crash making it really frustrating when you have finally gotton to one of those later waves in a stage only to see your work amount to nothing.Now for nuance it seems like that game has a somewhat more involved story line that still has a big open ending and playing as the new character class was quite an enjoyable experience.My final verdict is that if you are really looking for a game that you can casually play with friends during LAN events or get togethers that this game can be a nice fix. If you haven't played this series before and are more inclined to play solo anyway I highly recommend to get part 1 instead. If you have already bought and or played part 1 then I am not really comfortable really recommending this one.I hope the devs get around to fixing some of the bugs in this game to make it a more stable experience.  Until then the game has a lot of potential but sadly fails to deliver.			",79,10,0,4,8,0,11

												Overall this game is good, many changes from OMD 1+ Trinket for supporting players+ Many varies of traps including weapons and trinkets+ Orcs got many classes, more Big Boys (troll, Elemental, Lord)+ Guardians, decoy and boom barrel can be placed above floor trap without obstruction- Push trap is too powerful- No weavers (They are replaced as trinkets which didn't help much)- Guardians are more weaker than Guardian at OMD 1 (Even can sustain by having Guardian Trinket)- Spring and Push trap clearly innefective against Big Boys (Ogre, Troll, Elemental and Lord) while OMD 1 with fortifications trap they can throw any big boys away.- Alchemist Bomb become quite innefective for mobs (only for suppression)Clearly i want the weavers back because it help us a lot compare to the trinket (Even Trap Trinket is Best of Best Trinket) however it lacks firepower for the Big Boys (Ogre, Troll, Elemental) i hope that the weaver on OMD 1 will return on OMD 3			",23,2,0,1,0,0,2

												One of the best games I have ever played. Beating and perfecting your defense in this game is really challenging and really rewarding. Not only do you need to survive the levels, but you can five skull them, survive Nightmare, Five skull Nightmare and High score both difficulties. There are plenty of options with Endless involved as well. Fantastic game.			",203,20,2,8,19,1,24

												Awesome game, unlike ''orcs must die unchained'' this one got everyparts of a cooperative tower defense game right. Its fun, its hard, its easy, its challenging, its taunting and orcs call for their mommy so that's always a plus.Me and my friend spent a lot of time having a lot of fun burning, dissolving, grinding, cutting, crushing, pinning and annihiliting orcs to protect the portal from them and I often find myself going back to play again !best money spent, I only wish there was more DLC nowadays and less ''orcs must die: freaking Moba game just like other unoriginal games'' but oh well this isnt a review on their failure so yeah.

												Orcs Must Die 2 Is obviously the Sequel to Orcs Must Die, But it feels like an expansion to some reguards.For starters, not much has changed execpt New Enemies, Levels, Weapons and that sort of stuff. but It's still really fun and another feature added in was Co-Op!And let me tell you, I reccomend playing this game with a friend. It's probably more fun than Another Shooter/Tower defense hybrid game, Sanctum. Why? It has more personal involvement, meaning instead of leaving your traps to do most of the dirty work You're gonna have to start taking down orcs with Two playable characters: The Warmage from the first game, and a New character, the Sorceress.Both of them are different in reguards of their playstyles, The Warmage was made to be the Guy usually being in the heart of the Orc swarm, and the Sorceress relying on spells and staying further away but still helping out the Duo ALOT.I honestly reccomend getting this instead of the first, only because It's better, and it has some levels from the FIRST Game as an added BONUS.Seriously, I can't reccomend this game enough if you and a pal are looking for something to play together.

Let us play"" So I downloaded, installed, played, played, played, played and played more.The game is fun.  The graphics are not amazing, but the cartoon look and feel is cute but also really nice.The controls are so simple, you literally cannot say you cannot play the game.  They are so easy.The audio is funny and nice.The game itself is top fun and best played with a friend.  Yes you can have fun alone but not nearly as much fun as you can with a friend, so best played with people.The leveling, perks, upgrades are all good fun to see and work towards.  They provide a sense up a strong build (Even though you never actually level)Is the game worth it? Yes, by all means buy play and thank me later :)			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												Just as great as the first game. If you've enjoyed Orcs Must Die, you should definitely pick this one up too.Most of the gameplay is very much similar. You still have a plethora of traps to use, and lots of orcs in each stage. There are fewer overall stages in the main campaign than there were in the first game, but the game offers some new stuff to make up for it. It now has 2 playable characters. Their starting weapons and starting traps are different. Like for example the Apprentice uses a blunderbuss as the main weapon, whereas the sorceress uses a sceptre to shoot small projectiles from. The presence of two playable characters also means the game can be played in co-op.In addition to this, some stages also have an endless mode, where you can keep fighting hordes of orcs till you lose all the rift points, and the game also lets you play some of the classic stages from the first game.The upgrade mechanic has been improved from the first game. Though the simplicity of it in the first game was nice, it's also great to have a bigger variety of upgrades that this game offers. Now each trap has more than 1 upgrade, and in addition to upgrading your existing traps, you can also buy new traps, weapons, and trinkets for all sorts of benefits, depending on how you prefer to play. Now this also means that it's easier to earn skulls, which are used as upgrade points. You can now gain them in more ways. In the first game you could only get them as a rating for each mission, but now you can also get them as bonuses and random drops, and as rewards for surviving a certain amount of waves in the endless stages.Just as with new traps, you also meet some new enemies. We now have some earth elementals which split into two smaller units upon death, some tall, lanky trolls which can take a lot of punishment, and even the regular grunts now have light, medium, and heavy armour varieties.There are only a couple of minor things I didn't like. The first one is that I was unable to find an easy way to switch between characters when in the campaign menu. I first played through the whole campaign as the Apprentice, and when I wanted to try out the Sorceress, I couldn't simply pick a stage I've beaten already and to do it with her. Instead I had to create a new character profile with no upgrades or unlocks and to start the campaign all over from the start, which isn't all that great.Another thing I didn't like was how the barricades have become virtually useless now. It's possible that maybe I was just unlucky, but on many occasions I noticed that the orcs now seem to prefer to rather smash their way through the barricades rather take an alternate path, even if the alternate path is within their vision. The only time this didn't happen was when I played the classic levels from the first game.In conclusion, this is a great 3rd person tower defence game and lives up to the quality of the first one. If you've enjoyed the first one, get this one too. If you've enjoyed this one, get the first one too.			",267,51,3,33,6,0,17

												I love co op games especially arcade style wave based co op shooters.For me there are allways 2 types of co op games - 4 players co op and 2 players co op.Orks must die 2 is a 2 player co op wave based tower defence 3rd person shooter with RPG elements.The game is pure awesomeness. The levels are usually mirrored but thats great for 2 player co op. It's amaizingly done with a lot of things to level up.I am giving it a thumbs up because of all the fun I had playing with my flatmate.HOWEVER the game has one flaw that has to be mentioned - all traps are useless except the first you start with. I have beaten all levels and gotten to impossible waves of endless by using only the spike trap and the wall spike trap with only trinkets for more money and revive of archers or paladins that my flatmate used to put everywhere. I have over 300 sculls that I don't need to spend anywhere because all the most usefull traps and trinkets are allready maxed and everything else is just bad or there if you like to challenge yourself and play with the crappy and expensive traps that are not needed.Except that the modding community is doing great things with the game so if you are looking for a great co op experience with someone you know in my case my flatmate this is the game to go to.

												If you've played the first game, you'll be happy to know that the 2nd installment has basically improved upon the first game to perfection.  Take on a bunch of new and challenging story levels alone or with a friend, battling through over 20 different monster types with a slew of new traps and weapons, all of which are upgradeable now.  As an added bonus, owners of the 1st game will also get to play 10 classic maps, as well as an ""endless"" mode to see how many waves you can survive before you run out of rift points.  All complaints I had with the first game have been fixed, and the replayability is very high in this title.  All I can say is, If you're debating picking this one up or not, you are wrong for doing this, and are merely wasting time you could be spending killing these hilarious, clumsy oafs.  Move your axe to the store page, NAO!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OMD2 is a hilarious little Tower Defense game. A slightly unimportant but actually pretty funny story, sets the stage for a huge amount of orcs running towards you. Through teamwork, you can fight the hordes with clever traps, a blunderbuss, some magical power attacks and lots of other funny weaponry. Get yourself a good friend and save...the world? Well who cares, just annihilate yourself some Orcs!			",193,41,7,32,38,3,34

												This game should be called OMD! - Co-op Edition.If you don't have a partner, expect nightmare on normal difficulty (especially in Act II) because maps are designed for co-op defense. The main offender is the last level which I can't beat alone even after watching varios YT videos. Level design is much worse than the first game. I really enjyed OMD!, but not the 2nd one. Now I just idle for trading cards. Shame.There are some positives - graphics is updated, endless mod is very good (if you have a partner), and the new second character (Sorceress) is very good. The best part is you can replay every level again and again to gain new skulls which allows you to buy traps, skills, and etc before they unlock. You couldn't do it in the original which was huge design flaw.			",300,63,23,45,36,5,95

												I know this game is highly rated, but I just couldn't get into it.1) Every map is clearly designed for co-op play.  As in every single one.  Defending widely seperated and/or overlapping lanes is extremely tedious.2) The barricade, your only mazing tool, is borderline useless because they're expensive and sappers will blow them up.  It is possible to place them such that they can be defended (most of the time), but this severly restricts your mazing options, often to the point where it's not even worth using them.3) You have to grind skulls to upgrade your gear and traps.  A LOT of skulls.  It's not like Defense Grid where the only thing you need to get Gold on every map is more skill and practice.  On the bright side, you can respec your character but doing this before every single attempt become a chore quickly.4) There's no real way to play this game as a pure tower defense game.  Your character is much more powerful than your traps no matter how you build yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one is really great, like its prequel, but way more. Now you can upgrade all traps  more than once, play as another Character, you have more Traps, and you can play Co-op! That is totally awesome. Now it is unlimitted replayability which makes it even more cool because it's never gonna end.

												After a long session of Call of Duty I can honestly say I couldn't be happier my friend suggested 'Orcs Must Die! 2' when I asked for a good tower defense game. OMD!2 will honestly be considered one of my favourite games of all time despite only having it for 1 month... it's incredibly fun, addictive and rewarding all at the same time. The story mode was entertaining due to the variety of strategies you could employ to complete them and the fact that each level can be completed at a different success rate. Beyond this there is an unlockable 'nightmare' mode which adds another layer of strategy to the game as well as making the game more addictive. However the story mode lacked any real in-depth storyline, there were only 2 cut-scenes that I can remember and each were short. Beyond story mode you could play endless which was interesting due to the more advanced enemies, it could however be deemed a touch repetitive or tedious. I didn't see it this way as it was always rewarded. There are many acheivements to obtain and none of them felt grindy, completing the story mode got you most of them and the others introduced you to other dimensions of the game such as combo'ing (however you will have to pay for DLC to get 100% completion).Overall I would say the game is definitely worth a purchase at it's cheap price due to it including Steam trading cards / achievements and being thoroughly enjoyable.

												The sequel to the popular Orcs Must Die! is a great addition to the game's unique genre. Orcs Must Die! 2 offers a familiar feel if you've played the original, but it greatly builds upon the first game's mechanics and expands the experience by offering cooperative gameplay, customization and a sense of leveling up by collecting skulls for various improvements. It should be noted that Orcs Must Die! 2 co-op mode is limited to your Steam friends. Regardless, this amazing sequel is worth a play-through for those looking beyond first-person shooters.

												This game many look like simple arcade game, but Orcs Must Die 2 is truly a great strategic tower defense. You play as ""The War Mage"" through a 3rd person camera view, and try to survive waves of orcs. Just like any TD game, there is always at least one entrance and exit the orcs must travel through. Your job is to stop them. Level design is very good, and each level has a unique feel and strategies. There is plenty of towers to chose from, and each tower follows an upgrade system which is accessed after each battle. Also there is many different weapons and items The War Mage can use, and like towers these can also be upgraded and given better abilites after each battle. Replay value is very high, each level has 3 difficulties and an unlockable surival mode, and you can chose to play with any towers you have unlocked. Upgrading all of the weapons and towers will defnitely keep you busy as well.I would reccomend this game to fans of tower defense games and strategy games. There is actually quite a bit of planning involved when setting up the perfect defense. 9/10 One of my all time favorite TD games! ",85,10,4,5,17,2,22

												Great but not as special as the first game.  In the first game you can work strategically and get a solid defense with work.  In this game everything is balanced down to a mediocre state, so no matter what you do your player has to do a lot of the killing.  This is probably intended but it's less fun than the first game.  The game is still great though.  I still recommend playing it after the original.			",359,54,13,41,32,6,32

Seamlessly combines 3rd person arena with tower defense, with a playful, cartoony graphic style that will have you laughing as ragdolls fly through the air. Definitely bring a friend, it's not the same alone. 9/10 (The DLC is awesome but hurts my wallet)			",38,11,0,7,3,0,6

												This game is really good in many aspects. You can use a lot of creativity in which way you choose to demolish those large hoards of orcs. Compared to the predecessor there are some improvements. You can reassign your upgrades and play with friends, for example.The graphics aren't the best possible but the top notch gameplay is enough to keep you satisfied for a long time.Levels are so versatile that you need to consider many different factors and constantly adjust your way of playing. That's what I like the most in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you for example like bloons TD as im not a big fan of. You will deffently like this game, the reason i say you wil like this game if you like bloons is becouse it's basicly the same, just the feeling of not just watching the traps but actually fight with them! the feeling of just shooting orcs is relaxing and of a wierd reason really fun. If you'r not sure if you want to buy this game. DO! if not STILL DO!! but i recommend playing multiplayer, much more fun :)			",49,8,0,5,4,0,4

												This game many look like simple arcade game, but Orcs Must Die 2 is truly a great strategic tower defense. You play as ""The War Mage"" through a 3rd person camera view, and try to survive waves of orcs. Just like any TD game, there is always at least one entrance and exit the orcs must travel through. Your job is to stop them. Level design is very good, and each level has a unique feel and strategies. There is plenty of towers to chose from, and each tower follows an upgrade system which is accessed after each battle. Also there is many different weapons and items The War Mage can use, and like towers these can also be upgraded and given better abilites after each battle. Replay value is very high, each level has 3 difficulties and an unlockable surival mode, and you can chose to play with any towers you have unlocked. Upgrading all of the weapons and towers will defnitely keep you busy as well.I would reccomend this game to fans of tower defense games and strategy games. There is actually quite a bit of planning involved when setting up the perfect defense. 9/10 One of my all time favorite TD games! ",85,10,4,5,17,2,22

												Great but not as special as the first game.  In the first game you can work strategically and get a solid defense with work.  In this game everything is balanced down to a mediocre state, so no matter what you do your player has to do a lot of the killing.  This is probably intended but it's less fun than the first game.  The game is still great though.  I still recommend playing it after the original.			",359,54,13,41,32,6,32

												This game is one of the game that i actually wanted for a TD game , Dungeon Defender is also another one however that do require quite a few char to play with and some people actullay hacked the equipment in game and causing it be not as fun as this game. Overall , Orc Must Die 2 is a rather Balanced game with some bad tower and you will require tower and you attacking them to win the game. I highly recommend this Game to anyone with a partner to play with .			",352,79,9,45,45,3,73

												i hate tower defence games, but this game is amazing.this is the best tower defence game ever made, hands down.the goal is simple, keep enemies from getting from point a to point b.you use elements to help you do such, like place and remove all sorts of different traps that do all sorts of different things.upgrade your traps and weapons and spells to do more damage, slow enemies more, transform enemies into something else, convert them to your team.use all sorts of different weapons and spells/magic.and play co-op with a friend, whom can bring their own strategies to the table.if you have never played or seen this game before, buy it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.

												Orcs must die 2 is a massive upgrade from the first one while having everything the first one have, and now co-op added to the mix.  Play as the Sorcress who was the main villian from the first game or the ever stupid Warmage.  They have slightly diffrent traps and diffrent abilitys to better refine a personalized play experience.  Most of the first game levels are there, endless mode is also avalable.  My only complaint is they should have seperated single player and co-op, as all the maps are designed with co-op in mind it is absurdly hard to handle it even on normal difficulty by yourself.  Aside from that one small complaint as someone else said ""Move your axe to the store and buy it now!""			",434,101,5,51,40,4,44

It's a pretty simple tower defense style game, but there are enough variables for you to create different playing styles and still keep it fun. I get a little bored playing this game in single player mode, but that's just my preference. In order to find some people to play with, I went on the Steam forums and found a post full of people looking for partners to play this game.

The main flaw is that music gets repetitive if you play a lot, that's why I haven't put 100% If you have OMD! or get the Franchise you will get the maps from the first game inside the second title too, so that adds co-op to them.Try the demo if you're not sure / or you haven't played games focused on action tower defense.Now it's on sale buy it in the Complete Pack to get the 3 DLCs for 2â¬. They add maps with special guests to proof your skills. Just buy it :D			",818,306,21,136,57,7,164

												Do you like Tower Defense?Do you like TPS?Do you like to smile and laugh at funny comments?Yes? Then there's no doubt that you should play this game!First things first: In case you wonder ""Do I really need to play the original OMD! before playing this sequal?""Well, you don't need to, but if you would like the story to make sense to you, then yes. And really, the first game was excellent - and they simply improved the story by making OMD!2. So, I will only recommend buying (and playing) the first game and then continue with this one. I have spent hours playing both games in all modes - all for a great amount of fun!Certainly, some levels might be best in co-op mode (if not all of them) but you can have a splendid time taking on the game just by yourself, in case you were wondering.This is the best TD game I've played (others including Dungeon Defenders and Sanctum), simply because it adds humor, and have very challenging maps. I do HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone wanting to either challenge oneself; build up a better teamwork with a friend; or simply have lots of fun listening to the comments the War mage and Sorceress throw at each other.

												I love this game. There's a lot of content/value here for the price they're asking, and the game's better and more polished than many of the recent, supposed ""AAA"" titles that have been released. If the idea of planning out a brutal network of traps in order to hold of a horde of enemies appeals to you, pick this game up. Mutliple difficulty settings/modes, upgradeable traps, weapons and trinkets, and all 'round good fun. Well worth the money.			",218,49,2,22,16,2,27

												95% |=> SUPERFUN and challenging (the DLCs mainly). Weekly challenges to increase replayability. Difficulty adapts to co-op. Now with workshop. The main flaw is that music gets repetitive if you play a lot, that's why I haven't put 100% If you have OMD! or get the Franchise you will get the maps from the first game inside the second title too, so that adds co-op to them.Try the demo if you're not sure / or you haven't played games focused on action tower defense.Now it's on sale buy it in the Complete Pack to get the 3 DLCs for 2â¬. They add maps with special guests to proof your skills. Just buy it :D			",818,306,21,136,57,7,164

												This is tower defense done right. Okay, so it's pretty much Orcs Must Die with co-op... but that game was awesome too. Funny dialogue, responsive controls, satisfying weapons and traps, and great graphics. Imagine Dungeon Defenders, but with the RPG bits removed and replaced with FPS bits. With the online leaderboards, there's plenty of replay value here.			",404,137,12,41,55,6,68

												This is a fun little game that I discovered and played exclusively co-op with a friend of mine.I'm a big fan of tower defense games, and this game sure can keep you occupied for a few hours at a time. Place traps, fight hordes, and different maps come with all kinds of different challenges.My personal favorite part is the variety in options you have to choose from when you create your build. There are probably around one hundred choices to equip, and you can only use 6 at a time, allowing for great differentiation and a unique build that fits your playstyle. Definitely recommend, especially on sale.			",68,4,5,10,17,0,5

												I love Tower Defense games and enjoyed the 3rd person shooting aspect of the first game. This sequel feels like an expansion and that's not a bad thing. You get to control the sorceress now and can even play all the missions in co-op with a friend. They added a bunch of new traps and items. My only gripe is that DLC missions are insanely hard. I look forward to their upcoming 5v5 sequel Unchained..			",705,182,11,97,45,8,95

												My favourite tower defense game, just edging ahead of Plants Vs Zombies. Action-packed, hilarious and deeply satisfying when you start pulping Orcs in finely-tuned traps; hugely challenging and panic-inducing on harder difficulties when trying to stop that last Kobold from escaping. DLC just adds more to an already fantastic little experience, but don't expect a huge progression from the original Orcs Must Die!, because this is essentially just more- more traps, more maps, more characters (the Sorceress and a co-op mode). If that puts you off splashing out for it at full price, wait til it's on sale, because it's still eminently buyable and very, very enjoyable.			",74,17,1,7,11,2,33

												Quite fun actually. Orcs Must Die! 2 did not have a ""wow-factor"" for me in terms of the gameplay. I have played too much Dungeon Defenders to be new to third-person tower defense. What this game does shine in is the variety of traps, I enjoy having different load outs depending on the map and my play style. The pathing of waves are designed to be optimized for certain traps (ceiling, floor or walls). The game also supplies players with a good collection of weapons used on Orcs to company the automatic traps. In the game, there are only two classes to choose from; War Mage and Sorceress. The War Mage is a male character whose quotes are quite lighthearted but unintelligent. He has two ""uniques"" a trusty Blunderbuss, a shot-gun that also doubles as a grenade launcher, and Tar Trap that slows down enemies. The Sorceress, on the other hand, has a very different style. She is more of a passive character than the War Mage. Her unique trap, Acid Sprayer is able to apply short-term effects on enemies and her Sceptre of Domination can temporarily mind control. Even with the lack of characters, Orcs Must Die! 2 is still very enjoyable to play and, if single player is getting repetitive, online co-op is always available.			",556,172,19,83,47,8,103

												Orcs Must Die! 2You know one of these games in which you ask  yourself, ""What were the developers thinking""?This is one of this, and this game has a really basic concept, but, after all, it's a really fun an entertaining game.All you need is a friend to play with, and clicking few buttons.The game's concept goes like this;You and your partner are meant to set up an ambush, and traps, to keep an X amount of Orcs getting through the Rift. The rift is shown up as a door with a dim yellow light coming from it, like something god-like. It's a defense game with waves; you can upgrade traps, outfits, gear, trinkets, and many more. Depending on what level you're on, the amount of waves and the enemy types may vary alot, and you'll have to figure out which is the best way to keep them from going through your 'fortress' in time.The game revolves around the basic and generic-kill everything theme, warriors and orcs. I don't have many hours in it, but even if you're a fan of extremely realistic, indie, or 2d games, no matter what, this game is pretty decent. At first you'll think it's plain simple and boring, but after you played it for a bit you'll get used to it, and the fun will start showing up. Play it with a friend, make up a plan, tactics, strategy, and then prove who's the king, the orcs, or your ""devilishly handsome"" protagonist, ha-ha.Good luck!			",107,18,4,9,4,0,8

												Do you like killing orcs? if so this is the game for you!!!No But Really Time For The Proper Review===============================Now what is orcs must die? It is a tower defence meets fps, at its core you are always trying to make brillent setups of many diffrent traps, some of them ar locked till you reach a certain ponit in the main story and allow you to buy them later on.Wait did I hear buy? Yep, as you play the game and unlock the right to buy certain traps. You earn skulls, these can be used to buy new traps, weapons and upgrade ones you already have. You can also buy some awesome skins.That is pretty much most of the game howeever, the game dose a great job by chllangeing you. The story steadly introduces new mobs and levels in a proper diffculty climb. You should never feel like a map is hopeless if you know what you are doing.Now another game mode is the games endless misssion. Wait wut endless missions so they go on forever? Yup, like the name entails I have been to some pretty high waves. and its really very fun.Still not convinced, well this game also suports mods adding great reply ablitty. However it is already very high due to its awesome endless mission, story and the veries diffcultiys it can be beat on and even offers to diffrent characters to play as.All in all this game has lots of content, always manages to pull me back in for a few waves amd still play it to this day with my friend after owning it for almost a year. You can not go wroung with this game. 8/10 would play again. In the words of Doge very fun, much hours.			",139,21,2,44,6,2,24

												Fun, silly game with great strategy. Lots of trap options and abilities, you can come up with some really enjoyable death machines and just sit back and watch....maybe clean up the few orcs that manage to make it through alive. With the DLCs you can get a good selection of scenarios (I won't call them modes since its basically the same just different enemies/goals). Good to play Co-op just make sure its with someone who you can work with easily lol. Seamlessly transitions difficulty from very easy for new players to extremely difficult for the seasoned players, you can spend hours on one level if you can survive that long. And its worth it.

												Orcs Must Die! 2 (or ""Orcs 2""/""OMD2"") is an odd amalgamation of third-person action and tower defense.  This creates a very fun and interesting mixture of gameplay that can be balanced at the player's discretion.  The basic format of the game is this:You have a portal or sometimes multiple portals which must be protected from waves of enemies of increasing difficulty.  The portal has a set number assigned to it that goes down if you die or enemies enter it.  If and when that number reaches zero, it's GAME OVER!At the very start, you choose between two characters, who each have access to certain weapons and traps and shout of their own cheeky one-liners:Warmage - A very balanced character with about the same amount of health and mana.  Definitely made for those who prefer to get up close and personal with their enemies.Sorceress - A character designed for those who'd rather set up traps and guardians and snipe at enemies with ranged attacks.  The Sorceress has almost double the mana as the warmage, but at the cost of having almost half the health. Once you pick a character, it's time to choose your loadout of items and tools to protect your portal:- Traps - Good old-fashioned traps act like towers in any other tower defense game.  Most activate by themselves and have a recharge.  Some are a little different, but most fit this description.  There is a wide variety of traps to choose from with countless different effects.- Guardians - Guardians are living beings which you summon to help protect the portal.  They are very much like traps in that they automatically attack enemies, but they are different in that they can move around, do not have a recharge timer, and can die.  They can, however, be revived.- Weapons - These are what throw the third-person action elements into the mix.  Weapons, while not quite as plentiful as traps, do have a wide variety.  Each weapon has a primary attack which costs nothing and can be used over and over, as well as a secondary attack which uses up mana.  Those who have played the Elder Scrolls should be familiar with how mana (magicka or stamina) works.- Trinkets - These are similar to weapons in that you carry them on your person, but they are different in that they play a more supportive role than an offensive one.You must use a balance of these four tools to defend your portal against seemingly-endless hordes of trolls, gnolls, ogres, and - of course - orcs!  The variety of enemies is just as vast as the variety of counters you have waiting for them.Inside of each level you collect gold to buy traps and guardians.  You gain the gold by killing enemies and collecting coins that are dropped by certain enemies for bonus gold.  At the end of each level, you are awarded with orc skulls depending on how well you did.  You use these skulls to unlock and upgrade new weapons, traps, guardians, and trinkets.  You can also buy a few (and I mean only a FEW) outfits for your character to wear as well.The game modes themselves are not all that diverse, but they get the job done.  You have your basic campaign made up of about 30 levels (give or take) with a pretty mediocre storyline.  Then there's the ""Endless"" mode which is not really endless as it has only 50 waves, but it sure seems endless as you find yourself constantly in a race to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemies.  You can also try out several DLC maps as well as the weekly challenge map, which has you play as a specific character with a pre-defined loadout on a certain map to see how long you can last.All-in-all, this is a great game for the price and can be very addicting.  The challenge is through the roof at times and you must be prepared to lose, if only to learn your mistakes and try again.  This game is fantastic in singleplayer, but it's an absolute blast in co-op.  What's better than singlehandedly taking on the beastly orc hordes?  Why, taking on the beastly orc hordes with a buddy, of course!  If you're a fan of mixing tower defense and third-person action, then get this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by the far the best tower defense game out there. Not only is it tower defense, it is first person with multiplayer! Orcs Must Die! 2 is definitely much better than Orcs Must Die! 1. There is multiplayer, tons of added maps, loads more traps, trinkets, and customization! There is a lot to do in this game, including campaign, nightmare campaign, and endless modes for nightmare and regular. The DLC is great, adding more traps and maps, and I highly suggest it. Overall, this game is great, and a good buy, worth every cent of it!			",155,29,7,17,10,0,19

												Oh man, I got this on impulse on sale. I gave it a whirl and... became addicted. Why? Well, throwing Orks all over the place is kind of fun, but besides, it's all about doing better and finding ever more fiendishly clever ways of killing them pesky Orks and Ogers. And Goblins. There's a million and one ways of doing the deed in question. Now, this isn't a great review, I know, but I've gotten most of my online contacts to get it. They also liked it alot. Then I discovered coop. It's not a hard-core game, that's sure, but that's the point of a game, it's FUN, it's like playing Super Mario Bros for the first time, it's simple, it's straight forward, it's got no plot twists and it's got no gimicks. It's just pure straight foward fun. Also, the voice acting, although not extensive, makes for some funny moments. Try it, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're looking for a game that you can pick up, play for an hour or so and then do something else and not regret wasting your time, then I would wager that this is the game for you.

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a brilliant successor to the first. There are so many new levels, traps, trinkets, and a new character in addition to the levels from the first game added on. All of that plus the DLC for an extremely low cost makes this game worth the $10 you will spend on a Steam sale. Infact, I bought this game full price and I have no regret.The newly added cooperative play makes the playability of this game extremely high. There is always something to achieve whether that be the actual achievements or simply personal targets in-game. The time it takes to 5-skull every level on story mode and endless mode is long so there is no shortage of game content.Many reviews I see on here under the ""only negative"" category are complaints about issues I have not seen. Once you get a friend to play with, this game is endlessly fun.The only issue I have ever had with this game is a single broken achievement.10/10. Will definitely buy the next iteration.

												Very well made blend of tower-defense and third-person action. Orcs Must Die 2 kept most of the traps and skills from the first game (apart from the Weavers) and added tons more. The same levels can be done using different strategies, so there is a lot of replayability. All levels are solo-able, though they do take some planning, experimenting and multi-tasking. Co-op mode is easier and a lot more fun! Recommended to any tower-defense lover!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the best co-op game of my experience other than the Army of Two series that I ever had. Its probably my favorite to do endless while finding the best way to make the game completely win by itself for all the waves. This game is visually and overall entertaining for anyone and everyone who adores the Defense missions of Survival genres as well as any game where you like overkilling enemies and orcs.

Posted: December 4, 2013
												  Orcs Must Die! 2 at first glance seems like a classical tower defense. You lay traps and have to survive waves of monsters in increasing strength and size. So what makes this game better than other tower defense you may ask.   Firstly, the seamless graphics along with the interesting ability of playing an active and very important role in the defense is major to its sucess. You play as your character and you have to personally mow down the monsters where your traps fail.         Secondly, the monsters require different ways to kill them, a koboldd sprinter is a small and fast unit with not a lot of hitpoints that can bypass most basic traps quite quickly and so need to be coupled either with some well placed shots to the head or another trap to slow the kobold to stop it from passing, whereas a heavy orc warrior would simply require a lot of traps or armor-piercing traps or shots to kill it. This necessity to vary trap combinations and styles plays a major role to the enjoyability of the game.   Thirdly, there are a plethora of traps and weapons to choose from, each providing a unique play style and experience. Thus you can customise your character either too a mean, lean killing machine or you can upgrade your traps say and lay down so nasty little traps in choke points that obliterate the enemy.   Fourthly, the game is not easy. For people who are not very good at tower defense games playing on anything but apprentice level can be a challenge, this skill level requirement or at least a certain level of understanding of the game is necessary as the game is challenging and keeps you on your toes, especially at later stages in the story or in nightmare or endless mode.   Lastly, the aspect of the game that makes it stand out so much from other games is the great co-op aspect. Can you name another tower defense that looks good, plays great, constantly challenges you to play at your best and allows for so many customizations? I think not. So, unless you have found a better tower defense game I highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for a challenging fun and funny game.			",20,1,0,3,1,0,13

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a game that you will pick up and play with the intention of only playing for half and hour and still be there a considerable time later. With the added bonus of multiplayer co-op, there are plenty of trap variances and unlockable upgrades that will leave you wanting to try different strategies to kill those Orcs.There are also plenty of levels and different types of enemy to keep this game fresh into Nightmare mode! The only downside is a lack of story or boss levels that put your skills (and your traps) to the test!			",127,21,1,11,13,1,19

												Orcs Must Die 2 continues right where 1 left off. The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.To start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.Gameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.Amazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.I'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.Endless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.If you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												You start off by picking a character, after you start the mission. It shows you how to play at the start then it gets a lot harder from there on.

												Fun, silly game with great strategy. Lots of trap options and abilities, you can come up with some really enjoyable death machines and just sit back and watch....maybe clean up the few orcs that manage to make it through alive. With the DLCs you can get a good selection of scenarios (I won't call them modes since its basically the same just different enemies/goals). Good to play Co-op just make sure its with someone who you can work with easily lol. Seamlessly transitions difficulty from very easy for new players to extremely difficult for the seasoned players, you can spend hours on one level if you can survive that long. And its worth it.

												Orcs Must Die 2 is the sequel to Orcs Must Die (obviously) and as lazy as it sounds I would recommend reading my review of that because this game is essentially the same again. Not that that's a bad thing! The formula works, hell in this one they even improved a few things.This time you can choose between 2 characters to play as, the apprentice or the antagonist from the previous game. Each of the characters has their strengths and weaknesses, the apprentice carries on as he did before but now gives you the choice of crossbow, blunderbuss. The crossbow being the same as the last game and the blunderbuss causing far more damage but having a much longer reload time. The sorceress has less health than the apprentice but more mana and she can control a Orc and make him fight the others for a short period. As well as that some of the starting traps are different depending on which you choose as well as a few unlockables later.Speaking of traps there are some new ones, all of which are entertaining to see unfold, the levels also sometimes have environmental traps built in which you can take advantage of.This time there are far more unlockables to collect, costumes that change your abilities, rings and trinkets to enhance the way you play and of course the upgrades.Like the first game it's repetitive as hell, but what do you expect? And also like the first it's difficulty seems to ramp up out of nowhere.I recommend this game to those who have either played the first and want more of the same. If your new to the series... Well start here. It's a better game really, since it's the first one plus extras.I'd say Â£11.99 is a little steep though considering the first is essentially the same minus a few parts. See if you can find it a bit cheaper or on a sale. Anything below Â£10 is a bargain really.			",538,242,9,92,52,4,86

												It's the sequel to Orcs Must Die! Here comes more orc-slaughtering mayhem at its absolute finest! This iteration has better graphics, more refined & compelling strategy, genuinely creative & exciting maps, and waaaay more delicious, delicious unlockables than the original (the hunger for skulls will be extreme - you've been warned!). There are several DLC packs now available which do an admirable job of forcing you to develop new killing techniques and motivating you to persist in slicing & dicing orcs (along with the newly added enemies) in order to earn yet more skulls which (as in the first game) are the currency with which you purchase new items and upgrades.The crown jewel of this genocidal romp... The area where it *really* shines is, without a doubt, the co-op multi-player. This game has provided me with the most fun I've ever had with other players here on Steam. Grab this game (and all the DLC!) for yourself and a good friend, hop onto a Ventrilo or Teamspeak server and you absolutely won't regret the gore-soaked results. Best played with a 360 controller (in my opinion anyway; though a certain Aussie friend of mine insists that mouse/keyboard control is the way to go) and an unquenchable thirst for chaos on an orc-pocalyptic scale. Yeah, I said it. I went there. I regret nothing!			",145,31,0,37,12,2,32

												Super fun and addictive Third person tower defense game, made even better with the co-operative aspect of the game.Both characters play differently with different starting weapons and a couple unique traps....and of course there is loads to do from the range of main game levels (about 20), DLC levels (should you choose to buy them; 3 levels each), endless mode (a few) and classic levels (if you have the first game purchased; 10 levels)Pros:+Super fun and well-polished gameplay/animations.+Massive range of traps, trinkets, weapons etc. ALL with upgrades.+Great range of maps, some easy and some painfully hard.+Improves on the first game majorly, great sequel!+Solo and co-op options (can do a playthrough with a mixture).+Fantastic soundtrack.+Nightmare Mode for when the first playthrough was too easy.+Spring traps...seriously, they fling enemies all around the place.+Leaderboards for when you want to show up your friends.+When an orc cries out for it's mommy whilest getting sucked into a grinder (does this make me a bad person?).Cons:-The weekly challenges are often either stupidly hard or impossible by yourself, and i've 5-skulled everything.-""Crunch"" (Level) - Maybe this level was a bit too hard to 5 skull on nightmare mode (especially solo).-The 'pros' list is too long.Seriously, even if you don't have a friend to play it with, it's still awesome; get it.Just watching hoards of orcs mindlessly run into your chaotic and unavoidable traps would make anyone's day.

												This has to be one of the best Tower Defense games I've ever bought & played! The only problem is that theres is a lot of orcs - orcs that MUST die! 10/108/8/15 UpdateHere's a more descriptive view on the game, but a short one. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a sequel to the original, bringing us more gorey ways in destroying the one-sided army of the bloodthirsted Orcs. In protecting each given stronghold, given many traps and trinkets to fend them off in any given way possible to your imagination. All the while, progressing through the story of fending off the last strongholds against the growing threat.Anyways, I loved the game from the start, being able to choose different routes and ways to take each level, all the while, being competitive to take the first place within your Friend Leaderboard to show you were the best one to make a route crazy enough to be that well, in the first place. While with DLC to offer you more ways to slay them all down, there isn't a way to truly put a stop the Orc's, as they just keep coming, until their prepared army is scaled down to nothing but dust. Strategies has and always will be present, in progressing through the game itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Played a few games with the warmage and after a while I decided to give a try to the sorceress class. And this is what I heard:""Ooh! So many at once""""Yes!

A Screenshot of Orcs Must Die! 2
By: AguilaDeAcero




Well.. you know...( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)Ha! But for real now. The game it's a solid ""Tower"" Defense game (with a nice twist), a third person action game and also has nice rpg elements in it (like unlocking new traps, weapons, upgrades and so on). Also the sense of humour it's a nice touch and well done overall, I just wish there were more lines or voice acting between the 2 main characters. Yeah I know, you are here for the killing but the interaction and presentation of the game really got me hooked and wanted to know even more about the story and characters.The game has coop, and some modes to keep things fresh but I'm having a blast with endless mode for the moment. Oh, and the game has steamworkshop built in so that's a nice plus too. I only wish there were more sorceress skins over there.. yeah.. Very good game and addictive too. Give it a try.

												You ever have one of those games where you wish they would continue on and on forever.  That is this game.  The tightly programmed gameplay, 3d physics engine is perfect for what this game is for.  I wish they would've continued onto creating this as an MMO, dungeon runs, as I instantly fell in love with the characters, and the manners in which you can wreak havoc on the enemies.  If you read this from the future, resurrect this game engine, and characters and create more varieties other than just a tower defense game, people will love it.			",79,1,0,14,14,0,7

												Got the complete package for 2.49 so of course this game was worth it. However, I probably would have not bought this at full price (25% reason being that I'm poor).The game itself is great. A tower defense+FPS with funny dialouge and great graphics. Very fun game. My only complaint about this is the mouse. The mouse sensitivity is quite high which can be annoying. It gets annoying trying to turn the other way and somehow the the screen makes a 360. With that being said, the aiming can get tough too, especially trying to shoot the fast runners. Swing your cursor to fast, you're gonna miss the target. Swing it slow, you're gonna miss the target. Other than that, great game, and very well worth the price on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a hilarious and entertaining third person tower defence. Use a combination of weapons, magic and traps to kill endless hordes of dimwitted orcs. It is co-op based but can easily be played solo. It is not a necessity to play the first game, however the game play is almost identical.This game is without a doubt, one of my most favourite games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of this posting, Orcs Must Die 2 is 90% off; That's less than $2!Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defence game that puts equal emphasis on the player and the traps he/she places, as in one cannot win without the other on the harder difficulties. You can choose the 4-8 traps, weapons, and utilities you use at the beginning of each round, and upgrade them too. The upgrade system allows you to choose one of two unique stat buffs / extra abilities, and gives an additional aspect to modify your items each round. There is a lot of clicking involved for some personal items (especially the sorceress's Staff of Domination). Co-op is also an aspect which, in my opinion, enhances the experience to a degree; However, the game can be completed entirely alone.The OST is most noticable during the beginning of the waves, and the last wave, where it conveys the chaos taking place when the late-game waves start throwing hundreds of orcs, imps, golems and trolls at you. Orcs Must Die 2 definately has some charm to it's presentation.Overall, I think it's a no brainer to pick it up on sale, as it provided me with a good 20 or so hours of fun (though I did not complete all DLC maps)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first time I saw the title of this game, I thought to myself. ""Yes yes... orcs MUST DIE"" and having a 2 next to it indicated to me that it would double the holocaust of orcs by my hand. Why I hate orcs so much you might? When i was a level 10 human warrior just minding my own business in Goldshire Tavern he showed up andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everyone even my bestfriend Saurion, he had to have 36 stitches in his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I vowed from that day to have my vengeance and this game would be the reaper of their souls. I began to fap vigorously for hours to build up the adrenaline to fight the orc hordes, everything was going well until the gnoll hunters came out of nowhere slapping all of my archers one by one, and they were lead by no other than Hogger my arch nemesis... While trying to kill gnolls below westbrook garrison he chased, beat, and violated me multiple times until I was able to crawl to Westfall and heal my wounds. Then i spammed 50 paladins and theyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everything gg wp commend me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fans of the original game will find OMD2 mostly enjoyable. The gameplay mechanics are identical, but there are lots of new traps, weapons and avatar buffs, all of which have several upgrades to select. There are also a couple of new orc types. The result is even more tactical depth and playing style diversity. Story mode seems a bit short compared to OMD1, but replayability is extended by the game type called Endless, where the objective is to survive as many waves as possible before you get overrun. And then there's coop mode, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. Some of the maps seem to be specifically designed for two players, with far too many orcs coming from too many directions for one player to cover all at once. This makes some maps frustrating to play, even after hours of grinding Endless for enough skulls to fully upgrade your traps. I don't mind difficult games, but OMD2 at times simply feels unfair to solo players. Overall though OMD2 is still worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Third Person Shooter meets unusually placed tower defence. I was actually surprised when I realized how well they work together.  The Orcs Must Die! was really good, and got me hooked for a while (never could beat the last level :( ), but once I beat it I never really saw much to go back for. The second, however, adds co-op to the mix, and trust me when I say that the co-op is almost required. Trying to do the game solo is near impossible. But with the help of a friend, you can both have a blast (at the orcs) while you laugh away. A real friend builder, that's what this game is. If your friend is one that doesn't take things very serious, this game will prove that he/she is not good at doing anything where his/her actions help/hurt. If you have a perfect fit of a friend, where you work together like a well-oiled machine, your friendship will fly to the next level. Get the game, and get a friend a copy of the game. You can see if you are good friends right in here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gotta hankering for mass murdering orc's while they charge linear paths and try to kill you and your nexus? lol Well buy this game. Its kinda one of those games you can just pick up and put down and always come back. The leaderboards are a nice addition if you're feeling competitive with friends or online players. I recommend playing with a friend tho lol. Just makes it much more fun and better time investment.core game play is simple. Kill X waves of enemies get gold spend on a Large verity of traps to stop the enemy dead in their tracks!  You'll find out soon that each new level gets a bit more difficult and always has a twist. Either new paths for the enemy or a new type. Flying , Elemental , Troll, or special unit with unique aspect.The starting levels are pretty simple but later planning and resource management will be a thing. But its always fun to retry for that perfect score. :)Buy it and have a good time with a friend totally worth it. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun single player mode. Even better co-op. Fun and easy to pick up but gives extra playability with daily challenges. The game has a couple of downsides though. The game is incredibly short and the DLC, which could solve this issue, costs a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of money. I also disliked the fact that you cannot get all the steam achievements without the purchase of the original Orcs Must Die. A minor setback but it still grinds my gears. 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My only complaint about this awesome sequel is that the main campaign is blatantly unfinished, lasting only 15 levels over the previous gameâs 24, and going out on somewhat of a whimper. Act 3 is completely missing, and most of the new monsters only appear in the skimpy DLC with 3 levels each, no voice acting and no story included. But instead of an Act 3, we got a new playable character with a different tech tree, ONLINE CO-OP, a staggeringly large armory of weapons, an endless mode with over a dozen maps, a new dwarven mines setting with awesome environmental hazards which half the game takes place in, a unique challenge level that cycles every week, about a dozen maps from the first game (if you own it on Steam), 3 DLC packs with freaky new monsters and good weapons, and Steam Workshop integration so you can play with mods you like. Also included are many very welcome interface changes, such as not having to pick your weapons again every time you restart a level, and a set-up break before Nightmare levels. A very fun, very worthy sequel that expands and improves upon the original. Have fun earning thousands of skulls to purchase all the upgradesâ¦ and then do it all over again with the other character! Itâll keep you busy for a long time. But enjoy it while it lasts, because OMD3 is a free-to-play League of Legends clone. (Ughâ¦ why??!!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game on a good sale with most of the dlc included, so here's my review.Great game, lots of fun with a friend.I gotta be honest I had bought Orcs Must Die (the first game) and I just could never get into the game, but this game has improved in alot of ways and the online CO-OP brings it to a whole new lvl- highly recommended ;) !Basically the idea of this game is simple, but the execution is not ;) .The goal of the game is to stop the baddies (mostly orcs, thus the game's name) from reaching the ending points once they spawn at starting points.Easy enough right?  Wrong =p plenty of enemy types, and lot and lots of them.  And how you go about attacking them is totally up to you and the tools you choose to get the job done.There are various different traps, helpers (guardians), trinkets (like armor pieces), and weapons you can equip and upgrade via skulls you earn from how you do on each lvl you play through, fun process and makes it have something to work towards ;) ; rewarding to say the least.Even at full price I'd can whole heartedly recommend this game, the dlc on other hand I'm not totally sure of yet, b/c most of the dlc was included in the pack I bought, so hard for me to judge the bang for buck on the dlc.Fun game though.

												Honestly, I was skeptical about this game, just watching people play on youtube. My friend kinda coaxed me into getting it, and it's probably the most amazing game I've played in a long time! The game is a bit short, but does provide lots of replay ability through the different modes OMD2 incorporates. This game can get a little monotonous at times, but when playing with a friend it can provide hours of entertainment. ~Pros~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.) Enemies are fun and make the game challenging at points; A fair amount of the enemies in this game are unique, and have different weaknesses, attacks and strategies. It makes for interesting gameplay!2.) Ragdolls are wonderful; When aren't orcs flying through the air into a wall funny?3.) Replayability is good; The game doesn't make you start over when finished, and gives the ability to reset the skulls you put into your traps and weapons, allowing you to try new things. OMD2 also gives a harder version of the campaign, and a mode called endless; which is basically just play until you lose. 4.) Great customization; I'm mainly talking about the traps here. Each trap has 2 different abilities to it, but you can only choose one. There are lots of different combos you can perform by tweaking at the abilities of your traps.5.) Differentiation between characters; The sorcerer and war mage are not entirely the same, and have different traps as well as weapons, allowing the player to choose their play style.~Cons~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.) Online seems barren; Ihaven't seen anyone online, so this game can get lonely without a friend.2.) Traps sell for the same as they were bought; I wouldn't really list this as a con, it's more in the middle of the both. When you buy a trap, at any point in the game you can sell it for the exact amount of money. With certain overpowered traps this can become slightly game breaking, and tends to remove the challenge in some occasions. However it's great in the fact that you can remove it and replace it somewhere else. I constantly misclick xD so for me this is great. 3.) Seems like an addition to the first game rather than a sequel; I think most people could agree, this game kinda seems like an adaptation of the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic game, I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't bought it yet, and is thinking of doing so :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die 2 is the co-op follow-up to the original game and while there are changes in maps and some of the traps, the core gameplay is the same. This is a good thing because the first Orcs Must Die is awesome, and only lacked the ability to play with your friends.Spoilers AheadIf youâve played the first Orcs Must Die recently you will remember that at the end, the war mage (you) closed the rifts into the orc world and trapped the evil sorceress on the other side with her minions. Closing the rifts had the side effect of making magic unusable, so the power she had over the orcs is gone, and now they want her dead. In this sequel, one last rift is opened by an old wise wizard (presumed dead in the first game) and the sorceress has escaped being chased by her former orcs. Itâs team up time, and the war mage must work with the sorceress to stop the hordes of orcs from breaking through the rift into the human world. This time around you can choose which character to play the game as: war mage or sorceress. Mostly theyâre the same but each has a couple of traps unique to them.  For example the war mage has the tar trap (one of the best floor traps) and the sorceress has the acid spray wall trap (decent against heavy enemies). Consensus seems to be that war mage is better overall. I played the sorceress and had fun with the polymorph ring against the super heavy enemies.Just like the first Orcs Must Die, the game is broken up into a series of independent map levels, and every level you start from scratch setting up traps and barricades to kill all the orcs before they reach the rift (or rifts). Itâs a hybrid tower defense/third person shooter, so youâre in the thick of the action, blasting enemies along with your traps, or mopping up the ones who manage to break past. Every level you beat gives you âskullsâ which are currency to buy upgrades for traps or unlock new spells/traps. Unlike the first game, you can replay levels over and over to farm skulls and eventually buy every upgrade. Pros:+Co-op campaign! You can play every level with a friend. This along with the skull farming adds a lot of replayability to the campaign.+Pretty much everything good in the first game is still there, including maps for the first game. You can play the âclassic levelsâ with the new traps and sorceress character.Cons:-The âendless modeâ gets buggy as you get to higher levels. Maybe itâs my computer but it really started to lag around wave 35. It actually crashed for me a couple times.Overall, if you liked Orcs Must Die 1, you should like part 2. Theyâre basically the same game with added improvements, options, and levels for the sequel.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As soon as you start shooting orcs in the face and impaling them with spikes you will rember the fun you had playing the first one! Also with the new multiplayer you can play with your friends! Orcs must die 2 also intruduces a new female character, The Sorceress, who can charm enemies with her magic wand. Personally I think she's a great addition to the game!So If you like strategy games and third person shooters, buy it its a good game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of this posting, Orcs Must Die 2 is 90% off; That's less than $2!Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defence game that puts equal emphasis on the player and the traps he/she places, as in one cannot win without the other on the harder difficulties. You can choose the 4-8 traps, weapons, and utilities you use at the beginning of each round, and upgrade them too. The upgrade system allows you to choose one of two unique stat buffs / extra abilities, and gives an additional aspect to modify your items each round. There is a lot of clicking involved for some personal items (especially the sorceress's Staff of Domination). Co-op is also an aspect which, in my opinion, enhances the experience to a degree; However, the game can be completed entirely alone.The OST is most noticable during the beginning of the waves, and the last wave, where it conveys the chaos taking place when the late-game waves start throwing hundreds of orcs, imps, golems and trolls at you. Orcs Must Die 2 definately has some charm to it's presentation.Overall, I think it's a no brainer to pick it up on sale, as it provided me with a good 20 or so hours of fun (though I did not complete all DLC maps)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 +) All personal and other upgrades have become masteries you can get before the game, as long as you have skulls for them. You don't have to choose one of them and dump the others like in the first series. +) Aiming got even better. +) Your choice of traps and items from spellbook are fixed on your hotkeys so you don't have to click 'B' and select them all over again in every new game like in the first series. +) Weapons, rings and such stay where you appointed them on the slot. They don't push them selves forward to 1 or 2 like in the first series. You put them at 9, they stay at 9. +) Graphics have become a little clearer: better. There was no problem in the graphics in previous series but it just got better and that's a good thing. -) The number of campaign missions have decreased. I would prefer the length of first series. -) In Campaign mode I keep hearing the beautiful sexy lady's voice but she's not actually in the game. It would've been amazing if she follows you around and fight with you as a NPC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You'll find yourself wanting to perfect all the levels in all difficulty modes, but once you fail, however, it's not at all fustrating to redo them again, with your partner.

												Got the complete package for 2.49 so of course this game was worth it. However, I probably would have not bought this at full price (25% reason being that I'm poor).The game itself is great. A tower defense+FPS with funny dialouge and great graphics. Very fun game. My only complaint about this is the mouse. The mouse sensitivity is quite high which can be annoying. It gets annoying trying to turn the other way and somehow the the screen makes a 360. With that being said, the aiming can get tough too, especially trying to shoot the fast runners. Swing your cursor to fast, you're gonna miss the target. Swing it slow, you're gonna miss the target. Other than that, great game, and very well worth the price on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The tightly programmed gameplay, 3d physics engine is perfect for what this game is for.  I wish they would've continued onto creating this as an MMO, dungeon runs, as I instantly fell in love with the characters, and the manners in which you can wreak havoc on the enemies.

Well.. you know...( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)Ha! But for real now. The game it's a solid ""Tower"" Defense game (with a nice twist), a third person action game and also has nice rpg elements in it (like unlocking new traps, weapons, upgrades and so on). Also the sense of humour it's a nice touch and well done overall, I just wish there were more lines or voice acting between the 2 main characters. Yeah I know, you are here for the killing but the interaction and presentation of the game really got me hooked and wanted to know even more about the story and characters.The game has coop, and some modes to keep things fresh but I'm having a blast with endless mode for the moment. Oh, and the game has steamworkshop built in so that's a nice plus too. I only wish there were more sorceress skins over there.. yeah.. Very good game and addictive too. Give it a try.

												Fans of the original game will find OMD2 mostly enjoyable. The gameplay mechanics are identical, but there are lots of new traps, weapons and avatar buffs, all of which have several upgrades to select. There are also a couple of new orc types. The result is even more tactical depth and playing style diversity. Story mode seems a bit short compared to OMD1, but replayability is extended by the game type called Endless, where the objective is to survive as many waves as possible before you get overrun. And then there's coop mode, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. Some of the maps seem to be specifically designed for two players, with far too many orcs coming from too many directions for one player to cover all at once. This makes some maps frustrating to play, even after hours of grinding Endless for enough skulls to fully upgrade your traps. I don't mind difficult games, but OMD2 at times simply feels unfair to solo players. Overall though OMD2 is still worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like tower defense and coop play, then this is a bull's-eye. It's a well crafted tower defense with third person perspective rather than an RTS perspective. The graphics do their job well enough, and the aesthetics are great for my taste. It has some short cut scenes and a little story you can follow, but puts most of the focus on the actual gameplay. Fun, easy to grasp and quite a lot of customization with multiple choices of skills and traps as well as leveling these up.Play it with a friend, or even better, a loved one. Worth the full price, particularly if you like tower defense, coop games, or third person action games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Third Person Shooter meets unusually placed tower defence. I was actually surprised when I realized how well they work together.  The Orcs Must Die! was really good, and got me hooked for a while (never could beat the last level :( ), but once I beat it I never really saw much to go back for. The second, however, adds co-op to the mix, and trust me when I say that the co-op is almost required. Trying to do the game solo is near impossible. But with the help of a friend, you can both have a blast (at the orcs) while you laugh away. A real friend builder, that's what this game is. If your friend is one that doesn't take things very serious, this game will prove that he/she is not good at doing anything where his/her actions help/hurt. If you have a perfect fit of a friend, where you work together like a well-oiled machine, your friendship will fly to the next level. Get the game, and get a friend a copy of the game. You can see if you are good friends right in here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Swarms of orcs come down preset paths while you place a wide range of upgradable traps and obstacles in their way. Having a large choice of upgradable weapons to help mow down rows of orcs solidifies the fun. Love the franchise, found it by accident. Highly recommend for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For sure a wonderful game! It brings a lot of fun to a concept I havent seen done this well in a long time. The game pits you against angry mobs of orcs and other mythical creatures and does it with simplicity and fun!The game starts with a short story about why the orcs are attacking and so on and so forth. However from there you start. Orcs spawn from a single (or up to 4 locations later on) location and have one goal. Reach a predetermined  ""door"" if you will on the map, and beat the heck out of anything that stands between them and the objective. If too many enemies pass through the door you must retry the level.You can choose between two characters. A male character or a female character. The male character comes equipped with a shot gun and his own set of default traps to throw off enemies with. The female caracter comes with a wand that you can shoot either lower power bolts from faster or shoot charged up high damage bolts that also have a short ranged knockdown effect on enemies around the enemy hit with it. The game offers new traps,trinkets, and weapons avalible to your character iin the spellbook. The in game store that uses skulls as currency that you obtain through beating levels. Everything is upgradable and it's always fun to see what kind of damage you can do with an uprgraded trap or weapon.Co-op is the name of the game for the best fun in this game. Grab a buddy and you two can stop the orcs together! It's the same concept as playing alone except for that you get to do it with a friend. For me it return my mind to a simpler time sitting in my parents living room ripping through a game with a freind. It's great fun!The game also comes with an endless mode in which enemies spawn in an infinite number of waves. It adds a lot of replay value after a somewhat short campaign. (maybe 5 to 6 hours).Put aside anydoubt and pick up this game if you think it looks good. It's a great buy and will give you lots of entertainment especially with the three DLC pack bringing new levels and weapons. An easy 9/10 for me!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think Orcs Must Die! 2 is very addictive.In this game, you put traps and fight against various enemies trying to pass through us.You have a few traps and weapons at first but you will get new ones and upgrade them after victory.Then it's available more way to fight, and stages, simple or complex or something, and get more interesting.It's also available to coop mode, so you can play with your friends too.So now I really recommend this game!

												Grab a friend and have fun!The coop is a great addition to this wonderful game. Even though the first levels seem messy, the later levels will reveal themselves to be really challenging and a good way to test your skill with your friend.Funny, easy to start but still challenging, cooperation, good ost and lot and lot of traps... my conclusion? Iz good (I like to stay simple!).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really liked this came coz of how simple it is and fun it is, plus it reminds me of the old birdeye viewed tower deffence games.All and all though i did really appreciate playin this one and is most surely with getting for those who like fun tower deffense games mixed with a bit of third person shooting, its quite the easy game to get your head round and dosn't really require tutorials like most tower deffense games but it dose give brief wile playin the game on how to do stuff and level up.Anyways i give it a 5*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a total improvement over the first game, the AI has been reworked and now you can truely block out enemy paths. Test your trap placing and combo making skills to the test with its wide variety of traps to use. This game becomes tougher as you play but also more rewarding, if you are having trouble with a stage, why not have a buddy help you out. Over all its a fun addicting experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For sure a wonderful game! It brings a lot of fun to a concept I havent seen done this well in a long time. The game pits you against angry mobs of orcs and other mythical creatures and does it with simplicity and fun!The game starts with a short story about why the orcs are attacking and so on and so forth. However from there you start. Orcs spawn from a single (or up to 4 locations later on) location and have one goal. Reach a predetermined  ""door"" if you will on the map, and beat the heck out of anything that stands between them and the objective. If too many enemies pass through the door you must retry the level.You can choose between two characters. A male character or a female character. The male character comes equipped with a shot gun and his own set of default traps to throw off enemies with. The female caracter comes with a wand that you can shoot either lower power bolts from faster or shoot charged up high damage bolts that also have a short ranged knockdown effect on enemies around the enemy hit with it. The game offers new traps,trinkets, and weapons avalible to your character iin the spellbook. The in game store that uses skulls as currency that you obtain through beating levels. Everything is upgradable and it's always fun to see what kind of damage you can do with an uprgraded trap or weapon.Co-op is the name of the game for the best fun in this game. Grab a buddy and you two can stop the orcs together! It's the same concept as playing alone except for that you get to do it with a friend. For me it return my mind to a simpler time sitting in my parents living room ripping through a game with a freind. It's great fun!The game also comes with an endless mode in which enemies spawn in an infinite number of waves. It adds a lot of replay value after a somewhat short campaign. (maybe 5 to 6 hours).Put aside anydoubt and pick up this game if you think it looks good. It's a great buy and will give you lots of entertainment especially with the three DLC pack bringing new levels and weapons. An easy 9/10 for me!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Best tower defense game I've played in my life!This game is one of my favorite games, and I still play it very often even now, though I'll try not to be biased.One thing I'd like to point out is this was sort of made for co-op, though singleplayer is managable.If you want the game made for 1 person OMD1 although more dated has easier levels.The good things about this game Weapons - All the weapons are useful in some way, my most used ones are probably the lightning ring, ice amulet and bladestaff (freezing them and hitting them with the bladestaff's a really good combo)- Unique weapons to your character - The sorceress gets access to the polymorph ring, and a staff with the ability to temporarily charm orcs, if they die during the charm they stun and damage nearby enemies. Warmage gets the blunderbuss, king in direct damage, and the warhammer, able to clear entire areas in seconds.- Stuns. Without stunning certian enemies you'd probably die too fast, especially as the glass cannon, the sorcererTraps- Although some players are more comfortable with sticking to certain traps, switching what you use based on maps can help.- Most traps can combo, such as tar with arrow walls to trap people and damage them a ton- Lots of traps to knock enemies off the map! Watching them fly is funny.The bad things- Endless mode gets ""harder"" by giving higher health enemies after around wave 40 ish- Certian traps seem useless, such as the one-time use ""Boom Barrel"" Though I'd say around 90% of the traps are useful on certian maps or situations.- Tar is overpowered (900 gold to slow the entire lane by a ton? Yes please.)- Some weapons I think shouldn't be part of the DLC mostly just the gaurdian trinket (resurect dead gaurdians, passive heal)These are all the negatives I can think of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Believe it Orc not, this has insanely fun multiplayer with a bunch of unlockables to make the game replayable. I enjoyed it thoroughly (still am). Runs pretty well on low-end systems. If you aren't sure about it, get your butt ogre to the store and get it!  Especially on sale (it happens often).Tower defense style (traps in lieu of towers) with waves of enemies with 3rd person combat (melee and magic).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When people talk about the traps being nerfed they weren't kidding. Every single second you have to micro manage each pathway and it gets extremely stressful. I was a fan of the orginal because it was better balanced, traps could actually kill, and you were rewarded with headshots.And to top it all off it has a saving problem, I played on endless mode today for about two hours straight. I quit the game like normal and all of the items that I unlocked were now locked again. Sad part about this is that I was actually going to give this game a positive score despite all it's flaws, don't get me wrong it can still be fun but the saving system made me lose my marbles with this game. Video games are already a waste of time to begin with, but never allowing me to advance even makes me feel even worse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a third-person tower defense game...i guess that's what you can call it :)You have to defeat orcs before they reach a portal (or multiple portals).In order to stop them, you can place different traps throughout the level, but you can also shoot them yourself, which is definitely harder and not as fast, so using traps is needed in order to stop them.You can upgrade your weapons and traps by earning skulls, which you will get after completing a level or when they drop randomly while killing orcs.You have mutliple types of orcs like flying ones, fast ones, strong ones etc. which need different tactics or traps to defeat them fast enough.It is a lot of fun, especially in co-op. So grab it if you like those kind of games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Understandably needing work, this game for some licenses will have traps/guardians/enemies invisible. They will appear on the map, but not on the screen in front of you, even though they can still damage you and vice versa. Until a patch  fixes this issue it is not worth buying this game to risk having this problem. This game is a great game for Tower Defense and a great sequel to Orcs Must Die 1, but these issues are too large to casually kill orcs or have a fun time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FUN Trap Defense!  Gibs & flyin' ragdolls galore.  The comedy actually makes me laugh, as it's quite dark, yet with that TF2 sort of physics feel that makes for 3 Stooges escapades when traps are launched..  There is always another reason to play a level another way for strategy, score, or just plain silliness.  Although a few of the levels feel a bit cramped or limited, by changing traps or weaponry one can overcome and appreciate the puzzler aspect of the game, hidden beaneath all the gore & violence.  ""Orcs Must Die 2"" is a really good time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10 - Somehow more boring than the first one, maybe because it is almost the same game. It is still you with traps versus Orcs, but this time you can play as more eye-catching character (or the same guy like last time) with many new traps. Plot continues where it ended and the places are very familiar. Anyone who's enjoyed first OMD will enjoy this too and those who haven't played it yet don't have to in order to enjoy Orcs Must Die 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very...unexpectedly engrossing. The developer team made many efforts for the combination of stuffs. At first, it has the most amount of stuffs(including weapons, trinkets and guardians) so far during the tower defense genre. Secondly, the combination of different traps, weapons and trinkets makes its strategies much more extensive and variable. All right, I admit its normal mode is quite a bit easy. But in nightmare and endless mode,you will pay more concentration on the combination of different useful stuffs for victory. Its co-op mode is another excellence compared to other similiar games. Unlike Dungeon Defender, you must have close cooperation with your partner in OMD2. Or you will surely be defeated by the orc very soon. Heroism creed is not necessary and is a poisonous seed to the playing experience. I remember when playing co-op in Dungeon Defenders, the only thing I can do was to rest and watch beside if one of my partners used the magician class. That was so boring that I gave up playing with others. If you worry about how to combine various stuffs, this game has the weekly challange to teach you the trick of most stuffs. If you are a fan of tower defense game and co-op, this game would be the one you must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games ever.I like tower defense in general, and this is basically tower defense as a TPS.Or if you will, single-player LoL.Has some nice progression to it.Replayability is due to some mods on steam though. Trying out new combinations, just messing around in endless mode just for laughs and see the orcs flying all over the map.Btw: sadly the soon to be successor OMD:unchained is meant to be an actual LoL-clone in TPV. So I'm probably gonna stick with this one all the longer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found Orcs Must Die! 2 to be a very fun experience. It is a 3rd person tower defense-style game, where the objective is to stop orcs from getting to a rift by utilizing various traps and weapons/spells. If you enjoyed the first game, you will definately enjoy this one as well- same orc slaughter, but more traps and weapons to use and upgrade. Orcs Must Die! 2 has a big upgrade system- you get ""skulls"" after each map to spend on upgrading your traps and weapons in many different ways. The better you do, the more skulls you get, and your upgrades persist thoughout all of the modes, allowing you to tackle the very hard modes such as endless and nightmare. There is also is coop, which I think is a big selling point for this game. I just completed the story mode with my friend, and it was a ton of fun. Watching your combined traps massacre hundreds of orcs as they try to pass by is just so satisfying. As you get into harder levels, teamwork becomes very important as you try to hold the line against and army of orcs.Even after you complete the story, there is still much you can do- endless mode (never ending waves of orcs, see how long you can last), nightmare mode (harder difficulty, but you keep your previous upgrades as I mentioned before), and many other modes.There are a couple of downsides, though, that I will mention. First off, the in-game voice chat is downright awful, and overrides the steam chat so you can't use it. There is no way to turn it off, so my friend and I just made it push-to-talk, bound the key to something we never used, and then used skype or mumble.Also, there really isn't much of a ""story"", it is not what this game's focus is- it is all about the gameplay. So if you are a person who is looking for a good story to drive you through the game, this is not it.This game is not for everyone. If you don't like 3rd person action or tower/wave defense games, I don't think this will really change your mind about the genres. But if you have any interest at all in the game, I would definitely pick it up. It is very good at what it does.Lastly, many of the levels seem to be made with coop in mind. If you plan to play though this game solo, you might have a difficult time getting through some of the levels.Overall, this game was a blast to play with my friend. If you are looking for a good coop game to play with a buddy, I strongly recommend you try out Orcs Must Die! 2. Even alone, though, this game can still be a fun time. It has a light sense of humor about it that makes it all the more enjoyable, despite the fact that you are slaughtering orcs by the thousands!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very...unexpectedly engrossing. The developer team made many efforts for the combination of stuffs. At first, it has the most amount of stuffs(including weapons, trinkets and guardians) so far during the tower defense genre. Secondly, the combination of different traps, weapons and trinkets makes its strategies much more extensive and variable. All right, I admit its normal mode is quite a bit easy. But in nightmare and endless mode,you will pay more concentration on the combination of different useful stuffs for victory. Its co-op mode is another excellence compared to other similiar games. Unlike Dungeon Defender, you must have close cooperation with your partner in OMD2. Or you will surely be defeated by the orc very soon. Heroism creed is not necessary and is a poisonous seed to the playing experience. I remember when playing co-op in Dungeon Defenders, the only thing I can do was to rest and watch beside if one of my partners used the magician class. That was so boring that I gave up playing with others. If you worry about how to combine various stuffs, this game has the weekly challange to teach you the trick of most stuffs. If you are a fan of tower defense game and co-op, this game would be the one you must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the most fun game I have played. It's a cross between a shooter and tower defense game. I recommend #2 expecially if you have someone to play with. It is much more fun with two people, but still a great game (although more difficult since levels are designed for two players).  If it is on sale, definitely get it. If you have any doubts you can try the demo to get a feel for the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall Score 9/10Fun factor 8/10Control and Gameplay 9/10Graphics 8/10Sound 9/10Replayability 9/10As a sequel to the original Orcs Must Die goes it's almost perfect as they addressed a lot of the issue that plagued the first game. The developers added multiplayer and skins adding hours of replayability with friends. They also fixing the taxing issue of playing Nightmare Mode allowing a build phase before the level starts. Multiplayer can be a bit buggy at times and if you crash or dc you lose all the progress made on the map of choice. It can be frustrating at times but enjoying the steampunk-isk tower defender with friends adds so much more debt to the game. Like with the original if you can pick it up for 50%-90% off itâs well worth the time and money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is always another reason to play a level another way for strategy, score, or just plain silliness.  Although a few of the levels feel a bit cramped or limited, by changing traps or weaponry one can overcome and appreciate the puzzler aspect of the game, hidden beaneath all the gore & violence.  ""Orcs Must Die 2"" is a really good time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love it.I'm a HUGE fan of the ""Deception"" games and ""Tecmo's Deception"" (the first one on PS1) is still one of my favorite games of all time. This game is great too, but in this game you can, and in most cases have to, also directly attack your enemies. The traps are all well thought out and interact with eachother very nicely, though not for the orcs.Level designs are fantastic allowing different tactics to beat them. You'll run around them thinking of where you want to throw which traps. Then the horde starts flowing and you need to improvise.Both characters have some unique traps and weapons that only they can use.If you have the first game, this game has redone levels from it outside the main story.There's a good amount of enemy variety, each with their own strengths / weaknesses. There's a wide selection of weapons and trinkets which can give you magic attacks, or abilities, or buffs etc..There's many types of traps, but you can only take a handfull with you. Less if you want to take an extra weapon or trinket so you'll have to plan your strategy carefully before you even begin. Each trap is further varied by how you upgrade them, and you can respec the traps/weapons/trinkets you have and how they are upgraded any time in the menu.I recomend the ""franchise pack"" that comes with the both games and all the DLC.

												Opening caveat:  I am not traditionally a person that plays Tower Defense games.  This is in fact my first one.  To get right to the point of it...I loved the game.  If the name wasn't a dead giveaway, the game has a silly, lighthearted tone to most of it that, when combined with the creative ways you can inflict mass orc genocide (some favorites being hurling them by the packs into bottomless chasms with a well timed gust of wind and launching them ragdoll-style for their afternoon lava bath), leads to plenty of destructive catharsis.  While you can play all the missions single player...the game is at its best (IMO) when played with a friend.  Many a map benefits heavily from having a second mind on hand to help combat the games challenges, and with co-op your individual action bar is halved so it emphasizes working and planning together.  The missions also reward player skill with the main currency of the game, skulls.  Doing things like beating a mission within a certain time limit...not letting anyone through your defenses...and even ""hidden"" bonuses like not using mana or not taking damage all reward you with additional skulls after the level.  If however you're not that great at pulling things off that way, levels can be farmed repeatedly for unlimited skulls so you aren't punished harshly.In conclusion...recommended.  Get a friend...get some chips...and get killing.			",28,6,0,11,1,0,6

The game is too difficult for solo play and if you have more than 1 friend that wants to play someone is gonna be left out. I hope an orcs must die 3 doesnt have this problem, if there ever will be a third game.			",62,3,0,6,4,0,21

												I was a bit hesitant buying this at first, seeing as I don't have any friends to play this with, and it's designed as co-op. I wish I bought it earlier. It is well possible to beat the game single player, though at times it can feel a little overwhelming. I've beaten the campaign, but have not beaten the DLC's yet, as I have yet to try them. If the only thing preventing you from buying this is the fact that it's designed for co-op, just get it. If you get stuck, watch a guide. Fryedegg's channel on Youtube was a great help to me on some of the harder levels. I have yet to try the levels on Nightmare mode (Hardmode) seeing as I'm farming skulls to make things easier. If you're thrown off by me saying you need to spend time farming, you don't. I just am to make things easier.You can reset the upgrades, refunding 100% of what was spent, which is a feature I wish i'd figured out before I was halfway through the game.This game is extremely fun, moddable, has a lot of replayable value, beatable in single-player, has a co-op mode, is better when eating tacos (What game isn't?) and... well... yeah.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",42,5,0,4,8,0,2

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is a game for you to play with your friends and by yourself! Its the simple things that make this game fun to play again and again.  Resetting your trap choices to tackle difficult stages make getting those 5 skulls per level endless replayability. Definitely a must have game when you just want to kill some pixels and relax.

												This is an amzing game. My only complaint is that it focuses too much on playing with friends, and u can only play with one at a time. The game is too difficult for solo play and if you have more than 1 friend that wants to play someone is gonna be left out. I hope an orcs must die 3 doesnt have this problem, if there ever will be a third game.			",62,3,0,6,4,0,21

												Orcs Must Die 2 is really more of the same, but this time it's bigger and, in some ways, even better. There are quite a lot of new traps, it introduces online co-op, collecting skulls has a better purpose and there's more replayability in general, thanks to Endless Mode.Graphically it looks the same and the one liners are once again amusing. The sounds in general (traps, kills, orcs, you name it) don't disappoint.As you can see it's a complete package and, considering the price, it's truly worth your money.[Rating: 88/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												If you have any interest in tower defence you should already own this.Combining 3rd person shooter and Tower defence, Orcs Must Die 2 allows constantly exciting gameplay with tactical thought like no other. The hordes of enemies overrun the screen with countless numbers as they run through carefully constructed death trap mazes and meet grizzly doom while you blast them away.Tons of traps, weapons and everything else each with a unique upgrade tree which when attempting to max out every item can take days. (Iâm not even close with 33 hours)Comparable only to Dungeon Defenders, Orcs Must Die 2 is quite simply a masterpiece. ",195,37,3,24,17,2,28

												Initially this game was fun.  The wave based defense was challenging and the mechanics were fresh.  The problem is once you continue to play past an hour or two.  The game turns into an endless grind without anything new.  While some may enjoy that type of game play, when it comes to wave defense, it gets a bit dull and mindless.  If you're looking for a wave defense game to burn time and you like that sort of micromanagement, this game is definitely a good buy for the price.  I, unfortunately, would not recommend the game.

												Fast-paced and action-packed games with simple, challenging gameplay and a humorous story, as well as several other modes to play in? This game has it all. Take the role of either the robust war mage or the crafty sorceress and fight off hordes of orcs with your large variety of upgradeable, disposable traps and your own upgradeable weapons and accessories. Play with a friend, or slaughter them all yourself. I personally love games that are simple and fast-paced, but also challenging, just like this one, and I'm finding it extremely addicting!

												7.5/10Really a fun and smart game.Basically, is a tower defense game that allows the player, which controls the main character in a third person perspective, to place traps in order to stop ordes of orcs and other type of monsters.The amount of traps, weapons and spells make the game replayable, thus you'll like to try different setups on the maps, both in survival and story modes.I recommend this game with a 7.5/10.

												This game is fun and interesting. Imagine a regular tower defense, but instead of doing everything in God View, you're actually running around on the map setting up traps, towers and minions to help you kill waves of orcs.The fact that you're able to help out by attacking with a vast variation of weapons and trinkets completes this game. You even get to upgrade defences you think are useful with ingame currency.Don't be fooled by my play time, I used to play this on a different account and put quite a few hours into Endless mode with friends. While it doesnt have insane amounts of replayability, it is definitely worth trying out if you've never played this genre of games before.			",59,10,0,14,3,1,7

												Dungeon Defenders was the first tower defense game I played and I couldn't get into it. It wasn't a bad game by any means, but the animation felt too slow paced for my liking and I couldn't get into the leveling and gear upgrades as much as I usually would in an RPG.A friend got me Orcs Must Die 2 to play with him and although I was skeptical at first, I enjoyed (and am still enjoying) the absolute hell out of it. It's much faster pace and spending talent points (or skulls) for weapon / trap upgrades has never been more fun. This is surprising to me because I usually prefer RPG elements in video games, and this one doesn't have any really, but I enjoyed it regardless. If you're looking for a great tower defense, you probably want to check this one out.			",107,33,1,46,14,0,32

												A quirky defense game which requires a high level of player involvement. Playable solo, but so much more enjoyable with a friend. A stready stream of unlockables, a variety of weaponry, and online leaderboards, make it a fantastic timewaster.			",263,66,3,54,25,2,56

												I've been playing OMD2 off & on for over a year now, it hasn't lost any of its charm yet as far as I'm concerned. It's still a brutally enjoyable (and handsome) game and I would recommend anyone with a slight interest in either defense games or action games to give it a try because, well, orcs must die!

												One of my favourite games like the game play toke a while for me to get hang of used to play lots games years ago but stoped for a while like the shortense of the story line quests or what ever they call them in this game. also like the endless games earn lots of skull points spend on impovering your characteirs gear. complete orgoinal story line like how you can change difficulty of games not as many new games have this as used to.lots cheesy jokes and waky story which i find refirshing in game please forgive bad spelling and that.

												Orcs Must Die (Original) used to have small issue - it enjoyed shutting down your PC. Overheating it.Orcs Must Die 2 fixed it. Two years after release. Still, fixed it.This said, this was only bad thing that I could say about this game. So... It's great. Just great.			",104,31,2,30,2,0,35

												The sequel to Orcs Must Die! is by itself a slightly worse game than the original, however it brings with it the addition of a co-op mode which can easily greatly improve your enjoyment of the game.The game suffers from the same issues as the original, mediocre level design and unbalanced traps/weapons. However it does bring with it some improvements as well. For instance in this game you only get some traps and weapons by default as you progress through the campaign, the others you have to buy with skulls, which you get by doing well in a level and picking up if they drop from an enemy. This adds another level to the game, and with the option to refund your skulls for free any time you want to, you can try out different styles of gameplay every single time.However I was not feeling the atmosphere of the game as I did in the original, that with the addition of new monster types, which seem to be there just to add to the number of different monsters, makes this game slightly worse than the original in my opinion. That is if you're only playing it in single player, however since the game is built more around the co-op aspect if you play it with someone else it becomes better than the original.7Â½ / 10			",809,305,38,121,97,9,172

												In this game you kill millions of orcs.It's one of the most intense and action-packed games I've played single player.There is also co-op. You better prepare some caffeine or similar.Rolling 5/6.			",284,81,8,30,40,1,33
