												Given how frequently new instalments in the Call of Duty and Battlefield series are churned out, there's a risk that the gaming world will soon grow tired of the military shooter. As enjoyable as these titles can be, some are starting to feel the genre is growing stale. Sniper Elite V2 is a game that could potentially set that right, offering a refreshingly tactical take on warfare simulation.Rebellion Developments has strived to plant players directly in the shoes of a frontline sniper with this third-person shooter. It's all about moving around in the shadows, creating diversions and calculating the perfect shot down to the finest detail. The game will certainly find favour with those who value realism over arcade action, but it's not for everyone.Sniper Elite V2 is essentially a reimagining of its 2005 predecessor, set within the same time frame, with a different spin on events. The game takes place in a battle-ravaged Berlin in the closing days of World War II, with players controlling a US officer dropped into the city to stop the Russians from poaching the Nazi's top scientists.The storyline runs only surface-deep, though newsreel-style cut scenes and effective voice acting help capture the Zeitgeist of war-torn Europe. In-game backdrops aren't too shabby either. Those rubble-strewn streets and burnt out buildings look glorious at the higher resolutions, and are functional environments where gameplay is concerned.Missions see players venture behind enemy lines on their lonesome, with only their wits and arsenal as allies. It starts out stealthy and tense as you creep by enemy patrols in search of a suitable vantage point to pick off your target from. Infiltration is a delicate game, and once your sniper's cover is blown, you're unlikely to last very long. A submachine gun, a silenced pistol and a trusty sniper rifle are the tools of your trade, although other weapons can be picked up later on. There's also a range of explosives on offer that must be used tactically if you want to get out of war-torn Berlin alive. Trip mines can be affixed to the threshold of a doorway to cover your escape, while proximity mines are useful for booby trapping enemy corpses.Every step you take and every bullet you fire must be carefully calculated in Sniper Elite V2. If you're not fleeing from the scene of an assassination, you'll either be crouch-walking or crawling along the ground since loud footsteps give away your position. This will certainly make the game a no-go for those who prefer swifter-paced action affairs, but as far as the stealth fans are concerned, it's an authentic experience.Firing stray shots from cover to create a diversion usually pays dividends, as do shrewd takedowns with a silenced pistol bullet. The idea is to come and go like the wind, never giving away your location.Infiltration is an integral part of the game, but the assassination set pieces are the meat of the experience. Finding the perfect spot to take aim from is only half the battle. There are a lot of variables to take into account when pulling off the perfect shot, such as distance, wind resistance, and even your rate of exhalation.Pulling off an effective kill gives rise to an immense feeling of satisfaction, heightened by the bullet-cam depiction of your handiwork, which shows your target's internal organs being ruptured via an x-ray effect.While these segments show off Sniper Elite V2 at its very best, they also highlight one of its biggest drawbacks. While enemy AI can be lethal if you blow your cover, its movement patterns and behaviour are thoroughly predictable. Picking them off from a safe distance is not unlike shooting fish in a barrel. Even on the higher difficulty settings where guard patrols will come at you in force, their attack strategy is enough to make one of Darth Vader's stormtroopers blush.The solo campaign offers around 10 hours of gameplay, and can be played co-operatively online to pad it out further. A selection of multiplayer modes provides further mileage, along with some unique twists on the military shooter formula. Overwatch mode is the standout offering, casting one player in the role of a sniper providing support for a ground level companion as they complete a range of objectives.In closing, Sniper Elite V2 does a lot of things right. The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat. Minor issues aside, headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												In my opinion this game really is underrated. It's a great sniper game. Probably one of the best currently available. It might be third person, but that doesn't take away the cool sniping feel. It's also the only game that has X-ray killcams. Looks so awesome. It also has great co-op. Really a game worth getting whenever it's on sale.			",299,57,8,23,33,3,17

												Great game. After 468 hours into this game, it's fun to play and outwit the enemy with mines, tripwires and more. KillCam is fantastic. The game runs smooth and plays well. I've enjoyed it time and time again. If you like Sniper Games, this is a good choice. Co-op is fun with friends and best played with comms. Multiplayer is also good. Play on dedicated servers, player based servers or, create your own server. Play with and/or, against your friends.Actually, this is my 2nd review. :DI would also like to add that, you can plan your attack/traps a dozen different ways in this game to take out the enemy and have fun doing it. Some times, it's funny to lure them into your traps by throwing rocks to get their attention. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros-The sniping mechanics are really good. The game takes into account bullet drop, wind, stance (whether you are crouching, laying down or standing), breath and motion.-The game lets you tackle a level the way you want to. You are only given a waypoint and how you reach that waypoint is up to you.-The levels are fairly open. Most levels have several big “arenas” connected by corridors.-The A.I can be quite challenging...Cons-The A.I can also be very dumb at times. I saw a couple of times enemies just giving up and resuming their normal route right after they had spotted me or I had killed someone next to them-Some minor bugs-At times the enemy can spot you behind cover or behind boxes which can be frustrating when you have successfully sneaked past several enemies.Neutral-Rebellion has been updating the game with “advertising” for their other Sniper Elite games. Now at the start of the game there is a launcher that is just one advert for their newer game and when closing the game there is another advert that you have to manually quit.I found Sniper Elite V2 to be quite an enjoyable experience. The gameplay is good and can accommodate any type of player (whether you run and gun, use stealth or anything in between), the story while not being anything remarkable is enjoyable and the mission structure is good enough to keep you playing. Sniper Elite is a fun game and an easy one to recommend.			",780,139,51,71,29,7,85

												The game is unlike anything else on the market, it is becoming and will become a cult classic just like I predicted when I reviewed this game a few days after the release (the Nazi Zombie expansion packs attest to that)  There are only three major negatives about this game that I can think of:1) It is not as immersive and complex as the first game;2) The enemy AI could be improved, but its not terrible;3) The game could be harder.I've been playing this game practically non-stop since it came out.There are certainly some trade-offs for the negatives. The graphics have been improved over the first game, obviously. The Asura engine is now one of my favorite engines, it shined in Aliens Vs. Predator and it's pretty good here. Except I don't understand why the last AVP game had Directx 11 support and this game doesn't. That is kind of inconsistent on the part of Rebellion. The bullet ballistics are still pretty good although they have been made easier since the first game. After a pretty fast learning curve you will be able to snipe targets away pretty easily. So I do kind of wish that it could be harder to snipe targets, for the better kill satisfaction. The graphics are pretty decent, I just with the anti-aliasing applied to every jaggy out there.The X-ray slow-mo camera. You can shoot your enemy's gonads off, you can shoot their jaw off, you can destroy their rib cages, their kidneys, their heart, their lungs, their eyes. The skull can also be destroyed in many ways even when the enemy is wearing a helmet. You just never get tired of it. I am frankly surprised that other shooting games haven't attempted this before and it is 2012!The physics of the game are pretty good. There is plenty of destruction to go around. What I also loved is that if you make your character sit and then start slowly rotating the camera view either left or right, you will actually see your character chance stance by turning the torso and moving the legs. It just FEELS that you are controlling someone. Compare that with Skyrim's third person view. When you do the same thing in that game, your character will just start levitating in air without shuffling legs or changing the body position.The bullet ballistics are good but can get predictable. If you miss your first shot from afar, you can immediately adjust your aim to shoot either slightly to the left or to the right, depending on where the last bullet hit.The online co-op campaign, something that is missing in so many games, thanks for not having an emblem for that, gamespot. My buddy and I spent hours carefully going through the 11 NON-RECYCLED AND VARIOUS missions. Not only that, there is a horde mode, or the Kill Tally mode, (only 2 players), with 10 waves and an increasing amount of enemies plus enemy trucks, jeeps, halftracks and tiger tanks (last wave only). There are 3 maps for that, each with plenty of locations to hide and hold your ground. You can plant trip wires, mines, dynamite. You can also self ignite enemy vehicles by shooting their fuel tank. You can also kill two or three enemies at a time with one bullet and even kill them with ricochet when they are hiding. There is also a bombing run mode, where you and your partner attempt to collect auto parts for fixing a vehicle and extracting. It is much harder than Kill Tally. There is also an overwatch mode (3 maps only) wherein you and your partner can either play as a sniper or the attacker conducting the ground assault. Finally, there is team deathmatch, with 2 new additional maps that were just added by Rebellion a couple of days ago.The story is okaish but damn is it made up, straight out of Inglorious Basterds. You are an American (of course) sniper in Berlin in April 1945 (yeah right), killing Germans and....Russians (with American bullets, ooookay), who is supposed to stop the Russian launch of captured V-2 rockets with poisonous gas on London as a prelude for the Cold War. It's preposterous if you have any respect for history.There is a lack of stealth in the game. I mean you could do it in about half the missions but it's more fun just shooting ze Germans and ze Russkies. Whenever you decide to go stealth, make sure to snipe targets during a loud sound as to not alert nearby enemies. You can also search your slain enemies for the ammo and supplies. You can also pick them up and hide them. As you progress, you find new weapons that you can later use in multiplayer but there aren't that many of them.The sound is good. There are distant explosions in the background, there are low and high altitude planes flying. There isn't a single civilian in the entire game though.The enemies could use some work. They aren't terrible though. They shoot, they take cover, they change positions, they zigzag, they throw grenades, they pick up and treat their fallen comrades. The snipe from afar and CHANGE THEIR SNIPING POSITIONS. The only real thing that I would have liked is for them to stick to their cover for longer times if they are being shot at by the sniper. The slowing down of time is neat, but it makes the game super easy. That technique is meant for the controller, since you can't aim as well with the two sticks.Finally, this is a great game if you are looking for something fresh. I can only hope that Rebellion adds a map editor. There are just so many scenarios to invent here.  The game is somewhat innovative, fun and pretty solid.All in all, awesome game. Go ahead and support Rebellion. They have redeemed themselves after AVP.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

												First time I write a review here, so I might as well write it proper.As I see it, Sniper Elite falls between a number of chairs. It tries to have it's cake and eat it too, and suffers greatly due to it. It's part stealth, part action and long range focused. Problem is, there is no good way of planning attacks, the gameplay is linear and the sheer number of enemies makes this game in a much poorer condition than it could have been in.The offset is pretty good. There aren't alot of games that focuses on the role of the sniper/marksman out there, and so far nobody has really suceded in recreating that aspect of combat. The game tries to come off as realistic, having it's balistic model as one of it's most adverticed selling points. And to some extent, the bullet physics are great, exept bullets can't penetrate anything, even a wooden fence can stop these bullets. Only thing it actually does penetrate are foilage and bodyparts... the latter it doess rather well.The levels of the game does not invite the player to plan their attacks, as I stated earlier. In addition, there is far to much focus on close quarters combat for this to really take the art of sniping seriously. Snipers and marksmen are mainly covert operators, and they are usually only used for high value target and recon, not as the one man army portrayed in this game. The gameplay is repetative, unintuitive and plain booring in the long run, and it's far from as interesting as it could have been.It does, however, provide some entertainment if you have nothing else to do for 30 minutes, but as a game to sit down and enjoy for an evening, it doesn't serve at all.Hope that you'll find this review helpful, comments are welcome.

												Got this free on Steam. You should have done so too. This isn't entirely realistic, but it's one of those games which strikes a balance between realism and fun. It's challenging too. The story, however, is not very engaging. You are an OSS agent in WWII trying to assassinate German scientists before the Russians can get them, so not only will you fight German soldiers, but also Soviet soldiers. And there's was a lot of room to make a decent story; you are a secret agent carrying out missions that ""never happened"" after all. But anyway, on the the gameplay itself. As said already, it's great. Since you are a sniper, close combat is discouraged, and even though you have an SMG, it has limited ammo. For the best experience, I recommend you set the enemy skill to ""Veteran"", realism to ""limited"", and tactical assistance ""off"". Lower settings to me make the game too easy. That said, you have to praise Rebellion for making customizable difficulties. And the main feature of the game: the X-ray cam. It show just what a sniper bullet can do to your body. Can be quite satisfying, especially when fighting difficult enemies. This is cinematics done right. Fortunately, if you are squeamish, you can turn it off. Also, never underestimate a single foe: he can kill you easily. Speaking of the enemies, while they can pose a challenge, the AI could use some improving. This is evident when you see German and Soviet soldiers fighting each other; they will have no problem trying to kill you, but they seem to not cope well when fighting each other. The campaign has a decent length: 8-10 hours. And a second play-through is worth it. Multiplayer is quite fun too, you are all snipers. Element of surprise and awareness play an even bigger role here.So do I recommend this game? Yes. But you should have got it when it was free. Right now, it's $30, and I don't think that's a good price. If you didn't get a free copy, wait for a sale: this game is worth $20 to me.			",60,0,1,1,6,0,5

												I really wish I could recommend Sniper Elite V2... but I just can't. Which is weird because it's a game I enjoyed playing a lot.Let's start with the good things. Like many said before me, the sniping mechanics are incredibly well done. Sure, some would argue that you shouldn't have to adjust your scopes for a 100m shot, but the maps are relatively small, so it's kind of necessary to have such a drastic bullet drop in this game. It makes the gameplay more challenging and definitely more fun... and that's just the ballistics. The bullet cam and the X-ray vision are what make this game very unique. I don't think I've ever enjoyed sniping so much before.BUTThese surprisingly fun sniper-sections of the game aren't worth the 20€ you'd be spending on it. (Thank god I got it for free...) Why, you may ask? Because not only the campaign lasts only like 6 hours at most (played on the highest difficulty, which is the only way I would recommend playing this game), only half of it will be spent sniping like that. Which should be okay since you don't want to get bored, obviously. Variety is important you may say, but sniping is literally the only thing they got right in this game... and after an hour of gameplay, you're gonna wish you could just snipe from your safe vantage point again, instead of attempting to sneak through an army of enemies, then inevitably fail.You may have guessed by now that this game is supposed to be a stealth-based one. A mixture of sneaking your way through to the objective, then assasinate X and hunt the rest of the enemies nearby. That's how it should work.Guess what: it doesn't. Most of the time you're given a very linear map which is almost completely impossible to sneak through. There are other times where no matter how good you are, you literally can't be stealthy: as soon as you arrive to a checkpoint, you trigger waves of enemies coming at you, no matter how sneaky you are. Then you're left there alone, against hundreds(!) of commies or Jerries with your trusted sniper rifle... and nothing else, since your SMG is♥♥♥♥♥♥weak and carries up to 2 magazines at once, and your pistol is either used for stealth play (which is either useless or non-existent most of the time), or you could grab a Colt and attempt to benefit from the power of the .45ACP round and its rate of fire. Good luck with that.So the game forces you to snipe even in a CQB situation, which is absolutely ridiculous. You better grab your Gewehr 43.Even when stealth play is given, you'll just find it faster, more effective and more fun to shoot your way through the enemies anyway. The other features of the game (setting up traps for your enemy, using distraction, the controls, storyline, co-op and multiplayer) are either laughably bad or just plain useless.TL;DR: Fun sniping, bad everything else. Worth it if it's free, not worth it if you have to pay for it.5/10 for the amazing sniping parts			",63,3,4,1,6,0,7

												You'd think a game about snipers would allow you to proceed in stealth if you are careful and patient.Instead the developers met ever popular decisions like only spawning in enemy snipers if you leave your overwatch postion and cross the open market place without cover. Of course they are already magically alarmed and always know where you are, even if you took out everyone around in stealth by timing your shots with artillery impacts.Being constantly forced to fight firefights which you only win because you have more health and regeneration is incredibly bland and boring. I was hoping for a good sniper game where patience, planning and observation are key. What I got here is a game with twitch based aiming and lots of bullet time.And don't get me even started on the physics. It took me the entire first mission until I realized that I didn't have to lead my targets, bullets travel instantly.			",234,33,1,26,13,2,38

												This game is not a bad game, and its built on a solid premise, but theres quite a bit that the other reviewers do not tell about. So please read this knowing that it only means to highlight some things about the game. First off, this is a sniping sim played through a third person shooter lense, but it is not ""Realistic"" its ""Arcade"" The most you can have is wind and gravity, for many gamers this is much more than their normal sniping experience, but it is still very watered down. The game plays in one of two ways, either its ""Stealth mode"" where you get a little indicator that bombs are falling and can cover the sound of your shooting, or you basically play zombie survival with enemy soldiers, every ten feet a new wave comes. Its not very sniper-y, youll spend most of the game in the streets of Germany, where no one with half a brain would stick around (as in no sneaking into buildings or picking your path, the game forces it on you)Another important point is there is almost no sniper versus sniper strategy. You die in two shots from an enemy sniper, so poke your head out, take the shot, learn where they are, wait 15 seconds for your health to come back, peek back out and empty your clip in their direction. If theres more than one sniper, youll die in the two shots and have to restart the spot hoping that the random sniper spawn changes. The enemy snipers also spawn at predetermined times, so you cannot look through your scope at the next area looking for enemies, you literally HAVE to walk in and get shot at to find them in almost every situation. Again, the game is not bad, its a great sniper game for people who think basic wind and gravity are ""Hard"". The story also is not bad, it's a ww2 setting so it's hard to stand out but it manages to keep ones attention. Overall, it's good for a few hours of fun. The sniping, especially in the stealth portions, is fun, and the killcam part makes it more exciting to get crazy kills like Richochets or long distance headshots. That being said, the distances you shoot at with the rifles you use, in reality, would have very little if any bullet drop.The longest shot i took thus far was about 5 blocks away. Review is still positive because what the game promises is there, and it is fun! But keep in mind what you are buying, this is not a hardcore snipers game, this is an arcade style ww2 shooter. When the game wants you to be stealthy, it lets you know, when it doesnt, you dont have the choice to be.			",243,24,0,11,10,2,5

												I remember playing first Sniper Elite and, excluding incredibly helpful glitch allowing you to use your sniper without holding it in your hands (you just needed to use „aim” button :P), it was waaaaaaaay harder than V2, but I think it was equal in fun from playing. Rebellion spent waaaaaay too much time comparing their game to Call of Duty (regenerating health, „unexpected plot twists” ending in open battle and killfest, half of game in paid DLC etc.), camera works horribly (I can't imagine playing this on hardest difficulty where you don't have that indicator showing you that AI sees you, most of times I see walls instead of what is actually in front of me) and Welrod has absurd amount of reserve ammo (6/16, compare it to Luger's 8/49), but X-Ray kill cam really pays up for this. And ability to lure AI into traps, it was hardly possible in SE, but in V2 it is pretty easy, but still fun. Kill one guy with Welrod, put a land mine on him, set trip mine in front of him and throw a rock. If hopefully somehow AI won't see you sitting behind cover, then you should see nice „boom”.There is also one bad thing about this game: maps seem to be split into some kind of sections, where you can do anything you want and only few NPCs will be alerted – and there is no way shot from Springfield wouldn't be heard in whole facility set up in some kind of freaking cave. But hey, I got this game from giveaway and I didn't paid single cent for it. I shouldn't complain too much about it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you ever wanted to be the guy up in a bombed-out clocktower with a scope rifle taking out enemies?  If so, this is your game.  It's straightfoward and fun.  The AI is simple, but that doesn make it less enjoyable.  I haven't been frustrated yet by failing missions, so I take that as a good sign.

												I actually have been playing this series in an odd order. I completed SE3 first, then SE1 (Wasn't into it with it first came out, but recently became fond of it, probably after seeing what they did to it with V2 and 3), and now am wading through SE2. I liked SE3 quite a bit, it was a lot of fun, but my main gripe with it was the braindead AI and broken stealth mechanics. Which still exists here. But the upside was that SE2 was a bit more of a playground, and the AI were slightly more aggressive.So in Sniper Elite V2, you obviously play as a sniper, but you don't really feel like one at all. It just feels like it's on rails to me. Most often, the best thing to do when you see enemies is to just sit and one spot and shoot all of them. Yeah, even with the difficulty and realism settings on max. You don't even have to be good at it, honestly, just wait for your health to come back and pop out to rapid-fire snipe them until it hits them. Though there is a lot of reward to get headshots and vital shots without the diamond aim assist. With the aim assist you just get to feel badass.But sitting in one place for five minutes is bad, right? No, the AI (even at the highest difficulty) don't really do anything that forces you to move. You never need to set up traps like they show you in the tutorial, you'll barely get any good chances to use them. They lack the ability to perform fire-and-movement tactics, or flanking maneuvers, and grenades are easily dealt with by walking backwards. Just inch your gun out from behind cover to where nobody can shoot you, but you can shoot them. That's it. If they get too close you can just use iron sights on your rifle, or throw a grenade (they won't run away from them). All of the submachine guns are worthless (you're more likely to die using them than you are killing anyone with them). I haven't tried any pistol except for the Welrod, with its gloriously inaccurate 6-round magazine, so if they are any good I am unaware of it. Welrod is nice though. Even if you fail the miserable stealth system, just shoot them three times in a row with the welrod to kill, and no matter how much yelling they make, it won't attract anyone. It just stunlocks them. Actually, it doesn't seem like ANYTHING the AI says influences their fellow soldiers. Their speech is just empty, like only you can hear it.Speaking of stealth, it's simple. Don't be seen, don't be heard. Well, often times falling a short distance (maybe a foot off of some object, this is a normal thing when proceeding through the level) will cause some horrendous noise that alerts enemies half a block away from you, causing them all to walk around awkwardly shouting ""I know you're here, sniper!!"" ""Sniper no sniping!!"" ""What was that!? A sniper?!"". Yet shooting someone that is just a foot away from someone facing the opposite direction, having them scream and gasp and fall to the ground, will not alert them...this is exactly the problem I had experienced in SE3, and I get this crap in almost every level.Another thing, which is kind of interesting, is that there are some environmental noises that can mask your gunshot. But..it doesn't really make sense. Your gunshot is only masked if YOU are in range of the object that masks your noise. An enemy could be by a noise source and hear everything going on. But if you stand by a noise source and a bullet whizzes right past their face, they aren't going to notice a thing. Nope. Not even if it hits the wall right beside them.One time, I think it was the third level, in the underground factory or whatever it was, I had a big firefight on one of the big hallways. Of course all I had to do was crouch behind a table and shoot all six of those nazis. Despite all of their hollering and return fire, I walk into one of the side corridors, not even 10 meters away from a dead nazi, and there's a guy just peacefully walking along as if he didn't notice a thing.So basically, I don't know what anyone was expecting from these sequels. But I was coming to this hoping for an awesome, gritty, realistic, stealth-sniping game, and if you want that you can give SE1 a try, it's not great but it's good (really dated, might not be an issue for other gamers). What I got was more like a light gun shooter. This game could've been great, but everything about how the AI reacts to the player made it go all wrong. SE3 is better, but still has the same problems. And I'll probably get SE4 too just because it's supposed to be even more sandboxy.			",74,14,0,16,0,0,12

												I had always considered myself a level headed guy.  I've always walked away from a fight, avoided confrontation made sure to keep harsh comments at a low volume so that there was no chance that my intended target might hear me.  I'm not even big hunting, not that I have a problem with it.  I just don't want to see soft bunnies and cute squirrels get obliterated at the twitch of my finger. Apparantly, once you put a sniper rifle in my hands however, all that peace loving hoo haa goes right out the window.  The window I'm crouched behind as I take a deep breath, hold it, and draw a bead down on your unibrow as viewed through my scope. Is Sniper Elite V2 a perfect game?  Does it have a riveting story?  Are its graphics amazing?  Nah, not really.  It's a whole hell of a lot of fun though.  The guns feel great, they function great, and you can even notice slight differences in mechanics between the different rifles.  If you're looking for a twitch shooter, this isn't it.  However, if you're not good at twitch shooters?  Don't shy away from this, you get ample time and it's a blast!			",364,56,12,63,30,5,42

												A very detailed but basic sniper game that is satisfing to overcome.Pros--In-depth sniping experience-Simple levels but detailed-Very satisfying kill cam-Detiled level difficulty settings-Gather info on enemies and wind to line up the best shots Cons--Enemies can be overy precise with shots -Points where enemies know your location 24/7 regrdless of stealth-Poor close combat experiece-Levels seem repetitive-Unkown escape route makes planning useless unless re-played-Little storyThough there are many cons to this game and in total feels like a very extended set of mini demo levels with a thread of a story to tie it all together if you are looking for the most stisfying single player arcade like sniping experiece there is your best choice. I can not reccomend this game at it's current full price but i will suggest it for any sales it may have. You'll get  chance to pull off some great shots with the tools they give you for a very realistic sniping experience while identifying your target, distance, and wind.			",63,5,1,6,9,0,5

												First ""Sniper Elite"" titled game from Rebellion was disgustingly bad. It was pretentious, sure, and it created some vile fan community... But it was awful all over. Yet, it was upgraded, and it evolved into something better! ""Sniper Elite"" V2 isn't horrendous game, like V1. Now it's just silly. Sure, there is some ""unique"" charm, made by combination of intrusive usage of sniper rifles, with kinda tricky ""almost realistic"" ballistic part, and slow-mo ""x-ray bullet cam"" effect. Which is literally provokes people to make shot after shot, again and again, and see another dummy's brain or testicles splattered.But, again, all over it's just another silly game about World War II made by people who know nothing about it and don't give a shoot about it. And made for people alike, with carefully cultivated by the gaming industry bad taste for lame on-rail scripted shooters.What were the worst points in the Sniper V1? By gameplay terms, in the first place, the shooting was bad. All the weaponry in hands of player besides the main rifle, was nerfed up to no use. V2 saved that feature, as one of its own personality markings, but still, other guns now are slightly more useful. To the point when I'm able to do some room cleaning without long and clumsy scoped boomstick. Not good enough, yeah, but way better than it was.Next, the AI. Now, the player and his enemies are learned to take covers, and even walk around corners from different sides! Sure, they're still dummies, blindly running forward on your position, even on the hardest difficulty setting. Eagle-eyed snipers, who can peek you from great distance in one place, but will neglect your presence in close-combat range, are also there. The ""stealth"" part is also spoiled from the start to the end of the game - you'll never need that, anyway. Except for two optional achievements, in the DLCs ""St.Pierre"" and ""Neudorf Outpost"". But, but, all in all, AI is surely much more complicated than in the V1, and has some fairplay tricks to make you feel oppressed, at least in some moments. Respawning-stormtroopers-on-your-back cliche is still widely in use, sure. But now you can make some traps on your way, which seems kinda useful in some dire situations where you're supposed to hold the point for some time against hordes of enemies. That part was even kinda hilarious. But not all that useful, alas!The other bad part of Sniper V1 were level maps. There was about 5 of them for 28 ""missions""... And they were poorly made, for the most part. Except maybe, occasionally, there was a place to perform a shot for more than 300 meters range. In the Sniper V2, there are 10 maps for 11 game missions (+some dlc's, each is 1 new map for 1 new mission, usually). Each map in the V2 is usually covered in an half of an hour... Yeah, the maps are That Short. They're looking not bad overall, but it's all the same - narrow corridor, with the ability to walk around some house from one side or another - at most. So, the marketing passages about ""Sniper's choice"" and ""using the Environment""  are about the ""hide behind chest-high wall and squeeze the trigger as you please"". Since the maps are quite short, I doubt that many players will ever achieve range above 350-400 meters (except the very last shot of the game, which is not skill-based, by all means).Finally, the story and player's motivation. In the first game, the player was an American agent in '45 Berlin, dressed as german paramilitary, and killing soviet soldiers before they dig up some really dirty nazi secrets. In the second game, the scenario is slightly more evasive. Now, the Russians are not the targets just because they are Russians and Commies, and whatever. No, there they're planning to shoot the V2 rocket armed with some nerve gas from Berlin straight to London (3 times of its actual range) and pretend it was Nazies! And actual Nazies who made the rockets and the gas - are helping the Soviets with the attack! To make Germany's reparations even higher, supposedly. Yeah, I guess people who've bought CoD Black Ops will buy any kind of crud, coming as a ""history-based scenario"". Why not the Soviets bombing their Allies? Because that's what evil tyrants like Stalin always do, right? Or not? Oh, who cares! Just pop more heads and see their brains exploded, that's what this game about!Finally, before I set my mark, I'll say a few words about multiplayer there. It is always a room full of campers, isn't that great? Well, I know some good shooters where some maps are made for this kind of self-entertainment... But to make all the multiplayer around campers is surely extreme way of thinking. Even the fact that ballistic there, with bullet derivation and all that, in reality looks quite arcade and dumbed down... Well, like I said from the beginning, the game is silly and stupid. And better than the first one. And aimed to some blood-thirsty 13-years-old maniacs who're not caring about whom to shoot, or why.Mark is 6/10. And downvote, for it's all still not fun enough.

												This game is a sad waste of potential, just like everything else that comes out of Rebellion. There's a wonderful ballistics model, and the kill-cam is really nice, but the rest of the game is an awful slog. You're given a handful of items, none of which will ever be helpful. Your silenced pistol is too inaccurate to use beyond literally a few in-game feet. If you're hiding outside a doorway and your enemy is on the other side of the room, you've got maybe a 30% chance of hitting his head. You won't want to aim anywhere else, hitting him anywhere else just sets him off. Rocks will trigger enemies, but can distract them for about a half-second. I haven't ever used them because if I'm that close and they don't know I'm there, I'd rather just shoot them with the pistol. I won't touch on the SMG, it's so inaccurate and has so little ammo that they might as well have ignored it. You're better off spamming your rifle, stunlocking with the pistol, or more likely just letting them murder you so that you can restart.I hear rumors about things known as ""stealth"" and ""flanking"", though I've never seen them nor have I ever seen an opportunity for them to manifest. That's not a lack of skill, there's just no other path to take. The first level is within a bombed-out city, which means that there are a handful of buildings you can go in, and everything else is invisible walls and rubble. There is one path winding through the streets, and you have to walk through the open in order to get to the next objective. The first two missions might as well have been on rails for all the freedom you're given. Waypoints and invisible walls push you ever forward, you're never given any reason nor opportunity to place traps on enemies, move bodies you've shot, or otherwise use the level organically. This issue is compounded by the fact that the enemies will spawn in and re-arrange themselves spontaneously depending on your ""progress"". This means that you'll pretty much never be able to place TNT as traps, you can only trigger them by shooting them. In order to use it as a trap, you'd have to manually place it next to an enemy, then backtrack to a vantage point and trigger the explosives. In lieu of that you could just shoot the enemy from the vantage point and skip the middleman, or sneak up on the enemy and use the silenced pistol. However, the latter option is likely to trigger enemy rearrangements or spontaneous reinforcements as you approach. Enemies are super-eagle-eyed, so you can forget about sneaking around within 100 feet of an enemy unless they're scripted to stare away from you forever until shot. That could change as you get closer, they could spontaneously shift into a patrol route because you passed through an invisible trigger. The awareness indicator is low to the ground, hard to see, and if it's there you've pretty much already tipped them off to your location. This goes double for snipers, who spawn in only when you're about to blindly encounter them, and they are set up so that they will always immediately spot you and engage. If you manage to cheat the detection system through a combination of luck and respawn-based clairvoyance, that still makes them the first target you *have* to shoot in order to progress. On the second level, they're placed so that they can't see you, but that's only so that you can exploit the noise mechanic. The noise mechanic doesn't care about ambient sounds, there's an indicator that pops up when specific events happen (like a train horn), and during that interval you can do *anything* without drawing attention. At all other times, every spawned enemy will hear every shot, and all nearby enemies will track upright footsteps. While enemies are eagle-eyed, they are forgetful. If you're lucky no one has Line of Sight to you and you can wait the minute or so that it takes for all the enemies to assume you've given up and gone home. Be prepared to use and abuse this feature.My suggestion is to download the demo. If you enjoyed blowing people's brains out, play the level again. That's the level right after the tutorial, copied entirely. It never gets better than that level right there. The maps are just as restrictive, the enemies spawn/rearrange spontaneously in the same ""just to F*ck with you"" maner, and the objectives are never more than ""go here"", ""plant the thing"" or ""shoot the guy"". I don't blame you for enjoying the shooting, I certainly did. There's just no reason to purchase the full game. No other part of the experience is worth the investment, if you're only there for the shooting than you might as well stick with the demo that lets you shoot stuff for free. If someone's done a Let's Play of this game from start to finish, you should just watch that and be done with it. You can't play this game any other way, the only variable would be your personal shooting performance. To simulate that, I refer you back to the demo.			",417,83,7,25,18,4,49

												Hrnngh/10If you already have it, you should give it a punt. You should maybe buy it on sale or something. But it's definitely not a full price purchase, as far as I'm concerned. It tries do to curious stuff, but fails more often than not. There's some nice verticality to the level design at times, and I like how it discourages close quarter combat by making you vulnerable and letting you carry a pitiful amount of submachine gun ammo. There's also a level where you're caught in a crossfire between the Germans and the Russians, having to fend off waves of soldiers from both sides while you slowly claim ground towards your target. It is The Acest Thing.At times, Sniper Elite is an amazing powertrip. I once had three enemies in close proximity - one patroling, and two standing guard. I took one of the static ones out, masking my shot with the ringing of a church bell. While the patroling soldier was examining the body, I took the other surviving guy out in a similar way. As the sole survivor turned around, he found another dead body, having no clue what was happening. I like to think he was pretty bewildered as a speeding bullet entered his skull.Ultimately, I spent a lot of time carefully planning a stealthy infiltration, stealthy assasination and stealthy exfiltration that never was. The checkpoints were too far apart to restart every time I was noticed, and I was noticed far more often than I would've liked. The thing is, I feel like it wasn't really my fault most of the time. The conveniently loud artillery fire would misteriously cease indefinitely as soon as I picked off my first target. Enemy reinforcements would magically appear in places I've already sweeped. Cheap stuff like that.I had fun for a couple of hours, but I came close to giving up on it several times.			",250,93,5,49,17,2,41

												A average, maybe even decent game and with the little amount of sniper games available, it might be worth it. But for me, the bad definitely outweighed the good and I often got tired of it or dropped it for a while out of frustration, not at least with the terrible autosave system. If you buy it cheap on sale (personally I got it for free in a short promotion offer on steam), it isn't a waste, but the money could be used so much better and for an older (and short) game it is quite expensive.The good:- Quite good sniper mechanics including wind and bullet drop (meaning that you often have to fire a bit over and to the left of the target to hit it, which is realistic).- Kill cam shows you the bullet penetrating your target in x-ray.- You can hit grenades in enemy belts and make them explode.- Graphics are quite good.The bad:- The third person looks provide you with a hell of a camera angle, often meaning that you can't see an enemy if he's right in front of you and you are standing close to a wall.- No real training possibilities meaning you need to practice shooting on the go. This is a problem in a sniper games as it means that you will newer really master how to hit a far away target precisely where you want to, that is, to calibrate the wind and bullet drop. At least not until you are almost finished with the game anyway.- The autosave is very bad and means some place that you might need to play through half an hour of combat again if you die. Also, to me it seems like some places, the enemies kept coming closer and closer every time I restarted at checkpoint giving me very little time to react and therefore dying a lot of times.- There is a general lack of genuine good sniping positions. Most positions are of the kind where you would be dead in five minutes in real life. In real life, a good sniping position is NOT sitting behind a small box in the middle of the road, but a place where you can fire without being spotted and then move to another good sniping position before you fire again. This is more or less impossible in this game.- While stealth is a possibility, most parts of the game more or less enforce you to chose between rambo or rambo-ligth approaches. A real sniper doesn't stand in one position blasting down 15 enemy soldiers firing in on him or assaulting a compound with a submachine gun killing off 50 soldiers.- There should be a more realistic game mode whit less help for when you want a challenge. In this you should be able to set off your own landmines and trip-mines if you don't pay attention to where you put them and there shouldn't be bullet lines to help you spot where people are shooting at you from.- The plot is bad and extremely right-wing USA coldwar hawkish. You fight to liberate nazi war criminals as long at they will help the USA build weapons or kill them if they want to do the same for the USSR. You don't assist in winning the war, on the contrary you actually delays the advance of the Red Army thereby prolonging the war and the suffering of both soldiers and civilians in the war zone or living in areas still under nazi control. Actually, you even kills lots of allied soldiers of the red army.- There are a few bucks in the game, but when they happen, they are major. Like a wagon full of German soldiers not moving at all while I stand right next to it killing them one by one.- There is no real aiming with other weapons than the sniper riffle, no real use of iron-sight but instead a cross point with a large spread of bullets, even at very close range .... like 1 meter.- The game is too split up in ""zones"". Meaning that you can't really lure most enemies away from the small area they start in. It would be cool if you could fire at them, luring them to follow you into a building which you had filled with traps offering you a more realistic way of taking out a lot of enemies and making landmines and the like much much more practical usable in this game.Also, the game is quite short, which can be both a good and a bad thing in my opinion.

												In my opinion this is one of the best sniper games or even best sniper game so far honestlygame atmosphere makes you feel that you're a real sniper :) especially the gravity, wind, recoil, scopes and the good sound of rifles and rest of guns, also the graphics, physics and many more had a Significant progress in Compared with the first Sniper Elite in series * in addition 4 DLC with new rifles,pistols,smg and new campaign missions could be more effective on your gameplay experiencesThe only issue is annoying about this game are the bugs and glitches in some multiplayer maps that could be disgusting a little about this game especially when you play in TDM mode, by the way the bugs are inseparable part of all games atm Less or More.

												Equipped with a sniper rifle, your protagonist must traverse through various WW II locales to eliminate high-ranking Nazi officials. The story gets interesting when you find out one of the officials is actually a traitor who has vital information as to what the Nazis are preparing for in their desperate attempt to turn the tides. This game is the epitome of long-range warfare! Sniping enemies has never been more fun! The Ghost Warrior games are nowhere near as exciting as Sniper Elite. The game regularly awards your long-distance, deadly shots with a slow-motion cutscene during which you can see the gory (and glorious) results of your doing. Quite often you get to see how the bones and organs are crushed within the enemies' bodies. Seeing how the heart of an MP40 wielding soldier explodes can be quite disgusting but also quite invigorating!Unfortunately, while the titular activity in this game is very well carried out everything else in the combat is quite mediocre. Close-combat fight can be quite difficult - it is next to impossible to get a headshot with an MP40 or a Thompson. It is as if the creators deliberately weakened all the other weapons just to force you to use the sniper rifle at all times. Not the mention the amount of bullets you have at your disposal - you will almost never run out of bullets while sniping. I get their point - still, a more refined system could have been put in place. I heard completing a major part of the game is possible via stealth gameplay - some of the achievements can only be obtained by taking this route. Still, I did not find the insta-kills interesting enough - I had several failed attempts due to the clunky movement of our character. Setting traps is also possible; we have tripmines, landmines and dynamites. Too bad it is quite rarely a must during the roughly 8-hour long campaign.Those of you who've already read my Nazi Zombie Army reviews must know how much I hate both games. I hate that you have an excellent idea but the execution is just horrible. Connecting to a host took ages and drops from the multiplayer game were frequent. With Sniper Elite V2's campaign I hate them even more as I can now see what levels the creators recycled to get their campaign ready. And now that I've mentioned the DLC titles I can confirm I did not find any cooperative / multiplayer sessions, at all. I expected this, though.Putting aside the non-existing online gameplay sessions Sniper Elite V2 offers a rather lengthy and great campaign. I do not know what can be more fun than taking out a tank by hitting its fuel tank with a well-aimed shot! This game is THE sniping game. Period!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												I picked this up on Steam in the ""collection"" version when it was on sale for a bit under $20. I've only been playing this for twenty-some odd hours now, but I really like it. I find myself replaying missions over and over chasing that perfect run, and trying out different tactics. Last night I played a mission pretty cleanly, and didn't get shot once so I got the ""Hide and Hope"" achievement. It felt like I had actually accomplished something! This game has reminded me of how much I like stealth mechanics, and slow, tactical gameplay. Now I've ordered other similar games for my library that I never played for some reason (Hitman series, Splintercell series). In fact, even though I'm less than half way through this campaign (and haven't played any of the coop), I went ahead and got Sniper Elite 3 and its season pass (together for $35, thanks internet!).The gameplay is very deliberate, if you like a run-n-gun style, this won't work for you. I really appreciate the tension and atmospherics in this game. Often even when I know I can safely run in a section, I will choose not to just because I hate making so much noise. Your sniper rifle is your best weapon. Your secondary has very limited range and accuracy, and also limited ammo on the battlefield (though there are strategies to improve this). You have to think like a sniper, don't shoot from a window, shoot from deep within the room, from the shadows (bonus, increased distance points!). Pulling off a perfect mission takes patience and strategy. Pulling it off with style takes experimentation and creativity (I pulled off the final stage of mission 4 using only traps last night). Maneuvering through the maps without ever being spotted is incredibly satisfying, and in some missions, incredibly difficult. Progressing your accuracy from all hits, to all headshots, to all through the eye or through the ear shots (beautifully confirmed by the amazing kill-cam) feels great. Doing that to 3-4 enemies in a row, all in a single breath feels amazing. This is really some kick♥♥♥♥♥sniping. And you can make it even more kick♥♥♥♥♥by tweaking the difficulty in a fairly flexible way. The in-game collectibles are completely meaningless, getting them all doesn't confer any kind of stat bonus or unlock new equipment, but I still like finding them as it satisfies that inner OCD (especially the bottles).The lack of a save system could be seen as a down side. It's checkpoint only. So if you screw something up, you may have to repeat a decent chunk, though they are usually pretty close together once you figure out the optimum pattern for a particular map.

												Not at all as good as it looks in trailers. Zero ballistics (and this is indeed a sniping game) and an ""OK"" for the release date, graphics, alongside with a boring multiplayer and ""nothing different to offer"" than the single player co-op mode. Soviet & Russia Fobic campaign missions and main character stupidity. Very interesting and original mature killcam idea and very pretentious music, which feels good in this game. After all still a good game because it has the feel of a good old WW2 shooter.			",205,44,6,13,13,1,41

												It's fun for about 10 minutes. Kill cam is ""Killer!"" but loses it's charm, again, in about 10 minutes.Played this game from the outset on 'sniper elite' difficulty.The AI is terrible. This is a mostly, on-rails, linear shooter with terrible AI. Enemy snipers spawn out of no where on several missions and can see you no matter what you do or how sneaky you've been. They will ALWAYS get the first shot off before you. It really takes away from the stealth part of a snipers job and it just feels like a scripted, rollercoaster ride that has you being a sniper who really can't enjoy the skills of that role.After a while of getting killed by super, x-ray vision, spawning snipers, it becomes a game of 'memorizing where they will spawn so you can shoot them' game.I bought it at a huge discount along with SE v1 and V3. Haven't tried V3 yet. Hope they fixed the AI/spawning, cause it's terrible.EDIT 10/07/2015  I'm done with Rebellion now that I know they're Trademark Trolls to the name ""Rebellion.""

Product received for free
												Here's why i cannot recommend this game:*Campaign missions lack diversity. Every mission feels the same*Bullet cam gets really repetitive really quickly*Although there were a few occasions where it was possible for background noises to cover up sniper shots, most of the time the only way taking down enemies quietly was by using a handgun called Welrod.*Using weapons other than Welrod results most likely in completely blowing your cover.*AI is awful: poor dialogues/monologues, dumb movement (why would they run out of cover when they now they are being pinned down by a sniper?)*Enemy seems to have either aimbot/wallhax or both.*Level design is just so bad. I felt forced to just go down one given path.*Game mechanics (tripmines, mines, dynamite etc) are useless most of the time. It is really frustrating when i am at the other side of the map from where a soldier dies from my planted mine and suddenly everyone knows my exact location and knows that a sniper has planted the mine (from their monologues)I could go on... these are just few major cons.Multiplayer was not the best but it was at least playable.Overall the only thing working decently was the uninstall button.

												In Sniper Elite V2, you take the role of the worst marksman the collective allied powers could muster who is sent on a high-stakes covert mission by his superiors from within intellegence agencies to destroy progress Nazi superweapons, the V2 Rockets. You know. As a joke. To aid him, you gain access to a wide arsenal of submachineguns that your international assassin can just barely figure out which end is which on, pistols that are all broken and work improperly to some degree and high-power battle rifles with worn-out rifling, thousands and thousands of rounds of reduced power ammunition, and increasingly powerful optics made in the back of a moving truck that are incapable of any adjustment.Coincidentally, as you undergo your mission, the magnetic field of the earth becomes much more powerful in Europe. Thousands die. This forces the people of Europe to redesign their roadways to only go in straight lines though low-magnetism areas, so there is only one path throughout all of the missions. On top of this added challenge, your projectiles (which are low velocity to avoid radar detection) are being wrestled to the earth, clawing all well-made death machines to an estimation of 3,679 Minute of Angle accuracy. To make up for this handicap, though, your infantry rifles do have anti-tank capabilities and the majority of your opponents are firing at you with fire hoses filled with lead fishing weights.As far as the plot goes, it's your normal fare. It's a historic fiction game set between 1939 and 1945 very similar to others such as Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, etc. Now I have a bone to pick. These games all rip eachother off in their writing. Their characters all look the same, even have the same names, the games all take place at the same times in the same places. I mean, compare the main antagonist of this game, Adolf ""Fuhrer"" Hitler, to that of the Adolf Hitler character in any of the games I mentioned previously. What hacks. They even all have the same moustache. Is it really so hard to come up with your OWN setting? How about you call your war something other than ""World War Two""? What about the first one? And why Germany? Why not something like Antagonistia or Detroit for a name? Some of the most uncreative writing I've ever found in a video game. Although, later in the game, I do like the twist where your character is bitten by a radioactive Nazi and gains x-ray vision, which reveals that the Nazis were really skeletons all along. It adds a nice twist to the setting and what I think would have actually happened were this a real war.I would recommend this game for young readers ages 8 to 12 who are hypoglycemic, get in excess of 40 hours of sleep a day, are multilingual, and have chronic vestigial flight capabilities.

												I honestly couldn't get through this game. It's a ""stealth"" game, but not really. Truly it's an action game and a decent shooter that requires a somewhat logical thought process to get through, but that slowly goes away as you progress.The level design is unclear, enemies are the same throughout the game, and it has the generic storyline and fighting that every WWII video game has. It's alright, but I got it for free and still didn't enjoy it much.My 13 year old brother said this, better than I could have, probably:7:42 AM - [REDACTED]: Sniper Elite is the worst game I've ever played7:43 AM - [REDACTED]: I don't know how you put up with the gameplay for so long; it tries to be a stealth game and a sniping game but fails at both7:44 AM - [REDACTED]: You essentially have to go loud every interaction with enemies because of the level design and the fact it is just easier7:44 AM - [REDACTED]: Most of the map design is also really close range so the sniping is out of the question7:45 AM - [REDACTED]: It's like it tries to be Hitman but instead of encouraging you to stealth and not kill anyone, it encourages you to kill everyone but do it silently7:45 AM - [REDACTED] and even when you ignore all of that it's just flat out not fun7:48 AM - [REDACTED]: Every negative review for this game is really detailed, which is really good7:49 AM - [REDACTED]: I was hoping that a realistic sniper game would be about long preparations with sudden bursts of violence. The tutorial that teaches the player to lay traps made me hopeful, but then the real maps were just as linear as the tutorial maps. There is no scouting of the location, no finding alternative exits, etc. There is only one road and after you take your sniping shot, the game will tell you when to run and which way to run. This game resembles typical shooters way more than I'd like it.I'm not an expert on AI, but it takes me out of the game when the enemy is coming towards me in a single line one by one and they don't react when I shoot them one by one. It also breaks the illusion when the level designers intentionally set up a bossfight-esque event when dozens of enemies are aware of me and shooting at me and I have to snipe them all before I can go on. These kind of things shouldn't be orchestrated, but naturally emerge from the gameplay.All in all I was very disappoined by this game as a sniper game, especially because this title is such well recognized as a good sniper franchise.7:49 AM -[REDACTED]: However, I expected a game where you sneak from sniper position to sniper position and where you have to be careful and think where you go, who you kill, what you do, stuff like that. I did this in the first misson, until I ""discovered"" that you can just run through the levels and basically noscope anyone in front of you. Soon sneaking through the streets and houses and throwing like a million stones to distract the completely idiotic enemies was something I didnt even think about anymore.. (One ran into a house and got himself stuck by laying down and trying to turn around, stuff like that happend pretty often to me.) At one point i felt like rambo, just with a sniper. In the mission where you have to enter a german V2 Facility I just ran through it and killed everyone with my sniper. Sneaking? Or any gameplay depth? I didn't experience any.Also there was something about a story, but it didn't really matter nor did it make me feel connected to the guy I was playing.""			",311,60,5,26,21,1,18

""WAS IST DAS""I'm ready for downvotes so be my guest.Now, Rebellion make jokes. They don't make products, they make jokes. Or the whole company might be joke. I bet even devs itself think that they do jokes. They catch the laugher straight in the morning immidiately after they wake up because of what they gonna do in the work. So, Rebellion found out that they can make one game and out of that they can do another 5 same repetetive same mechanics same sh*t games, sell them for♥♥♥♥♥♥ rice them dollars and put another f*ckton of DLC content which is another repetetive BS to every game. Fuhrer for 10€ in 2 / 3 / 4 Sniper Elite LOLLOLOL.Now, I ain't hating because they make that dollar. Those who knows me knows what I do. I love to support great startup, I love when fellas around are successful and most definitely I love when guys get good money for the hard work they did. You know that saying ... ""Successful people want others to be successful."" But don't forget this doesn't apply to everybody. Rebellion might be even worse than EA. LMFAO.Now, to people that reads my review, my apologies that you had to read this. I got little fed up with this bussiness model. I'm done with them. No more games from them (except Alien vs. Predator) and I ain't even going to get DLC for V2. Also people have to keep in mind that company could care less about few lost customers, but if everybody who don't like what's going on in gaming industry these days keep distance away from toxic stuff, companies would have to change the way they handle bussiness.REVIEW FOR GAME IS BELLOW THIS!Sniper Elite V2 will take you deep to Germany inside ruined Berlin. Of course, cliché again, you're there to save world from destruction. Game contains 10 missions that I have to say will be same. Go there, destroy this, go there, save this, go there, survive this, go there, kill this. Yes, it's sniper action game but come the hell on, do some creative work there.Story will last you easily under 9 hours. Overwatch is just a little bonus that might add hour or two. CO-OP feature makes game a little bit enjoyable because of your companion. DLCs I'm not even going into that again. But if you want to snipe Fuhrer then be my guest. Visually game is alright, audio is awful for me. I wasn't able to enjoy the city, surroundings, atmosphere, not even shooting. Sound just wasn't good for me. But sniping mechanics itself was great. I must say that. Distance, wind, heart, all matters. X-Ray cam was awesome idea. But on the other hand, other gaming mechanisms sucks hard. Everything outside sniping just sucks so bad. Sometimes even his moving around gets you annoying. Stealth is weak, AI is terrible, checkpoints are not correctly choosen, whole game missing logic and overally just don't buy it.Bonus Point: Jokes & BallsRating: 3/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												Finished Sniper Elite V2. Took me exactly 8 hours according to in-game statistics actually. A bit sooner than I expected but just the right time. It was getting tedious.It's a third-person shooter with a clear focus on long-range sniping, set in the last days of World War II. You play as a generic American sniper with the mission to eliminate five German rocket scientists before they can escape to Soviet Russia. This is it. This is the amount and depth of the story and characters. I don't remember a single name of the scientists or high-ranking German officers. I don't even remember my own name or if it was ever told. You could call it shallow, a backdrop or just not a focus of the devs which is fine because Sniper Elite V2 feels like a budget production, so it's natural for it to be lacking in visuals, polish and presentation in general.They did however put enough focus on what matters, the actual sniping. It is simply fun. What also makes it stand out is the gratuitous, excessive violence of the slow-motion x-ray kill-cam. It never got not satisfying to watch organs, skulls, gonads and bones get shredded.The game's structure is very straightforward with corridor-like maps that leave little room for different approaches. This surprised me as sniping could be done in a more open map design. It's not a detriment to the game though. This way missions take not too long and avert becoming tedious hunts. Besides your sniper rifle you also have a submachine gun and a pistol which will be used not as often. This is a good thing since close-quarters combat is lacking.On that front I feel the need to advise against a stealth playstyle. The mechanics are just not well implemented and the results are frustrating and unsatisfying. Once I abandoned stealth after the first few missions, my enjoyment with the game increased significantly. I feel the devs knew this as well, since there are no missions which have stealth requirements which is odd since there are stealth mechanics like carrying corpses, timing shots to ambient noise, visibility markers etc. They just don't work well on top of a lack of manual saving and bad, bad AI. As an action shooter it is a fun time.I do recommend giving this a try. Just leave any expectations of story at the door and prepare for a glorious shooting gallery.			",456,119,8,39,40,3,51

												Sniper Elite V2 is a third person shooter that takes place during World War 2. The game is less of a run and gun shooter and more on stealth. I never did get into any multiplayer gaming and just played the solo campaign (I am not much for multiplay when the game offers an excellent campaign play through).I was one of the lucky people to get this game when Steam was offering it for free (for a 24 hour period) so I figured I would try the game out. Why not if its free right?I was impressed with the use of history and how it made for the story line during my first few minutes of play. I liked how the bullet cam worked as well. Taking aim at a very long shot after controlling your breathing then firing your rifle you will see your bullet travel all the way from your barrel to the target.What I was most impressed with was the X-Ray kill cam. At certain moments when you have a shot and fire you get an X-Ray of the target and get to see the skeleton and organs get damaged as the bullet travels through. Its pretty gruesome and for my first time seeing this I was amazed at the effects and coolness of it. I wouldn't say its true to life but well done for a video game.I didn't notice any issues with the game while playing but I did find that it relied on triggered events. For instance, I get in a building and hang back then use my sniper rifle scope to check the area ahead and don't notice anyone around. I fire a shot and nothing, so I creep up to the doorway and then the enemy's spawn.Setting yourself up to a vantage spot is very useful. In a solo campaign where you camp at a good spot and peg off anyone around is a good tactical move for playing a sniper in any game or any game mode.You do have other tools at your disposal like trip mines. Setting on up in a door way then heading up to the second floor and getting some kill shots off only to hear the trip wire go off makes me smile. Its an easy kill plus a good method to alert you to move to another spot.The main campaign story was also good. At the beginning of every mission there was a briefing as to the scenario to play out and what was needed to be done, all of it was voiced.I played the game with the Xbox 360 controller and Sniper Elite V2 is very friendly for controller support. I can't see myself playing this game with the keyboard and mouse.I have to admit this game was addicting and I did spend allot of time trying to get the X-Ray kill cam to happen. If it wasn't for that I don't think the game would offer all that much. The bullet cam is cool but its the X-Ray kill cam that really makes the game interesting.Now I got this game when it was free so I can't really say if its worth the price because when something is free of course its worth the price. However the game is currently $29.99 and although thats not a bad price I would wait till its on sale or the price drops to $9.99. You may also want to wait till the game and the DLC come bundled together for $29.99. Either way the game is fun and worth a play.Pro'sX-Ray kill camBullet CamIts a true Sniper gameVoiced mission briefingsDecent A.I.Con'sTriggered EventsHave to go through a couple menu's to finally exit out of the gameCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː			",162,43,4,22,23,2,10

												Sniper Elite V2 is a bad case of a game trying to do what it isn't supposed to do. It markets itself as a sniper game. And I will admit it is very good at that. The sniping in the game is very satisfying and interesting. It's very fun trying to line up a good shot after factoring in the bullet drop and other factors. The slow motion and X-ray effects are great, they make you feel like you're powerful. Unfortunately, the game tries way too hard to be an action game at the same time. You spend more time sneaking around and shooting than sniping. Stealth plays an important part in the game, but it's done very poorly. There are no ways to easily kill guards silently, and your 'silent' crouch is extraordinarily slow. Simply put, stealth feels very sluggish and forced into the game. I found it a lot more satisfying just to pull out a gun and force my way through the stealth sections.Speaking of which, the gunplay in this game is awful. The camera controls don't work very well, and the guns feel completely useless. You feel like you're using a peashooter as the enemies shrug off bullets. No to mention there are way too many of these sections in the game. Why is it called ""Sniper Elite"" when you're using an SMG or pistol for 50% of the game?Overall the game is so terribly mediocre in all aspects I find it impossible to recommend. If you're looking for a really good stealth and sniping game, try the first game. But if you're looking for a competent game that doesn't bore the hell out of you, don't try this.

												If you want to play as a bad♥♥♥♥♥sniper soldier then this is the game for you. Amazing shot and bullet time effects as the bullet hits your target. Really good graphics and sound. Gameplay is okay although I'm not so good with shooters. Has replay value if you want to experiment and try different aproaches. When you hear the word ""sniper"" you expect to be hidden, stealth action and such, but this game is not exactly about stealth although you can avoid detection sometimes.Got it for free! Have nothing to complain.			",212,57,7,16,13,7,17

												This game has got to be one of the greatest I've played.You begin with the character Naomi Xian, a chip off the old block kid, whose life becomes threatened when Australian invaders exploit the land. With nobody standing up to the Aussies, Naomi is quick to act fast and places the entire land in peril. Naomi then finds himself trapped in a world of drugs, money, fame, and power, forcing him to make decisive decisions that will impact him throughout the whole game.With this in mind, the player has full control over Naomi through the perk system, skill tree, etc, and, through the RPG based aspect of the game, the player can develop Naomi into a complete versatile weapon of good, or evil - I personally made my first Naomi a level 13 Orc Mage hybrid with an Archer build.Besides the story, and character, the game also offers immense graphics with minimal invisible walls - I repeat: minimal invisible walls, literally none. This, added with superb AI, offers an action packed game bursting with possibilities! This AI also includes real time situations with real time reactions; enemy soldiers will be able to manoeuvre around obstacles, definitely ensuring 100% that they will not go prone and stare at the obstacle blankly, whilst trying to fathom the meaning of ""lyfe"".I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in any form of RPG, as the open-world design, with unlimited freedom, truly allows you, and you only, to choose Naomi's destiny...

												Game graphics are a good upgrade compared to Sniper Elite v1. Enemies are not too bad when using Elite difficulty. They will hunt you in teams on ground level and keep going after you as you try to evade them. AI could be better if enemies, once alerted, always kept under cover and went from cover to cover. The game is mostly interesting when played with a friend in coop : 2 players, doing campain together, on Elite difficulty with no aiming help. In coop MP it's ok. You can play it alone, will keep you occupied for 20 to 25 hours. What is missing is a map editor, something where you could load any game map and MP map, put enemies, make patrols, or static surveillance with angle of surveillance (an editor like GRAW did offer would be nice). With such an editor, we could create a lot of maps. Add random spawning of enemies on map when you get spotted, random enemies positions and it would be great.Since V3 is out now and offers a 4 player coop, I would suggest this game mostly for playing campain with 2 players.Alone it's ok but not as fun as in coop. I did not suffer any bug nor crash while playing it from Windows 7 64-bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good things:+ not that many World War II games this days.+ graphics are decent.+ bullet physics.+ x-rays kills are awesome.+ you can get some pretty sick no-scopes. :D Bad things:- sometimes stealth is broken.- controls are clunky.- enemy acting like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when they are aware of you.- repetitive missions.- the Colt M 911 pistol sounds like god damn sniper rifle.- sometimes you can't jump a little wall/window.- the recoil on the assault weapons is crazy like thay say: '' please don't use me ''I'm glad I got it for free.

												I just finished the game, and it's fantastic. You should play it on ""Sniper Elite"" difficulty, it's a real challenge on some sections full of enemy snipers.This is how it runs (it still looks very good):

												A quick one today, having played the original Sniper game I was already expecting a pleasant playthrough. There is just something about watching a bullet explode a man's nut-sack that makes any game that little bit more enjoyable.The slick graphics makes you actually feel like you are wading the streets of Berlin. Some excellent visuals throughout the playthrough. I only hit the single player as multiplayer seemed a little dead, so the run was a little short at three and a half hours, but I wasn't too fussed about that as Steam actually released this game for free for a day a couple of weeks back, so hopefully most people will have it already. Story-wise, it is very much like a pre-cold war setting, so anyone who likes stories set in that era will certainly enjoy following the plot. I on the other hand, was more focused on the gameplay. Being able to snipe through hoards of enemies from your chosen hidden location is so satisfying, you can often take on ten or twenty enemies at the same time, you feel bad♥♥♥♥♥by the end of it all. If you haven't already got the game in your library from the free event a few weeks ago, this is certainly one you should be playing. Sadly it is still fairly expensive at £22,99 so you may be best waiting for it to go on sale			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												The plot is painfully stupid. Game teaches you that backstabbing your allies is okay even if they already have a rocket technology (BM-13). The AI is stupid, music is awful and maps are just boring brown corridors.			",538,117,29,69,43,5,78

												For a game that i got for free, there was nothing to be dissapointed about, though the game seems kind of hard in a first few campaigns you will realize after a while that you have to use the same exact strategy everywhere...duh!!So when you get bored of solo campaign you will atlast give co op a chance(if you have ""friends"") and eventually you will realize its not that good either. So you can play it, if you got it for free. I completed the campaign expecting something interesting atleast in the end but...!!			",165,17,12,11,9,4,6

												Okay, if your favorite slice of the FPS pie is sniping, you might want to give this a go. I got it for free during a 24 hr Steam giveaway, but after having played it through I'd probably pay at least $10 for it. That's not much of a recommendation, but read on if you want to know why I take this particular stance. It's WW2, and you're a sniper working for American interests at the end of the war. The storyline is okay, not superb, but passable. Well, mostly--the ending is a bit much, but no spoilers here. You are fighting against German and Russian troops while attempting to keep V2 rocket technology from falling into Communist hands. Stock World War II characters and situations are prevalent with no memorable bad guys. I played through the entire solo campaign in less than 24 hours, and while certain battles and moments have stayed with me, a lot of it is fading into one long blur of FPS glory.The Good:The sniping can be, at times, truly amazing. The first time you breathe out and squeeze the trigger and watch the slow motion display of the carnage wrought by your well-aimed, well-timed shot, you will feel truly repulsed and rewarded at once. The usual sniping of FPS with either ragdoll physics or the flicking of a light switch effect that seem standard are largely replaced here by visuals that show bullet shattering bone, devastating internal organs, sparking off some metal gear being carried or worn, blowing a large exit wound in the opposite side of your foe, and the realistic tumble of an impacted round. As someone who was trained by the military in forensics and went on to work with one of the largest and most prominent medical examiners in the U.S. (Detroit produces a wealth of experience in forensic and autopsy work), I can say that I was impressed by a lot of what I saw. There are custom settings for different aspects of gameplay, so if one aspect doesn't suit you, you may be able to tinker with it; this includes difficulty of enemies, aiming assistance, and so on. There is a decent amount of variety in the types of objectives, maps, and situations you will encounter, so even though your play through may be somewhat brief, it shouldn't feel too repetitious. When you complete the solo campaign, there are multiplayer, co-op, and challenge modes available to extend replayability as well. What the developers got right, they got very right, and I can easily see myself coming back to this from time to time just to get some target and tactical practice.The Bad: The AI is awful. I found myself constructing many elaborate traps only to find I had no way to lure soldiers into them if they were beyond a certain distance. Not in every instance, but in far too many. And once you've set a trap, it's used. No way of retrieving them.You cannot shoot out lights. I find that nearly unforgivable in a game like this. Also, there are bottles set up for target shooting, but apparently they are made of some incredible material because you can't knock over or destroy them from 5 feet away with a handgun. Only sniper rifles can destroy them, which brings unwanted attention of course. Also, the mutant regeneration ability seems out of place, even if it is necessary to the game's mechanics of play. Not saying it is, just saying. And it seems silly, even if satisfying, to be able to destroy all manner of vehicles with a single, well-aimed shot, but not be able to shoot out a lightbulb.The Ugly:Multiplayer. Take out the one thing that makes this game worth getting, toss in lackluster maps which, at least in some instances, are clearly imbalanced in favor of one team over the other, and return to everything that is tired and old about WW2 FPS games, and that's the multiplayer I experienced in the three servers I joined. Nothing there to keep me coming back. Oh, and don't forget the players who've memorized the best spots on the best side for each map to absolutely make the play monotonous and frustrating beyond belief. I've played much older games in this genre that did a much better job of it. I have not tried co-op yet (UPDATE: this has changed), and I'm hoping it will offer something more than multiplayer. Oh, and before I go (I edited to add this part), the stealth aspect. It's almost non-existant. There are moments when you can use it, but for a sniping game those moments are far too few. Most of the time you'll feel like Rambo, but with a sniper rifle instead of an M-60. I wish they had made this more of a true stealth game, but alas...Final Analysis:Decent fun for the price, if you catch it free or for cheap. If you like sniping, give it a shot. Just don't expect too much out of this title and it'll be alright. If you have a buddy who likes this game, co-op is alright even if somewhat limited and at times redundant. I like it even with its faults.			",135,27,5,27,19,0,17

												The sniper - a highly trained and feared elite soldier, whose job is to use camoflauge and concealment to infiltrate, observe,  and eventually put a SINGLE bullet downrange into a target that would otherwise be impossible.  In Sniper Elite V2, you play some sort of commando who forgot to bring ammo for his tommy gun, but wait, luckily you have this scoped rifle.  Seriously, if you, like me, thought you would buy this game to play the sniper, stealthily approaching your targets, hiding and waiting for your opportunity to slip past patrols, creating distractions, etc.... WRONG.  Your job is to gun everything and everybody down.  The only thing about this game that resembles a sniper is the scoped rifle.			",37,4,0,14,15,0,22

												Pros:- looks nice- bullet physics are okay- x-rays are pretty awesomeCons:- scrolling binoculars often doesn't work (w/ multi-monitor setup)- controls are terrible, very consoley- AI is not only omnipotent, but also perfect shooters, doing 360 noscopes all the time- missions didn't really feel connected- blowing up tanks by shooting fuel caps wtf- can't play it stealthily - after a cutscene suddenly you become the number one target- also when Germans fight Russians - if any of them see a bit of you, you're the most important target for some reason- enemies spawns are triggered and sometimes you can see them spawningOverall, it looks and plays like a low budget game.

												Sniper Elite V2's main selling point is the grusome x-ray vision that the player sees when they shoot certain parts of the body. And that is basically it.My main complaint was the extremely poor programmed AI. The logic written for the enemies do not make sense at all; they do not react like soldiers being shot at by a sniper hiding away in some window hundreds of metres away. They spot you immediately and lay precise fire on your exact position which I found to be extremely annoying.Once I was sneaking up a unexpecting German soldier from high up. He was maybe 50 metres away, got ready to pull the trigger and send the bullet into the back of his skull, but suddenly he does a 360 and starts firing at my exact position.Games such as MGSV make you feel more like a Sniper while this game made me feel I was quickscoping in MW2 again.5/10 would not buy unless it had a big discount.

												Bought it because of the high ratings, didnt enjoy much, maybe its just me but this game just doesnt appeal to me at all ever since I started playing. The combat is cool at first, but that slow-mo killcam gets repetitive quickly and soon feels very underwhelming (and sometimes even annoying). Also, considering this is a game built around sniping, the AI doesnt make sense. Things like :-enemies just running in the open to change cover (for no logical reason) despite knowing there is a sniper aiming right at them-enemies practically line up for your shotsJust makes combat feel very bland and doesnt make you feel anything like a sniper at all, despite this game being advertised so proudly as THE sniper game.The story and foundation of missions are also very dumbed down to a point where all of them are basically 'go here and shoot bad guys'. There is too little diversity, the only challenge added after every mission is more enemies and tighter maps.Overall I feel its a very lackluster game that is missing a certain.. 'life' to it. Feels more like an overpriced arcade machine tbh			",24,0,0,6,0,0,2

												3.5/10Pros: -Great sniping mechanics that make you think out every shot (This is literally the only pro)Cons:-The story is stupid, using a Call of Duty approach of having this near super soldier go in and kill all of the baddies, punching Hitler in the face and coming out unscathed. This is only fun if it's Duke Nukem-Extremely linear storyline. In fact, it's so linear that you can basically just memorize the distances for each kill, making it stupid on another playthrough. -The AI are poorly programmed. Once you shoot, they all know exactly where you are and begin using their laser-guided shooting to kill you-Stealth system is mediocre and generally only used if told to-Some missions are difficult because you're so close that using a sniper rifle just doesn't make sense. -Multiplayer is dead and even if it wasn't, it still suckedIf it's on sale for like 5 bucks and you're bored, sure buy it but at the retail cost of 30.00, that's asking quite a lot.

												Stealth Mechanics are way too bad to be called a stealth game. The only silencer you get a pistol with terrible accuracy struggling to try to shoot a guy in the head at close range with it when the noisy sniper rifle is recommended to do almost everything in the game since you barely get ammo for other weapons anyway.. Sneaking and crawling aint really much help from their enemy snipers and high AI detection. You will mostly be shooting your way through the game anyway..			",507,60,20,66,22,3,35

												Plenty of fun. You play as an American sniper in Berlin during World War II. The game is a third person shooter (TPS) but since you're a sniper, you'll be seeing through scope more than anything. You can die easily, so you'll have to make it thorugh the missions carefully. The game gives you the option of playing stealthily for most of the missions, and it's a good challenge and a lot of fun. And nothing is more satisfying than watching your bullets go throw your enemies' bodies and rip their insides to shreds in slomo x-ray vision. I got 12 good hours of it. and I enjoyed every minute of it. The multiplyer seems kind of empty tho.			",60,6,0,13,3,0,6

												If I were to ask you to design a sniper game would you:a) make a large open-level style game focusing on stealth and relocation, where you are vulnerable to overwhelming odds and need to exhibit stealth and patience above all, as well as expertise with a sniper rifle? Or b) a corridor shooter with terrible controls and animation, lack of satisfying sniper opportunities, tons of forced dumb stealth takedowns using either a terrible welrod, single shot, silenced pistol or ""press button"" to kill mechanics because you've misunderstood the role of a sniper in a battlefield so completely that you've mistaken them for SAS rambo style one-man armies?If you chose B) you should go work for this developer.  No seriously, the second level in the game has you single-handedly assault a V2 rocket installation, where you have to navigate corridors armed with a Welrod, Thompson and a sniper rifle.  The majority of the level takes place underground (ie corridors).  I made it past this level, but was so put off by it that I couldn't stomach playing further.  I've tried restarting this game mulitple times, I gave it lots of chances, but its renews my disappointment each time.Avoid this game if you're a WW2 fan or just a sniper fan in general.

												I have to admit I had fun, but stupid checkpoint choices, and enemies spawning out of the blue ruined the game for me.On top of that, the game started to crash On Krezuberg HQ level every couple of minutes. Now combine it with bad checkpoints and here you go - bad experience.Shooting ordinary soldiers is (most of the time) fun. However so called ""sniper battles"" are frustration ridden bug holes :(That most important element of the game is completely broken. Enemies can spawn in a ridiculous places like a crane in the middle of the map?! On top of that they always know where you are so forget about scouting for them. They will shoot at you as soon as you enter thier line of sight. No fun at all...Definitely I am disappointed because that could be an excellent game.I'm not going to try the next one...

												The game is a blast! Shooting germans with sniper rifles and watching the bullet flying in slow-mo and hitting its target is a pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for that little killer inside our heads. The graphics are really nice, after 4 years the game still looks good.The campaing is short but it is no a bad thing as you will probably play it more then once to try out different approach.I played most of the missions loud, getting every soldier on alert and shooting them in a fierce firefight. I will be playing the game again this time trying to sneak more and perform silent kills.The game alos has coop mode for 2 players! I will update my review after I try it out.There are 4 DLC missions available for the game (to buy of course) but it saddens me that they are not available to play  in coop mode which is really a bummer...

												An average third person shooter with broken AI (apparently germans have group fetish on rocks - and land mines), abysmall corridored level design, terrible voice acting and absolutely pointless storyline. I frequently asked myself: why the hell am I even playing this piece of uninspired code? There is no answer to that question, unless you fantasize about blowing people's balls up (just look up through positive comments - the main asset players that liked this game bring up is in fact ballsack-shooting. Even if sniping mechanics are still pretty neat, the blatant elitism among fanboys is just laughable if you take in consideration you blow up tanks with single bullet. If you look for a competent third person shooter, you don't want to even launch this title. Also terrible checkpoint system. Whoever thinks it's good on PC should be shot. In the balls - because hilarious and elite realism elite v2.Hell, it's one of those not numerous titles I didn't even bother to finish on single player.			",171,33,3,33,20,1,41

												Nothing beats the kill cam as your bullet crashes into someone's unsuspecting brain from nearly a kilometre away.A decent graphics engine and layout that gives a good feel for WW2. The mechanics are fun as you plot your next move. The only complain I have is that the sound at times can get a little hollow. A fun game overall with a campaign that's a bit short...

												Sniper Elite V2 can be a great game, but with many flaws.  First of all the AI is extremely poor, I found most soldiers could be baited and tunneled with ease, not to mention lured into the ""pill box"" for a line-up of kills.  Enemy snipers are also easy to spot and kill, you can just sprint, or get around cover and peak out fast and return.  They will surely fire their one shot, if it manages to hit you is another story.  Just hold your breath as you peak out, and aim above their head -> DEAD.I played the game on my first play through on the hardest setting, which to be honest was extremely easy.  I ended up not even using the scope after a while and just holding CTRL and picking off guys with head shots.The game has a lot to offer and ways to take out enemies.- Standard Kills- Baiting with explosives- Shooting their grenades- Blowing up explosives near them for double and triple killsThe story is subpar if anything, I never felt emotionally involved in the main character, nor any other sub characters.One of the best experiences was getting waves of units sent at me for immediate slaughter.The biggest issue in this game is the horrid camera.  I cannot explain how bad this system is, but it was way too touchy.  Sometimes you would be running and turn around not realizing you just did a 360, not 180.  I also rarely found myself using anything other than grenades, and maybe a few trip wires...  I think I only used two, one in the tutorial, and one for fun.There is also CO-OP and Online Mode, I found these to okay if you can get the right group.Overall I would say 6/10.I also received this free during the promotion, and honestly would not buy this game.

												SPOILERS AHEAD.Sniper Elite V2 is a rare breed. A WWII game, but with an emphasis on stealth rather than the usual guns blazing tactic seen in other FPS and TPS war games. You play as Karl Fairburne, an American sniper sent into Berlin during the dying throes of WWII to assassinate German rocket scientists.The main feature of the game, the sniping, is pretty damn good. The bullet cam mechanic is one of the most varied I've seen, unrivalled in realistic shooters, and the only one rivalling it in any shooter maybe being Stranglehold's Precision Aim mechanic. However, on higher difficulty levels, the bullet ballistics and wind mechanics can be fiddly at it's worst, but I find it gives you an amazing high when you can calculate the exact place to shoot, slotting a fresh round from a Gewehr 43 into some Nazi's frontal lobe.Speaking of which, the guns in this game can be described in one word: beautiful. They stay faithful to the real world counterparts, sharing the names and both the pros and cons, with the Mosin-Nagant's bolt-action reload slowing down your killfest in return for astounding bullet velocity, and the PPSh-41 trading ammo in some places for a higher fire-rate. On lower video qualities, the guns look slightly blocky, but on higher, they look just like the real variants.-- SPOILERS START HERE --The story, although contrived at times, is a nice backdrop to your bloodlust. As Karl Fairburne, you are tasked with eliminating multiple German rocket scientists, although there are many ways the game surprises you with this, including attempting to save one as he defects to the American side. It is revealled that as a last ditch attempt to win the war for the Axis, the Germans and the Russians are planning to use V2 rockets aimed at London and filled with deadly Tabun gas. Eventually you shut down the V2 launch site and assassinate the mastermind.If this sounds all a bit gung-ho, that's because it is. Although Sniper Elite V2 is a great stealth game, deep down inside, it wants to be like Battlefield, it wants to be like CoD, it wants to play with the big boys. The story has been altered from the original Sniper Elite back in 2005, to adjust for the changing times. In the original, you have assistance from the German resistance. This has been taken out of V2, as a large section of FPS fans these days prefer a ""lone wolf"" type story. Some of the in-game areas are a bit too close quarters for what's meant to be a stealthy sniping game, including the Russian HQ in East Berlin, where a large amount of enemies (probably around 20 or so) come screaming at you down a narrow-ish corridor.However, on the majority of the game, it is a bona fide departure from the Modern Warfares and Bad Companies that populate the FPS genre these days. Sniper Elite V2 is a healthy apple in a Happy Meal of double cheeseburgers and McNuggets. Overall, I do recommend this game, and would suggest it to not only the more discerning gamer, but even your average teenager with a 10 second attention span.9/10 - could have improved in some places, but overall a gem. Pick it up if you see it on sale at any time, or even if you just have spare dosh lying around.			",143,26,7,5,10,4,4

												You kill one of the highest ranking Germans in the first mission, and then go on to murder millions of Nazis who are too dumb to kill one sniper. The mechanics are basically broken, it takes 5 bodyshots (including the neck) to kill someone as opposed to headshots...all in all, this game sucks. Don't buy it.			",163,9,0,14,8,3,35

												The campaign quickly becomes boring and repetitive, and the multiplayer in my experience has many hackers (Or possibly lag from most players living around Russia). On one occasion, I put a full round of MP40 ammo into another player in deathmatch, and they proceeded to snipe me at point blank without being scoped in. The only real way to have fun is to get a few friends who all have the game and play around on a closed server, which then becomes great fun. However, the game by itself is repetitive, boring, and in case of the multiplayer, frustrating.			",25,4,0,7,2,0,6

But I have purchased and played the S.N: Nazy Zombie Army titles before and I've enjoyed them. So I said: "" Yeees, I will play this game"" and suprise! This game is great! Have nice visuals, good optimization( I've played and completed this game in a non gaming pc, and runs very well with nice graphics), great controls and good game options. Let's talk about the story, is kinda short but entertaining and very intense! I've completed this game twice( coop and solo) The coop experience is just great and funny, you should play this game with your friends! Now I want to play Sniper Elite 3!			",320,69,9,23,14,0,29

												Perfect game. I love military simulators, but this is one of my favorite games.For complete realism play at the highest level of complexity. On hard level is very fun to play, everything should be done quietly and gently.I loved the game and not get bored. Like before the shoot count trajectory and also to monitor the wind, as it also affects the flight of bullets.Nice graphics and the idea. I do not understand how this game may not like... yes you have to kill Germans but it just a game. Nothing personal and abusive. I advise everyone to play this wonderful simulator.10/10 ",102,12,2,15,5,0,13

												Sniper Elite V2 puts you into the WWII setting in Berlin, 1941. You obviously should play the first game before this, but some of you didn't, which I'm guilty of too. I feel that after playing the first 3 missions of the game, the review was ready to be spit out. I personally like this game, and the reasons so I will say. Now the gameplay is very nice, giving you a challenge the whole way through the mission, which I like. Unlike COD, this game takes the use of your brain and putting it to work. You can't run in throught the mission and shoot, hell no, not in this game. You can easily die running into the mission, which I'm guilty of the first couple times. You can easily be picked off by one or two enemys by running in, but in COD you can take on 10-15, which is insanely absurd. Which is mainly why I don't like COD too much, but the zombies mode and campaign are alright. So, in order to not get killed so much is to have the enemy come to you, you don't come to them because 2-3 shots can kill you right off the bat.Now to talk about the graphics and the enviroment. The enviroment is great, it gives that vibe to the whole WWII scene, having to do with flying planes, destroyed buildings, tanks, roadblocks, exploded vehicles, you name it, the game has it. The graphics are beautiful, running Sniper Elite on a 1080p resolution and the ultra settings preset made this game look beautiful, which contributed to the game being so good to me personally. But, the water and smoke looks like poop! The water looks like a plastic sheet put over the ground, not to mention that stepping in it had no splashing effect which made the water so lifeless like it wasn't even water. The game developers need to put some physics into the water and smoke, or it'll just make the enviroment seem more lifeless and bland. The smoke from a far distance looks good, but up close it looks like it was made with the Microsoft default Paint program you have in the Start menu. The smoke also has no density to it, making it bland just like the water. Again, the developers should've spent more time on the smoke and water effects. Anyways, I forgive it since the rest of the enviroment looks next-gen with great PC optimization giving a full 60FPS on ultra with this last-gen GeForce GTX 550 Ti Gigabyte OC that I carry in this PC.Now the background story, which this game doesn't really have any. The backstory to this game makes me say ""What""? Now, what I mean is that there's no backstory to this game, as in the cutscenes before each mission for example Grand Theft Auto, Half-Life, and Mafia II have a backstory, which gives it's background that promotes the fuller understanding of the game, although there's a brief saying of the mission you are about to enter in this game. But, still there really isn't a backstory to the game. Now, if you don't understand what a game's ""backstory"" is, I'd go look up backstory on Google or whatever search engine you use. Anyways, Sniper Elite is still good even though it has its flaws to the game. Every game has its flaws. Like Grand Theft Auto IV, which has sort of a horrible PC optimization to the game.The heartbeat system consists of mainly two things, your lung capacity to use focus time, and your health. When your heartrate goes above 80BPM you can't go into focus time, there's two reasons as to why it is over 80BPM. One: You've been shot, which brings up the heartrate, but not necessarily all the time though, there's a few times when I been hit 3 times and it still was at 70BPM. Two: You've have been either jogging or running around, which would always raise your heartrate. So, that's the heartrate system in a nutshell.HUD elements like your objective and your weapon and ammo will disappear after an amount of about 5 seconds, which can be helpful if you need to see at the corners of your screen. That's a plus in any game.Overall, the game's nice, the music is good. The gunshots are satisfying when you snipe someone overhead. The overall rating of this game is a good 8.7/10.

												My rate for this game is 6 out of 10, that means ""If you enjoy sniping and planting explosive traps and you have nothing better to do you may find this game entertaining"". At least that's the spirit how I played it.So, I actually won't un-recommend it because it doesn't deserve it but surely it deserves critics.Because this game is wrong from the basis: it is supposed to be a ""stealth game"" but it is clearly not; a ""sniping game"" but sniper rifle isn't the most useful weapon; a ""realistic game"" and it is definitely not!Before explaining my critics let me tell in advice that i played at the highest difficulty. So, let's start with the stealth factor.I won't definite this a stealth game because you can't complete any level stealthly. Well, actually you can't complete any ROOM stealthly: The only stealthy weapon you have is a silenced pistol that is way the most useful weapon of the game (But ""Silenced-Pistoler elitè V2"" didn't sound good enough); then you have an un-suppressed sniper rifle who aggros enemy just by pointing them (if you point them with the binoculars you will not be caught that easily); and a nice arsenal of explosives. It doesn't sound like a very quite equipment.In game you fight against troopers, and snipers: the latter will shoot at you anyway (so there's no need for stealth) the firsts don't act at all like a real trained soldier: no one soldier will ""pound the alarm"", not even after an explosion (that's why to this game sound logical give landmines as a stealty weapon). Any un-quite action will only alarm the soldiers in nearby: it doesn't matter if you shoot away everything, blast them with grenades, or snipe efficently: you will never be in permanent trouble.Also, if a soldier finds a dead body he doesn't pound the alarm of call for reinforcements (there's no such a thing in this game) he just stays close to the body, wondering what could this mean.If you try instead to move the body you will alarm the enemy because you are being loud.So: leaving a body is not a negative beavior because it doesn't get you in trouble, actually is a POSITIVE beavior because you can fill the body with mines. Stealth. Sniper.Another example of the lack of logic is the tank AI. They act like dogs. Indeed, like dogs: If a tank see you it will shoot cannonballs as long as you are in his line of sight, than it just go away. Like a dog barking to defend its territory.Oh, yes, and of course a tank shooting does not alarm nearby soldiers.Another disturbing element is that the game gives you an arsenal for a preparatory game: you should know the territory, what will happen, then you plant mines and choose your position accordingly. But this never happens: you just follow the track, snipe the main target (or snipe some explosives, just to remain stealth) from a position unknown from the beginning, and at last you fight your way out without knowing in advice what way will be.So: what's the point with mines?I think the game is the result of a developing team that didn't follow the same line guide: some one wanted to make a stealth game, and some one other said that didn't sell enought.

												I completed this game to the credits, and even when I was halfway through, it had become a bore. The missions are repetitive, the gameplay is pretty bad, and the performance isnt very good. I'm not even sure if there was a strong plot, because I had toned out the monotone narration of the protagonist after about 5 minutes. From what little I gathered, the plot is practically non-existent, and there is no way to be interested in any of the characters.This game's only stong point is its famous killcams which, by the end of the game, have become extremely repetitive and not very satisfying.

												I love this game. Its bullet physics, and the visceral impact the game displays to you is all awesome, and probably worth the purchase alone at the right price.  However, instead of presenting you with a lot interesting sharpshooter scenarios, the game tends to put you more into a meat grinder, by throwing wave after wave of enemies at you.  There were a few times during the game where I had to make a complex shot on my target.  Those instances were fun.  But, they only lasted maybe 2 minutes a piece.  The rest of the game revolves around shooting Nazi A, Nazi B, or Nazi C, (or Russian A, Russian B, or Russian C).  It stops being a sniper game, and becomes a standard shooter.  The times where I had to time my shots to coincide with artillery shells exploding were awesome.  There needs to be more intersting things like that.  Or, if they are going to force me into a building to retrieve a document, I would like to have some sort of melee or takedown option because I always favor stealth over guns blazing.  Overall, now that I have thought about it enough while writing this review, the game is kind of cheap.  Which can make the awesome bullet cam seem like a gimmick.  I can see how someone would think the entire game was basically that, and the rest is just cheap window dressing (i.e. great bullet cam... lame story, cheap enemies, meat grinder missions, poor voice overs, repetive music).  I'm a little torn on this game, but I can't recommend it.			",385,64,10,28,32,4,44

												I got this game when it was Free on Steam for 24 hours from the 4th June 2014 - 5th June 2014, and admittedly only got it because it was free.My first time playing this was the morning of 5th June and was pulled straight into a private lobby against 5 of my Steam friends who had been playing it all night long :P  It was the most fun i have had playing a multiplayer game in a very long time and i would reccommend it just for that.I then went on to play the campaign missions which did have a fairly basic but interesting story, i found the collectibles challenging to find but some of them i found on the second playthrough and had to kick myself for not seeing them the first time :P Since i enjoyed playing this game so much despite it being free, i went on to buy the £13.96 worth of DLC which gave some new weapons and a couple of challenge missions which i chose to go at stealthily because that is my playstyle and had tonnes of fun sneaking up on enemies, and the most satisfying part about the game has to be the X-ray Killcams that show the path of your bullet with a satisfying squelch as it hits them and shows the bullet passing through thier insides, i loved every kill :PJust one last thing to note, i am one of those that doesn't feel like i have played a game to its fullest unless i get all the achievements for the game so i have definitely done so on this and it was well worth the 41 hours i spent completing such a task, i will no doubt be spending many more hours in multiplayer mode from now on.

												I was hoping that a realistic sniper game would be about long preparations with sudden bursts of violence. The tutorial that teaches the player to lay traps made me hopeful, but then the real maps were just as linear as the tutorial maps. There is no scouting of the location, no finding alternative exits, etc. There is only one road and after you take your sniping shot, the game will tell you when to run and which way to run. This game resembles typical shooters way more than I'd like it.I'm not an expert on AI, but it takes me out of the game when the enemy is coming towards me in a single line one by one and they don't react when I shoot them one by one. It also breaks the illusion when the level designers intentionally set up a bossfight-esque event when dozens of enemies are aware of me and shooting at me and I have to snipe them all before I can go on. These kind of things shouldn't be orchestrated, but naturally emerge from the gameplay.All in all I was very disappoined by this game as a sniper game, especially because this title is such well recognized as a good sniper franchise.

												This game is garbage. I could talk about its weird controls, the fact you can't jump and must perform specific actions only in specific places, its inexistent difficulty or its totally dumb AI, but I will focus only over one thing: stealth is completely broken. In a game where you are a sniper, stealth should be the only way to perform a task; in this game, IN EVERY DAMN LEVEL, you will have to shoot down battalions of bad guys that know your exact position. You will really enjoy this game only if you are a big fan of rifles and ballistics or a 13 years old CoD fan. But yeah, killcams are great....			",212,36,8,23,7,3,17

												In closing,Sniper Elite V2 does a lot of things right.The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat.Headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.			",51,8,0,2,11,0,8

												Let me start out by saying this: I own this game for the 360 and have put dozens of hours into it. I've beat it multiple times and have gone back to redo levels just for fun. When the giveaway for this popped up, I couldn't wait to have another copy for PC.This game is my favorite shooter of all time, and I play a lot of them between twelve separate game systems. There is endless replayability in this game...this is the type of game where if you mess up and die, it really doesn't bother you, because it's so much freaking fun to go back through it again and again. Obviously, the game is centered around being a sniper during World War II, though you also have other methods of killing Nazis at your disposal, including a silenced pistol, mines, etc. You can play this game any way you want. If you'd like to go for stealth, you can try timing your sniper shots with the soundwaves of nearby explosions, sirens, etc. so that you remain undetected, all while hiding bodies. OR, you could rush into situations, hole up in a room, set some traps at the door and wait for the Nazis to come to you. Ideally, you'll want to settle somewhere in the middle, but the fact that you are free to choose how to progress is liberating.The bullet cam pushes this game over the line from ""superb"" to ""awesometacular."" For many of your sniper bullets, the camera will follow your bullet and slow down time, showing you exactly how well you aimed your shot by offering to you an ""inside the body"" view of the damage your bullet does to an unfortunate Nazi. If you get a headshot where your bullet explodes an eye, it shows you that. The gore, while present, is also realistic. It's not over-the-top to be over-the-top, but it is oddly and disturbingly satisfying. I can't count the numbers of times I've yelled out loud, ""NICE!"" or ""Did I get the eye? Did I get the eye? YESSSS!!!"" Trust me...you'll be doing this often, as this game makes you feel like an absolute badass.Finally, the environments are varied and interesting. You'll be going through streets full of ruined homes, cities on fire, having sniper battles on rooftops (my favorite mission)...not to mention they also offer two types of collectibles that are actually fun to search for. I'm a ""game collectible"" fiend, and this game does it best, in my opinion, over any other game with collectibles that I've ever played. One of the collectibles is a brown bottle that each level has a set amount of. You have to shoot them to collect them, so you'll be having a lot of fun finding these in hidden, far off places, on the map or off. Also, these bottles are hidden well. You can tell the devs had a ton of fun hiding them in ridiculous places, rather than just putting them in corners and calling it a day.In summary, this game is a god among games. It does everything right, and adds some interesting and original ideas to the genre...a genre already unfortunately low in sniper-focused games. I only preorder about one game every few years...and this is the game that convinced me to make that game Sniper Elite 3, because this game is just untouchable. This is a game you will play and replay just for the pure entertainment value. If you don't have it yet, buy it. You won't regret it.			",461,269,16,130,96,2,166

												Sniper elite v2 take place during the WW2,where the game protagonist must discover the location and destroy the ""V2"" rocket made by the germans and prepared to be lunched.After finishing the singleplayer campgine,i decided to write this review.I personly enjoyed the game alot,espacially the relastic shooting that the player experience after hitting a ""Vital"" part of the enemy body.The story is very good,discribing how the protagonist fight his way to destroy the V2 rocket,and preventing a disaster that could happend.The graphics are good but i was expecting better graphics.The player can carry 3 types of weapons along with a set of inventory that help him in his missions.the player carry a:sniper refile,sub-machine gun,a pistol,along with grenades,tripe wire,trip mine,and dinamite.Stealth is missing form this game,and could only be done by the slinced pistol ""werlord"".Also the singleplayer campagine is a kind of short but the shortness is coverd by the good story.The coop-campign is one of the best coop in many games,which allow two players to finish the mission,by helping each other.The game multiplayer is very cool and has two types:death match and team death match,but it is very hard.                                 The good in the game:+Great story+good graphics+awesome gameplay+relastic shooting experience shown by xrays when hitting a vital part of an enemy+Great coop-camapign+greart multiplayer+no glitches or lags+Awesome endingThe bad in the game:-Short campaign-lack of unlockable weapons-No stealth elements(stealth only by slinced pistol)-hard multiplayerConclusion:i recommand this game to every one who loves sniping.This is one of the best games i ever played.My rating:-Story:9/10-graphics:8/10-coop:9/10-multiplayer:9/10-Controles:9/10Overall:44/50			",133,29,6,18,10,1,6

												If you just loooove gore and seeing bullets crushing skulls and whatever, then this is probably the game for you. Other than that, it's very boring. I love the concept of the game, being a sniper with realism in terms of bullet trajectory and mechanics but the game is just too dull. I only played the first 2-3 levels and it just feels the same every single time. Crouch -> aim -> shoot -> change spot -> (repeat)			",26,3,1,3,3,1,6

												You play as a sniper in World War II setting. During that era, silencer for sniper rifle aren't invented yet, so to achieve stealth kills using sniper rifle, you will need to time your shot with environmental noise like bomb shells or thunder storm.The concept is not bad, but in practise, it is very hard to achieve stealth. It is very easy to trigger alarm, and once it is triggered, the entire sector will instantly know where you are and fire at you.You can lay traps and lure approaching enemies to it, but it is very ineffective and troublesome to setup, and some times it will still trigger alarm anyway.So on overall, unless you are very patience, more than half of the time this game can be treated as a generic shooter, with sniper rifle as primary weapon.But, if you are very patience, and like to play it correctly as a stealth game where you carefully plan your route, and scout the area, this game might really suit your taste.The graphics are not bad. Kill cams are awesome! For some time. It gets dull and repetitive very soon. The plot is not bad.The entire campaign can be played in coop.Review for DLCsEach DLC adds one extra mission, all are in one single giant map. These DLC missions can only be played in single player.Story and setting-wise, they are quite okay. Pricing is okay too as a DLC, so get them if you liked the game.For Achievement HuntersThe following DLCs are required for 100% completion.St. Pierre DLCThe Neudorf Outpost PackThe Landwehr Canal PackMost of the achievements are quite doable. But some of the harder ones require some luck, and a huge lot of patience.My score: 7/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												This review is based on single player campaign only.Sniping and ""stealth"". Too bad that the ONLY silenced weapon in this whole game is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ british pistol which accuracy is best compared to a howitzer... So stealthing goes to the bin, plus the fact that AI spots you like hawk on steroids, so you pretty much have to spot the enemies and snipe them down. Silenced sniper rifle was probably too much to ask for. Maybe it would have been too OP. I don't know.Another annoying aspect is how you can blow up the tanks by shooting the CAP of the fuel tanks... oh boy... Little bit too much Hollywood!Besides all that, oh boy the game mechanics were so fun!! The slomo cinematics are nicely done and pretty much nothing beats the feeling when you can shoot off the bad guys balls. Outchie! :PAll in all funny little game. 3½ / 5 ",36,9,5,13,4,0,10

												Its filled with idiotic scripts. Let me give you example. In one chapter, you need to go to the church. Bells are ringing, so, you can use that sound as a cover for your shots. Too bad, that you need to move first to some spot, to trigger bell rings. Annoying !!Or, you clear full plaza of enemy soldiers, you are looking on exact spot on the roof, where might be the enemy sniper. Nothing, all clear.You move out from your cover, after few metres, sniper is there and is shooting at you. I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE SCRIPTS !!!!Anyway, this game is kinda fine.

												Honestly a really frustrating game, only played it because it was on sale and I'm an impulse game buyer. Whilst it brands itself as a stealth game with varying decisions on play style for each level, this couldn't be further from the truth, when the sniping works, IT WORKS and the bulletcam is amazingly satisfying, but there are often stages with close quarters where using the sniper is futile and you have to resort to using the awful secondary weapons to kill wave after wave of enemy. Just poor level design and overpowered and funnily enough fairly stupid AI also. Just want to finish the repetitive campaign and uninstall this game for good.5/10			",155,16,1,14,16,0,15

												TL;DR - This game is not worth any money at all, and I am glad I got it the day it was free. If you want a more realistic shooter, buy any of the terribly inaccurate Call of Duty series. That's how bad this game is. This game is an embarassment to any ""sniping"" game. You can NOT change shoulders at all which in a third person shooter is extremely frustrating and will kill your more than anything else in the game. The cover system is complete and total sh** by not letting you peek out to shoot whenever it wants to, and the fact that you have to FULLY EXPOSE yourself to make a shot. Secondly this game demands you either make a headshot or shoot something vital i.e the heart or lungs in order to kill someone in the multiplayer which is total sh** again because WWII had little to no body armor at all (Yes there was body armor in WWII that's when it started being made i.e flak jackets). The ballistics on the weapons are very poor; in the multiplayer I shot someone five times in the inside of the thigh, groin, and pelvis with a 1911. I have fired a 1911 and .45's tend to put people on their butt really easily. And seeing as the femoral artery is in the inner thigh and pretty easy to hit, that guy should have died. Instead he pulled his sidearm and shot me in the face once and continued to run around unhindered. Another thing is that your rifle bullets will ALWAYS over penetrate in the campaign. BULLETS DO NOT DO THIS! Especially the rifles used in WWII, not every shot would over penetrate. The last thing that really annoyed me was how the game sends you alone with no spotter or back up. Sorry, snipers never work alone. That is a HUGE pet peeve of mine with most shooting games: they all think snipers are lone wolf bamf's who can do reach into their pack, pull on their Super Man cape and save the day. That and the fact that you can soak up any round type in the campaign and be perfectly fine after hiding in cover for a few seconds makes this game completely and totally worthless.

												Visually a great game, but besides the initial fun of setting up the shot and seeing the bullet cam the fun kind of drops off. It gets repetitive and in some cases makes the game hard to play as a sniper. You get in to close quarter fights that you can only really survive by pulling out the pistol or machine gun to complete. And it amazes me that every single enemy in the area instantly knows exactly where you are once you fire a shot. In an urban setting with buildings, streets and walls, the sounds of gunfire would echo and be pretty difficult to pinpoint.Straight up: this is not a tactical game about sniping, and definitely not realistic. If you want a very arcade-like shooter then maybe go for it based on its one big draw: slow-mo bullet cam. I have played the game for hours just for this feature, but once it wears off you are left with flawed and rough game mechanics and plot. Plot is bad, but not critically so, I've seen worse. The gameplay features firefights mainly at under 200m with very unrealistic features (such as shooting through corners due to bullet tracing form the crosshair rather than the gun, and using 3rd person to peek and scout the area). The actual situations it places you in as a sniper are also poorly chosen, as most snipers excel in situations of patience, strategy and long-range targets. Forget all of that; it is very linear and confined, and you have will be just as good firing quick snapshots between sprints as you would if you crawled to a good spot, steadied your heartbeat, controlled your breathing and took a good shot. Additionally you just shrug off bullets call of duty style.			",136,22,0,9,3,0,12

												Great game and one of the few games where you can experience being a true sniper and seeing your shots completely destroy your targets. The storyline is set in WWII and is quite short (I completed it in about 3 hours or so without stopping) but some of the slow-motion shots are amazing and show in detail where exactly the bullet penetrates the body which is so cool to watch. I picked this game up when it was free for a couple of days before the release of Sniper Elite V3 but I would definetely say if you want to experience what it's like to be a sniper then get this game.

												Sniper Elite V2 is one of those games that's hit-or-miss (pun semi-intended).  I only just got the PC version, but I've had the Xbox 360 version for close to a year now and the only difference I can see is the graphics quality.  In fact, let's start with that, shall we?The graphics of Sniper Elite V2 are surprisingly excellent.  The game world itself is far from beautiful, but that is to be expected when you're a lone wolf sniper crawling through the rubble of Berlin in the twilight hours of the Second World War.  The amount of detail is extraordinary.  You can see the leathery texture of an SS officer's jacket just as you're about to blow his brains out.  My only concern is, perhaps, optimization.  Could have used a bit more, but nothing too serious.The storyline is nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done of linking the missions together.A lot of the time you'll be crawling around in the ruined streets of Berlin, but you do get to see a few other environments.  Each of the levels is quite linear.  To a lot of players, this is what breaks the game, and I can understand that.  However if  you can get past the linearity it is still a very enjoyable experience.As for the gameplay, well, it's a sniper game.  You get a sniper rifle, a pistol, and an SMG, along with various booby traps.  The star of the show truly is your rifle.  This should be your go-to weapon throughout most of the game.  The sniper mechanics in this game are phenomenal, and highly customizable.  Bad shot?  You can set it so that bullets come right out of CoD and hit where you're aiming.  Just got off of a BF gaming binge?  You can set it so that bullets are effected by gravity.  Really want to challenge yourself?  You can set it so that not only is there bullet drop, but also wind as well.  On top of this, you will always have to watch your heartrate.  If you're running around a lot, your heart rate is going to spike and your scope will sway heavily.  Stay low, move slowly, and take your time and your heart rate will drop and you can focus on the shot or even slow time.Once you take that shot, it is very likely that you will go into a bullet cam, which will often show an X-ray view of your target as their organs are shredded by your sniper shot.  You can control the frequency of these bullet cams if you're squeamish or just don't like much gore, but I do not believe you can completely turn them off.  It is, however, quite satisfying when you see your round enter through an enemy's skull, exit out the other side, tumble realistically through the air, and proceed to take out his buddy behind him.That AI themselves are quite varied between the difficulty levels.  Easy AI will have them walking in circles, wondering where the sniper is that just dropped their friend while you proceed to plink away at their ranks.  Hard AI means that one wrong shot will result in your death.  Medium AI is comfortably in between the two.Finally, the co-op and multiplayer...  I admit that I have not tried to competitive multiplayer yet, but I did take a quick glance at the options and servers.  There are quite a few servers running and the options for a custom match are outrageous.  As for co-op, you can team up with a shooting buddy and take on either a challenge mission or a wave-based survival mode.  I can say that both of these are extremely fun and, in some ways, make up for the singleplayers linearity with open maps that allow you to roost in whatever sniper perch you find suitable.All-in-all, I'd say that Sniper Elite V2 is not a game that I would pay a full $60 USD for.  At the current price of $30 USD, however, it is a great game, so long as you're interested.  If you're looking for a game that has basic, yet functioning, stealth mechanics, fun cooperative play, and excellent sniping mechanics, then I suggest you pick up Sniper Elite V2.  It's not the end-all-be-all of sniper games, but it's a hell of a lot better than Sniper: Ghost Warrior.  I can tell you that much!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fresh from completing Sniper Elive V2, I thought I'd give a brief couple of points on the game.Positives:+WWII setting.  Differentiates itself from the current 'modern' trend.  Appreciate WWII was the big thing 5-10 years ago.+Graphics.  Decent graphics, some nice effects like fire and explosions that look good without too much scrutiny.+Physics.  Completed on Sniper Elite difficulty so got to experience some decent bullet drop balistics etc.  Shots are definitely missable if you're not careful.+X-Ray Kill Cam.  This just never gets old.  Ever.  There's something immensely satisfying seeing the skeleton of your enemy shatter into little bits.+Campaign length.  Though it could be completed quicker (I'm sure), I got a good 10+ hours out of the single player.Negatives:-A.I.  Far too easy.  The game can effectively be progressed by simply giving your position away, letting the A.I. run around in the open as they try to hit you.  Makes sniping actually a little too easy.-Opernplatz.  There's a progression bug on this map. I hit it, couldn't get past and ended up shelving the game for 6-12 months.  Thankfully, a fresh download seemed to let me move on when I finally returned.  Very disappointing.-Story.  Generic America saves the world (well, America saves London in this instance).  Not very exciting and a little too Hollywood.-Linearity.  Maps can be moved across using various routes but it's essentially a point A to point B fare.  Shame really. -Kit too situational.  I had mines, trip mines, dynamite, grenades and a rock (no, NOT  Dwayne Johnson) but using them was VERY situational.  Had the game given me better A.I. (i.e. supressing and flanking etc.) then maybe I'd have used a more tactical approach such as trip mining doorways and the like - but the game just doesn't need it.  You can treat it like any other shooter and progress just fine.  A massively missed opportunity. Overall, I'd definitely say I had fun with Sniper Elite V2 (taking aside Opernplatz) and would recommend it as being 'worth playing'.  Arguably one of the better sniping games in recent years.Lastly, it's really cheeky of Rebellion to peddle DLC and the next game on the exit screen.  Bad form, folks. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper elite 1 was a masterpiece and sniper elite v2 is its sequel; featuring bullet xray cam and much more brutal environment than the first one.Pros:1. Really well designed missions2. Great sniping elements.3. Good close quarter battles.4. An average storyline and lenghty (if you play on hard mode)5. Great COOP6. Amazing multiplayer (capture the flag is the best)7. A brand new COOP game mode called Overwatch which is offering its own campaign like splinter cell COOPs.Cons:1. Tanks are not so challenging like in Sniper Elite1 that you needed an anti tank weapon to kill them but here you should shoot the fuel tank and the tank is gone which is easier than battling it with panzershreck.2. Enemy AI sometimes fails.3. Bombing Run coop mode offers too much randomly spawned enemies which is so stupid and annoying!Overall I surely do recommend this game because it is amazing like the first one!			",182,13,5,3,7,3,23

												Pros: Graphics: are top notch, now with DX 11 settings as well, some graphical issues, but could be driver related.Gameplay: When played on the hardest difficulty, sniper gameplay is awesome.Sound: Seems fine to me, possibly a little echo-y when it comes to enemy dialog.Controls: Easy enough to grasp.Cons: Gameplay: when played on lower difficulties, just plain awful. A.I. on all difficulties are weak, but better on the highest.Controls: Sometimes when you go to turn around it gets kinda touchy, resulting in a little confusion.Conclusion: If you played the first one, or Sniper Ghost Warrior and liked those, this should be under consideration, and close to an insta buy at $30. At $40 however only buy if you absolutely can't wait, like me :)8.5/10			",667,105,17,90,58,6,114

												Sniper Elite V2 is a 3rd Person Shooter with the 2nd World War as the setting.___________________________________________________++Story++You are a (correct me if I am wrong) nameless sharpshooter who was sent to Berlin to kill important germans. On your way, you find out that the nazis have a last ace, the V2 Missiles, brutal weapons of mass destruction that are aimed at London, and you make it to your mission to destroy the V2s and defeat the Nazis.++Gameplay++The game has the typical shooter corridor as the leveldesign: Take way A, B, or C, but in the end, all ways lead to the same destination. But what is different? You can sneak completely unseen past the enemies, or kill them all with your sniper rifle. Loud noises can drown the noise of your rifle, so you can shoot without warning the enemy. If you just shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything, you will alert the enemy and get quickly killed, which is positive because snipers are not supposed to take a lot of damage. You have some tools like mines and grenades to prevent soldiers from following you or flanking you. If you take out an enemy with the sniper rifle, you will most likely trigger a bullet cam that shows precisely how your bullet penetrates the body of your target, which can look disgusting at times because you see in X-Ray how the bones and organs get damaged (looks very amazing when you shoot your enemy's eye).++Grafics++The grafics are the usual standart for shooters back in 2012. Not amazingly good, but not bad either. The faces have  animations, the bullet cam looks great.++Music++The music gets annoying fast and is brutally loud, so turn it a little bit down before you start playing. Better play with some own music.++Features++Your sniper bullets are actually influenced by gravity and wind if you do not play on easy, which is amazing and makes the shooting harder, and requires you to think a little bit when you shoot.___________________________________________________I thought that this game is like Sniper Ghost Warrior a hidden CoD clone, but it is a solid 3rd Person shooter with innovation and ideas, and that makes this game worth to be bought. Good work, Rebellion!			",203,40,2,34,11,1,4

												Modern shooter design has evolved such that the headshot is the most desired action. Game after game, we are conditioned to aim for the head  thanks to the unique animations and sounds that result. But in this game, headshots are just the beginning.On the surface, Sniper Elite V2 seems like yet another brown WW2 shooter. Every level is ""bombed out European city"" and you're America's answer to Golgo 13, casually blowing up tanks, trucks, and rockets with well-placed rifle fire. But the kill cam makes all the difference. With most killshots, you get a dramatic slow motion shot of the bullet traveling and killing its target. An X-Ray shot lets you see exactly which bones and vital organs are obliterated. Now, you've incentive to aim not just for the brain, but the heart. The lungs. The testes. THIS NEVER GETS OLD. EVER.You can adjust enemy AI and ballistic modeling to suit your tastes. Don't want the videogame-y HUD assistance? Turn it off. Want to have to adjust aim for distance? How about wind? The option's there. You can sneak if you want too, being mindful of sound and enemy line of sight as you hide bodies, cause distractions, and use a crappy silenced pistol. But there is zero penalty for neglecting to use stealth, and eventually you HAVE to fight. By all means, go...ballistic. This isn't Hitman. You have to get spotted. That's why you can and should set traps for when the Nazis and the Reds come a-runnin'. You can't set off your own mines, but you can get hurt when they do explode.The fact that you're given points for each kill encourages you to just shoot everybody you see. Incapacitate a guy in the open to draw his friends out to save him. Then put one shot through both of them. BONUS POINTS. You actually get the fewest points for sneaking up behind someone and melee killing them. Co-op play is supported through the entire campaign (albeit with fewer X-Ray shots), and there's special co-op multiplayer as well. Versus multiplayer...eh, it's a game about camping and sniping. Don't bother with that.The Metacritic score is wrong. The reviewers are wrong. This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed TRIUMPH, and every level is highly replayable. The DLC's pretty good too, especially its infamous ""Kill Hitler"" mission. No co-op on those, sadly.			",505,108,4,62,32,2,72

												Even if I'm not the greatest sniper, I still love sniping and sniping games! Sniper Elite V2 was a fun little treat to play, quite enjoyable. It's third-person as you move around but you'll find yourself looking through your scope most of the time. It looks pretty decent, I noticed a few glitches here and there but nothing major nor anything game breaking. The game doesn't have the most interesting story but it holds up good enough. This is a game that's all about the game play which makes it understandable that the story is lacking a bit.You're an awesome sniper and you're job is to be sneaky and snipe your way through German and/or Russian soldiers while getting to your objectives. The sneaky part is harder than it sounds. The sniping rifles are the main characters in this game, the rest of the guns are not quite as powerful but they do the trick, if you aim right. There are a lot of things to take into account to make the perfect shot count.The use of sound is quite important in this game, you sometimes will see an indicator on your top-right when a large sound can mask your shots.

												As if Siphon Filter/MGS had a baby placed in WW2 and gave it simulation-realistic ballistics with full two player co-op through the campaign. Honestly I had no idea how great this game is, and above all how fun especially with someone if I didn't get it for free, but I would gladly buy it if I had the chance. Absolutely getting the third one hands down.			",366,41,8,38,16,1,25

												Well before i start writing this mini review, let me thanks to Rebellion for offering this awesome game on Steam! Sniper Elite V2 is a good and solid action sniper game. The story is quite good, well narrated and motivates to keep playing. This was my second Sniper game that i played, the fist one was Ghost Warrior, and gotta say loved both! But although the story is quite good, can't say the same about the levels, the are bit short take around 25min to complete it (depends on the difficulty) and also doesn't give a lot of exploration. In addition, there is far to much focus on close quarters combat for this to really take the art of sniping seriously.  The best part of the game for is definitely the Bullet Travel, amazing, you see guy at 180m you hold your breath and shoot to his head, bam, amazing! Strong recommend this game!~ 8/10 ",493,181,16,44,79,10,49

												Even if I'm not the greatest sniper, I still love sniping and sniping games! Sniper Elite V2 was a fun little treat to play, quite enjoyable. It's third-person as you move around but you'll find yourself looking through your scope most of the time. It looks pretty decent, I noticed a few glitches here and there but nothing major nor anything game breaking. The game doesn't have the most interesting story but it holds up good enough. This is a game that's all about the game play which makes it understandable that the story is lacking a bit.You're an awesome sniper and you're job is to be sneaky and snipe your way through German and/or Russian soldiers while getting to your objectives. The sneaky part is harder than it sounds. The sniping rifles are the main characters in this game, the rest of the guns are not quite as powerful but they do the trick, if you aim right. There are a lot of things to take into account to make the perfect shot count.The use of sound is quite important in this game, you sometimes will see an indicator on your top-right when a large sound can mask your shots. Trying to time this right was pretty fun, since if your shots are heard the enemy might notice your position rather fast. The AI isn't perfect, I found them running into obstacles and getting stuck once in a while, which was pretty funny but takes away a little of the challenge. I had a lot fun with the game though and I recommend it, it's about 8-9 hours long. The game also has a co-op mode that can add a few extra hours.			",1065,477,54,178,148,12,257

												Nice at the beginning, and irritating after a bit. Heavily scripted enviroment spawning enemies out of nowhere (ex. sniper or several of them in a window you have checked few times before you reached a certain point in the open), very few paths and places to reach, overly accurate and underintelligent enemies - this makes a big no-no to anyone who would rather have a decent ""sniper sim"" (the very first Ghost Recon was far better in that matter) instead of ""cod-like FPS with slower pace"". Those who don't care and like the x-ray shots and simply love WW2 setting should be satisfied enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game, it's epic. Personally I've always loved to snipe in various action/war games, and in sniper elite v2 they've pulled off the sniping quite well. So if you love to snipe, this is definitely a game for you. Although the game is in third person, you won't be noticing it too much, because you'll be looking through the scope anyway! The killcam/bulletcam feature in the game is amazing, and very well made, I reccomend setting it on increased frequency. A little short singleplayer perhaps, havent tried out the coop version yet, but I will.Can't wait for the 3rd one, (soon out!)Happy sniping!			",97,31,3,8,15,0,10

Product received for free
												The following is based mostly on single player campaign at the highest difficulty.Supercommando Elite Sniper Elite V2 sounds like an ideal sequel: bigger, prettier and more polished. Unfortunately it flushes a good basic sniping mechanic complemented by a delightful x-ray death animation system down the drain with horrendous design decisions like scripted enemies teleporting out of nowhere and lack of manual saving. Better place your bets on the sequels.+Graphics have aged pretty well and the game seems mostly well optimized. Lack of borderless window support is a pain though+On a decent SSD at least there are almost no loading times except when starting the game+In terms of production quality sounds and music are fine work+Depicts war torn areas reasonably well in the game's own limited context+Good sniping mechanics+X-ray killshots remain entertaining throughout the campaign-No manual saving. Did I say no manual saving? There is no manual saving-Only one checkpoint ""save slot"" that is used badly and far too sparsely. The game has no qualms about saving in the middle of a fight which may force you to restart a whole mission-Scripted enemy spawning out of nowhere. This is a running theme throughout the game that becomes predictable after a few missions.-Forced combat: no matter how stealthily you manage to get through one phase of a mission, the game can still throw a bunch of enemies in your face fully aware of your location-The game is very linear with usually only one path to follow in any area which doesn't really fit with the whole sniper theme, Then again the whole gameplay feels more suited for some kind of commando or saboteur game rather than a sniper game-Sniper duels are boring. As enemy snipers can spawn out of nowhere you tend to detect them by getting hit first. Then you wait for a moment to heal and try to return fire. Rinse and repeat-In some missions enemy snipers are utterly infallible and will shoot you with perfect accuracy and no detection or preparation lag of any kind, leading to very tedious gameplay-The player's weapon accuracy is laughably bad while enemies can hit you almost always no matter the distance or weapon. The silenced pistol is particularily inaccurate even at almost point blank range.-Hit detection is appalling at times. I lost count how many times I saw a bullet shot at someones face impact on a wall behind them instead-Absurd stealth mechanics. You either move soundlessly in a crouch (except when falling even a few centimeters, that makes huge noise) or then you run like a rampaging elephant which the enemies can easily hear. Oddly the enemies themselves hardly ever make any footstep sounds...-Some inexplicable framerate drops in simple cutscenes			",75,10,0,13,2,0,11

												Just finished up the last DLC achievements and Sniper-elite difficulty campaign last week. It had been a while since i played it and enjoyed myself a lot. Great game, loved sneaking around, shooting guys with the welrod, sniping them from afar, throwing rocks to distract them. I actually enjoyed it more than Sniper Elite III now. The setting during the last days of the Battle of Berlin was also fun, being stuck between the Ivans and Krauts. Had some great fights on rooftops being pinpoint down by snipers all around, destroying tanks, kill lots of enemies rushing your hideout...Together with Dishonored these Sniper-Elite games are some of the greatest and most enjoyable stealth games.

												Sniper Elite V2Story - Interesting, full of action, has awesome moments! 9/10Storyline Length - Should take you a couple hours. It isn't that long of a game.AI - Quite stupid on easier difficulties, but on Sniper Elite difficulty, they will hunt you down. They'll use grenades, be accurate with their bullets, even try to surround you. 8/10Experience - Singleplayer campaign is cool, you can replay it a couple times and still not get bored, the coop is brilliant, but the multiplayer can go burn in hell. Honestly, I expected a stealthy game where you get in, do the objective, get out. But NOOOOOOoooooOOOOOO, you can't finish an entire mission in stealth. Still pretty awesome! 8.5/10Graphics - Quite realistic, there's a lot of detail in nearly everything on high graphics. 9/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Gunshots, explosions, Nazis shouting at you to ""Show yourself, dog!"", reloading sounds, it's all just really beautiful. 10/10Controls - Easy to learn, a bit too easy to learn. Great tutorial, I'd say! 10/10Overall - 9/10It's a fun WW2 Sniper game, you've got enemies around every corner, you've got targets to kill (obviously), you've got♥♥♥♥♥♥to explode, you've got the absolute awesome experience of being a sniper. If you haven't played this game, then atleast try out the demo. It's super fun! Forgot to mention, when you get a vital shot on an enemy, it shows you this X-Ray killcam, a bit like Mortal Kombat's X-Ray thingy. I'm not a psychopath but this is the only reason why I have 222 hours in this game.(The DLC is cool too, you get to kill Hitler >:3 )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1/10***** sniping ***** is REALLY fun in this.  Game had alot of potential - graphics are great.  Physics are neat - and sometimes glitchy af.most of the game was more or less cod with a scoped rifle.  not sure why it makes sense for a sniper objective to require clearing out the map - esp parts with 10+ AI in the same spot running at you with machine guns.-3 for terrible AI and bad pacing.  AI can shoot through walls.  Most of the time, enemies won't spawn until you walk up far enough.  Several places they will spawn right on top of you.  This really makes sense for a sniper game?  No.-2 for terrible difficulty scaling.  Headshots don't always instakill - yeah makes sense with a sniper rifle okay.  The game doesn't get tougher with the difficulty raised.  All they did was increase the bot HP/accuracy.-2 for terrible controls.  After you carry a body, and put it down, your guy stands up and makes noise.  Sometimes walking over parts of the map with rubble makes your guy trip and make noise.  You can climb up spots in the map, but you can't climb down - you have to jump?  Half the time when you try searching a body, it will trade your gun instead of searching the body.  The ""throw"" arc doesn't work well at all, it's very inaccurate and doesn't always show-1 for locking the over-shoulder camera to one position.  This makes it very annoying to shoot from the left side of cover.-1 for awful weapon system.  You can only sight down the sniper rifles.  You basically hipfire every other gun.  It gives you a tiny focus, but it's all hipfire.  This makes a headshot on a guy 10 feet in front of you random luck.  Yeah it's a sniping game, but if we have to kill loads of enemies what good is hipfire with only 1 clip?Most annoying game I've played in awhile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't expect to have as much fun as i did with this one. The game starts off pretty weak with the regenerating health system being the main flaw that i could spot instantly. This coupled with enemy placement in the early stages makes the game feel too easy even on the highest difficulty setting as there is little to no consequnce if you get shot. In turn this enables you to be pretty reckless using the crosshair or ""quickscoping"" to take down targets in one shot even from point blank distance, neutralizing the need for a sidearm in CQC engagements.Later on, however, the pace picks up and the stakes get high as there are more enemies arround and you'll have to plan your shots accordingly lest you want to be dead within seconds. Another feature that plays an important role later on but is sadly downplayed on the earlier levels due to the reasons mentioned above, is ""masking"" your shots using ambient noise to avoid being detected by the enemy.As the game progresses engagements and scenarios become more memorable with a certain fire fight on the rooftops of war-torn and ravaged Berlin being an incredible experience.The game's trademark feature (or gimmick) is the gruesome killcam that resembles MK9's X-ray moves. Personally i love it but there is the option to reduce its frequency if you want to.The game's story is forgetable and it's there only as a reason for you to snipe some dudes.On a technical level the game looks and performs great and there are lots of options in the menu to customize your experience. A benchmark is also included.What stood out for me though in the technical aspect was, inspite of the levels being pretty big and beautiful, the load times were incredibly short and almost zero on my dated sata2 7200.11 drive.As far as multiplayer is concerned there is a slew of co-op missions and 3 different modes as well as vs with a server browser. From what i got to play the netcode was good and the vs part was surprisingly active and fast for a sniper game as you could tag opponents for your teammates to see, effectively countering camping to a degree and preventing the game from becoming a total snoozefest.Recommended.

												Its ""meh"" at its best and ""meh"" at its worse.A third person action shooter hiding itself under weak stealth aspects. I played on normal as a clasical FPS scum and it was a breeze. Stealth melee kills give only 10 points, while a full alert sniper rifle kill gives 25. Also, a game that has to limit the ammo of the smg to add up to the stealth is defenatly doing something wrong. In the end Youre just a superman wining the war all by yourself. Cant say anything about higher dificultys, but if You dont want to spend half an hour creeping around linear streets filled with enemys and still killing all of them (because the map is so narrow) or go in guns blazing this isnt a game for You.Also, what was a russian sniper doing on a roof of a german held museum 5 meteres from a german infantryman? Ohh yeah, we just put those snipers all a round wihthout thinking....			",31,1,3,2,1,0,9

												Ever since I tried the demo of Sniper Elite V2 on my PS3, I've put it into my wishlist. Then, Christmas 2014 happened. The game was being given away for free. I took the opportunity to download it. So totally worth it. Even if it wasn't free, I'd probably buy it. It was just that good. The X-Ray kills in this game are so mesmerizing. It made me go ""Oooh!"", or it made me go ""HAH!"". And the story was interesting, too. The one thing I never expected from such a great game like this is the story's length. It's damn short. Also, I haven't had much run with the multiplayer, simply because I just wasn't really interested in it, but it is nice to try it. Regardless, SE V2 is a must-buy.			",212,57,3,6,18,1,5

												This game is fun at first, but it gets very repetitive by the time you're halfway through.It would be more accurate to call this a stealth game than a sniper game, though chances are most of the time you'll get discovered and it'll be a straight up shoot-out anyway. The game flies in the face of game logic that bringing a sniper rifle to a firefight means insta-death for you, with it expecting you to use the rifle in close-quarters combat, as the regular machine guns are the useless weapons this time round.What you're left with is basically a shoot-em-up, going from point A to B, and repeat, plowing through firefights as you go. You might be expecting some sort of sniper simulator, but even in this game you're a super soldier single-handedly winning the war by wading into battlegrounds, walking up to enemies and shooting them no problem. On harder difficulties it instead turns to frustration as you have to restart the entire part several times because of a hidden sniper taking you out when the coast was supposedly clear.With no variation, it gets boring fast, if not infuriating.A Steam game review without any forced jokes. I bet you did Nazi that coming.			",52,39,0,11,6,0,6

												How could you ♥♥♥♥ up the Mosin like that?The PU variant has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turned down bolt handle not a straight one and no you cannot fix that by only turning the bolt halfway you idiots.Otherwise great game though, get to brain goosesteppers all day long, no need for an FAL since that would be anachronistic.Speaking of which, Cold War DLC/full size game when?

												Are sniper rifles your favorite weapons in Counter-Strike?Do you main a Sniper in Team Fortress 2?Do you play sniping a lot in Call Of Duty or Modern Warfare?Do you prefer sniping in any FPS games at all?Well guess what? You haven't sniped until you've played Sniper Elite V2. This game makes sniping in all other FPS look like child's play. Every inch, every breath, every mouse sensitivity will decide the end of your target, or you.Sniper Elite V2 sets the standard for stealth sniping, without a suppressed sniper rifle. The environment will be your shroud. Strike like the shadows, unseen and unheard. Be a ghost, be a spectre. Be a sniper, be an elite sniper.Easily a 7 out of 10. Recommended, better than a whole lot of FPS out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Cripple V2...Damn that guy who made me install it, it does not worth cards it's given with.First of all I asked if it has ballitstics, yes it has he said. Jupiter ballistics. I have no idea how shiТty Springfield IRL, but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have to adjust sights on 100m distance. To compensate that game's smgs fire on 20m and pistols are close to melee. I understand this is a game, but I don't find this approach nor interesting nor benefiting for gameplay somehow.Guard had 2 bullets for his smg... What for? One for shooting himself and other just in case he misses? And This is in the game where buttshots are deadlier tham headshots, gives clue on why enemies are so dumb.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just don't. This game will break your heart like the ending of Mass Effect. SO much potential and some truly AMAZING moments. Then the game kicks you...HARD. For a game that is designed to allow you to snipe, there's entirely too many moments where you're just not allowed to. The biggest offense is that bad guys just pop into areas when you pass invisible checkpoints. ""Hey I just cleared this entire area....BLAM! Where did that guy come from???"" Speaking of checkpoints, the lack of a quicksave is just plain STUPID. Also, you never know when you get an autosave so everytime you die it's a surprise on how much of the lame game you're going to have to replay. Just don't.			",239,77,1,17,16,5,35

												In my opinion, a sniper game should challenge the player, except for shooting, observation and patience. But this game feels more like a hunted house, the enemy would just teleport in and try to scare you, and you can kill them by your longer hp bar and superman-like health regeneration.Actually I quiet like the bullet time design, that is the only reason I play this game to the end. But I wouldn't recommend this game as a good sniper game.			",96,32,1,12,17,0,22

												(Based on the hardest difficulty, as I didn't bother playing the lower ones)Pros:+ Gravity affects ballistics.+ So does wind.+ And heartbeat.+ Single AI soldiers sometimes manage to outflank the player.+ Player can use enemy weapons.+ Missions are alright.+ It's rather important to stay concealed.+ The game is quite fun.Cons:- Can't destroy light sources like lamps.- Light doesn't seem to really matter much anyway.- Bullets do not penetrate objects.- Can't use surroundings to make camouflage.- No injuries at all, the player and his enemies are either dead or alive and a shot to a limb doesn't make it unusable. Evident existence of health points.- You can take quite a few bullets before dying.- Regenerating health. Get shot a few times, hide, repeat.- AI doesn't work in groups, they are just a bunch of individuals.- The game is too action-oriented and it's much easier to kill every single enemy soldier than to sneak past through them.- Maps are closed and linear.- Sneak through the whole map, have an AWESOME cutscene, now everbody knows where you are and you must kill them.Overall it's amediocre action game that doesn't have much in common with an actual combat.

												I got this game for free during a promotion recently, so I really didn't have anything to lose by trying it. But having played it for several hours now, I'm glad to say I'd have paid full price for it (and I'm very likely to buy V3). The sniping mechanics are extremely satisfying, the visuals are crisp, and the gameplay can be frantic at times.There are a few minor problems. The AI is very hit-or-miss. Sometimes they'll loop around and flank you before you realize what's happening, while other times they get stuck against a tree or other object and make themselves an extremely easy target. Additionally, stealth kills are problematic. If you hit the indicated button when behind an enemy to perform a quick takedown, it usually doesn't work if the enemy is seated. Likewise, you can't perform this technique from any angle other than directly behind the guard, which frustrated me when I would tap the button while slightly diagonal to the guard only to have nothing happen.Aside from those gripes though, it's a very satisfying game and a nice (dare I say much-needed) return to the WWII setting. A++ would play again.			",128,61,1,16,11,1,11

												I'm not really a fan of shooters that are based off of historic wars. War stories typically don't intrigue me and I usually find them to be repetitive and dull, which means games like this need to have superb gameplay in order for me to enjoy it. Fortunately, Sniper Elite V2's gameplay delivers.Story:The game takes place in Berlin. It's 1945 and nearing the end of World War II. The Americans are gathering the best of Germany's rocket scientists and V2 programme architects for Operation Overcast. You assume the role of Karl Fairburne, an american sniper sent out to make sure those scientists don't end up in Russia's hands.Gameplay:Unlike other modern day shooters, Sniper Elite V2 doesn't focus so much on going in guns blazing. Instead, it focuses on stealth and strategically timing your shots in order to complete your mission unnoticed and unharmed. As you can probably tell by the title, this is a sniping game. It's largely focused on sniping your enemies from distances while staying in cover. Sniping out enemies with your rifle is so satisfying thanks to the x-ray effect. When you pull the trigger, a short slow-motion cinematic shot will begin showing the bullet penetrate your enemy. For example, if you shoot your enemy through the eye, it'll show the bullet penetrating the eye and coming out of the back of the skull. Even after doing this for hours, it never gets old. You're always trying to get that next great headshot. However, it's not all about sniping. There will be times when an enemy soldier will be alerted by the sound of your rifle and you'll have to defend yourself in other ways. The game allows you to carry three weapons at a time. This usually consists of one rifle, one pistol and one machine gun. The game also allows you to carry various equipment such as trip wires, land mines, dynamite and even rocks to distract your enemies. With so many options, the gameplay definitely makes up for it's lack of interesting storytelling.The game also has different collectibles to pick up throughout each level if you care about that sort of thing, but it's up to the player and isn't necessary in order to complete the game. It's a nice additional feature that encourages the player to explore every corner of the map. Conclusion:If you're a fan of third-person shooters, stealth games, or if you just love sniping, I'd definitely check this out. I'd also recommend getting the DLC packs for this game as they contain extra missions and weapons. I can't say the additional weapons are worth it because I didn't find myself using them that often. However, the four additional missions should add on a few more hours of fun if the base game left you craving more.			",252,110,24,15,32,5,6

												This is a beautiful game I must say! The game's genre should be really action/stealth because I find that the majority of the time you are out to snipe people's head from range and still remain hidden. This is actually crucial if you are playing this on harder difficulty, but I just played it on normal difficulty and still found that being stealthy and doing stealth kills is a plus rather than go charging and spraying.What I didn't like so far was the fact that there were no *silenced* sniper rifles, or at least an option to add a silence to it. Because I prefer that all my shots from out of line of sight be quiet shots rather than me kill one person and then a battalion of troops somehow find out where I am camping and start blasting my area!But I suppose back in the day - there weren't really any silenced sniper rifles, were there? If that were the case in this game is trying to be as close as possible to what it was like back in the WW2 days with what weapons and arms existed at the time, ok fair enough I won't argue with that; however, if not - I do wish there was some sort of silencer for the rifles. Though if this is really an *action* intended game rather than stealth/action, ok I can understand them not adding a attachable/detachable silencer of sorts to any gun.Yes there is a silenced pistol I use to do stealth kills, but that won't get a target that's 1km away from where you stand/crouch/prone!But that's it, everything else is perfectly fine!What's next is to find some people that I can do co-op mode with throughout the entire game to see what that's like.I'm definitely looking forward to Sniper Elite 3. Might grab the first one to see how it all started.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good game that I picked up for free.The game's title says it all. The primary weapons are snipers with SMGs, handguns, RPGs and fixed MGs aiding in combat.Gameplay is quite good.The controls are more or less satisfactory.There are four modes: singleplayer story, singleplayer challenge, multiplayer and coop.The story is ok. I invested most of my time on the challenges killing waves of emerging enemies and seeing how long I last.My verdict: The game is worth buying if you like sniping or tps or games that offer a variety of modes.Don't hesitate to buy this game if it is on a super sale.

												Brilliant sniping game! I have been playing this series from 2006 (Sniper Elite : Berlin 1945), and I was so eager looking forward to the sequal, Sniper Elite v2. Honestly, this game did not live upto the expectations when it comes to gameplay, the original Sniper Elite was way better. But what this game does bring to the table is entirely different. * Multiplayer community is alive* Has CTF, TDK and TTH modes which can be played to kill time (a lot).* Co-op Campaign and Kill TallyIf you have played Sniper Elite : Berlin 1945 then you'll feel a bit let down with this, but it makes up for it with the online community, graphics (x-ray kill cams) and game modes! If you have played Sniper Elite III then you will absolutely love this game. Sniper Elite III is a train-wreck compared to this.If you love Sniping with friends, get it!			",467,167,23,44,41,1,42

												Sniper Elite V2 is a good and solid action sniper game. The story is quite good, well narrated and motivates to keep playing. Rebellion studio has returned with Sniper Elite franchise and has proven that there is a place for a game dedicated solely to sniper duty. Target hit effects are great throughout the entire game.The graphics aren't amazing, but still above average.The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat. Minor issues aside, headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.			",125,3,3,16,7,0,3

												Sniper Elite v2 is a third person stealth shooter from Rebellion software. It shares it's gameplay mechanics with Sniper Ghost Warrior series, but in a WW2 setting.As a, surprise surprise, sniper you'll operate behind enemy lines to eliminate some prominent nazi generals, explode rockets and help allies win WW2. Sniper Elite v2 is a game for rather patient people, it's kinda like Hitman. You should move unseen and eliminate or avoid enemies quietly. You can try to run and gun, but the main character is not bulletproof and dies in a few shots. Kinda like Agent 47.It's a good enough stealth game, even if it has some annoying issues. Mechanically the game is solid, the sneaking usually works, the shooting usually works, but sometimes it doesn't. Enemies might spot you through trees, from 300 meters, and shoot you through these trees to death. The sometimes odd camera will not show you the guy that is just around the corner and as soon as he sees you the whole map will know where you are. Some enemies will bug into a car or tree just to unbug at the perfect moment to break your cover and start shooting at you. So yeah, the game can be annoying. And the worst thing, one level where you're forced into close quarters. Ugh, that one is bad.Still, it's like WW2 Hitman with the possibility to shoot people in the head over long distances with nice slowmos of their vital organs being shattered into tiny pieces. It's actually quite cool. The game is not too short and not too long and should take about 10hrs on normal difficulty. The story is there, it's not too bad, a good excuse for some long distance headshots.I liked:* shooting people over long distances* cool slowmos of gruesome headshots* when sneaking and sniping works it's really cool* not too long not too short* the gfx in generalI disliked:* jerky animations* AI that can see you from 300m and can be deadly accurate with a machine gunGet this if:* WW2 Hitman seems interesting enough for youDon't get this if:* you're more of a run and gun type fellow* you can't stomach glitches and/or occasionally unfair AI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this free during a one day special to promote Sniper Elite 3, and I enjoyed playing through it. The less than frantic tempo appealed to me, and it's pretty cool, with the excellent bullet cam, to see a round go from your muzzle to smashing through, x-ray style, a Nazi head, body or testicles. The game is fairly linear, but it does try to give a few more open world options in certain places as well. Not quite a classic, but overall, recommended, and I'm looking forward to playing Sniper Elite 3 at some point for sure.			",76,6,13,5,14,0,12

												 I picked this game up in the sales after hearing very good things but i wasn't quite prepared for the glee i felt while watching Nazi testicles explode in bullet cam, although it sounds a bit disturbing it is immensely satisfying watching how your bullets injure targets and id be lying if I said i haven't been trying to hit every Nazi in the balls since.   Other then reproductive organ destruction the game is highly entertaining, whether your the stealthy type or a gun toting lunatic that charges head long into a gunfight. The only issue I have been having is getting stuck on odd corners and parts of the map when desperately trying to escape an irritated Tiger Tank. But all in all a delightful game and with  Sniper Elite 3 on the way my muscles are twitching at the prospect of unmanning some more of the Nazi menace.			",97,13,1,14,14,1,21

												I'm not really a fan of shooters that are based off of historic wars. War stories typically don't intrigue me and I usually find them to be repetitive and dull, which means games like this need to have superb gameplay in order for me to enjoy it. Fortunately, Sniper Elite V2's gameplay delivers.Story:The game takes place in Berlin. It's 1945 and nearing the end of World War II. The Americans are gathering the best of Germany's rocket scientists and V2 programme architects for Operation Overcast. You assume the role of Karl Fairburne, an american sniper sent out to make sure those scientists don't end up in Russia's hands.Gameplay:Unlike other modern day shooters, Sniper Elite V2 doesn't focus so much on going in guns blazing. Instead, it focuses on stealth and strategically timing your shots in order to complete your mission unnoticed and unharmed. As you can probably tell by the title, this is a sniping game. It's largely focused on sniping your enemies from distances while staying in cover. Sniping out enemies with your rifle is so satisfying thanks to the x-ray effect. When you pull the trigger, a short slow-motion cinematic shot will begin showing the bullet penetrate your enemy. For example, if you shoot your enemy through the eye, it'll show the bullet penetrating the eye and coming out of the back of the skull. Even after doing this for hours, it never gets old. You're always trying to get that next great headshot. However, it's not all about sniping. There will be times when an enemy soldier will be alerted by the sound of your rifle and you'll have to defend yourself in other ways. The game allows you to carry three weapons at a time. This usually consists of one rifle, one pistol and one machine gun. The game also allows you to carry various equipment such as trip wires, land mines, dynamite and even rocks to distract your enemies. With so many options, the gameplay definitely makes up for it's lack of interesting storytelling.The game also has different collectibles to pick up throughout each level if you care about that sort of thing, but it's up to the player and isn't necessary in order to complete the game. It's a nice additional feature that encourages the player to explore every corner of the map. Conclusion:If you're a fan of third-person shooters, stealth games, or if you just love sniping, I'd definitely check this out. I'd also recommend getting the DLC packs for this game as they contain extra missions and weapons. I can't say the additional weapons are worth it because I didn't find myself using them that often. However, the four additional missions should add on a few more hours of fun if the base game left you craving more.			",252,110,24,15,32,5,6

												An otherwise bland sniper game made somewhat memorable by its innovative features. V2 is great testicle-shooting fun for about 3 hours, but then it quickly gets overwhelming. Bullet ballistics were advanced and the simulation seemed quite a bit more accurate than other shooters. Getting long-distance kills was very satisfying, mainly because of the gory bullet-cam that displays your bullets entering your opponent's body and wreaking havoc on his organs.I would have loved for the sniping fun to continue, but all the sudden the game overwhelms you with massive numbers of... tanks. Yes, I said tanks. Literally, you're on the ground with no cover, trying to shoot a tiny fuel cap that will blow the thing up. All while it's pumping you with bullets. The game also incorporates a story, but it's bland and forgettable. Graphics are on-par with a decent game released in 2009, minus the bullet-cam (best bullet-cam ever).Multiplayer sucks. You all know how much it hurts to get sniped from across the map within a few seconds of spawning. Imagine this, but in a game with poor level design... where the only class is sniper. That, and there's almost never anyone playing.The price is horrific. Honestly, don't even think about spending $50 on this. If it goes on sale for under $15, you might want to consider it-- but don't expect too much.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												So you shoot people in this game. Yay. I got this game for free when Steam was giving it away one day, so really the only thing this game had to do was not be completely bad and I would be satisfied. Free games do that.What I saw was that this game actually isn't half-bad. I did have a nasty bug that crashed my game on the third level, but a fix for that was found and I encountered no other problems of that sort. Thus I was allowed to focus on what the game wanted me to do: to sneak around and put bullets in people's heads. Yeeeey. So you are an American sniper person sneaking around Berlin in 1945 and shooting some people who apparently deserve it. But since most of your targets are Nazi's, I suppose they do. Or you can just tell yourself they do and it can actually be a little convincing. Less able to be rationalized away is when you have to shoot Russians, which are allied with the US when the game is taking place, but apparently they deserve it too. So its a cold war game set in the closing days of WW2. That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the plot, and that narrative is certainly not what you should be looking for in this game.No, this game is about ending people. And in that regard, it can be pretty good. The slow-motion camera that tracks your bullet and lets you watch it kaboom their insides is a little creepy, but its not a deal-breaker. You can set traps so enemies sneaking up on you go boom instead, shooting when loud noises are happening can mask the sound of your shot, and you can actually be sneaky in this game and not have to kill everyone you see... sometimes. Sadly this game takes you away from the sneaky gameplay sometimes and puts you into big firefights against lots of enemies who are all trying to kill you. So that is a bit of a shame. Also enemy snipers can sometimes be really hard to find. But the game itself is functional at least, so you don't have to worry about bizarre bugs or (completely) brainless AI behavior.Really when it comes down to it though... even with its flaws, this game actually does let you play as a sniper who sneaks to a position, picks out a target, and then turns their head into goo. If that is something you want to do, then this is a pretty decent game for that. :)			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												So, I spent some time with Sniper Elite V2, here. Overall, it's a 6/10, and I will explain why.Initially, I got this game on the day it was free, so it scores some bonus points for not costing me any dosh. I installed it right away, excited about a WW2 Sniper shooter! I went in expecting levels with a wide variety of paths, ways to complete your goals, and all sorts of neato things like that. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I write this on finishing the campaign on the Sniper Elite, or Hard, Difficulty of the game.   Over a mind numbing 8 or so hours of dying, dying some more, crawling before dying, and dying again, I finally finished. On these 8 hours, I have to say that the campaign is fairly linear in the paths you can take, with only a few special spots you can get up in that give you any real advantage over the super aim of enemy soldiers. There's not many ways to skin the cat either, when it comes to completing goals or shooting targets. There's one set vantage point, or one set way to stop a convoy of vehicles, etc. I will applaud the story, though, for obtaining my interest and keeping it through the duration of the campaign.  On the story, it's somewhat generic, and I won't spoil it in this review. It was enough of a fresh breath, though, compared to the games around it that it stands out.   Mechanics wise, the bullet drop is interesting. Not as punishing or realistic as Red Orchestra 2, but not as rediculously cheesy as a game like COD. The cover system is mediocre, with your body sometimes sticking out enough for enemies to be able to shoot you, and on sniper elite, this will kill you every time. Enemy detection works alright, and the AI is fairly cohesive. I found myself flanked from time to time, and they aren't grenade spammy.   I don't care about graphics, so that doesn't weigh into this score. The multiplayer is fun with friends, and so is the co-op. Otherwise, don't bother.Overall, this game is a short, interesting little game about killing Nazis and Reds. Would I buy it? Only on sale. Would I reccommend it to friends? No. 6/10, and I'll probably wind up getting more time in it playing co-op matches and free for alls with friends, and having a grand time of it.			",140,12,1,11,8,1,17

												Sniper Elite V2 playing on Marksman and Rookie mode. Game so fun... Shooting Nazis like a Rambo going Rambo during Overwatch witch really brings nerves to my teammate Vladimir (DarkAce). Game is so fun especialy with friends.Teamwork and stuff. Anyway i go and try Sniper Elite mode. Pretty fun. This Sniper Elite difficulty kinda makes you wanna throw a rock.When Nazi approaches i quickly sprint to behind him and... Break his neck. 2 guys aregoing to investigate what is that soldier doing.They see a dead body one guard comes close to it while the other is coming to it. I suprise and Break his neck while i quickly run into a next guard and breack his neck. Then i Kill Sniper on Rooftop. Reposition. Shoot the one target witch is investigating the shoot at the area and i relocate again. then keep going that way. Plant 2 bag of explosives at SandBags & Truck.Okay good. Now i head into building and see a Nazi sleepin on his feckin chair. I approach carefully to punch him. Search his body. Good i found Tripmine. I keep going up i hear a German talking over radio. Radio Operator:Yes the convoy will be here soon.ˇ I made my way to ruined final floor. I am on Vantage point. APC and 3 trucks are coming. i wait for APC to come to truck then. Boom! Whilist i start shooting truck fuel tanks. to destroy them. Oh Scientist is trying to escape! I kill Mg. On the second floor on that building ahead of me. While i keep shooting other Nazis. There was the Scientist. Hiding... in my eye... Deep breath. And then BOOM! the bullet penetrates the eye and head skull & brain. Oh look! A Panzer II tank Approaches.While i knew he would come there so i seup a two charges incase a bigger reinforcement comes. I climb down. Finish the rest of the pinned down Nazis. Search the Scientist body. And i found the documents about Top Secret infrmation about V2 facility. I run in ruined buildings to vanish from Germans. (To be Continued). Anyway game is really nice. In Sniper Elite difficulty it makes you use mind witch is really fun.			",79,7,1,4,7,0,4

												I've found Sniper Elite V2 a very satisfying game. It runs incredibly smoothly on my laptop, despite the seemingly high-end graphics. It loads fast, it runs fast, and the gameplay, while repetitive, has yet to get boring.Like Thief and Hitman, Sniper Elite V2 is very much a stealth game, although when the sh-- hits the fan, things can get tense and fast-paced very quickly. For the most part, though, you are encouraged to sneak and be deceptive in your kills. A silenced pistol is handy for close encounters, while your trusty sniper rifle is, of course, the most satisfying. Still, there's something to be said for the satisfaction you feel when you hear a trip mine you placed go off.Like Max Payne, Sniper Elite V2 has a ""bullet time"" effect you can activate while sniping, slowing down the gameplay and allowing you to aim smoother and even zoom in a tiny bit more. It really helps when you're trying to line up a headshot against a guy ducked behind a barrel who you can barely see. And 75% of the time, when you fire, the game cuts to a slow-mo tracking cam of the bullet as it speeds towards its victim, and displays the trajectory of the projectile through the victim's body/head, somewhat like one of the more recent Mortal Kombat game's fatalities. It's a rather cool effect, and thankfully it doesn't hold you up when you're trying to kill a bunch of people at once.The only complaint I have for the game is the submachine gun, which, when mixed with the third person pov, can be very difficult to aim when used in an emergency, and really, the only time you want to be using it is when you're suddenly getting dogpiled by a ton of soldiers, so it's rather frustrating to have to lift the gun to aim and have your crosshair be completely off from where you think it would be.Honestly, I got the game for free when they were giving it away, but knowing now how much fun it is, I would gladly have bought it.

												Very Solid action/stealth game. The mechanics are great, really fit into gameplay. The gameplay does not feel artifical, it feels very organic and unqiue. If you have not played the first Sniper Elite, I would recommend this one over the first. Better gameplay and the mechanics and controls are more refined. Story is decent, nothing extremely different. I think everyone knows how WWII ends, but it changes it up with the inclusion of Russians being your enemies. The enviroments are detailed and do represent what WWII looked back in that time. Over all its a good game, a lot better than the first. I also got this for free so I really can't complain. ^_^			",145,6,2,6,1,0,4

												Sniper Elite V2 was a great game. I first got it for free on my old pc and played it. It was fun but my pc wasn't good enough to handle it. After getting my gaming pc, i've been playing it, and I seriously enjoyed it! It's really brutal and obviously not for the faint of heart but it's a thrilling and super fun experience. The game makes you feel skilled similiar to games like CS:GO and that really attracted me to it. If it's on sale or something for like 10-15 dollars, I'd get it. It's worth it and a blast to play. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Historically accurate weapons including WWII-era rifles and the infamous Welrod assassination pistol, along with a plausible story and actual footage from WWII just add the final touches to this badass game. The game play is smooth and polished, the Kill Cam is epic, and when you turn up the difficulty the bullet physics are brutally unforgiving and take a lot of trial and error to become skilled at. Did I mention how badass the Kill Cam is? Highly recommend this to not only WWII game fans, but to anyone who likes a good FPS action game.			",71,20,1,11,17,0,27

The game itself is not hugely long however the killcams/x-ray slow mo kills are both brutal and satisfying to pull off. There is some dlc available for this game which adds a couple more single player missions but also some new rifles/sidearms which give you a nice overall choice. Would definately recommend even tho it was from 2012 the multiplayer and co op modes add extra longevity to a very decent game!			",217,34,5,15,4,0,8

												I got this game when it was free on steam, and I am so happy that I was able to.If you enjoy action-packed third-person shooters, especially set in the WWII timeline, then you will really like this game.The aesthetics are fantastic! When using the sniper rifle, the kill cam will activate (quite often), providing a slow motion, x-ray view of where your bullet pierces the enemy. You can see things like the rib cage exploding, the testicles rupturing, etc. My personal favorite was when I headshotted someone, and the bullet exited and ricocheted (more like bounced, it didn't even move in a straight line) to the person standing next to him, resulting in a double kill. The music is also very good, creating intense firefights. The story is pretty basic, one man's mission to cripple the Nazi regime Rambo-style.The controls are typical of an action shooter, not at all diffcult to familiarize yourself with. The learning curve is moderate, as the game's difficulty requires a lot of preplanning if you intend to survive (especially on the hard difficulty) against the enemy. There are collectibles like these wine bottles you need to shoot, and gold bars you can pick up, which entice achievement junkies to explore most of each map.The game is a lot of fun, with multiple ways to complete your missions (stealth vs. guns blazings creates interesting scenarios). For example, you can try to snipe the gas valve on that enemy tank, or you could shoot the explosive next to it that you had planted in the beginning of the mission. Setting your traps (trip-wire bombs, antipersonnel mines) to deter the enemy and moving to different vantage points really makes you feel like a sniper deep in enemy territory.Try this game if you are interested in action shooters, with sniping as a critical element.Definitely recommend.

												Decent graphics, good controls, i would give this game a 7/10.The AI makes the Russians and Germans run like ducks, it's like playing a shooting game in a Carnival sometimes. Buy only if you are a real fan of the sniper genre, try the demo first. I found those X-Ray Killcams very repetitive in the long run, so i turned them almost off after 3 missions. The game is also very short, so it is not worth 50$, wait for a deal.			",249,22,0,34,54,1,98

												Sniper Elite V2 is a satisfying WW2 shooter taken from the perspective of an awesome sniper. The game is about the sniper stopping the V2 missiles from being launched but really, you probably won't care about the story. This game is all about the satisfying sniping mechanics. When you pull of a long distance shot, the game will follow that bullet in slow motion and show you where you hit the enemy and what bones you shattered. The game is extremely brutal but that is part of the fun. The game offers high difficulties that will make the sniping even more satisfying with more things to take into account such as the wind and how it will affect the destination of the bullet, and general bullet drop based on distance. The game doesn't offer a great amount of weapons for you to choose from but they all feel pretty great to use. The campaign in this game isn't all that long. You can finish it within 6-10 hours depending on the difficulty and how you progress through the stealth sections. One mode I can't really comment on is the coop in this game because unfortunately, I have no friends that wish to play this with me and I couldn't find anyone online. If you wish to get more out of this game, be sure to have a friend that wants to play it as well since the coop is dead. The sound in this game was pretty great and the graphics were good. The challenge maps were pretty good and it was pretty satisfying to shoot Hitler straight in the balls. 75 + 5 for being able to shoot Hitler in the balls and have an awesome bullet cam for it. 80/100			",646,136,23,81,50,5,98

												Sniper Elite V2 is a fun sniping orientated 3rd person shooter. In this game you play as a generic American White male with no backstory sent to single handedly take out hundreds of nazis. Bullet ballistics can be tweaked to be affected by wind, gravity, or nothing for a casual experience. The game does allow you to equip a secondary SMG and pistol but close quarters combat is usually not the correct play because you die very easily in this game. Enemy AI is competent enough to try to flank you while a sniper or mg nest pins you down.The shooting feels and sounds great. Also the by now iconic gore kill cams of the series are of course present and do a good job at breaking up the monotony of the otherwise very basic combat. There's nothing like seeing the same bullet enter the heart of one enemy and exit out te testicles of another. :) The kill cam can be turned off or lessened. Stealth is by far the most fun and effective way to play this game. However this is where the game's greatest issue surfaces. While the original sniper elite was about open levels where stealth was incredibly encouraged, Sniper Elite V2's levels feel like guided linear corridors in comparison. Stealth is also just not always an option sometimes which is frustrating. Enemy AI is for the most part decent. However, one annoyance was that if you are detected by one enemy soldier, for some reason literally all other enemies in the vicinity will immediately know your exact location. The game also has co-op missions/hoard mode which has no one playing it atm and multiplayer which is still active with a very small community. That being said as someone in US WEST, the closest server to me had a ping of over 500. Overall the base game is great fun but even for the somewhat low base price of 20 USD I say perhaps wait for a sale unless you really love sniping games. I usually take my time with games but for this game the main campaign literally took me only 6 hours to beat on the ""medium"" difficulty.As for the DLC, Neudorf features an open map that shows that the majority of the main game's maps should've been like. Aka decent sized maps where you can choose how to tackle the objective and use stealth. Landwehr is the hardest one by far which 100% requires stealth or you will lose. St. Pierre is extremely mediocre. All the mentioned DLC take about an hour each to beat which honestly isn't enough content for full price. Kill Hitler might seem cool at first... that is until you realize that you are paying 8 USD for a mission that is literally 20 minutes long.			",642,168,18,57,56,10,122

												The Sniping is super fun the slow-mo x-ray cam never gets old and if it did it can be switched off. I like the mechanics of using sounds to mask your shot sounds. The graphics for its age are decent. The sound design feels really weak though all dialogue seems to have an echo as if it took place in some church.What annoys me are some technical shortcomings. The mouse imputs seem to be awkward. No consistent sensitivity settings just two arbitrary sliders and the x & y axes seem to have different calibrations. So it took me a while to set a playable sensitivity.The movement feels clunky too often I awkwardly bumped into stuff.Also I found that during missions it was hard to plan ahead without having played the mission beforehand. This allows for multiple replays of a single mission to really ace it but on the first attempt it is very hard to foresee what lies ahead.To me the game was fun at first but as the fun from the nice sniping mechanics wore off soon and the other shortcomings of the game annoyed me more and more.

												Sniper Elte V2. O que é que eu posso falar.É um excelente jogo, mas tem alguns problemas, como o stealth que não funciona direito ou é praticamente impossível seguir de stealth.Contudo, as fases são bem feitas e os gráficos são ok.O preço, por R$55,00, não vale a pena comprar, eu sugiro que espere uma promoção, como a de algumas semanas atrás, quando estava acho que por menos de R$10,00.

												Excellent game, not played 1 or 3 yet, so can't compare. If you're used to fast paced games like Battlefield or COD, and like to snipe on them, this is a lot different. Every bullet counts.I play BF3/4 and even then we reload all the time when you feel like it, ammo all over the place. Not in this game there isn't. There were times I had one bullet left in the gun, but still never reloaded, just in case.I could have gone for the extra achievments like the bottles, but wasting my ammo shooting a bit of glass was a no brainer. Maybe on the 2nd playthrough.Those slow motion headshot, or even getting a couple in the old groin, was great to see. It also teaches you to not go running around like a madman. Many times, you're couting the rooftops, trying to see if its safe or not.I did enjoy it, recommend this to others. I also created a small game review here, only 5mins long:

												Sniper Elite v2 is a typical Spunkgargleweewee. It's levels are small and it's story non-existent. A large part of this game is taken up by shooting at 2nd deaf-blind battalion of the German Army. Other than that you plant bombs. That's it. It's ballistics and ""stealth"" are kinda nice, but don't help the game too much.I purchased this game for around 4€. It's low price at the moment of purchase is the only reason this game gets a positive review.			",114,7,3,16,8,0,6

												Now, this game is my favorite, not hard to play and i enjoyed the multiplayer. Stalking your prey and picking them off one by one....setting traps,bombing target areas and moving in for the kill.holding your breath as you squeezed the trigger, oh, the trill of the kill. The setting is great with old bombed out and ruined buildings , made for good hiding places. you feel like a real sniper...everyone should play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is grossly underrated! The campaign is great with an actual story line that flows like a book.  The multiplayer is great with i dare say much much better game play than CoD or even Crysis.  There, I said it.  But its true.  To play this game well you need cunning and patience but you can also be sucessful running around shooting at other players. I wish this game were more widely adopted by players and pro server administrators.			",67,4,1,1,4,0,0

												Game suffers from enemies popping in from nowhere when you complete an objective, so half the time there is no opportunity to sneak around or plan ahead.The game uses an over-the-shoulder camera style. You can't flip to the left shoulder, so most close-quarters fights are decided by whether or not your rifle can poke around a corner without the rest of your body exposed to the enemy.Not worth the full price.

												The Good:  I got the game for freeThe Bad: The levels and game-play are repetive.  Often times you will find yourself in the ""same"" buidling even in different places in the same map.  The encounters tend to blur together after a while.  Its all the same stuff over and over.  I would say that the only difference is the back-drop, but even that is mostly the same.The ugly:  The AI is insanely bad.  Enemies will happly re-position themselves in the same exact spot, the spot that contains a pile of corpses and proceed to quickly add to that pile.   The game sends waves of enemies after you, and each wave will do the same exact thing.  So you just fight the battle you just fought 2 or even 3 times in a row.  It is also annoying how you can ""clear"" an area of enemies, and then step over some invisible line and suddenly a new wave of guys appears out of thin-air.  Sometimes from rooms behind you with no possible way for them to have gotten past you.Once the AI is ""aggroed"", it will always know where you are.  It is both amusing and sad to see a bunch of the AI dudes tracking you though solid walls, standing there shooting at you endlessly.  They almost NEVER seek you out beyond thier scripted pattern of movement.  They could just run into a building or up some stairs to get you, but unless it is a scripted event they will stand there shooting at you through the walls, floors or celings.I have played enough of this game and I just can't take it anymore.  If you are bored, I wouldn't pay more than $1.99 for it.  I did manage to get 7 hours out of it before I couldn't stomach it anymore.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												Really want to recommend this game, but I simply can't. The sniping mechanics themselves are spot-on and are the best thing about the game. However, most of the levels have sections where sniping is effectively impossible thanks to too many corridors and enemies in confined spaces. This combined with the fact your other weapons are awful and that the AI knows exactly where you are when you fire, makes these urban sections terribly tedious. Its a shame because the sniping segments are massively fun, but the rest of the mechanics let the game down.			",67,10,0,18,13,0,21

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. This is because of the WW2 ira, which I am extermely into with games, but i also REALLY love the fact that it is a game dedicated to sniping. Another thing I love about the sniping is the bullet cams whenever you get a good shot, which i don't think any other game has yet. One more thing is the fact that in the harder modes, it focuses more on the real bullet ballistics when aiming down the scope, such as wind direction, speed and gravity of the bullets. Hard mode can take some getting used to, but I managed, so anyone should be able to. The answer is, YES! I definitely recomend this game to anyone into sniping or WW2. It is very enjoyable, and has got to be my most favourite game. I hope this interested you in the game.			",33,2,0,1,2,0,0

												While it is not the most polished game, by far my favorite sniping game by far. It is also very co-op friendly. I will say I love sniping, have always been very interested in WWII, and it always brightens up my day when I get to kill a few Nazis; if you do not fall in at least one of these categories, you will probably not enjoy this game as much as I do. I first bought it on xb360 and bought it again for pc because I enjoy so that much.If you like killing Nazis and presice shooting, this is the game for you.For people that love sniping: 10/10.For people who like shooters in general: probably 7/10.

												It's actually a very nice game, but sometimes there are too many scripted events. For example, you have to move up to a certain point to get the enemies to spawn behind a corner. If you try to kill them with a grenade, before going over the trigger for the script, they are just not there and so can't be killed. So basicially you have to go into a position where they can hit you much easier. (For example the entrance of the tower with the flaks on top. The enemies won't spawn until you get onto the stairs in the corner. Without this, you could easily throw a grenage up into the hallway and take out at least half of them.)And oh yeah, they could have given the enemies a few more lines. They are always saying the same 3 or 4 sentences, sounds just a little bit stupid and annoying.  Besides this, its not too bad. I'd still recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's actually a very nice game, but sometimes there are too many scripted events. For example, you have to move up to a certain point to get the enemies to spawn behind a corner. If you try to kill them with a grenade, before going over the trigger for the script, they are just not there and so can't be killed. So basicially you have to go into a position where they can hit you much easier. (For example the entrance of the tower with the flaks on top. The enemies won't spawn until you get onto the stairs in the corner. Without this, you could easily throw a grenage up into the hallway and take out at least half of them.)And oh yeah, they could have given the enemies a few more lines. They are always saying the same 3 or 4 sentences, sounds just a little bit stupid and annoying.  Besides this, its not too bad. I'd still recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've read about these games and I always felt they would never appeal to me as I thought it was just a boring game where you sniped people and had to score points and reach a target to unlock the next level sort of system, but I bit the bullet (excuse pun) and tried the demo and to be honest I was actually wrong. The game isn't that bad and the sniping mechs are in line with Fallouts V.A.T.S system and the bullet time is also like it if you needed an example but this game takes that system and slightly tweaks it to make it a bit more realistic with the way bullets actually hurt people by showing what damage it actually does to the body. And it's here where the game is made around to be honest if it didn't have this more realistic view of bullet time then the game would fall flat slightly as there's isn't much to do but follow on screen prompts to progress the level and basically get the best shots for the best points per kill.It may sound very boring and repeative but it's not too bad and the way you clear out a set of enemies is up to you my problem is I am armed with landmines which can be placed under bodies etc but you never know where the enemy will spawn as you progress until you've played that mission before so you can then plant them in places before they appear. The game's graphics are very nice and can even be high demanding I can play at HIGH with VSYNC on at 4X antitropsic, 1920x1080p@60hz and I have a i7 2600k, 8GB DDR3 1600hz Crucial Ballistix RAM, 2GB 7850 GPU and if I put it up even more I get sluggishness, On HIGH it looks great so be prepared to push your system with this game for better graphics.

												(Ignore my low amount of play time on this game. I've played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the demo, and have completed the Wii U version on various difficulties, and also played and completed the original game from 2005.)PROS:+Decent PC port, has a good amount of graphic, display, control, gameplay, and audio options, runs okay on my crappy laptop on lowest settings.+Pretty cool DLC that lets you fight an army of Nazi Zombies, and/or kill Hitler himself!+Solid sniping mechanics, accounting for variables like wind, heart rate, and distance.+Adjustable difficulty levels for AI, sniping, and in game assistance.+Bullet cam is cool as ♥♥♥♥.IN-BETWEEN:+/- Soundtrack is okay, but nothing memorable.+/- Graphics aren't the best, but not the worst either.+/- Voice acting is better than that of the first game, but that's not saying much.+/- Levels look nice, but are very linear in design.+/- SMGs and Pistols are effective for close quarter combat, but it can also take over a full Thompson mag to kill one guy.CONS:-Karl Fairburne (player character) still has less personality than a piece of cardboard.-The brown palette of the original Sniper Elite has been replaced with various shades of blue and white!-Generic, tacked on multiplayer.-Open ended levels of the original have been replaced with more linear ones, with some exceptions.-AI are dumb as rocks on all difficulties for the most part.-In the original you had a more realistic health system, with each part of the body slowly getting damaged the more you get shot there, you needed medkits to survive. Too much damage to your legs, and you'll need to crawl to safety, headshot and it's game over. In here however, you have regenerating health and the ability to take cover from almost anywhere, so you might as well be the ♥♥♥♥ing Terminator.-Long loading screens.OVERALL:Fans of the orignal might not enjoy it as much, but anybody new to this franchise will probably like it.

												Eleinte kétkedve álltam neki ennek a játéknak,de hamar rá kellett jönnöm egy jól összerakott kis game-l van dolgom.A megvalósítás zseniálisra sikerült,a történettel sincs bajom,szerintem egy rövid és egyszerű,de hangulatos játékra találtam.Az X-ray effectek is jól sikerültek.Néha azon kaptam magam ,hogy hangosan felnevetek mikor az ellenség golyóit sikerült ellőnöm,merő véletlenségből,és itt most nem a puskályuk golyóira értem :)Engem személy szerint meggyőzött a játék,hogy érdemes kipróbálnom a többi részét is.Amint alkalmam lesz rá be is fogom szerezni őket.Csak ajánlani tudom mindenkinek.

												Awesome game, really fun, has the possiblity to play with friends and doesn't require much from the computer to run at 120 fps. One of the things that diferentiate it from other FPS snipers is the Bullet Travel Time, and Bullet Drop, meaning that the bullet takes more time to reach it's target and will go down due to gravity. Lower dificultys make it so enemys do less damage, makes the physics less realistcs, therefore making the game easier, however, the Sniper Elite dificulty makes it so that there is more realistic physics, enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage and eliminates the little Square that marks where your bullets are going to go, and to go around that, you have a stealth mechanic, different explosive armaments to make traps or to use in direct combat, such as grenades, land mines and trip mines			",17,0,0,2,1,2,2

Still would recommend it, but didn't live up to Sniper Elite 1 because of dumbing down process.			",100,7,0,11,4,1,4

												Slow motion headshots and nutshots are awesome but if you make a game entirely on that concept you are gonna have a bad time. This game has like 8 missions all of which you infiltrate some buildings and then have to assassinate a nazi, and then get out again. You play as an american sniper who has to stop the nazis fireing a V2 rocket. That is the enitre story. No more no less. The multiplayer in this is also bad. And the coop even worse since it is the exact same missions as in the singleplayer but now with two people. The game is bad but the head and nutshots are satisyfing as hell. 5/10			",149,17,4,16,15,1,5

												Simple story guides you through a series of missions that test your sniper skills. Sniping is pretty much what this game is all about and it does it well, with the kill xray cam adding to the general experience. It's fun to play if you only have a couple of minutes to get you to a next checkpoint or if you have a cople of hours to actually finish the whole game in one go. Aside from that however it doesn't have much to offer, the levels are simple, straithforward and linear with pretty much only one way to finish them, still the simplicity of design does not negate the generally positive feeling of fun it provides. Co-op missions are pretty much the same as single player with few instances where one of the players is a spotter and does not have a sniper rifle. Multiplayer wise everyone is a sniper and depending on the mode selected you either kill everyone else or the enemy team. Overall a solid piece of fun especially if like me you got it for free on the 24h super special deal they had going about a month ago:)7/10			",126,15,4,14,19,1,20

												First off the game has good graphics and bullet physics which you don't see in other FPS games. But aside from that the game isn;t much fun. The game heavily relies on stealth which is fine execpt for the fact that you only have one silenced pistol that is hard to aim with. To continue, most of the missions are very repeatitive. Plant a bomb here and shot it. Rescue this guy. Shoot this guy after trudging through boring enimes. Its the same thing everytime execpt for a few missions.

Your sniper is powerful and easy to use. The graphics looks a bit old, but if you are not that kind of guy who always only looks at the graphics, then you might enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can try online if you want, it might be fun but most people know the maps like the inside of their pockets, giving you a giant disadvantage. So, if you want to play it, I recomment a couple of friends to play multiplayer with.Furtheron, I like this game. amazing graphics, amazing gameplay and the multiplayer gamemodes and mechanics are also good. Storyline might become boring after a few runs, but the multiplayer is fun, and more fun with friends.			",149,16,5,10,11,1,17

												I really didn't intend to spend 180 hours on this game.  The campaigns were fun to work through at first, then again at harder levels.  The real fun came when I started playing multiplayer.  Actual techniques and tactics became important there and it was fun to learn things on teams with more skilled players.  After that, it became more fun with different groups playing sniper games or capture the flag with entire different approaches.  The people playing this are generally fun, making multiplayer games something easy to jump into when you have time for some stress relief.			",345,71,18,43,33,4,69

												At the start, this game didn't seem to have that much going for it. The graphics aren't great, the maps are small, and the AI is ever-so-slightly buggy. But as I got more and more into it, I actually started really having fun.The sniper mechanic is wholly enjoyable, with Nazi mooks milling around just asking for that cap in the brain. Something really cool about this game is that it supports my psychotic tendancies. To wit, each time you get a successful kill, the game shows a little cutscene of a bullet ripping through the organs of an unaware goose-stepper. Add to this the scream that rings out after each kill, and you have a system that makes my insane little heart jump with joy.It's wierd, it's gory, it's hard, it's insane, and it's a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

Hell, you can even explode a grenade lodged at an enemy's belt with a careful shot.And what's more satisfying then blowing up tanks with just your precision rifle.The best sniper simulation shooter game out there. With stealth, your trusted binocular to track enemies; gravity, wind, and bullet power to take into account, every shot must count and the smallest mistake means death (though the enemy AI is somewhat lacking).9/10 would snipe again.

												Sniper Elite V2 is a good stealth game. But it's far from perfect. With repetitive objectives and missions that result in a shoot-out all over the place, Sniper Elite V2 has a lot of short-comings. Still, it is an enjoyable game, just not as much as I had hoped it would be.Pros ++ Solid coversystem+ Enemy AI (higher difficulties, like Sniper Elite)+ Multiplayer+ Good graphicsCons -- Poor obective variety (kill this guy, destroy that and so on)- Sound effects (pretty bad)- Enemy AI (Cadet, Marksman difficulty)- Grenade throwingVerdict : A solid 7/10While the game can be a bit repetitive and have poor sound effects, Sniper Elite V2 is still an enjoyable game, and a good stealth game.

												I picked up Sniper Elite during their promotion yesterday and for a free game, it is a great one. Interesting storyline and gameplay that gives an interesting view as to what it means to be a wartime sniper.However, some of the bugs really take away from what this game could be. For example, when crouchwalking, the legs move awkwardly, clipping a tiny bit every time. Going down the stairs increases the clipping significantly. Additionally, the firing on the  silenced pistol (I can't remember the name) is very sporadic. One minute, I can hit headshots in succession fairly easily. The next, I can hit everything EXCEPT the enemy.That last thing that really bothered me was the cutscene animations. There are multiple examples of where characters are supposedly standing still, but looking at the feet, they are slightly clipping through the ground.Like I said, for a free game, it was great, but from what I've observed of the game mechanics itself, it is not worth 30 USD.

												This game again garners mixed feelings from me. It does make me feel like a BADASS sniper instead of some COD rambo, and it is frankly the fps which I have been wanting to play for a long time. Alas, it is marred by the inconsistency in sound( especially explosions), the hit and miss of bullet trajectories, unrealistic hit points ( some guys survive my headshot) and extremely clunky close quarter combat.  The last sniping mission to assasinate a commander in a driving car is epic, and probably is this game's saving grace. Skip this game if you hate repetitive missions and cant stand the inaccuracy in ballistics, as the camera X-ray shots can only compensate as far as your tolerance level is.Edit: Well, after playing some multiplayer and getting to know the nuances of crosshair aiming, I have got to say most of the hit and miss of trajectories are my mistake. Nevertheless, there are still inconsistency but it is rare. A positive rating from me, at least for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 is a very good game, I didnt played story yet but MP is quite enjoyable.You can use your pistol to make a quick kill, or with Springfield/Mosin kill a target fromdistance. And traps! Most beautiful thing in this game, you have one land mine and onewire trap.PROS:-Good graphics-Traps-Set up your own loadout-German/Russian/American teams in MP-Create your own server in MP -Ultimate fun with friends-UPCOMING SNIPER ELITE V3CONS:-Stupid server owners keep limiting traps/pistols-Game requires fast player actions to stay alive(Naturally, sniping game)**I can suggest you to buy this, its really fun in MP- since its an stealth/snipinggame you have to be patience.

												If you're one of those FPS gamers who play with nothing but snipers, this is the game for you. On one hand, the sniping in this game is unparallelled by any other and deserves a 10/10. On the other hand, if you're in close combat or use anything other than a sniper then this game is one of the worst shooters ever and deserves a 3/10.			",156,9,6,21,10,1,4

												Good Game, But It Needs ImprovementThis is a great game; it captures a lot of depth into how long range bullet ballistics and historical facets of WWII. But it desperately needs to be reworked to fit. There will be many times within the game where you will be forced to think not as a sniper, but a Rambo style killing machine. The beginnings, half-way points, and endings will decently fit the bill as using precision skill and timing with your rifle. As in, scripted parts of the game. But in-between those key points it asks you to do things in another fashion. Such as level's two and three. In 2 you're in many tight corridors, so you have lots of straight shots. But you have zero visibility, enemies running up to you and killing you because you're on the ground, and enemies that will actually spawn before your eyes in the same tunnel. This means that your rifle is practically useless and your best choice is using your machine gun and running. Next we have level 3. Again, lots of tight corridors, low visibility, and more enemies that spawn only when you come within a certain close distance. Your only choice on any difficulty higher than the average is machine guns and running. It's a great game and I love it for its sniping parts, but it needs to be that at least most of the time, not a Call of Duty esc rampage. And I am sorry for using that comparison, but the Duty series appers to be the benchmark that the developers making this went for.			",41,4,0,9,5,0,1

												This game was potentially my second favorite purchase in the last week, behind PAYDAY 2 and surpassing Portal. SEv2 is an oddball of a game. It is at some points filled with action and then in other points you're wondering where did everyone go? As far as a sniping game, it is VERY VERY satisfying when you get your shot off as your round gruesomely penetrates the skull of your enemy in an X- Ray view of their skull shattering as the bullet tears through like... well, a bullet. It's  not necessarily hard to get your shot off in this game, MUCH easier than Battlefield 3/ 4. In a way the sniper physics are kind of unrealistic but unles you're a purist you can get over that aspect. Very fun game, and would recommend it to anyone willing to try it.			",80,5,3,4,3,1,1

												This is a very well done game. I've been a fan of the Sniper Elite series since the beginning and this game definitely does the license justice. If you ever wanted to have that one shot, one kill experience then this game will give it to you. The new x-ray kill cam is just icing on the already fattening cake. With the kill cam and good aim you can get head shots, organ shots, and even wounding shots that make the enemy call out for help then guess what...you get two kills for the price of one. The only gripe I would have with the game is the parts that are set to trigger enemies and no matter how stealthy you've been, it turns into all out chaos. That is truly my only negative thing to say about the game. In closing I'll say this, if you even have the slightest intrest in anything I've mentioned at least download the demo and see for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's actually a very nice game, but sometimes there are too many scripted events. For example, you have to move up to a certain point to get the enemies to spawn behind a corner. If you try to kill them with a grenade, before going over the trigger for the script, they are just not there and so can't be killed. So basicially you have to go into a position where they can hit you much easier. (For example the entrance of the tower with the flaks on top. The enemies won't spawn until you get onto the stairs in the corner. Without this, you could easily throw a grenage up into the hallway and take out at least half of them.)And oh yeah, they could have given the enemies a few more lines. They are always saying the same 3 or 4 sentences, sounds just a little bit stupid and annoying.  Besides this, its not too bad. I'd still recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a good game. Scenario is about to V2 Rockets. Mission types aren't so much but some enjoyable missions can found for every wargame player. The environment is not so bad and you can adapt easily. Most of missions has a neccesery  of silence. On first try it looks like a good assasination system but it's more different than this, you can understand it on your another tries. In my opinion this system can't force you enough to be silence, you can solve everything with violance. But when you choose the noisy way you can take your SMG gun instead of your sniper or pistol and  fire them. These smg bullets must kill the enemy soldier at first or second shot. Because you firing from short distance. But thats not happening. The soldiers hit by the bullets and again and again. They are just dancing with bullet and just dies at half of your magazine. The snipy way is more good than this. (But i chose the smg.) Take you sniper right click and open your scope aim, fire and kill. You can aim to the grenaides at the belly of an enemy and when you hit boom the grenaide explodes and many of enemies are died. You can do the same for the trucks which transports enemies. And also tanks. You can shoot tanks but this is silly for me. If can you really do this at the real war tanks should became useless.You can also put traps but they are not very useful but when you use them effective they will be funny for you. And if enemies are watching the way which you must go you can throw a rock to scam them.  The graphics are well to most of pc's and they don't look bad. The X-ray system is very funny. Hit the enemy and watch how you hit him. Voices are not so specific.Multiplayer is funny for a short period for me.People sneaks and i couldn't find 'em. Lastly this game is not very very good but it's good to play.			",52,10,4,7,7,2,9

												In my opinion this game is worth playing. DLC really makes the game better because it has quite limited amount of weapons without them. Shame that you can't make your own character or modify your weapons because it would good feature to add. Also few extra missions would be great. Things that i liked: 3rd person view, Shooting, Story of the story mode, DLC weapons and maps, Graphics and Shot highlights.Things that i didn't like: Multiplayer, Narrow selection of weapons without DLC, Short storymode, AI can see you from anywhere and other game modes.I would rate this 4/5			",25,1,16,5,3,1,1

												I really didn't intend to spend 180 hours on this game.  The campaigns were fun to work through at first, then again at harder levels.  The real fun came when I started playing multiplayer.  Actual techniques and tactics became important there and it was fun to learn things on teams with more skilled players.  After that, it became more fun with different groups playing sniper games or capture the flag with entire different approaches.  The people playing this are generally fun, making multiplayer games something easy to jump into when you have time for some stress relief.			",345,71,18,43,33,4,69

												I don't know why so much negatives about this game because this is a very realistic sniper simulator despite sometimes levels too linear for stealth but anyway it's one of the best games of 2012. Your level of enjoyment will be almost directly mapped to how entertaining you find the visual spectacle to be, and - for me at least - it was perfectly good fun in short bursts.So, the game started pretty much like the Nazi Zombie Army mod but without the zombies and with some stealth elements. Seemed decent enough. First missions went like a charm a bit boring and repetetive altogether but still somewhat fun, so I kept playing.Advanced ballistics system, Sniper Elite's saving grace, does not hide the game's flaws, but rather puts them out for all to see.

												Pretty good game. Picked it up during the free day and wanted to try it out. The campaign was alright. Quite enjoyable with different tactics despite the linear gameplay. Tutorial was annoying and unhelpful but then again most games' tutorials are anyway. I have enjoyed what I have played so far of the singleplayer despite the story not massively gripping me.The multiplayer isn't my sort of thing. I love stealth games but only when there's something to kill. Finding players in this is pretty difficult. The multiplayer is very slow paced for such small maps. I personally prefer fast pace in small areas (TF2 sort of thing) and slower paced, more tactical in large areas (such as battlefield). I thought the maps would be quite large considering it's sniping but then again it would make it difficult to find people. The worst part was the map I played was from the campaign and I'm guessing it's the same with the others. That's something I don't like as I personally like the SP to offer a different experience from the MP.Good singleplayer, Okay multiplayer.6/10			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

												This is one of those games that I would suggest playing with a friend. I played this with my Father and greatly enjoyed it. Some of your shots are enhanced by a mini-cutscene where the camera follows your bullet and even sometimes activates an x-ray mode where the slug breaks bones and enters organs making the whole spectacle really fun and satisfying. The game by itself is pretty solid, but with co-op incorporated into the game, I see no reason not to recommend it to others.			",202,57,5,25,19,1,18

There's nothing really special about it, apart from the X-Ray kill cam which I must say is very awesome. I would say that feature alone sells this game.The graphics are okay, the sounds are average, the story is average, the performance is poor which is a shame, and the gameplay is quite linear but somewhat realistic. It encourages stealth which is nice.Should you play it? Yeah, but only but it if it's going cheap.			",454,20,6,11,8,3,38

												Fairly simple stealth game, use distractions, shoot, wait for the panic to end, throw rock, shoot, rinse and repeat. Not recommended that you use controller, KB + M works fantastically with this game, as there is somewhat of a response lag when you use your controller. If you're a run-and-gun type, this is definitely NOT your type of game and I'd advise skipping over it.			",103,21,0,41,19,0,11

												Pleasantly surprised by this game that I picked up for free. I can't honestly say that I like the story or characters so far. However, the gun play is pretty solid and seeing the kill cam and where you placed the bullet is pretty satisfying. You also have a couple of options on how you progress for a level which for me is more enjoyable than something that's linear. Also there's a survival mode for when you just feel like messing around and challenging yourself. Overall I enjoy the game and would suggest that you pick it up, though for a low to medium price.

												I felt like the developers put everything into the sniping aspect of this game. As the name intends, it is Sniper Elite. However, what does this title promise for the game? It leads to exactly what it is; sniping. While this is not bad, the rest of the game is very lackluster. The maps you are set in for the campaign are very linear with very little to explore, and even if you decide to, you'll be trying to look for something to keep your interest. Sniper Elite is a game full of running, shooting, and..... that's mainly it. Stealth should be a key element in a game like this, correct? Stealth only dictates whether you have an easier time or not as your rifle holds the most ammo. The designers obviously had a reason behind this, and it's in your best interest to take all the time it requires to finish one of these linear levels. The environment is uninteractive as well. The most you can do is vault over things; mainly required as it's rare you'll do this on your own. Overall, the game is boring after the first mission and is un immersive.			",103,18,0,17,7,2,5

However, if you just want a fun and exciting experience like in war and action movies, then this is your game.The story is a bit, well, BEHINDERT and since there are like, what, 2 talking characters (you included) you can't be expected to really give a SCHEIß about the whole plot n' drama. But who needs a story when you can shoot a grenade on someone's belt and start a chainreaction of explosions? Who cares about plot when you make that sweet shot right through the scope and eye of an enemy sniper? And most importantly: All this GEILE ♥♥♥♥E can be done in co-op. YES. Finaly, a game remembers that co-op storymode is like the pasties on a stripdancer's nipples. Sure, boobies on their own are neat-o and filled with hopes and dreams, but the pasties make that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥like, 10 times more fantastic to watch.In addition, there are also challenges where you and your co-op KAMERAD have to rummage through the Berlin ruins in search for vehicle parts to fix a car/plane/tank. This can be balls-to-the-walls-hard, but seeing that cutscene when you finish it with all the explosions and alarms going off will make you smile the stupidest grin you've had in a while.Teeny-weeny minus point is the repetetive german of the germans, with highly quotable lines. It sometimes has a jarring, sort of ""wrong"" accent, but its better then just english with german accent. Oh oh oh also, the game has custom made propaganda posters that are pretty fitting and look like they could have been real. No more dutch and norwegian SS propaganda on every wall nearby....(I'm looking at you, CoD, Wolfenstein, Red Orchestra etc.)			",148,17,3,11,7,1,34

												Think being a sniper during World War 2 is easy? Think again, between being sent behind enemy lines to assassinating high level targets the life of a sniper is never done.  Think your good enough to stop the German war machine?  Think you can inifiltrate a V2 factory and take it down or sneak through a city under siege? Then sign up!  What, you've saved the world from the V2 menace?  Then jump into matches against fellow snipers and show the world your skills, play as a team with you friends and boast your amazingness or take the world on yourself in Deathmatch.  Between capturing the flag, distance king, and deathmatches you'll have plenty to fill your quota as a sniping master!			",219,22,0,27,17,0,40

												(Somewhat enjoyable but very lacking)What we have here folks is a shooting game that was designed around an xray cam.  Thats right, the game is really just an afterthought most of the work done has went into the fancy exploding head on xray thing that seems to make this developer think they have something.   If this was a dam fine shooter in its own right with this mechanic thrown in I would agree, however its not.   The developer must think you are going to get about 80-90% of your gameplay out of the multiplayer because the Single player is only about 5-6 hours long without DLC.   Heck even COD gives you about 10-11 hours and for full AAA price you should get about 5x more single player fun.  Gameplay is extremly linear (par for the course with a shooter) and some of the traps make the game somewhat more fun.   One major gripe is with spauning of tangos, you can be in a snipers nest and look all over the killzone and mark your targets.  Start your shooting and kill everyone.  Move foward about 5 feet and OH LOOK the game has spauned new players where they could not possibly be.   Thats right the game negates the whole planning mechanic because it cheats on spauns.   I wont go on with the negatives , bottom line here is the game will keep your attention about 4-5 hours if that.  Then what little content the game has will wear out and you will move on.   Make sure you play ROCK bottom for the game, anything over 10bucks is a waste.  Shame			",268,90,2,41,63,4,108

												I keep looking in the distance for gunmen in windows of derelict buildings and roof tops.The crux of enjoyment for me is taking out fellow snipers 100+ metres away. This alone is hugely enjoyable: from lining up your shot, choosing whether to take a body shot or a more risky head-shot(instant kill).You star in a detailed war zone where you have multiple adversaries in varied scenes. This is different to your average shooter. The rewards are for accurate shooting, long distance shooting, head shots, shooting through 2 people with 1 shot, even shooting someone through the nuts(the slow-mo kill-cam is extraordinarily detailed). The game is more enjoyable when played with patience; although there are some non-sniper scenes(usually in buildings) where you choose a rapid fire gun to take out the enemy. For every mission you choose your rifle, machine gun, pistol and grenades/dynamite etc.If you ever enjoy those long distance shots in fps games then this will be a perfect alternative to the thousand of mindless shooters out there. Overall: a superb shooter with detailed graphics and addictive gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 is nothing like the original Sniper Elite. This game has kept just the name and the general setting. EVERYTHING else is different. You play an OSS agent sent into Berlin to prevent Nazi scientists from falling into Soviet hands, but you soon discover things are not that simple. You can carry three weapons: a sniper rifle, a sub machine gun, and a pistol, plus some mines, grenades, and such. You need to make your way through enemies (both German and Russian) including infatry and snipers, plus tanks, armored cars, trucks, and more, and accomplish your objective, whether it be assassination, sabotage, or rescue. The best part about this game, is of course, ""bullet cam"" where you follow your bullet leaving your gun all the way to where it impacts the enemy. With SEV2, you get a new ""CSI style"" bullet cam that shows you exactly what happened to the target of your bullet, including blood spatter, breaking bones, and ruptured organs, as if you're looking at an X-ray. (You can turn that off if you wish). The game also added ""collectibles"" (Nazi gold, and wine bottles) to encourage some exploration of the level. There's also various battles against AI and/or playing co-op on certain missions. All in all, SEV2 is a fun game, if a bit watered down from the original sandbox vision. Eye candy, on the other hand, is excellent.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												If Rebellion's goal was to make a game loosely inspired by the movie ""Enemy at the Gates"", they succeeded. The gameplay is enjoyable and they put a lot of hard work into really letting you cherish the moment when you murder an enemy. The game looks pretty good -not excellent- and the soundtrack fits the atmosphere, or at least until it starts playing the combat music on a loop for the entire level. I only really had one problem with SniperEliteV2, that was that the game only spawned additional enemies once you had progressed further into the level. This was irritating, as I would watch an area of the mao I was about to go to, see that it was clear, and then have a dozen soldiers just kind of show up. With that said, it's not a bad game. I give it an OK/10			",109,19,0,13,12,0,15

												Pros IMO:+Good gamepaly .+i liked the killing animations as it my first sniper elite.+i liked how the game gives you the advantage of using the environment or the wether to do some stealthy movements like using the thunder to take some stealth shots.Cons IMO:-i enjoyed the gameplay more than the story as the story line is about tracking scientists and generals who are involved in the development of the V2 and thats it.-the game didnt give the option for stealth i was hoping to complete one mission without being noticed but there is no way . maybe you can do some stealth...............to the next corner but there is no way to complete a mission its like you are being spawn trapped and you have to do the Rambo sniper thing.-multiplayer, i didnt see how this game has a multiplayer its all about : 6vs6 in huge maps and start searching....

												Human-internal-organ-viewer & Testicle-destroyer simulatorMost of the time...You either gross out, or got awestruck by your bullet effectively penetrating through your enemy with the most exquisite detail of X-Ray kill cam. Hell, you can even explode a grenade lodged at an enemy's belt with a careful shot.And what's more satisfying then blowing up tanks with just your precision rifle.The best sniper simulation shooter game out there. With stealth, your trusted binocular to track enemies; gravity, wind, and bullet power to take into account, every shot must count and the smallest mistake means death (though the enemy AI is somewhat lacking).9/10 would snipe again.

												This game was potentially my second favorite purchase in the last week, behind PAYDAY 2 and surpassing Portal. SEv2 is an oddball of a game. It is at some points filled with action and then in other points you're wondering where did everyone go? As far as a sniping game, it is VERY VERY satisfying when you get your shot off as your round gruesomely penetrates the skull of your enemy in an X- Ray view of their skull shattering as the bullet tears through like... well, a bullet. It's  not necessarily hard to get your shot off in this game, MUCH easier than Battlefield 3/ 4. In a way the sniper physics are kind of unrealistic but unles you're a purist you can get over that aspect. Very fun game, and would recommend it to anyone willing to try it.			",80,5,3,4,3,1,1

												This is a very well done game. I've been a fan of the Sniper Elite series since the beginning and this game definitely does the license justice. If you ever wanted to have that one shot, one kill experience then this game will give it to you. The new x-ray kill cam is just icing on the already fattening cake. With the kill cam and good aim you can get head shots, organ shots, and even wounding shots that make the enemy call out for help then guess what...you get two kills for the price of one. The only gripe I would have with the game is the parts that are set to trigger enemies and no matter how stealthy you've been, it turns into all out chaos. That is truly my only negative thing to say about the game. In closing I'll say this, if you even have the slightest intrest in anything I've mentioned at least download the demo and see for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic game! However, I am a little dissapointed that the game only has around 10 missions or so, but it makes up for that with multiplayer and Co-Op. You can choose different difficulties, from ""Never played the game before"" to ""Expert sniper with over 500 comfirmed kills!"" Personally, for how small the game is, I'd recommend buying it on sale.			",145,12,7,7,26,0,3

												Let me first provide some backstory on my idea of WW2 games. I hate them. That being said I can tell you that Sniper Elite V2 has completely changed my view on the weaponary circa 1940. The game is truly georgeous and runs super smooth. The bullet time mechanic with x-ray kill shots is genius and had me trying to imptove my sniping prowess.I would 100% reccommend this game to my friends that love shooters...			",58,1,0,6,1,0,1

												Simple story guides you through a series of missions that test your sniper skills. Sniping is pretty much what this game is all about and it does it well, with the kill xray cam adding to the general experience. It's fun to play if you only have a couple of minutes to get you to a next checkpoint or if you have a cople of hours to actually finish the whole game in one go. Aside from that however it doesn't have much to offer, the levels are simple, straithforward and linear with pretty much only one way to finish them, still the simplicity of design does not negate the generally positive feeling of fun it provides. Co-op missions are pretty much the same as single player with few instances where one of the players is a spotter and does not have a sniper rifle. Multiplayer wise everyone is a sniper and depending on the mode selected you either kill everyone else or the enemy team. Overall a solid piece of fun especially if like me you got it for free on the 24h super special deal they had going about a month ago:)7/10			",126,15,4,14,19,1,20

												I really didn't intend to spend 180 hours on this game.  The campaigns were fun to work through at first, then again at harder levels.  The real fun came when I started playing multiplayer.  Actual techniques and tactics became important there and it was fun to learn things on teams with more skilled players.  After that, it became more fun with different groups playing sniper games or capture the flag with entire different approaches.  The people playing this are generally fun, making multiplayer games something easy to jump into when you have time for some stress relief.			",345,71,18,43,33,4,69

												I just finished the single player campaign on normal difficulty. The total time to beat it was only 6 hrs. That's super short. The novelty of sniping various organs and headshots quickly wears off and there is no way to skip it. The game also downplays how ""awesome"" it is being a sniper when guards aim using machine guns with equal accuracy to your rifle. I get that you are supposed to be stealth and not be seen, but giving the AI unrealistic accuracy just breaks the immersion.			",624,206,14,124,85,6,171

												Sniper Elite V2 is a good Game, after playing this Game for a couple of hours. The game has left pretty good impressions, third person shooter game, shooting mechanics are Solid and the game looks up-to-date graphics wise. Probably half the missions are based on stealth, you can choose any direction to approach your opponents from and devise the best strategy to take them out without being spotted. The satisfaction of X-ray Kill Cam when it hits the opponent's eye, head or any parts of the body, Co-op is the best part, when playing with your friend since you can come up with a good strategy in order to execute your plan. It takes alot of Patience and Reflex ability on the perfect time, try the demo version in steam. I recommend it! Rated: 9.3/10			",93,4,3,1,1,0,3

												Remember my feelings after watching the very first trailer Sniper Elite V2. Small clip, which fit exactly one American sniper shot - but what a shot! ""One bullet can change the course of history"" ... And then he reveals exactly how she does it - in moderation breaking spine German tank officer, carelessly leaning tower of ""Tiger"". Revise trailer could endlessly - it's so cool it all looked. Technology X-Ray, thanks to which it was possible to examine in detail what happens to the enemy giblets in the moment of impact, the promise to build the most that neither is a realistic ballistics, not forgetting about the plot and decent graphics ... What else to be happy? The guys from Rebellion started so cheerfully, that just had to do not play, and candy.			",41,6,3,4,5,1,3

												RIdicolously unrealistic, in-your-face fanservice game, with insane amount of emphasis on shots that -thanks to the ""empty lungs"" system - can be easily done by a five year old.I know it doesn't sound like I'm positive here, but if you're looking for some lighthearted fun in a ww2 setting and you're into snipers, this game will be more than satisfactory			",181,21,4,24,11,1,24

												I was lucky enough to get this game for free the day before Sniper Elite III came out. While the game rewards you for droppin' Nazis without detection, the number of enemies present in a given level usually only makes that possible in close quarters when you can use your silenced pistol, and that's not too sniper-y, eh? The player goes through a tutorial that gives the impression of carefully scouting a location, setting up all manners of nasty tricks to stop them bad guys, then taking a shot in the perfect position and moving so that you're a step ahead once detected. Thing is, it only plays out like that until you shoot your rifle and, oh look! More Nazis coming from around the block! Better stay in the same position and snipe a wave or two, maybe lay down a trip mine behind me in case they sneak up while I'm trying to fend off a dozen or so coming up the road. Not to say this isn't fun, it's just that the meat of the gameplay isn't nearly as calculated as it was set up to be, and I would have liked it better that way. The shooting is a lot of fun; the x-ray bullet cam is great, the ""breathing system""  I guess you could call it is great (try running up to the top of a building, trying to get a shot on an enemy who's getting away in a car, only to find you're out of breath and the scope is moving all over the place. Adrenaline!) though these both tend to get old, again due to the sheer number of enemies that require bullets to the skull and/or groin. All of this raises a question: is it possible to make a carefully calculated sniper game when it's still the player vs. the world, huge environments and armies pitted against you like every other military shooter? Sniper Elite V2 is nearly there, and it's compelling enough to make you want to finish the game. Will I now buy Sniper Elite III as Steam's promotion intended? Maybe, I'm curious to see whether the creators have improved upon the formula. Would I buy V2 for $30? Probably not, but then again, why would you buy any two year old game on Steam for $30? It'll go on sale eventually...			",49,2,3,8,3,1,2

												I recommend this to buy with a couple of friends. Even though the campaign is fun, it won't be enough for hours and hours of gameplay. You can try online if you want, it might be fun but most people know the maps like the inside of their pockets, giving you a giant disadvantage. So, if you want to play it, I recomment a couple of friends to play multiplayer with.Furtheron, I like this game. amazing graphics, amazing gameplay and the multiplayer gamemodes and mechanics are also good. Storyline might become boring after a few runs, but the multiplayer is fun, and more fun with friends.			",149,16,5,10,11,1,17

												This game was potentially my second favorite purchase in the last week, behind PAYDAY 2 and surpassing Portal. SEv2 is an oddball of a game. It is at some points filled with action and then in other points you're wondering where did everyone go? As far as a sniping game, it is VERY VERY satisfying when you get your shot off as your round gruesomely penetrates the skull of your enemy in an X- Ray view of their skull shattering as the bullet tears through like... well, a bullet. It's  not necessarily hard to get your shot off in this game, MUCH easier than Battlefield 3/ 4. In a way the sniper physics are kind of unrealistic but unles you're a purist you can get over that aspect. Very fun game, and would recommend it to anyone willing to try it.			",80,5,3,4,3,1,1

												This is a very well done game. I've been a fan of the Sniper Elite series since the beginning and this game definitely does the license justice. If you ever wanted to have that one shot, one kill experience then this game will give it to you. The new x-ray kill cam is just icing on the already fattening cake. With the kill cam and good aim you can get head shots, organ shots, and even wounding shots that make the enemy call out for help then guess what...you get two kills for the price of one. The only gripe I would have with the game is the parts that are set to trigger enemies and no matter how stealthy you've been, it turns into all out chaos. That is truly my only negative thing to say about the game. In closing I'll say this, if you even have the slightest intrest in anything I've mentioned at least download the demo and see for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This seemed like a good sniper game to me, and if you generally like this type of game, I think you'll like this specific game.  I played it on the easy/casual difficulty, and it took me 7 hours or so to make it through the single player campaign.  I'm not a great player, so even with the easier aiming and less deadly enemies, it still took a few tries to clear each mission.  I'm glad there were checkpoints, so I didn't have to start each one over from the beginning when I died.You play solo here, but have some items besides guns you can use to help you out:  land mines, trip mines, grenades, etc.  They're not really necessary -- I finished single player and used them rarely, if at all -- but they probably do make things easier.  At the medium and hard difficulties, enemies are stronger and more bullet ballistics come into play, like bullets dropping over distance due to gravity, which makes things noticeably harder.  I started a single player game on medium difficulty to try it out, and after 20 minutes I still hadn't cleared the first training mission.  (Like I said, I'm not a great player.)  I haven't tried multi-player or co-op, but having additional play modes like that is nice.There were enough missions for a story to develop, and it took a nice amount of time to play through.  On the easy level for me, it wasn't too easy, and it wasn't frustratingly difficult or long.  I almost always felt like I was making progress, even when retrying after dying, which was definitely good.  There seems to be some replay value, too, even if it's just working through harder difficulties than the last time.  And thanks to those multiple difficulty levels, this game can be enjoyable for casual gamers as well as more dedicated gamers.			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

Hell, you can even explode a grenade lodged at an enemy's belt with a careful shot.And what's more satisfying then blowing up tanks with just your precision rifle.The best sniper simulation shooter game out there. With stealth, your trusted binocular to track enemies; gravity, wind, and bullet power to take into account, every shot must count and the smallest mistake means death (though the enemy AI is somewhat lacking).9/10 would snipe again.

-Recommended Title-I always spend a bit of time  reading reviews, and I must say, I was a little apprehensive initially of what I would end up getting with SEv2. However, I am happy to say, that so far the gameplay experience, has been fantastic. The graphics, are great.  I have not had any  performance issues,  so overall from a system point of view - all good.The missions to date I have found to be engaging, and  satisfying. I do like seeing the sniper bullet rip through my targets  body  and the ability to pretty much stay undetected, if using stealth tatics correctly, and take out more of the blighters. Overall, it's pretty addictive.What is stated on the game decription (store page), is what you get.  I wasn't dissapointed.I would recommmend purchasing this  SEv2, especially if on sale. It's one for the wargames library, when you feel like a bit of long distance fighting, and softly, softly approach to completing the missions. Excellent game to play after having a bit of gametime on  ""Verdun"" , "" Insurgency"" or ""Counter Strike"" !Once all the missions are completed, I'll update this review.Enjoy! :)7/10			",269,56,5,20,63,1,76

This is a gem of a game in that, it has a very good Single Player mode and a fun and enjoyable Multiplayer mode.

												Originally played the demo for this on Xbox 360 and thought that while the X-Ray bullet kill cam was a cool gimmick, it would get old fast.I was wrong.Picked this up for free on Steam during a 24-hour special sale period and I have been plugging along at it bit by bit.  It's fun in its own way - you have to scope out each mission, make some quick decisions as to how you're going to approach it, and (after dying a few times) perfect it so you can last as long as possible without being detected.  I'm not sure it's possible to go through an entire mission without being spotted by the enemy, but that's fine with me - stealth games haven't always been my favorite, anyway.Only a couple of downsides:1. The various traps and things you can set to protect yourself I find to be usually worthless to me personally, as I tend to move around a lot.  I'm not sure if that's just my style or if it's because I don't find myself in situations often where I have been able to anticipate hordes of enemies coming at me while having to snipe others in the distance.2. When zoomed in, my framerate drops to about half of what it is in normal view.  I don't have the best computer in the world by any stretch of the imagination, but it does get annoying nonetheless (makes it very hard to line up shots quickly).That having been said, the death cams are awesome, and I'm just having fun in general working my way through the various missions and locales.  In the end, that's all that matters to me, anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good sniper game, especially considering the price I paid: FREE!The maps are very nice, especially the city ones, if a little empty.  The hardest difficulty level is just about right for any experienced pc gamer. Go slow and take you time...until it goes loud. And loud it will! Then you run.The stealth in this game is really weak. Then again, I guess there was no sam fisher in wwii. It almost always does not pay to sneak, because it'll just get you killed. Find a good spot, snipe, rinse and repeat.  The Ai's aim is usually fair, except for the enemy snipers that seem to have some kind of modern warfare x-ray vision and laser accuracy. They always know where you are.  You gotta bait them with your own life, take a hit and then go for a kill shot.Good game, worth playing.			",300,82,2,40,16,2,49

												When I heard of this game first being developed I had high hopes they wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ it up and keep it original just like the first ORIGINAL sniper elite game. I rented this game to begin with around the time it first came out, and honestly I despised it for not having the same game mechanics as the first Sniper Elite game did and returned it. Now, a couple years(ish) down the road I decided to download it for free and surprise surpise! I still hate this game just as much as I hate Sniper ghost warrior. Stealth does not play a huge factor in this game as portrayed by the developers before the release. AI dont spawn in unless you trigger an event so theres not to much long range shooting unless the mission gives you an objective to DO JUST THAT. Yeah, Xray shots cool I get it. Not so cool when the AI are shooting you through rubbled down pieces of a building so you cant shoot them as well as they can spot you when they aren't even looking at you? AI is broken in my opinon, really glad i didnt buy this game at full price. My advice, this game isnt worth $30 its not even worth $15. Can't wait to see how Sniper Elite 3 turns out so i can be disappointed once again!			",118,2,0,7,14,0,19

												This game is a good game. Scenario is about to V2 Rockets. Mission types aren't so much but some enjoyable missions can found for every wargame player. The environment is not so bad and you can adapt easily. Most of missions has a neccesery  of silence. On first try it looks like a good assasination system but it's more different than this, you can understand it on your another tries. In my opinion this system can't force you enough to be silence, you can solve everything with violance. But when you choose the noisy way you can take your SMG gun instead of your sniper or pistol and  fire them. These smg bullets must kill the enemy soldier at first or second shot. Because you firing from short distance. But thats not happening. The soldiers hit by the bullets and again and again. They are just dancing with bullet and just dies at half of your magazine. The snipy way is more good than this. (But i chose the smg.) Take you sniper right click and open your scope aim, fire and kill. You can aim to the grenaides at the belly of an enemy and when you hit boom the grenaide explodes and many of enemies are died. You can do the same for the trucks which transports enemies. And also tanks. You can shoot tanks but this is silly for me. If can you really do this at the real war tanks should became useless.You can also put traps but they are not very useful but when you use them effective they will be funny for you. And if enemies are watching the way which you must go you can throw a rock to scam them.  The graphics are well to most of pc's and they don't look bad. The X-ray system is very funny. Hit the enemy and watch how you hit him. Voices are not so specific.Multiplayer is funny for a short period for me.People sneaks and i couldn't find 'em. Lastly this game is not very very good but it's good to play.			",52,10,4,7,7,2,9

												This sniping-stealth hybrid is the second in s series of games made by Rebellion, who've had some interesting ideas in the past with titles like Neverdeadbut tend to have terrible execution with titles like Alien Vs. Predator. Does this game fall into the same trap of good potential yet bad execution like so many others? We shall see. This game revolves around an American special ops soldier (this is what must be assumed, he never interacts with another person) whose name is also never revealed. All of his mission breifings are done by himself and any other human being he ever comes across ends up horrifically dead. For all we know he could be some nut running around Germany at the end of the war.Mr. Whitebread here has the objective of killing a series of German scientists who worked on the V2 rockets before they fall into the hands of the Russian menace. So you kill both Germans AND Russians. This is when we were still allied with them, keep in mind. You of course prevail and destroy the V2 rockets and their creators, of course.As the title indicates, you are a sniper. And this game deosnt have simple CoD esqe sniping, no, this game has the advanced ballistics on higher difficulties. There is bullet drop (which without indication on the higher difficulties, results in the guessing game) and fairly realistic enemy reactions to bullets. You fire at somone in the head, they die, you fire at somone in the heart. they die. Same goes for the lungs, stomach, and yes, testicles. While it has realism with vital organ hits, it still takes an unrealisitc number of hits at any other part of the body. There is also a kill-cam, in which if you hit a vital are on an enemy, the camera may do a stylized folling of the kill. It follows the bulet in slow motion and shows the impact in slow motions (sometimes x-ray, even more gruesome). This mechanic is very entertaining at the beggining but starts to become flow-killing after some time. You can turn it off as well as change how much it happens, but on default settings it happens too much for a decent flow.Graphically, the game is okay. It has decent looking effects and for a game that came out two years ago, looks good. Considering how basic the levels are though, it could certainly be better. It is also pretty well optimized, allowing for older machines to play as well.The sniping is undoubtedly the best aspect of this game, with a fairly disastorous attempt at stealth. To impliment good stealth into a game, you MUST have good AI. AI that is fairly predictable (as to make it possible to play) and acts like a human being. The enimies in this game can hear you if you move at more than a duck-walk from hundreds of feet away, or will go back to normal patrols after seeing their friends have his brains blown out right before his eyes. In short, the AI is all over the place. Another aspect to good stealth games is level design. Giving you options upon where to go, what entrence to take, how to deal with your foes. In my opinion, the best stealth games allow you to get through a level without ever taking an enemy out or ever knowing you were there. Here, you are forced to kill every last person you come across and are forced through very linear and lifeless enviornments. All in all, much is left to be desired and some may find it simply unejoyable.In addition to the few campaign missions, there are two other game modes. The first is a co-op gamemode in which you play through the singleplayer levels with another person. Lack of dedicated co-op maps should be the first red flag here, simply placing two people in an already prepared mission shows extreme laziness. It also results in levels being far too easy, even on full difficulty, with two players fighting where one was designed ro be. From there it feels more competative than cooperative, with the players fighting over kills and objecives. In short, co-op is very tacked on. The multiplayer on the other hand is argueable the most fun part of the game. Most of the game modes are standard, team deathmatch, free-for-all, CTF, and so on. There is however Team Distance King and Distance King, which encourage the player to make long distance and skillfull shots as to win. Multiplayer here is fun, resulting in tense sniper fights and cooperative gameplay. The maps are fairly open and well designed for sniping. It results in an enjoyable online experience that can well extend the playtime of this game. In conclusion, I'd reccomend Sniper Elite V2 to those who much enjoy sniping and can swallow mediocre stealth, levels and standard graphics, and a very barebones story. This game had very good and big ideas of a WW2 special ops game that could allow the player to feel the tension of a lone wolf sniper operative in enemy territory. It somewhat pulls through with a moderately fun experience 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pleasantly surprised by this game that I picked up for free. I can't honestly say that I like the story or characters so far. However, the gun play is pretty solid and seeing the kill cam and where you placed the bullet is pretty satisfying. You also have a couple of options on how you progress for a level which for me is more enjoyable than something that's linear. Also there's a survival mode for when you just feel like messing around and challenging yourself. Overall I enjoy the game and would suggest that you pick it up, though for a low to medium price.

												This is one of those games that I would suggest playing with a friend. I played this with my Father and greatly enjoyed it. Some of your shots are enhanced by a mini-cutscene where the camera follows your bullet and even sometimes activates an x-ray mode where the slug breaks bones and enters organs making the whole spectacle really fun and satisfying. The game by itself is pretty solid, but with co-op incorporated into the game, I see no reason not to recommend it to others.			",202,57,5,25,19,1,18

Story is really forgetable with no epic moments at allFor some reason the developers insisted in keep close combat in some situations with is really boring and don't add value at all.Get this game cheap and you will at least have fun			",751,271,18,95,70,5,120

												I have always been critical of any and all military styled games that try to mimic any type of real military experiences but this game was actually really good, it's nothing you can take too seriously but the game was pretty entertaining and I felt compelled to finish the story and see what happens. I think one thing they did really well was they took actual events and places that happened and then spun them to where it wasnt just replaying history so that was definitley a plus to me.Overall I'd say 7/10Also get the DLC you'll get to shoot Hitler in the♥♥♥♥♥			",354,54,29,31,21,4,30

												I found that Sniper Elite 2 was a game that wanted you to be sneaky and stealthy, but forced you to fight every single time. It really reminded me of earlier shooters such as the original Medal of Honor, whereas you are forced to follow a very set path while fighting, except in SE2 it usually gives you ONE extra building in which to hide as you move from checkpoint to checkpoint. This is a ""meh"" game with a neat killcam gimmick.			",107,16,2,8,27,0,45

												I keep looking in the distance for gunmen in windows of derelict buildings and roof tops.The crux of enjoyment for me is taking out fellow snipers 100+ metres away. This alone is hugely enjoyable: from lining up your shot, choosing whether to take a body shot or a more risky head-shot(instant kill).You star in a detailed war zone where you have multiple adversaries in varied scenes. This is different to your average shooter. The rewards are for accurate shooting, long distance shooting, head shots, shooting through 2 people with 1 shot, even shooting someone through the nuts(the slow-mo kill-cam is extraordinarily detailed). The game is more enjoyable when played with patience; although there are some non-sniper scenes(usually in buildings) where you choose a rapid fire gun to take out the enemy. For every mission you choose your rifle, machine gun, pistol and grenades/dynamite etc.If you ever enjoy those long distance shots in fps games then this will be a perfect alternative to the thousand of mindless shooters out there. Overall: a superb shooter with detailed graphics and addictive gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If Rebellion's goal was to make a game loosely inspired by the movie ""Enemy at the Gates"", they succeeded. The gameplay is enjoyable and they put a lot of hard work into really letting you cherish the moment when you murder an enemy. The game looks pretty good -not excellent- and the soundtrack fits the atmosphere, or at least until it starts playing the combat music on a loop for the entire level. I only really had one problem with SniperEliteV2, that was that the game only spawned additional enemies once you had progressed further into the level. This was irritating, as I would watch an area of the mao I was about to go to, see that it was clear, and then have a dozen soldiers just kind of show up. With that said, it's not a bad game. I give it an OK/10			",109,19,0,13,12,0,15

												(Somewhat enjoyable but very lacking)What we have here folks is a shooting game that was designed around an xray cam.  Thats right, the game is really just an afterthought most of the work done has went into the fancy exploding head on xray thing that seems to make this developer think they have something.   If this was a dam fine shooter in its own right with this mechanic thrown in I would agree, however its not.   The developer must think you are going to get about 80-90% of your gameplay out of the multiplayer because the Single player is only about 5-6 hours long without DLC.   Heck even COD gives you about 10-11 hours and for full AAA price you should get about 5x more single player fun.  Gameplay is extremly linear (par for the course with a shooter) and some of the traps make the game somewhat more fun.   One major gripe is with spauning of tangos, you can be in a snipers nest and look all over the killzone and mark your targets.  Start your shooting and kill everyone.  Move foward about 5 feet and OH LOOK the game has spauned new players where they could not possibly be.   Thats right the game negates the whole planning mechanic because it cheats on spauns.   I wont go on with the negatives , bottom line here is the game will keep your attention about 4-5 hours if that.  Then what little content the game has will wear out and you will move on.   Make sure you play ROCK bottom for the game, anything over 10bucks is a waste.  Shame			",268,90,2,41,63,4,108

												I love this game. The stealth component is a bit awkward (or I'm just terrible at it) but fortunately stealth is never required, just recomended. Also, sometimes it seems like the AI can't decide if they're blind drunk or wall hacking. But, none of that really matters because the core component, sniping, is absolutely fantastic. The bullet cam is like a mix between the Fallout series's VATS, when it does the cinematic kills, and the weird CSI stuff when they show people getting shot to death, it's awesome, almost gratuitously gory and incredibly satisfying. This game seems like it'd be really intensive with all the bullet physics and stealth, but if you're lame you can turn off the bullet physics, make the AI all mostly stupid, and increase the occurence of bullet cam kills and the game becomes just a fun gore fest.Also, I shot a guy though the eye and it went through and hit someone else's grenade causing an awesome explosion. 10/10			",94,37,0,24,10,0,20

												Awesome game, really fun, has the possiblity to play with friends and doesn't require much from the computer to run at 120 fps. One of the things that diferentiate it from other FPS snipers is the Bullet Travel Time, and Bullet Drop, meaning that the bullet takes more time to reach it's target and will go down due to gravity. Lower dificultys make it so enemys do less damage, makes the physics less realistcs, therefore making the game easier, however, the Sniper Elite dificulty makes it so that there is more realistic physics, enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage and eliminates the little Square that marks where your bullets are going to go, and to go around that, you have a stealth mechanic, different explosive armaments to make traps or to use in direct combat, such as grenades, land mines and trip mines			",17,0,0,2,1,2,2

												I don't know why so much negatives about this game because this is a very realistic sniper simulator despite sometimes levels too linear for stealth but anyway it's one of the best games of 2012. Your level of enjoyment will be almost directly mapped to how entertaining you find the visual spectacle to be, and - for me at least - it was perfectly good fun in short bursts.So, the game started pretty much like the Nazi Zombie Army mod but without the zombies and with some stealth elements. Seemed decent enough. First missions went like a charm a bit boring and repetetive altogether but still somewhat fun, so I kept playing.Advanced ballistics system, Sniper Elite's saving grace, does not hide the game's flaws, but rather puts them out for all to see.

												I was lucky enough to get this game for free the day before Sniper Elite III came out. While the game rewards you for droppin' Nazis without detection, the number of enemies present in a given level usually only makes that possible in close quarters when you can use your silenced pistol, and that's not too sniper-y, eh? The player goes through a tutorial that gives the impression of carefully scouting a location, setting up all manners of nasty tricks to stop them bad guys, then taking a shot in the perfect position and moving so that you're a step ahead once detected. Thing is, it only plays out like that until you shoot your rifle and, oh look! More Nazis coming from around the block! Better stay in the same position and snipe a wave or two, maybe lay down a trip mine behind me in case they sneak up while I'm trying to fend off a dozen or so coming up the road. Not to say this isn't fun, it's just that the meat of the gameplay isn't nearly as calculated as it was set up to be, and I would have liked it better that way. The shooting is a lot of fun; the x-ray bullet cam is great, the ""breathing system""  I guess you could call it is great (try running up to the top of a building, trying to get a shot on an enemy who's getting away in a car, only to find you're out of breath and the scope is moving all over the place. Adrenaline!) though these both tend to get old, again due to the sheer number of enemies that require bullets to the skull and/or groin. All of this raises a question: is it possible to make a carefully calculated sniper game when it's still the player vs. the world, huge environments and armies pitted against you like every other military shooter? Sniper Elite V2 is nearly there, and it's compelling enough to make you want to finish the game. Will I now buy Sniper Elite III as Steam's promotion intended? Maybe, I'm curious to see whether the creators have improved upon the formula. Would I buy V2 for $30? Probably not, but then again, why would you buy any two year old game on Steam for $30? It'll go on sale eventually...			",49,2,3,8,3,1,2

												This game again garners mixed feelings from me. It does make me feel like a BADASS sniper instead of some COD rambo, and it is frankly the fps which I have been wanting to play for a long time. Alas, it is marred by the inconsistency in sound( especially explosions), the hit and miss of bullet trajectories, unrealistic hit points ( some guys survive my headshot) and extremely clunky close quarter combat.  The last sniping mission to assasinate a commander in a driving car is epic, and probably is this game's saving grace. Skip this game if you hate repetitive missions and cant stand the inaccuracy in ballistics, as the camera X-ray shots can only compensate as far as your tolerance level is.Edit: Well, after playing some multiplayer and getting to know the nuances of crosshair aiming, I have got to say most of the hit and miss of trajectories are my mistake. Nevertheless, there are still inconsistency but it is rare. A positive rating from me, at least for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 has the best WWII immersion I've ever felt since Battlefield 1942, it feels now that it should be titled something like: American Sniper, (just kidding). You're sent out as a lone sniper to kill Nazi leaders while evading patrolling soldiers, guards and allies who will still kill you on site for no reason, (yes I'm talking about the Russians). I didn't encounter any bugs apart from a few fleeing Russian soldiers temporarily getting caught on poles and walls. I had a lot of fun finishing this campaign in Sniper Elite mode, it was very challenging but worth the 5 dollar sale price, I definitely wouldn't get this at full price though, there isn't enough content.

												Pretty quick play-through on the Single Player campaign, and the missions are relatively same-same in nature.  The token value of the x-ray bullet-time thing wears of fairly quickly as well.  Multiplayer wasn't worth it, either.  Worst nightmare, 12y/o sniper camp-fest.  Not that I'm against camping at all, its a legitimate strategy in most games -- boring in this one.I would recommend this game if it was on sale.  Otherwise, do not pay full price for it.

												pros: great video menu and visuals, benchmarking, competent tutorial, multiplayer has standard game modes, 7hour long single playercons: lame scripted events, wonky hitboxes, boring storyline and ending, enemies spawn/respawn out of thin air, even if you are hidden in a far away location the enemy could know exactly where you are (especially on scripted events) and can hit you accurately with smg's, enemy AI can actually fire at you and hit you even if they have just a milli-pixel of their body exposed behind cover, there is NO full stealth in this game because there will be scripted events that force engagementOverall, this game has an ambitious concept but the execution is terribly flawed. I found the best way to play this game is run and quickscope, and leet noscope. Play this way and you won't get bored - because ammo is plentiful, health regenerates, and there is absolutely no reason to stealth. If you want a real WW2 sniper experience, Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer will tickle your fancy.Sniper Elite V2 is a hit or miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You're dropped into the shoes of Karl Fairburne, a German-American soldier sent by the Office of Strategic Services to eliminate key targets associated with the V2 program.To accomplish this, you start the game out with a Welrod Mark I(a silenced and surprisingly effective handgun) and an M1903A4 Springfield Sniper Rifle as well as an M1A1 Thompson for use in emergencies(you only carry one magazine with you for that). These three weapons can of course be exchanged for other variants, if you should find them, but they're all you really need. The Welrod is the only silenced pistol in the entire game, making it especially essential for your survival.The selling point of Sniper Elite V2, however, is the slow motion bullet cam that'll show an ""x-ray"" of the enemy when you hit them, if the shot is judged well enough by the game.But in general, the whole game feels very... Generic? There aren't too many selling points. The story isn't a blockbuster story, there aren't really any interesting characters, and as a whole the game feels very empty. Still, if you like challenges with semi-realistic bullet physics, I suppose you can't go too wrong with this.			",675,164,26,94,78,7,122

												While the gameplay is fairly simplistic, the kill came that follows the bullet through flight and then shows an xray of the target as the bullet does it's work is a pretty cool effect.

												So, when i first bought this game I didn't expect a story driven game (Which I didn't get, but I didn't expect it), I expected a game where you had a sniper rifle, and you were a badass. That is what I got. The campaign took me around 2 and a half hours, and then I spent $8 on a DLC just so I could shoot Hitler's testicle. (Worth it). Pros:Fun gameInteresting premiseYou get to be a badass with a sniper rifleYou get to S H O O T  H I T L E R ' S  N U TCons:Short gameThe Kill Hitler DLC was around 10 minutes long and $8It seems like not much effort was put into anything but the sniperLittle to no replayability valueAll in all though it was short, it was fun as hell, and although I would not recommend paying the full price for the gameyou NEED to pick it up during a sale. Especially when it's free. AND YOU GET TO SHOOT HITLER IN THE TESTICLE.			",187,32,1,26,19,1,20

												(SINGLE PLAYER ONLY)This game is about being a WW2-sniper, it's not a modern sniper game, it's not a future sniper game, nor a pre-historic stone archery game, it's WW2. The game is good for what it is supposed to do, sniping and it allows you to choose different difficulties depending on the level of realism you want in the game. Whenever you shoot someone in a critical spot, like the head, testicles or major organs, you see a slowed-down view of the bullet piercing through said bodypart with x-ray and everything. The story is very linear, as you go from place to place,being directed by markers on the map. In certain parts the game is too linear as certain enemies only pop-up when you reach a certain point, and even de-spawn when you go back far enough, thus there is no real point in scouting out and really, planning your battle as you won't have full view of all the enemies and you might not even know that certain enemies were there, until it is too late. The X-ray view of bullets also gets repetitive after a while unless you enjoy watching the animations, which I do, the graphics look quite nice when seeing the special animations.Once you finish the game there is really not much to keep you going back other than collecting hidden bars of gold in every level, and sniping hidden bottles of wine in every level. If you played the game at a lower difficulty it might be fun to try a higher difficulty to see if you're up for the challenge.This game is a one-time thing and will only really hook enthusiasts of this type of game to play again,while it is fun and it works well for what it is supposed to do;that is the only thing.

												An outstanding game overall. The controls are smooth and easy to use, the AI is relatively good, and the weapons are well modeled, there there could be more of a selection. One thing i find annoying with this game is, the creator seems to have put lots of effort into realistic physics, and bullet mechanics, though actual the actual realism of war could be improved, as in when do you ever got one sniper against 50 other russians and a tank. This can get quiet tiresome. The X-RAY cam also, is awesome but a little more detail could used in this.			",22,0,3,1,1,0,0

												Nagyon érdekes játék. A történet kifejezetten tetszik, a grafikai is szép és a játékmenet is nagyon jó.Viszont a buggok miatt néha elég élvezhetetlen az egész. A másik probléma, hogy eszméletlenül laggol még low grafikán is. Az irányítás is rémes, az egér rettentő érzékeny, még akkor is ha nagyon alacsony értéken van. És személy szerint jobban örültem volna ha a a guggolást és a hasalást külön gombokra tették volna.Összességében: Szerintem tűrhető, ingyen teljes mértékben megérte, bár a teljes árért nem vettem volna meg.A buggok, az irányítás és a laggok sokszor eléggé élvezhetetlenné teszik, viszont a történet, a grafika és             a játékmenet miatt megéri kipróbálni.6/10 ",89,7,3,7,4,0,7

												Sniper Elite, This was the only other game I can think of off the top of my head that has an legit bullet time and kill cam. (The other being max payne)  I would play it on marksman, which would effect the wind and bullet drop, adding realism.  All around the campaign was a great story. I did how ever have to occasionally resort to my SMG Because I was not as stealth as I hoped. Another High point in this game was the traps. Whether it was the Trip mines or land mines, there was always some sneaky place you could stash them so that when a nazi tried to flank you they would detonate one of said mines.  The DLC were alright. My personal favorite, was to kill Hitler, for obvious reasons.  If you have the chance to pick this game up on a sale, or a bundle.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 is a not a particularly great game in any aspect but is fairly amusing, good-looking and adequately challenging most of the time. I would reccomend it, but only if it is on sale and you are a fan of long-distance combat and can accept the lack of any good kind of story.The game features fairly standard cover-based shooting and snipering where your bullet is influenced by wind and drop-off. Aiming is a bit inaccurate when you are not using the sniper, but when  you are using it, in spite of whatever influences your bullet, in my case it became quite easy to just guess where to shoot. And when long-distance sniping is the core mechanic of the game, it makes for the game in general to be quite easy, apart from a few bumps in the difficulty curve. Extraordinarily difficult bits occured when you encountered groups of Russians and Germans fighting eachother, or when you come across a tank. What I did like about it was that you can not just shoot the tank's gas can and cause it to explode, you have to hit the fuel cap instead. That is at the very least a bit more realistic and challenging and is therefore quite fun. Extremely frustrating however was one mission where you are tasked to kill a number of enemy snipers in a big open environment, who kill you with ease and are extremely hard to spot. But leaving aside a few exceptions, the game is no too hard.Graphics are an area where this game shines, although the level of detail is not distributed quite equally. The player character, as well as the NPC's, look very good but the game world is left out a bit at times. In spite of that, the lighting and bright colors make the world pleasant to look at.A few more nice things that this game features is an X-ray style vision of your target when a bullet flies through them, showing exactly what damage you did. What was also well done in my opinion was the feeling the city gave me. With idle conversations in German around me and the aforementioned nice visuals in the city it did manage to convey the atmosphere of the war-torn city. What bothers me most about it is that there is nothing special about it, except for the X-ray thing. The gun mechanics and atmosphere are nice, but it is all you get and that is not enough for some people. The story, for instance, is quite boring. The game is set in Berlin in the last few weeks of World War II and you play as an American sniper sent to kill a few high-ranking German scientists as well as some of the Russians that are invading the city at that time. The biggest problem with the story, apart from the fact that nothing truly interesting or imaginative happens, is that it is only brought across by a voice during the pre-mission menu. This is no aspect of the game that is relevant.I would reccomend this game anyway, because of that it can be something nice if it is on sale and you are looking for nothing else besides amusing gunplay.

												Sniper Elite, This was the only other game I can think of off the top of my head that has an legit bullet time and kill cam. (The other being max payne)  I would play it on marksman, which would effect the wind and bullet drop, adding realism.  All around the campaign was a great story. I did how ever have to occasionally resort to my SMG Because I was not as stealth as I hoped. Another High point in this game was the traps. Whether it was the Trip mines or land mines, there was always some sneaky place you could stash them so that when a nazi tried to flank you they would detonate one of said mines.  The DLC were alright. My personal favorite, was to kill Hitler, for obvious reasons.  If you have the chance to pick this game up on a sale, or a bundle.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nagyon érdekes játék. A történet kifejezetten tetszik, a grafikai is szép és a játékmenet is nagyon jó.Viszont a buggok miatt néha elég élvezhetetlen az egész. A másik probléma, hogy eszméletlenül laggol még low grafikán is. Az irányítás is rémes, az egér rettentő érzékeny, még akkor is ha nagyon alacsony értéken van. És személy szerint jobban örültem volna ha a a guggolást és a hasalást külön gombokra tették volna.Összességében: Szerintem tűrhető, ingyen teljes mértékben megérte, bár a teljes árért nem vettem volna meg.A buggok, az irányítás és a laggok sokszor eléggé élvezhetetlenné teszik, viszont a történet, a grafika és             a játékmenet miatt megéri kipróbálni.6/10 ",89,7,3,7,4,0,7

												It is by far one of the best games I have played on PC, it has brought me many hours of enjoyment.It has amazing graphics, physics and plays really well. I think the most enjoyable part is the campaign although online is fun wth friends, the most enduring game I have played. It especially draws me in when you shoot peoples balls off... You can't do that in many games also the stealth aspect is very well done.Pros and Cons:Pros: Stealth is good and enjoyable, can customise difficulty to suit the player, very realistic with windage and bullet drop.Cons: If you shoot before you reach the next checkpoint and theres enemy right round the corner then they can't hear it for some reason, shooting will alert everyone in the checkpoint area to your EXACT location, you can't really hide once they're alerted of your presence.Stealth: 7Realism: 9Overall gameplay: 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You're dropped into the shoes of Karl Fairburne, a German-American soldier sent by the Office of Strategic Services to eliminate key targets associated with the V2 program.To accomplish this, you start the game out with a Welrod Mark I(a silenced and surprisingly effective handgun) and an M1903A4 Springfield Sniper Rifle as well as an M1A1 Thompson for use in emergencies(you only carry one magazine with you for that). These three weapons can of course be exchanged for other variants, if you should find them, but they're all you really need. The Welrod is the only silenced pistol in the entire game, making it especially essential for your survival.The selling point of Sniper Elite V2, however, is the slow motion bullet cam that'll show an ""x-ray"" of the enemy when you hit them, if the shot is judged well enough by the game.But in general, the whole game feels very... Generic? There aren't too many selling points. The story isn't a blockbuster story, there aren't really any interesting characters, and as a whole the game feels very empty. Still, if you like challenges with semi-realistic bullet physics, I suppose you can't go too wrong with this.			",675,164,26,94,78,7,122

												Sniper Elite V2 was given away free for a day by Steam a while back, and it went into my backlog because I usually prefer shooters over stealth games. Fortunately, Sniper V2 blends the two genres together successfully and most of the stealth sections are where you’re trying to get to a good enough position to headshot your targets. The game’s difficulty is more customizable than most shooters, so whether you want to casually murder some people from long range, or sneak around silently lining up the perfect muffled shot, it’s up to you.The game takes place during the latter days of World War 2, with you playing the part of an American sniper behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany picking off high value targets as well as trying to get your hands on certain German scientists. The race is on between the US and Soviet Union to grab up all the best Nazi scientists before the other side gets their paws on them. In this case, you’re looking for the scientists who worked on the Nazi V2 rocket program (long range missiles).The gameplay for Sniper Elite V2 is third person shooter except when using the sniper rifle scope, which is first person.  The game is broken up into distinct missions, each being about half an hour long, and you start with all your equipment right from the start of each mission. You have your trusty sniper rifle, a Thompson machine gun, and a silenced pistol, as well as a couple of explosive items such as land mines and trip mines. You can switch out your machine gun with weapons from fallen enemies, but it’s generally a bad idea because the guns you find on the ground have like 5 bullets left in them. Besides, you shouldn’t be using the machine gun much anyways if you’re sneaking around as much as you ought to be. Despite how important being sneaky is, the stealth system in Sniper Elite V2 is not heavily developed. You just crouch down and you’ll be walking silently. There is a colored arrow indicator when enemies are close to spotting you (kind of like Far Cry 3) except it usually happens so fast that as soon as you see it, you’re probably going to be caught.  When you get spotted, an alarm goes up and all the nearby enemies will start gunning for you at your last known location. The game uses a regenerating health system so as long as you don’t take damage for a few seconds, you survive. Of course you shouldn’t really be getting shot much anyways since the highlight of the game is long range sniping.When looking through the scope you have the ability to hold your breath and focus in (steady your aim) on targets as long as you have enough stamina. If you manage a long range shot to an enemy’s vital organs (brain, liver, heart, etc.) the game will do a slow motion kill cam where you see the enemy in x-ray with the bullet piercing through and busting stuff up. It’s pretty cool in the beginning, especially if you just made a really long range shot. The game’s ballistics options let you decide if you want realistic sniper shooting with bullet travel time, bullet drop over distance, and wind trajectory, if you enjoy missing a lot. Pros:+A fun game if you like sniper action. You vs a bunch of soldiers firing at each over long distances. Boom Headsot! If there are bombs dropping the background, you can use the sound of the explosions to cover the sound of your rifle shots. The bad guys won’t even know they’re being picked off one at a time as long as they don’t see bodies. Once the alarm is raised though, just kill everyone.+The stealth sections are fun for the most part when you sneak around with your silenced pistol. The game uses checkpoint saving, so you may end up replaying some sections over and over trying not to get spotted. There’s a Steam achievement for getting through a particular area without being caught and I must have played that section a dozen times before I made it through. +Some multiplayer options are available and there seem to still be people playing the game online. In one multiplayer mode, you can co-op with a friend as your spotter who tags enemies for you to snipe.Cons:-You really do spend a lot of time crouched down trying to be sneaky, which greatly slows your movement speed. So many times I just want to run from point A to B, but I know if I don’t sneak I’ll probably be heard and need to restart the checkpoint. It can be frustrating for someone used to moving fast because unlike some other stealth games, you have no way of knowing whether or not there’s an enemy nearby unless you can directly see him (you don’t have an enemy radar).-There’s not too much variety in gameplay/weapons. You get maybe 3 different types of sniper rifle found through the story, but really they’re pretty much the same. I think the better ones just have larger clips or an additional level of zoom.Overall the game is fun if you just want to get some sniper action and kill a bunch of Nazis. And as a bonus, you may already have this game for free. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

For others it gets repetitive and boring, but for me it never really ceases to feel good.Ballistics are pretty alright but definitely exaggerrated for reasons I'll detail below.Those are about the only things good about the game.So yes, it's a WW2 shooter with the !!twist!! that you're a sniper, and you have to infiltrate enemy territory and assassinate critical targets with (almost) no backup at all.Maps are really linear, and don't offer the tactical opportunities an actual sniper would really like to get. They are also pretty damn small for real sniping, yet the reasons you don't want to go in with your secondary weapons are their abysmal accuracy, even when prone, abysmal recoil and little available ammo. Stealth isn't an option most of the time, or even something like relocation after firing a shot - kill or miss, doesn't matter, the AI will be permanently alerted, and no amount of hiding or moving away will stop them from repeating the same ""Find him"" or ""Come out, sniper"" lines over and over. Not to mention how they will just endlessly try to bumrush you on higher difficulties, again violating one's common sense to take cover then slowly move up and flank you. The real difficulty comes from them spotting you from absolutely anywhere you poke even a polygon through - a little crevace, in a dark room, a hundred meters away, it doesn't matter - they will still see you, and will keep firing in automatic bursts across that same distance and hit you 3/4 of the time.Realism only really extends to the sniper ballistics, and even those are exaggerrated for the sake of giving the illusion the maps are really bigger than they appear to be. There's no sight zeroing but you do have a part bullet time, part ""eliminate 90% of idle scope sway"" hold breath mechanic. Sounds are exaggerrated as well with lots of echoing even in areas which shouldn't have echoes.You frequently end up in shooting gallery sections, where enemies funnel down a corridor and you are expected to deal with them either with a slow(-ish) firing rifle (which can admittedly penetrate multiple dudes) or with the same abysmal secondaries mentioned above. This goes pretty much against everything a sniper is supposed to do in the area of operations.Speaking of snipers, f*** the enemy snipers. They spawn in difficult places, with the only hint of their existence being an occasional scope glare and (on lower difficulties) an arrow pointing in their direction. Even when they are on the move, they have near perfect aim and WILL get at least one shot on you, every time, until you memorise their spawning positions and ice them.I got this for free, and honestly I was really hyped the first time I learned of this game just before release. The sparkle and spectacle quickly wore down as it slowly turns like most other WW2 first/third person shooters with some mind boggling design choices.If I were you, I'd not pick this game just because it advertises having wind affect ballistics, which many other such games seem to lack.

												Well, how should i say this?Sniper Elite V2 is a god damn good-looking game, with realistic physics and well-made characteristics.The bullet effect has been made well, and most of the gruesome kills really look cool.The is not very complex, but it's easily catchable. There are 4 different difficulty levels to choose from;""Cadet"" (easy), ""Marksman"" (intermediate), ""Sniper Elite"" (hard), and ""Custom""I myself played the game with Marksman, and i must say, i died only one (1) time on campaign mode.The way game makes itself harder, is by adding more realistic physics; like gravity and wind.You'll take some more damage from enemies, but not too much.The game itself is not so long, as i played trough the campaign within 5.6 hours.Allthough there are some bonus collectibles, as Bottles & Gold Bars.These items do make some kind of replay value, but i myself am not that type of person, who enjoys collectibles.There is an access for a Multiplayer Game. The Multiplayer Mode is not the best way to enjoy about the game.The gameplay is basically same as it is in the Single Player Mode (campaign).There are multiple game modes, but the most popular ones must be;DM (Deathmatch) - this means you versus other playersTDM (Team Deathmatch) - this is variation of Deathmatch, you and your team try to wipe out other team.CTF (Capture the Flag) - steal the flag and take it to your base.The game mode i played most, is the TDM. The games are just silly. The snipers job is camping and shooting people.But this is just not good with 12 players on same server. The idea is great, but the execution is not.Most of the multiplayer game time goes by hiding behind rocks and bushes and trying to snipe other people.Doing the exact same. I recommend you to skip the Multiplayer Mode for better gaming experience.tl;dr?Sniper Elite V2 looks cool & acts cool, the gameplay is realistic & well-made. It's a Single Player game.If you like Sniping & Bullet Effects besides Nazi Plot & Manly Protagonist, i recommend you to buy this game.			",113,7,2,2,6,2,4

												It is by far one of the best games I have played on PC, it has brought me many hours of enjoyment.It has amazing graphics, physics and plays really well. I think the most enjoyable part is the campaign although online is fun wth friends, the most enduring game I have played. It especially draws me in when you shoot peoples balls off... You can't do that in many games also the stealth aspect is very well done.Pros and Cons:Pros: Stealth is good and enjoyable, can customise difficulty to suit the player, very realistic with windage and bullet drop.Cons: If you shoot before you reach the next checkpoint and theres enemy right round the corner then they can't hear it for some reason, shooting will alert everyone in the checkpoint area to your EXACT location, you can't really hide once they're alerted of your presence.Stealth: 7Realism: 9Overall gameplay: 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 is a great game for newbies like myself who want a taster of a stealth game.The balancing of the game is skewed towards the player with health regen and no insta-death.  Which is a good thing as it plays right into the hands of recreational players.  The maps and graphics are immersive.While shooting meat over and over again is repetitive, there is good variation in the map and the environment.  You may be sniping long range in an open area, or using a silenced pistol to take out enemies in tight indoor areas at close range.  Climbing up flights of stairs is always heart-stopping as you never know what is waiting for you at the top.If you're an experienced Splinter Cell gamer who look to play a serious stealth game, this isn't for you.  There is also limited replay value as the enemy positioning is the same every time you die and reload from the previous checkpoint.			",17,0,4,3,4,1,7

												Sniper Elite V2 is a not a particularly great game in any aspect but is fairly amusing, good-looking and adequately challenging most of the time. I would reccomend it, but only if it is on sale and you are a fan of long-distance combat and can accept the lack of any good kind of story.The game features fairly standard cover-based shooting and snipering where your bullet is influenced by wind and drop-off. Aiming is a bit inaccurate when you are not using the sniper, but when  you are using it, in spite of whatever influences your bullet, in my case it became quite easy to just guess where to shoot. And when long-distance sniping is the core mechanic of the game, it makes for the game in general to be quite easy, apart from a few bumps in the difficulty curve. Extraordinarily difficult bits occured when you encountered groups of Russians and Germans fighting eachother, or when you come across a tank. What I did like about it was that you can not just shoot the tank's gas can and cause it to explode, you have to hit the fuel cap instead. That is at the very least a bit more realistic and challenging and is therefore quite fun. Extremely frustrating however was one mission where you are tasked to kill a number of enemy snipers in a big open environment, who kill you with ease and are extremely hard to spot. But leaving aside a few exceptions, the game is no too hard.Graphics are an area where this game shines, although the level of detail is not distributed quite equally. The player character, as well as the NPC's, look very good but the game world is left out a bit at times. In spite of that, the lighting and bright colors make the world pleasant to look at.A few more nice things that this game features is an X-ray style vision of your target when a bullet flies through them, showing exactly what damage you did. What was also well done in my opinion was the feeling the city gave me. With idle conversations in German around me and the aforementioned nice visuals in the city it did manage to convey the atmosphere of the war-torn city. What bothers me most about it is that there is nothing special about it, except for the X-ray thing. The gun mechanics and atmosphere are nice, but it is all you get and that is not enough for some people. The story, for instance, is quite boring. The game is set in Berlin in the last few weeks of World War II and you play as an American sniper sent to kill a few high-ranking German scientists as well as some of the Russians that are invading the city at that time. The biggest problem with the story, apart from the fact that nothing truly interesting or imaginative happens, is that it is only brought across by a voice during the pre-mission menu. This is no aspect of the game that is relevant.I would reccomend this game anyway, because of that it can be something nice if it is on sale and you are looking for nothing else besides amusing gunplay.

												I got this game when it was free so I have nothing to complain about, but I would have definatly payed for it at full price. This isn't just a sniper game it's stealth and missions, you have to sneak through the levels with your trusty silenced pistol and get to vantage points and take em out. The games Sniper mechanics are spot on. Wind, gravity, bullet velocity are all on par. The sequences of the bullet tearing through your enemy are super cool. Watching a spinning peice of hot leat rip through the head of a Russian is just one of the coolest things ever. This game is a Must Have			",239,36,4,31,36,2,42

												Fun - 7 (Some of the less than genuine situations sometimes detract from immersion. And although the hard-fought control issue fixes during early release may have improved controls, they still feel kinda ""in the way"" sometimes. But still quite fun and satisfying)Replay - 4 (I'm guessing the ""scenario"" type play of SniperEliteV2 doesn't warrant much replayability. And also 'doubt that its multiplayer does much to improve on this)Sound - 6Visuals - 8Value - 6Worth it? - I think so. I've CERTAINLY played much worse military sim / FPS games.Definitely the cure for that itch to use some bullet-time in a sniper situation. Visuals are nice, but not jaw dropping. Sound is slightly above average with some looping war sounds, things get a little gimmicky feeling while you're out and about. Controls are good in most areas but leave a moderate amount to be desired in a couple areas. Namely sprinting (and even moving while standing) feel forced and ham-fisted. There is little difference between and standing walking and a running sprint, they both feel loud, careless, and half-uncontrollable.It took me three fresh starts to finally find the difficulty settings I wanted. For mil-sim fans, you'll definitely wanna turn up the difficulty settings, or perhaps just do a custom difficulty like I did to turn on some of the more ""simulation"" style aspects of gunplay. Things still get a little....action-movie'y during play. But, I suppose everyones gotta have a day job. Overall, my expectations were not disappointed much at all and I find it an enjoyable (albeit slightly arcade-y) sniper game.			",245,49,20,30,41,5,60

												If you've played the first Sniper Elite and enjoyed its campaign thoroughly, thinking that you might enjoy this game's campaign just as much; you may want to rethink about getting this game.The campaign is rather short and not as challenging nor suspensful as its precursor, albeit being more action-packed. Onto visuals and general gameplay:It's a decent-looking game, slightly leaning more towards the prettier side, although the character animations are rather rough. Most custscenes of the campaign are unecessary, and the end of every mission (MINOR SPOILERS) is literally just the main character walking out of the scene. (END SPOILERS) Gameplay however is pretty addicting and I'd imagine people who enjoy the first few hours of this game would strive to become better. You don't really have many weapon-choices, however, each weapon offers a number of options for a distinct playstyle of the player's choosing; be it stealth or run and gun.I would recommend this game for the gameplay, but the campaign is on the fine line between simple or barely worked on.

												A very pleasant surprise, this. When I heard of the original game not scoring too well, I had little hopes for this either. I obtained it through the Free Offer that Steam gave out back in June and literally only installed it just over a week ago.The WW2 back-story is interesting, though far from unique. But rarely have I come across a game that rewards you for playing it 'well'. The game's main character (you) - can easily play though and complete it with all guns blazing. You can also proceed as a sniper should- slowly, methodically and scanning every piece of terrain between you and your target. It's entirely possible to complete a level without ever alerting the enemy - using a mixture of cover, stealth, silenced handguns and above all - patience. Playing in this style will maximise both your points and overall score.Personally, I went for a mixture of the two - taking time when I could and literally firing from the hip when needs must. SE2 isn't without it's faults. For the ease of gameplay, vehicles and armour often have an explosive fuel tank strapped to their flank. I'm pretty sure that no Tiger or T-34 tank was taken out in WW2 through a sniper hitting just the right area of a diesel can on the side! :) Also, and a little frustrating at times, is the dubious hit detection. Many a time I scoped up an enemy and the bullet I fired made a perfect hole in the wall - directly behind their head or hat. By which point, the enemy is alerted to your position and you have to frantically fight back.Those are small gripes however, in and otherwise thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile game. If you like your FPS games to be a little less gung-ho - or you like to tactically work your way to a defined target - then this game is for you. Oh, and if you thought the bullet-time action was good in the Max Payne games - see what your bullets do to the opposing forces....Good fun and much appreciated - thanks Steam.8/10			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

												This is a single player review as I don't care for multiplayer games.I really wanted to like this game. It has some unique mechanics that set it apart from many of the other FPS and 3rd person shooters out there and was fun for a bit till I started noticing the many, many, flaws in it, namely that it tires to be too many different things at once... The biggest problem though, is it suffers from the sameness those games do as well. Pushing the player into corridors and hallways way too often and not giving enough options for strategy or planning of any sort. Being a gun enthusiast in the real world I know a bit about bullet drop, wind, and ballistics and it gets things almost right when it comes to the sniping aspects, for the most part (I could nitpick about lack of penetration namely wood is not bulletproof, and their extreme bullet drop at what are considered normal engagement ranges for battle rifles, but with the limited map sizes it is understanable), as for other weapons? Heck no!The problem is that for a game called ""Sniper Elite"" there is very little opportunity to snipe. Bad guys seem telepathic, levels are way too linear and too many corridor shooter parts, too many close quarters combat parts, not enough options for sniping as you are mostly stuck on the ground for much of the game with very few options for good sniping positions... You can climb over some walls but not others even if they are lower than the walls you can climb over! Too many times I thought, ""Oh look if I can just get up to that window it would be a perfect sniping position."" Nope invisible un-climbable wall that is only 3 feet high! The few levels where you get a nice open map with lots of options for sniping are quite a bit of fun and the only reason I would recommend to get this game but only for under $5.A big issue I have is with the close quarters combat this game forces on the player way too often... First off, enemies do not spawn until you reach certain trigger points or check points, so in an open area you cleared out, all of a sudden new enemies are swarming you that were not there before, forcing you into yet more close quarters combat because they all telepathically know where you are! There were a few times I thought I had a nice hiding spot and an enemy would actually SPAWN ON TOP OF ME out of thin air! Now that would not be a problem if weapons outside of the sniper rifle could actually hit things you were aiming at, but for some reason an SMG cannot even hit a guy that is 5 feet in front of you! At full auto on the SMGs, bullets seem to leave the barrel at nearly 80degree angles so firing off a full magazine of 30+ rounds you will be lucky if 5 bullets actually hit the enemy 5 feet away. I don't think the people that made this game ever even fired an SMG in the real world because the mechanics of it are absolutely terrible in this game. Some other weird issues, certain enemies’ weapons will vanish when you take them out because the game designers didn't want you to get those weapons too early on, ""Oh look he has a Nagant! I want that!"" poof vanishes, ""Damn.""For a game about stealth and sniping it has some serious drawbacks. The stealth is meh. Also location based body damage is very unrealistic. I thought, ""Wow! I love the bullet camera, this is pretty neat! Uh oh I see an enemy sniper's hand! I'll shoot him in his hand and take him out of the battle."" So I fire over 5 shots into the enemies hands and he just keeps shooting at me like it never touched him. Or if you shoot someone in the leg they just do a cruddy little stumble animation and then continue firing at you like nothing happened even if you technically would have blown off their kneecaps. Even on hard the AI is terrible... Just find a bottleneck area and the enemies will pour through it even if they see a pile of their dead buddies stacked up there. Relocation doesn't work either, I could run away from a group of enemies to try and pick them off and in most cases, even if I ran halfway back across the map, they somehow always know where I am.And the final reason for the thumbs down on this game I tried really hard to like.... It is less than 8 hours long and that is even with me trying to explore every little nook and cranny in the game. It does have some replay value for the few good sniper levels, I will give it that.Bottom line: Sniping is quite a bit of fun in this game, when you are presented with the opportunity to snipe, and the few areas where you can take multiple approaches and the trap setting and strategy can be quite fun when it isn't forcing you down a linear path... But I cannot recommend this game for over $5 because most of the game is close quarters combat with terrible close quarters weapons that cannot hit a thing directly in front of you, the enemy AI is terrible even on hard, for a game about sniping you are more the typical ""one man army"" type every other shooter game does and sniper rifles feel more like a secondary weapon at that point. If you are going to call a game ""Sniper Anything"" it needs to have a bigger focus on the whole sniper part.			",278,34,11,27,31,3,49

												I bought this game, out of a realisation that I have no games involving shooting Nazis. And as someone who has a firm belief that it's impossible to murder a nazi, only avenge their victims, this was a travesty. After buying this game, I realised that i'd never succeed if I wasn't stealthy. Luckily enough, it turns out being exceedingly accurate works too. Occasionally the game zooms in and gives a slow motion x-ray view of your shot as it moves through the air, and your targets. I found this highly satisfying, though i'm sure some wouldnt, and it can be turned off in the options menu. The game is largely stealth oriented, though i'm about as stealthy as an atomic bomb. To this effect, I just shoot everyone. The graphics are good, though i've come across an odd bug which causes the textures to go haywire. Restarting the game seems to solve the problem. Overall, this game is at it's most enjoyable if you have Inglorious Basterds stuck in your head. ""You'll all owe me a debt! Of one hundred, nazi, scalps! And I want my scalps!""If only Lt Aldo Raine was actually in this.. oh well. Quoting him will have to do.			",305,28,4,33,25,0,28

												So there are no women in this game. There's not even a reference to a female. At least that hoary old man-fest Gears of War had a female pilot and, um, Dom's wife. This game however, is too full of testosterone to allow any women near it. In fact, it is so full of testosterone that it needs to show you the effects of shooting a man in the balls with a sniper rifle. In X-ray form (Spoiler: they explode).So in love with its explodey ball-cam is this game that it does not let you skip the end credits, just so you the player can honour Dave Smith the bollock-modeller - who really put a lot of effort into making testicles explode, it's on his CV now and everything.Anyway, I digress. This game has a rubbish plot, boring level-design and very poor AI. But, and this is a big but, they got the shooting right. I feels very satisfying and for a game called ""Sniper Elite"" I guess that's the most important thing. Well, that and the balls.			",679,261,30,141,83,11,137

												Very good game and explores a lot of aspects that face snipers. There are a couple of issues with the gameplay though. First the ""sneaking around"" is very limited and linear. There aren't enough ways to avoid the enimies and that leads to an unrealistic kill towards the end of missions. There would be no way that high value targets would still show with men dropping around them. The second problem I have is with the extraction. You end up just running to a point and it is over. It doesn't matter if you are leaving hot or not. The levels just end. Overall it is fun to play, the kill cams are awesome, and the physics are even better when you get to the points with high winds.			",272,53,6,29,40,2,41

												A great gem that mix's stealth with gun play it works very well with its great controls and do i have to go in to much detail about how good it looks ? no thats what i thourght moving on . The x-ray cam's add a nice bit of fun to this kind of game i mean its a very nice feeling when you get a kill from long range and see the bullet hit you target right in the head and he fly's back blood and bone flying its great. would say good buy it if you like 1. stealth 2. gory gamplay 3. badassery . but would say get the addons with it to extaend your play so ""aim"" (bad pun sorry) to get it when its on sale. I got the game plus all the addons for £9.20 (no idea how much that is in other country's sorry). final score 9/10			",243,16,4,6,8,3,14

												An excellently well done game. If you loved the previous Sniper Elite this is an improved and added upon version. The story is awesome and very well done, it takes you back to WWII and you get to kill some of the greatest leaders in the war at that time. You also get to kill Hitler which is a great mission to do. There are so many ways to snipe your enemies in this game, you can go for their grenades, and hit random things in the area to explode to give the shock affect. The graphics brings a new depth and feel to the game when you actually see the internal impact your shots do to the enemy. The online play is very active and well done. There is co-op which is so much fun with a friend but is really hard to get a game with just random people. It can be a challenge to know were to go though on the maps, but can be overcome with time and practice.  The overall quality of this game is awesome and it was so much fun to play. If you played the previous Sniper Elite then you'll love this!			",3038,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												For those who like sniping in fps games.... this is it... the ultimate sniping game. IT definetly reminds me of Tenshu and those finishing stealth moves, with zoomed in xrays... Yep you get to roll stealth with a sniper rifle OR just go right into action, moving from buildings and shadows while constantly sniping. 1 shot 1 kill...Nice set of achievements will keep you interested in a more skillfull game, instead of that simple storm through fps...this fps has that ""extra"" you want and that ""classic"" you like.

												I got this game when it was free not too long ago just for the sake of having it in my library. However, I played it and was pleasantly surprised on how good, what sounded like a generic WWII shooter, actually was. This game focuses a lot on sniping and so if you enjoy using sniper rifles in shooters (like me) then you will definately enjoy this game. It is also a cover based shooter, so if you enjoy Gears of War, you will definately like this game.			",111,10,0,2,4,1,4

												Keep your distance Sniping is always great fun so any game that offers plenty of it has to be a good thing. The sniping in SNIPER ELITE V2 is (as I understand it) pretty realistic. It includes all the conditions that would effect such a task in the real world, including bullet drop, wind speed and direction, body movement etc. There’s no denying the satisfaction when you score a hit, especially a headshot, and this is often augmented by the enjoyable spectacle of the bullet flying through the air in slow-motion towards its target. Personally, I could have lived without the kill-cam’s depiction of the victim’s injuries, but this is only a game so let’s not get too wrapped up in the ethics. Less successful is the close-quarter combat that you are sometimes forced into. The cover-based stealth system is less sophisticated than in some games (Deus Ex: Human Revolution, for example) and aiming at close range can be problematic. This, coupled with a ridiculously keen-eyed AI, can prove frustrating. The graphics are good to very good, with the ruins of a war-torn Berlin particularly well depicted. The story is rather fractured due to the mission-based gameplay but SEV2 isn’t really about story, its about honing your long-range shooting skills, and this it does well.3.5/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

The weapons are okay to use even though there could be more.Do not except a sniper simulation game or even a good stealth game, it's nothing like that, it's a pure arcade game.You should get it during a sale.6/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												Sniper Elite V2 is very realistic and enjoyable. Simply one of the best sniping games ever, in my opinion, I like the story, the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is just fantastic. What I love mostly about this game is the ""x-ray killcam"", where you can see the bullet going through someone's skull or other body parts. If you are searching for an amazing sniping experience, this is arguably the right game for you! 10/10 Worth every single cent.			",36,4,3,1,3,0,3

												very good game, obviously it's key feature is the cinematic kill shots, which were executed rather well.. with some slight ignorance of physics.. but it's a game, what can you expect really? few drawbacks are the over-dependancy on accuracy wih sniper rifle, but then innacuracy with the silenced pistol, and the stealth could've been applied better.. overall, I'd probably give it a 7/10			",131,12,3,14,13,1,4

												Awful!  This game was terrible there is no proper hit boxes invisible walls everywhere.  The shots are different everytime. You could have the exact same shot multiple times with similar to same wind direction, and your bullet will go where it wants it has a mind of its own.  I would not recommend this game.  Do not waste your time or money this has also turned me away from buying sniper elite 3.  Did I mention the campaign/ story was just garbage no introduction or structure to it.

Whilst nearly every other game that comes out now is set in the Middle East this one is set in WW2 and makes this for me stand out from the crowd of same thing again seen it too many times syndrome. You can play the game stealthy or just go around shooting everyone this makes for a nice pace to the game and whatever your mood is the game delivers.Graphics 9/10Sound 8/10Replay/Gameplay lengh 8/10 (Has Mulitplayer which works well and is easy to connect/find a game)			",653,210,43,81,86,7,91

												I really enjoy the Sniper Elite series. I have played the first game and liked it so when I got the chance to get Sniper Elite V2 free I jumped at it. Sniper Elite V2 reminds me of another ""sniper series"" I like, the Sniper Ghost Warrior games. Right from the start I had a good idea what it was going to play like, but overall I feel that Elite V2 is a bit better than the Ghost Warrior games, at least in single player. The multiplayer is not bad though, not bad at all, it just feels pretty basic to me but simplicity is not always a bad thing.   I recommend the Sniper Elite games to my friends, and now you, I think that if you have read this far into my review you are at least interested enough in the game to get some enjoyment out of it. You dont just have to take my word for it though, Go check around online there is sure to be more compelling evidence out there as to why you should play this game.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Accidentally shoot the balls of a nazi and it exploded, I feel sorry for him.10/10Serious review:The game is okay, not the greatest game but It's a nice one, better than the Ghost Warrior ones and In my opinion, better than the Nazi Zombies ones too (probably because it gets boring killing nazi zombies/zombies every times).The missions are simple, nothing epicUnfortunately, the stealth is not present in this game. The weapons are okay to use even though there could be more.Do not except a sniper simulation game or even a good stealth game, it's nothing like that, it's a pure arcade game.You should get it during a sale.6/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												This and the Sniper Elite Zombie games are plagued with bugs, sound issues, and crashes. Just go online to see the multiple issues and I can assure you, one or more will be your games demise. I love the game, although the Zombies do tend to pack up, so snipering is not as fun as in this the original game. But being forced to play it with NO sound, well that is a deal breaker.Just a follow up. It has been a month now and still no sound. I installed different speakers, used different headphones, installed new drivers (re installed they were all current) and the support team said ""have you tried a different sound card. So I installed a different sound card, and still no sound.I didn't buy the new game (Sniper Elite 3), and probably will never buy a game from Rebellion again.Terrible support. Terrible follow up. Game breaking lack of sound. 528+ pages of sound problems on their forums btw, so it isn't just me.I give these games a 0/10 because thats what I hear while I play them...nothing.

												For those who like sniping in fps games.... this is it... the ultimate sniping game. IT definetly reminds me of Tenshu and those finishing stealth moves, with zoomed in xrays... Yep you get to roll stealth with a sniper rifle OR just go right into action, moving from buildings and shadows while constantly sniping. 1 shot 1 kill...Nice set of achievements will keep you interested in a more skillfull game, instead of that simple storm through fps...this fps has that ""extra"" you want and that ""classic"" you like.

However, I played it and was pleasantly surprised on how good, what sounded like a generic WWII shooter, actually was. This game focuses a lot on sniping and so if you enjoy using sniper rifles in shooters (like me) then you will definately enjoy this game. It is also a cover based shooter, so if you enjoy Gears of War, you will definately like this game.			",111,10,0,2,4,1,4

												Finshed the game in about 11 hours. I've always been drawn to sniper rifles in other games so a game that dealt with sniping as the primary combat method was appealing to me. If you're into sneaking around and quietly waiting for the shot, this is the game for you. There are segments with close combat as well and you'll make use of a silenced pistol in some areas. The bullet ""cam"" is a cool feature and you can adjust the frequency of the kill shot animations. It can get repetitive but I left it at the default setting. I did not encounter and bugs other than some minor path issues. The enemy AI can be smart but there are times when the enemy just walks around even though his comrades are dropping around him. The music does a lot to indicate the danger as well as set the spririt of the time period.  I definitely enoyed the game, the missions and the combat mechanics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper Elite V2 is a WW II 3rd person shooter with a linear level design with SP and MP mode.Graphics:     5/10Graphics are ok but the textures appear blurred even with the highest settings. The colors are realistic and suitable. Neither special nor modern.I like the bulletcam. It gives you the right feeling of hitting someone critically.Leveldesign:     4/10Well - I know the scenery is determined by the World War theme but it's extremely monotonous. Always the same destroyed buildings. The levelborders are partly ok since it's not that difficult to design them in a destroyed city.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     7/10All in all a standard shooter. It annoys me that the bullet hits a cover I never aimed for because the view is odd sometimes. The snipers work fine for me. I didn't really recognize a major difference between them except for the clipsize and manual or semi-auto. The pistols are kind of useless, but after all the game is named sniper elite.Trapmines are nice but you will rarely use them.AI:     6/10Seeks cover, uses grenades, authentic aiming, reacts when someone gets hit.But sometimes the AI just randomly runs around inviting the sniper to shoot him right between the eyes.Sound:     3/10First the good things: Yes, it sounds like a war. Plenty of bomb explosions from afar, gunshots etc, etc. The weapon sounds are somewhat ""ok"" but i'm not impressed. The music is very annoying. There are like 2 or 3 tracks and that's it. And on top of that the soundtrack is boring in the first place.Storyline:     1/10I think the problem here is: The developers wanted the story to be kind of realistic. But it is not. Why? Because you are a super-sniper-soldier, killing hundreds and hundreds of Nazis and Russians. And your ""awesome"" mission is: Kill some strange guys who have something to do with the V2-Rockets. Well. Nice. That shows that the priority was set on the word ""Sniper"". Because they just needed any random reason to take a gun and shoot people.Critic summary:     4.3/10Personal fun rating:     5/10     [mediocre game]Since I got the game for free I recommend the game to play it at least a few hours.But I would never buy the game for 10 bucks. Not sure if I would for 5.It's strange enough to make the game in third-person-view. I didn't finish the story and I think I never will. There is no reason to play the game twice. If you are a Sniper-enthusiast then go for it. But since I write this review for people who consider to buy it:Don't do it.			",133,4,1,7,4,2,6

Posted: February 18, 2015
												I'm approaching this from someone who never plays shooters. I've had a great time playing SE V2 and I'm not much of an action / shooter gamer.  I never play FPS games because they make me motion sick. So I'm really entirely new to the genre. I couldn't play Doom, Unreal, Quake or anything else because I'd be sicker than a dog in 5 minutes. Sniper Elite V2 is probably the first shooter I could...ahem...stomache.So after not puking while playing the demo, I decided to get SE V2 on sale and I was really pleasantly surprised. It's a lot of fun sneaking around, figuring out the best angles, staying hidden, spotting your target and pulling off a brilliant shot. It's one of my better ""hmmm, let's take a chance"" purchases on Steam.Of course, the sniper rifle isn't the only thing available to you. You have your trusty Thompson machine gun and a silenced pistol. You also have grenades (though very limited amounts), tripwires, mines and even rocks (nothing better to try to get a guard to investigate an area). Each map is laid out like a puzzle and it's up to you to solve it. Do you run and gun? Do you sneak? Do you lure your enemies into a trap-filled area and watch them blow up? With numerous options and difficulty levels, it can be a challenging game the 2nd or 3rd time through.Personally, I'm pretty hardcore. I like the sneaking method. So I take my time, creep into position, take my shot and get the heck out of there before the Germans come running. It's great fun and I feel that there's a sense of accomplishment when I can do that.Are there problems? Yep. Some enemies are scripted to ""see"" you when they enter the map. Other enemies don't appear on the map until you hit a specific waypoint. These scripted challenges make the game feel artificially difficult and occasionally downright cheap. Truly, the game works best when it lets you play the pure role of the sniper, but some maps and areas are little more than stand-up firefights. SE V2 doesn't do these very well, so these missions or areas become tedious fast. Of course there's also MP, but that's not my thing and the MP community has already moved on to SE3.The other aspects - the story, the ""bullet kill cam"", the (few) different weapons - didn't really interest me all that much. The graphics are fine but they're certainly not top notch. But since I found great pleasure in spending 20 minutes creeping into just the right position to blow Generic German #142's head clean off, I quite enjoyed it. Enough to play all the way through at least twice. So if the demo appeals to you, go ahead and grab it. YMMV.			",81,36,8,60,54,5,57

												This isn't a hallmark in storytelling, a raised bar in set piece design, or the king of graphics.But it is absurdly fun, and ridiculously varied for a game focusing around a single mechanic (sniping), and the bullet cam is always a guilty pleasure to watch. Also, the co-op campaign is the single player campaign with a second player tacked on.Which is perfect.			",239,11,1,16,4,1,13

												Ridiculously easy, linear, and dull. Pseudo stealth mechanics and useless AI makes firefights or stealthing boring. The only remote satisfaction to gain from this game is a really nice looking x ray shot you get with your sniper. These are rare however because you're almost always close enough to the enemy where instead of the bullet kill being an x ray it only slows down time to show the bullet hit the body (no x ray at certain distances for whatever reason). In fact there is very little sniping in this game at all. Mostly pistol action and ""quickscoping"". Do not buy unless you are mentally challenged and gain satisfaction from shooting AI that only sit there and watch you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you enjoy third person shooters that require accuracy?Do you enjoy ridiculous mouse acceleration?Do you enjoy forced stealth when your only silent weapon isn't a guaranteed one-hit kill?Do you enjoy a protagonist who is only capable of speaking like Don LaFontaine and has an oddly shaped face?Do you enjoy sniping between 50 and 150 yards?Do you enjoy ridiculous amounts of collectables?Do you enjoy crawling through brick-based piles of rubble?Do you enjoy the last sentence of a game being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequel hook?Do you enjoy popups in the main menu trying to sell you DLC?Well, in the rare case that you adore everything on that list, this game MIGHT be worth your money.I got this game for free and I still feel ripped off.The only worse sniping game is probably Sniper: Ghost Warrior.

												Although it is quite an old game now, I picked it up cheap while Steam were having a sale on the Sniper Elite Franchise.Sniper Elite V2 has good graphics, sound effects and a great story mode whiuch was very enjoyable to complete all the way through. However, (even though this is a major game element of the franchise) the slow-mo when you get a headshot, even if you were not 'emptying your lungs', did get very boring after a while as it would occur after nearly every shot. You can change this slightly in the settings but it still got rather tedious.Unsurprising, it did run very well on my system. Overall, a great game to play if you want to complete the previous games in the Sniper Elite Franchise before moving on to the most current game. Am now going to buy and play through Sniper Elite 3!			",165,19,3,10,29,1,13

												Great game for those of us who crave a real sniper experience. Nice variety of rifles my personal favourites being the Einfield and the japanese x99. Wind and muzzle velocity count in this game, if your using a rifle with low velocity then you have to compensate heavily when taking shots ie. aim slightly higher than the target. Its very satisfying when you start hitting head shots consistently, my best was one at 287 metres !! Its also a pretty challenging game if you play on the highest diffculty, if you try to run in Rambo style you will be dead in seconds, your a sniper not infantry.			",248,42,2,51,18,3,47

												Sniper Elite V2 is a decent sniper game set in World War II.The campaign features a solid storyline. It is set in 1945 at the close of WWII and you are behind enemy lines trying to stop the launch of the V2 rockets. The campaign packs some fun elements that not only allow you to attack the Germans but also the Russians, which in itself creates an interesting dynamic where alliances do not matter. The game is around six hours long and some missions are obviously more engaging than others. For the most part, the game emphasises freedom in how to engage your objectives and this allows you to go loud or stealth, creating a fun and exciting balance in gameplay. At only six hours in length, the campaign dragged but it did somewhat allow me to invest into the story.The gameplay is good. It is identical to Sniper Elite 1. The freedom in approach to your missions are interesting in creating strategies on how to engage your enemies without alerting the rest. The gameplay incorporates a slow-motion bullet cam that is now a main part of the Sniper Elite series. It happens so often though that it feels like something to help expand the length of the campaign. The enemy AI is above-average. The machine gunners are smart in listening and knowing where to shoot but the enemy snipers are plain stupid. I did not play multiplayer. I played this around the time Sniper Elite III was out.The performence is atrocious. This game does not have much spec requirements and my computer has better specs than the recommnended. I played on low settings with the majority of settings set to off and that was the only chance I could obtain a consistent 60 FPS. Absolutely awful.Pros:- Sniping mechanics.- Freedom in missions.- AI was somewhat challenging.Cons:- Performence.- Length and quality of campaign. At six hours, the campaign dragged in the final two.- Enemy Sniping AI.- A lot of bugs.Overall, Sniper Elite V2 is a decent game. It features a solid campaign that is interesting enough until it drags. It incorporates fun gameplay with some twists into the strategic element, and will keep you entertained for a few hours. I recommend this on sale. 6.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

												First off, this is a game about sniping. It tries to be about sneaking, but the mechanics are terribly done and it is all but impossible. First off, guards see you from 100m away while youre crouched or behind boxes or anywhere you are. This negates trying to move quielty and every time a firefight erupts. Also, you cant be quiet because even if you jog or run 200m away or two floors below, they instantly hear you and know where you are and come to you. Also, they don't just move toward noise and turn around or anything, even if you are behind cover they wouldn't walk past you in the room; they walk right up to you as if they knew you were there the whole time. The other big problem is that all the levels are SUPER linear. You can't go in half the buildings and even if you can you can only go up into a window but you can't go through them. If there is a wide open level it still only has 1 little open door/gate to go through and it is guarded by a few guards.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												Not a bad game, not a great game.  The kicker here is that if you buy it you support a company that sues for the use  of ""rebellion"" in a game title not connected to the Rebellion studio  There are other sniper games out there that don't support this level of legalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery.  Maybe they could try naming themselves a little more creatively than just picking a noun out of the dictionary.  Don't feed the trolls.......			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In closing, Sniper Elite V2 does a lot of things right. The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat. Minor issues aside, headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.			",288,96,11,37,71,8,50

												Although it is quite an old game now, I picked it up cheap while Steam were having a sale on the Sniper Elite Franchise.Sniper Elite V2 has good graphics, sound effects and a great story mode whiuch was very enjoyable to complete all the way through. However, (even though this is a major game element of the franchise) the slow-mo when you get a headshot, even if you were not 'emptying your lungs', did get very boring after a while as it would occur after nearly every shot. You can change this slightly in the settings but it still got rather tedious.Unsurprising, it did run very well on my system. Overall, a great game to play if you want to complete the previous games in the Sniper Elite Franchise before moving on to the most current game. Am now going to buy and play through Sniper Elite 3!			",165,19,3,10,29,1,13

												First off i got this game for free and played the demo a few years back. The first few missions were fun but it got really old fast as balls i was begging to God that it was the last mission atleast 5 times over. The Sniper kills and slow motion stuff is fun at first but it got to the point where i was spamming my keyboard trying to find a way to skip this dreaded slow motion butt or-gy. The close combat in this game ruins it and it more than half of the game. It doesnt work up close in 3rd person because of the stupid over the shoulder bull. Just knowing that a 3rd game is coming out makes me think that i could make the same money by selling my feces online. Last to say the multiplayer is boring quiet and full of cheaters.

												If you don't play in the highest difficulty you don't get all the awesome bullet physics, which is the main feature of this game, but it gets almost impossible to actually snipe (meaning shoot, move out of sight, shoot, repeat). Instead, you have to go commando on those russians. Either way, you'll probably get killed and will have to start on the last checkpoint, 10 minutes ago. And the storytelling is just bad.

												This game barely improved after the first part. They kept everything almost exactly the same. Once again Berlin, once again small streets with little space.In all honesty, about the only improvements are concluded in some of the presentation of the cutscenes in the beggining, some music, the slow motion camera and the sound design.However all else can be found for a much lower price in Sniper Elite (2005). I'm presuming most people got Sniper Elite V2 in June 2014, but if you're thinking of getting it, then I strongly advise to much rather look upon the predecesor.I was personally rather disappointed with the quality of the character animation, the firefights and the stealth in general. It kept all the clunky aspects of the previous game, with only very slight upgrades - of course the visual side too, but it falls apart when I see the low level the general execution of most levels.  The level design is linear. It feels more linear than even the first gameEven more, I would say most levels seem way too reminiscent of the previous game. They could've went with pretty much any other European setting of WW2, but since they kept Berlin it's way too reminiscent of it. It's just not a good game from what I saw.Perhaps in the future they will work more on it and bring it in order with future games. But thus far it's a lost cause.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32
