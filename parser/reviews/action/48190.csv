 Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.  Plot  -Before you play this game, I highly suggest that you play Assassin's Creed 2 first. As this game will start off exactly where the previous game has ended. I honestly felt that the story was short, you can easily sense that it is about to end soon. Compared to Assassin's Creed II, wherein I've poured atleast 26 hours of gameplay to finish the whole story and that includes some puzzles and some few side quests, it only took me atleast 18 hours to finish Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I'll admit that I've done more puzzles and side quests on the previous game than this one, but I think the difference from 26 hours and 18 is just too big. But given those comparisons, this game still has a story worth playing. And it is an essential part of Ezio's story rc, which is great if not one of the best storylines this franchise has. Environment and Design  - The game takes place on Italy, featuring its greatest city, Rome. It showcases some of the famous landmarks like  The Colosseum ,  Pantheon , and many more. And these aren't just for a show off, you have the option to purchase this landmarks to increase your income. Because of the extensive land size this game offers, parkouring over the roofs may not be enough to roam the whole city on your own. Hence, they introduced horse for you to ride on and help you get to places faster. But to make travelling more faster, there are underground tunnels that would take you to different parts of the map instantly.I have mentioned earlier that the town feels more lively, and it is also because of the townspeople. There are more happenings around you, more idle animations and no more  just walking  people. And this may seem a small detail, but sometimes even the smallest detail can make a game better. Gameplay  - The game may be short, but the side ques and activities is what made this game the way it is. Given its land size, there are alot of areas to conquer to increase the size of your brotherhood. And you may call this recruits during fights to help you assassinate the guards in the area. Or you can send them to different missions for them to earn experience and some gold for yourself. In terms of combat, everything in this game has been improved, from hand to hand combat to picking off enemies silently. You can now chain kills when using either a sword or a small weapon when timed correctly. Not only this but you may also combine the use of this with long range weapons, you can now use the Hidden Gun while using a sword or use small weapons together with your throwing knives. As for the stealth, new long range weapons have been like the Poison Darts, which has the same effect of a Poison Blade but for long ranges. And the use of a Crossbow, which is basically a stealth version of a Hidden Gun, preventing the guards to be alerted when fired.As for the parkour itself, everything seems just the same as to the previous game. But the most downside for me is when they implemented the synchronization. Its a side goal that they give you in each mission, normally everything is doable and reasonable. But what make its annoying is when it prevents you to be ceative of your own kills, because a failure to do so on the given side goal would only result a half synchronization. And it doesn't stop there, for me, the most annoying side goal is when you're in a dungeon full of obstacle course and puzzles, and they will give you a time limit. That is very frustrating, as if the game doesn't want you to explore the whole area to gather chests hidden somewhere. And a true gamer always want to get lost when exploring an area. Controls  -The game still punishes you if you're a little bit hasty and wants to do things on a fast pace. As usual, I ended up falling alot of times again due to rushing the obstacle courses. I've also lost alot of side goals due to being impatient. But thank god they finally fixed the UI for controls shown on the top right. Instead of the weird icons, that I have no idea what key they represent, they now show the representing key. It maybe too late due to my experience to the previous, it is still a nice touch. Conclusion  - Finish Assassin's Creed II first before touching this game and you'll appreciate how the story continues. The game may feel more focused on other activites than the main story but its still a game worth playing. Everything from the previous game is well improved.Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.Thank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.Assassin's Creed II - ReviewAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review ",763,245,29,80,57,10,64

AC Brotherhood: more isn't always betterAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is only the third game in the Assassin's Creed series I've yet played: I keep to the order in which the games were initially released. Ubisoft got this game, the second one featuring Ezio Auditore as the protagonist, out in March 2011, three and a halve years ago. Having played it relatively soon after the original Assassin's Creed II, I feel it natural to compare the two games to each other. This makes even more sense since the story of AC II really coninues in Brotherhood: not only do the same characters appear in both games, chronologically too they follow nicely upon each other.Brotherhood starts off splendidly, with a recapture of the final sequences of AC II which flows naturally into the new twists which the well-known story of the struggle between Assassins and Templars about world-changing artefacts takes. After the initial (short) part of the game that functions as a tutorial, I was taken straight into the city where almost all of the action takes place: Rome. The fact that there is only one major city here, compared to the two (Firenze and Venice) and the countryside of the original game, makes for a huge difference. Rome of around 1500 comes to live in Brotherhood in the most fantastic imaginable way. First of all, the map is HUGE: there are 12 districts (including the Vatican and some outer area's which have a rural sense about them), and running from one side of the city to the other would cost you at least ten-fifteen minutes (happily, horses are allowed in the city and there is a well-thought-off fast-travel system). Secondly, the development team has obviously taken the utmost care in analyzing how Rome anno 1500 looked like - and that's really quite different from modern-day Rome. During the first ten (!!) hours or so in-game, I mostly just walked around, discovering the city, marvelling at all the details in the buildings and eagerly reading the information provided for almost every single church, Roman building or other landmark. During my entire playthrough, I felt like being a tourist catapulted 500 years back to a place I love so much. That's quite some accomplishment, and I would even go so far as to call Rome the main character of the game, not Ezio.That's not only because of the painstaking detail with which the ""Cit√† Eterna"" is being depicted, but it's also due to some problems with the concept of the game. Not only is the world almost entirely accessible from the start of the game, the number of side-missions is daunting, certainly compared to the main-story missions. Since I am a curious gamer, I tried some of these, than more of those missions, mixing it all up with the main storyline. Wrong! Almost every mission gives even more options afterwards, unlocking new factions or side-story lines, and they are of course all indicated on a over-cluttered map (which I had to zoom in really close to be able to read every sign on it). After a further ten hours or so into the game, I started feeling overwhelmed: there was SO much to do, to explore, to try, and it could all be done at my own initiative. Now this open-world concept may appeal to many gamers, but I like more of a narrative element, or at least a good backbone of a main story. And this exactly where Brotherhood tends to falter at times. Only by following the main story mission after mission (which I started doing after quite some time), did I refind the feeling of actually being Ezio Auditore, a feeling that had been so strong in AC II. Once I really plunged into it, the main storyline proved to be quite good, though not so compelling as the one in the previous game, and certainly much shorter (although this is more than made up for the number of side-missions and -excursions).In all other departments than the identification with Ezio and the overdose of side-activities, Brotherhood does shine, just as I had hoped for. The walking/climbing/jumping and whatever more of Ezio is so fluent, that I actually felt becoming ""good"" at it, but as with the other AC games, using an Xbox 360 controller really is a must. Combat has been greatly improved upon alreay in AC II, and this game even adds more possibilities, all very natural. The biggest change is the addition of the Brotherhood: a group of Assassin's I could train by giving them missions abroad, and whose help I could call for when needed. Graphically, the game still is a gem, also after a couple of years. Only musically things could have been better: the music could have used a bit more variety.All things put together, Brotherhood is a worthy successor to AC II, but it is flawed by trying to do too much, and all of that at once. It's not on the same steallr height as its predecessor, but it's still a very, very good game. Buy it if you tried and liked AC I and/or II, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first dive into the realm of the Assassins.Gameplay: 24/30 (would have been higher with a tighter storyline)Graphics: 18/20Sound: 7/10Technical: 8/10 (I don't like Uplay as an extra ""shell"", but that's just how it is, and otherwise it's very stable)Longelivety: 9/10 (there is some MP which is mostly out of use, but SP alone gives you dozens of hours of gameplay)Steam-integration: 5/10 (as with almost all other Ubisoft titles: they try to promote Uplay...)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall: 80/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												AC Brotherhood is so much like its predecessor, AC II. It continues the story of Ezio Auditore and offers a fewer minor, but noticable improvements over the previous title. The most obvious improvement is the ability to recruit a band of assassin's and deploy them on various missions throughout Europe or even assist during actual gameplay. There are also a plethora of new weapons, paintings, armor, investments, and various Leonardo da Vinci gadgets that continue to make this a fun series to play. I also noticed I didn't find myself cursing at the combat system like the previous titles so they had to make some improvements in that regard as well.The main story takes place in Rome and while it is a much bigger city, the story seemed to be quite a bit shorter than the prior two games (for me) and this one left an obvious wide opening for the next game in the series. There did seem to be a larger variety of side missions though. Graphics and voice acting are top notch as usual.While I've been a little slow at playing the more recent AC titles, the first three Assassin's Creed titles have been an enjoyable series thus far.

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ ACB‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ AC1 was rough around the edges, both story and gameplay wise, barely tolerable, but this was acceptable, because it birthed multiple new genres (open world parkour, counter based combat, and map towers) and iconic new concepts (hidden blades, white hoods, and bales of hay).  An engine with ultra realistic climbing and combat animations.‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ AC2 fixed every problem with the original, while at the same time making huge new additions to the series.  Ezio, currency, equipment, upgradable village, sidequests and more.  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ ACB fine tuned things even further, and added yet more content and features.  It was impressive, the pinnacle of the series, before AC lost it's writer and then transitioned to a new engine; 1shot1kill meaningful combat, dual hidden blades as a combat weapon, upgrade the entire world now, build a brotherhood, unlock guild perks, unlock gadgets with leo, perfect openworld replayability with rewardingly sensible bonus mission objectives, tons of little touches like free jumping or poking out your hidden blades for vanity, and much more.  This game also added unique cat/mouse multiplayer, though I didn't much care for it.  * AC2 is quite possibly the only sequel in gaming history of legitimate value, aside from maybe the Final Fantasy series, which hardly qualify as sequels.  This wasn't just a L4D2 adding 4 new maps and 4 new survivors,  or an RE4/5 where the entire game was changed, or Dead Risings offering a new mall, or Farcry 3 and 4 being practically identical games, and lets not even get into CoD; it was an improvement and expansion of every idea in the game.  Even Arkham City, which is a 5star game and grand improvement over Asylum, could have been treated as a simple open world expansion on the original.  Most sequels are more like DLC, and most actual DLC is a total ripoff.  ACB, while an improvement, could have been an expansion for AC2, and the games only go downhill after that.‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ ACR removed many features, added nothing meaningful, and had a blatant change in writers.  Not only had the tone and setting changed for the worse, but the previous games were practically ignored, even though ACB ended on multiple cliff hangers. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ AC3 moved to a new engine, while it was graphically superior, the gameplay became floaty and overly simplified, with practically none of the depthy features that made AC good, and climbing animations that looked as if they were captured by Twilight's laughable wire team.  The writing was also poor, with a seemingly motivationalless, unlikable, unrelatable, bipolar main character.  The ship combat, however, was amazing here, probably the best ship combat ever put into a video game, sadly only treated as a minigame.‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ AC4; PIE RATS.  The story is a bit better here, the engine is a bit better here, the ship combat is a bit worse, but more integrated.  Overall an OK game.  ????? ACRogue; Missed this one, heard it was the best of the newer ones????? ACU; Skipped this one, can't comment, heard it was terrible.‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ ACS; Still using a floaty engine, this time with poor performance, combat has been reduced to mindless stat based button mashing, parkour has practially been removed as you can simply zipline around the world.  I don't like the setting either, and the story wasn't good enough to keep me interested.  This isn't even AC anymore.* Controller required, which is why I owned most of them on PS3 instead of Steam ",302,25,6,60,22,1,51

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed 2.Desmond is on the run again. This time, Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun visit the ruined Auditore villa on Monteriggioni and make it as their new hiding place. Desmond has learn much from Ezio, but he still need to uncover more information from Ezio, so there he goes again, and again, to the Animus.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood gameplay is pretty much the same with Assassin's Creed 2, but is now focused on the city of Roma, where Ezio battle his way to eliminate Cesare Borgia and liberate Roma in the process. Ezio needs to liberate each sector in the city of Roma by destroying the Borgia towers. Doing so will free the sector and let Ezio rebuild the sector, such as reopening blacksmith shops, doctor shops or banks, gaining income in the process. The game also let Ezio to recruit Assassins by helping troubled civilians who can then help him to fight guards or kill his mission target. Recruited Assassins can gain experience as they are being called by Ezio or by completing contracts. Also, for the first time in Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood feature multiplayer game.The graphics of the game still pretty much the same too. There may be some slight improvements but we won't notice it somehow. At least there is no downgrade.Overall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has taken the next step in Assassin's Creed franchise by introducing recruitable Assassins, while retaining the open world feature. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues right where Assassin's Creed II finished, so if you haven't played Assassin's Creed II I'd highly recommend playing that game first. Not only was it a good game, but it's almost essential at this point to play it so you can understand the story. This may not seem important, but for me the story is the most intriguing element to the entire franchise.The gameplay continues to improve game-on-game, but it's pretty much the same mechanic we've seen since the first Assassin's Creed game. Sure they've removed the terribly rigid design to the missions where you MUST scale this tower before you can do anything else, and I'm personally grateful they did this. However, overall the gameplay isn't that amazing. It's fun, sure, but at the same time it's played it's course now. Don't get me wrong, you can still scale the towers to remove the fog of war, but now it's optional.In fact it works well within what is slowly becoming a very sandbox style world, and this is another area of the game I'm starting to enjoy with each Assassin's Creed game. Ubisoft seem to be aware of what people enjoyed from Assassin's Creed II and disliked from Assassin's Creed and have done a good job of doing more of the same, and removing the offending elements of gameplay.Gone are the insane amount of collectibles, and instead we have more Tombs/Lairs to explore, Glyphs to discover and solve and an entire city to manage. While these elements aren't essential to complete the game, and at times they don't seem to to do much to the story at all (and I personally found the city management side of the game to be over before it begun), it's nice to see that there are options there for people who wish to slow things down and invest into the Assassin's Creed world. It's not all roses though, there are a few elements to Brotherhood that confused me. I'm hooked into the story, I want to know more, I want it to expand and progress, and sadly Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood never truly felt like it got going. It felt that it was one long prelude into Assassin's Creed: Revelations, with most of the Memory Segments feeling more like tutorials for the new gameplay mechanics or refreshing into franchise staple gameplay mechanics (most of which any Assassin's Creed fan would hopefully already be aware of). It's a minor fault, and if anything it's something of a Ubisoft Trademark to have excessive gameplay hints/tips/tutorials throughout the game.It doesn't really distract from the game, but it does slow down the buzz and adrenaline that has built up after the huge climax to Assassin's Creed II. Now that I've finished the game, I'm not too concerned about the lull as I can fool myself enough to believe it was perhaps intentional pacing to bring you backdown to build you back up for Brotherhood's ending (which was decent). Yet, I'm still left feeling 'what really happened' during Ezio's memory segments. I know who the main target was within the story, but you have so little interaction with them directly that you don't really focus on them (unlike in Assassin's Creed II where The Spaniard is referenced and featured in most segments). Sadly there is one element to the game that is lagging behind Assassin's Creed II and that's the soundtrack. I was convinced it was a new composer as it just felt alien compared to the previous work of Jasper Kydd. I just couldn't connect to it. Also, once again the character modles have changed ever so slightly but strangely noticably. A minor point of annoyance. Overall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fun game, and somewhat fast paced (almost to the point where it feels like it's over before it even begun). If you're hooked into the series by this point I'd recommend buying Brotherhood as it continues the story in an easy fun game. If you didn't really enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I think it's best you bow out of the series now and leave Brotherhood, as it's more of the same.The characters are slowly developing, and the plot is thickening. I also know that some people don't enjoy the 'future tech' side of the game, namely the areas outside of Ezio (such as being Desmond and the whole Animus side of world). I personally enjoy the mix of history and Sci-Fi within the game, so I don't find this to be a problem; however for those who do find it a problem there is a somewhat large/significant portion of Brotherhood that centres around the 'adventures of Desmond', so again it might be best to avoid Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers modest but welcome improvements over the previous entry in the series, Assassin's Creed II. Graphically, it's very similar. I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.However, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.But mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.And - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story. Last comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable. You see different NPC character models in different parts of the city, and they change between night and day. People mill about in a realistic fashion; some have places to be, others chat in the shade. The ambient noise is fantastic. And never a loading screen as you move about.So... Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is over 4 years old as I write this, so I doubt I'll convince anyone to play it who hasn't already. But it looks great, plays great on PC with a controller, and really delivers a satisfying experience. It's definitely worth your time. ",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												Brotherhood picks up where Assassin's Creed II left off, with late-fifteenth-century master assassin Ezio having just defeated a sickeningly corrupt pope. He returns home safely, but is inexplicably surprised the next day when the pope's son interrupts his awkwardly animated sex scene with an army.After a tedious segment outside of the Animus, Ezio travels to Rome to dislodge the tyrannical establishment. It's here that the open-world game starts for real, and the plot congeals.As in AC2, the story progresses through a series of Ezio's memories. The missions are varied sequences of stealth, combat, and story-driving dialog, and even the seemingly garden-variety escort missions are well done.The free-running and combat do take effort to master.The more I played, though, the more impressive my acrobatics became.As fans of open-world games would expect, a lot of the player's time will be occupied with missions and activities that don't necessarily advance the plot. It's easy to get sidetracked for hours finding treasure chests, taking on assassination contracts, doing missions for the various guilds or trying to level up your relationship with them, exploring the world or climbing landmarks like the Coliseum.Leonardo da Vinci is back as an ally too, and once again provides weapons for Ezio. Turns out he's also been pressured into creating war machines for Cesare, so it's up to Ezio to destroy the plans and prototypes. There are three major changes that try to switch things up: the assassins' guild, the tweaks to combat and the ability to ride your horse anywhere. Recruiting assassins who can be called upon with the press of a button is obviously the big one, and it works very much as advertised.It's also worth mentioning that looting dead guards' bodies now yields far more valuable items than it did in ACII. You can top up on smoke bombs, crossbow bolts, poison, bullets and medicine with relative ease.Perhaps the biggest surprise of the Brotherhood package is the multiplayer, which is refreshing and inventive.Multiplayer matches are simple but challenging stealth manhunts, either as lone-wolf assassins or teams of killers.Overshadowing even that, Brotherhood's biggest improvement is that it requires only one-time activation, as opposed to AC2's ‚Äúalways-online‚Äù DRM. The game itself isn't notably superior, especially in terms of story, but all of its additions put it on par with the last, and it's a hugely entertaining sequel.Overall 9/10.

Introduction:If you are a fan of Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, you are going to absolutely love this gem! If you have not played Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, I highly recommend that you start there, as Brotherhood and Revelations are direct continuations of Ubisoft‚Äôs 2009 predecessor. While Brotherhood is a sequel of a sequel, it continues to bring multiple quality elements to the table. This game is, without a doubt, my personal favourite in the series. Like the original installment, Brotherhood is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. One that you will not be disappointed in.As a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the predecessors, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first or second installments of Assassin‚Äôs Creed.Story: Brotherhood follows Assassin‚Äôs Creed II nicely, and cleanly picks up where the last left off. Desmond flees the scene of the latest Templar attack, and follows his team to Monteriggioni: their new hideout. Desperate to locate the Apple of Eden, in hopes of preventing a global disaster that had been predicted to happen later on in the year, Desmond rushes back into his genetic memory. For Ezio, it is 1499, and he still cannot explain what he had seen inside the vault. Unfortunately, he is not given much time to mull it over before the actions of the Templars push him back into action. He spends most of the game struggling to cripple the Borgia influence in the capital, and then begins the process of training other Assassin‚Äôs to aid him.Gameplay: Allow me to start off this section of the review by stating that Brotherhood is a huge game, offering more content than Assassin's Creed II. There are a lot of places to explore, both above and below ground. While some players share the mindset that ""more isn't always better"", I am a firm believer that the fans of the beloved assassin Ezio Auditore will have a blast checking out this game... Especially taking into consideration that there is a huge pool of returning characters, including Leonardo DaVinci and Machiavelli. There are a number of recognizable, yet staple mechanics worth mentioning, that have been recycled in Brotherhood: The original (if not improved) free-running system, eagle-vision, hidden messages, looting, buying, and investing. Furthermore, Brotherhood keeps the modernized and improved quest system from its predecessor, which permits Ezio to hire courtesans, thieves or mercenaries.The combat aspects of Brotherhood are mostly recognizable from Assassin's Creed II. You can still cycle through your weapons, and choose whether or not you want to execute a clumbsy public chase, or a stealthy and well-planned kill. Combat aesthetics are gorgeous, and make just about any fight seem brutal and bloody. Like it's predecessor, weapons and armor can be both obtained and repaired at blacksmith shops - Each offering their own selection of kill animations.However, there are also new aspects of combat. For instance, mounted combat is possible. While running through crowds and across rooftops is entirely possible, Brotherhood now offers the option of horseback riding through cities (once the stables have been purchased), permitting the player to jump from a horse, and straight into an assassination. Leonardo DaVinci has a bigger role in this game, along with optional DLC. In fact, he offers stand-alone quests that require Ezio to go after his four war machines in order to lessen the Borgia's military strength. While getting to each of Leonardo's inventions might seem a bit repetitive at times, the objective following locating the machine is always exceptionally diverse. No two missions to destroy Leonardo's inventions are the same.Finally, I  saved the best implementation for last. The Assassin's Guild. Ezio is eventually able to recruit civilians, and train them up by sending them on their own quests, to become assassins. Once they have been obtained, they can be called upon to assist Ezio in combat so long as they are not deployed on a mission. While they are extremely powerful, I thought it was a lot of fun to recruit and train them, and I guarantee that you will likely feel the same.Controls: If I am not mistaken, the controls are entirely identical to the setup in Assassin‚Äôs Creed II. You still cannot re-arrange your buttons, though I guarantee that playing with a gamepad will be much more friendly than playing with a mouse and keyboard.Like the previous establishments, Brotherhoods targeting remains a bit on the tricky side. You can‚Äôt ever be 100% certain that you will hit your target, but it is something that can still be worked around. However, from time to time you might still end up changing your camera angle, and inadvertently kill a civilian or something, oops!Graphics: Brotherhood offers beautiful graphics that focus heavily on its environment. Virtually every area has been polished to reflect the games atmosphere. I‚Äôve said it a million times before, and I‚Äôll say it again: It is really hard to nit-pick this aspect of the game, because the visuals are so fine-tuned.Sound: Having played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations - It is my firm opinion that Brotherhood offers the best of music and voice tracks. Ubisoft continues to uphold the tradition of combining dramatic scores of music to assassinations, making the experience more enjoyable for the player. Subtitles are still an option, and a huge help when it comes to fully understanding what is being said - I encourage you to use them for your own benefit. As always, the sounds only add to the atmosphere of the game, and in the case of Brotherhood: It is extremely well done.Replay Value: In my own opinion, Brotherhood has the highest replay value in the entire series. It introduces so many miscellaneous objectives, that the game never truly feels boring. While replay value is entirely dependent on the player, I am confident enough to say that any fan of Assassin‚Äôs Creed will want to play this one again.			",83,20,0,36,0,0,0

												It's been a while since I've revisited a relic of my younger days that used to keep me up late. It's only been 7 years since this game came out. My lack of age is really showing right now, isn't it?Yeah, I'll admit it, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an old favorite of mine. My first game for my PlayStation 3 was Assassin's Creed and this girl in my class let me borrow every subsequent AC release. I even asked her out. She said no. I'm a lonely man. Anyways, let's review this game!Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place exactly right after Assassin's Creed II, both in Desmond's and Ezio's storyline. Desmond is being hidden in a new location while the Templars keep hunting him and his Assassin gang down, while Ezio realizes the consequences of NOT killing the main villain of the last game and has to fight his much more evil and powerful son.The story in Brotherhood is... alright. There are some highlights here and there like saving ""Jesus"" from being crucified, disguising yourself and your battalion as French soldiers to infiltrate a fort, and especially the final level in Spain are some real stand-outs. But the interweaving drama between these climactic moments is pretty dull. It's like Lifetime entertainment's take on what ""drama"" is. For some reason Claudia hates Ezio and La Volpe randomly doesn't trust Machiavelli. These subplots come out of nowhere and are so easily solved it makes you wonder why they were problems in the first place.While the story isn't A-grade material, what always attracted me to Brotherhood and had me replay it three times (yes, this is my third time playing this bloody game in 7 years), was Rome. This is, in my opinion, one of the best Assassin's Creed sandbox locations in their whole library. If anything even comes close to Rome, I'd say it's the Carribbean Sea from Black Flag, but that's a debate for another time and place. Rome has some real atmosphere to it. Rome feels like a dead city with real culture that's had a new culture come by and forcibly build their own monuments and villages on top of it. The poor live in the ruins of Roman architecture while the wealthy live in their Italian villas within the main city. Rome feels very interconnected and the music that changes whenever you go to different sections of the map gives the sandbox a truly unique flow. This is one of the most alive sandboxes I've ever played in an open world game.Of course, a great sandbox doesn't carry a game. And, unfortunately, this is one of the greater faults of Brotherhood. As a sequel to Assassin's Creed II it doesn't do a whole lot to improve the gameplay as a new installment. You can ride horses inside cities, maintain your own brotherhood, and have a new plethera of gadgets and gizmos at your disposal... but the core gameplay isn't changed that much so the new features feel really tacked on and make the game a f***-ton easier.The new counter system breaks any challenge in combat you could ever have in these games. It ranks weapons in stores like there's a difference between weight, power, and deflection but you can kill the same amount of guards in a fight with just your bare fists because of the counter system. If you kill one guard you can chain kills until everyone lies dead around you. Where's the challenge in that? Where's the fun?The Brotherhood mechanic also takes away a lot of potential fun. You can now train assassins to go across the globe and perform various tasks... that you can't watch. And when they return you can have them kill your targets for you. But, again, where is the fun in that?That being said, the micromanaging you do through Rome by maintaining your Brotherhood, buying out businesses and ruins, and going on various side-quests always managed to latch its talons deep into my brain. There's something about mindlessly running around and performing small tasks to accomplish a greater good that makes me forget about how mundane and terrible my own life is, and then I don't have to worry about the swirling abyss that is my inevitable death and I... oh god... no... NO! NOT AGAIN!*ahem* Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a precursor of what was to come to this franchise that has been slowly drained by Ubisoft to this day. They keep thinking that ""innovation"" is just ""adding some more sh** on top of the formula"" and it works in this game. Assassin's Creed II was more like the child in the front of the class that took notes and got a fair B for its great effort, while Brotherhood is sitting in the back and just follows its friend's lead by barely scraping away with a C. And that's pretty much was Brotherhood is. Good... but not as good as Assassin's Creed II. A decent experience that has lost its charm and magic it used to have over me as these years have passed. I'm giving Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood a 6/10.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												This game is beyond words. I can't describe nor explain the depth it brings to the franchinse. In order to really get a sense of how the game works, you must play it. I bought this game cause I once had a PS3 but had to sell it and I never got the chance to beat it on my PS3. The lairs of Romulus were my favorite! The Da Vinci DLC was beyond anything I have ever played. Every penny I saved up to buy this game was worth it and I highly recommend it to anyone.			",17,0,0,1,1,0,0

												It's that time of year again, suiting up in your best hooded outfit, cutting open a pair of black stockings, taping a butter knife to each hand and lurking around the neighborhood looking for Templar's to slay.  Ah, the memories of jumping out at the purse snatcher and jamming the butter knife directly into his ribcage..  The sweat dripping off my bald head, my heart pounding.. my face hitting the ground as I realized I'm not Enzio and the man I just jammed in the stomach is 6'3 and close to 300 pounds.. After a nice nap, I woke up in the hospital.. Not one to feel discouraged, I vowed to get revenge on that over sized Neanderthal.  After all he had knocked out my front tooth.. Enough about that..  It's time to talk about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, or as I like to call it Assassin's Creed 2.5.  The Story:  Brotherhood picks up the story after the second game.  Enzio returns to Monteriggioni after he successful retrieved the Apple.  He returns to a hero's welcome, and numerous offers of ""ahem"" favors from the local town woman.  Our resident playboy settles for a night with Caterina Sforza.  All is going well for Enzio, he's a hero, he's gotten his revenge, he's got himself a sexy MILF, he's going to live happily ever after...  Since this is a game, we all figured out this wasn't going to happen..  Que the music...   (puts on Hammer Time by MC Hammer)  After some vigorous relations with Caterina Monteriggioni is attacked by a new Atagonist Cesare Borgia.  Needless to say the attack left Mario dead and Monteriggioni in shambles..  Guess a relocation is in order.Left with nothing Enzio is tasked with rebuilding the Assassin Brotherhood, while at the same time getting justice against the Borgia clan and reclaiming the apple once more..  This time around the game takes place in Roma.. better known as Rome, a very large and vibrant city.  You'll meet numerous people in your travels and back yet again is everyone's favorite painter and cheapskate Leonardo Di Vinci,The Gameplay:  If you've played Assassin's Creed 2, you know fully what to expect in Brotherhood, the few additions to take note of..  Money serves a fair larger role in Brotherhood, gone is the building of a city, now you are tasked with rebuilding an entire City-State.  You gain revenue from the various businesses and landmarks that you purchase.  A new feature are the Borgia Towers, which have replaced many of the view points.  You need to kill the Guard Captain, then make your way up the Borgia tower to set it ablaze.  As you take out Borgia towers you reduce the Borgia's power and open up new businesses and landmarks that you can buy.  Another awesome idea is building of the Assassin Brotherhood, you can recruit assassins..  The more Borgia towers you control the more assassins you can own..  I believe the max is 10.  Also this time around various guilds exist which allow you to climb their ranks (although aside from dropping the price to hire the various helpers (courtesans, mercenaries or thieves I didn't notice any other benefits).   You can send your Assassins away on contracts of various difficulties, these earn the assassins experience, and money for you.  Occasionally you'll be rewarded with items as well. The Combat:  Not much has been changed from the second game. The few changes are as follows.. You gain access to a crossbow!!!  A nice ranged weapon which allows you to silently kill enemies from afar.  Unlike the gun which makes noise and attracts attention, the Crossbow is silent and quite deadly.  Unarmed combat includes a few new animations for unarmed kills, such as a curb stomp, and neck breaking.  You can also chain kill this time around, which is very useful for those times when you are surrounded by 8 or 9 enemies, after you execute the first enemy, you can immediately focus and execute another without the need to fight them, repeat this as much as possibly until you need to counter attack.  The biggest change over all is the ability to call your Assassins into combat, or order them to take out guards.  Instead of having to get your hands dirty and risk tipping off the guards, you send in your crew, they clean up the guards then run off..   This is the single biggest game changer about brother hood..  Nothing beats having an army of 7 - 8 buffed up assassins at the ready for any of those large scale battles (although only about 3 - 4 of these battles exist unfortunately)The conclusion... If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed 2, you'll enjoy Brotherhood.  While the game itself feels like a rather large expansion, it has enough meat and potatoes to stand on it's own.  So buy it, enjoy it..

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a parkour beat'em up adventure game. On the run from Abstergo, Desmond further explores his ancestor Ezio's memory to find where he had hidden the Apple of Eden, bringing him to the Papal Wars when he settled in Rome to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood and oppose the Templars that controlled the Vatican.Pros: Once again improves on the previous one, introducing new mechanics early and giving a coherent reason for starting from scratch. Replaced multiple medium maps by one large open world: Rome and the surrounding countryside and villages, which you assist in rebuilding by investing in it. Looting enemies now gets you ammunition, more money, and actual loot which can be sold or traded to unlock equipment. The near-future is also more relevant, as Desmond can log out of the Animus and interact more with Lucy and the others. Oh, and another WTF ending!Cons: Rome is a clusterfrak to parkour in: streets zigzag incoherently while rooftops are so uneven it's faster to just run on the floor than climb up and down all the time. The loot you get is mostly clutter you'll sell, only a few of which you'll use to unlock stuff. Graphics didn't see much change at all. The last Ezio chapters are rushed.Verdict: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ - Next on your list!Great sequel to Assassin's Creed II, but it's basically ""more of the same"" with some light improvement and more story. Don't play without playing the previous one first, and if you did like the previous one, you'll love this one, too!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThis was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Pros:- Has everything you would want and expect from an Assassin's Creed game. - Lots of assassination tools at your disposal: medicine, poison, smoke bombs, throwing knives, crossbow bolts, and bullets.Cons:- Really easy game. I could take lots of enemies head on if I wanted to, but I shouldn't be able to because I'm supposed to be a stealthy assassin.- Can't skip the 15min ending credits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As my personal favorite of the series, Brotherhood perfects and expands upon many of Assassin's Creed 2's features. Riding through town, fast-travel points within the city, kill streaks, brutal new animations and mission-replayability are some of its many improvements, fixing a few negativities I found in the previous game.Instead of just rebuilding his family villa, Ezio is tasked with liberating a Borgia-oppressed Rome and bringing it to its former glory, with the help of not only a few old friends, but of a new Brotherhood as well. Assist citizens in need and watch them rise through your ranks, ultimately shaping Master Assassins to aid you in your quest. The main antagonist is ambitious, vicious and ruthless, stopping at nothing to achieve his goals, which, in turn, make his every appearance exciting.Unlike former entries, Brotherhood offers a wide variety of interesting side quests, such as excellent tombs to explore, advanced war machines to destroy and templar agents to silence, even though they mask the rather short length of the main story. Rome is filled with great sights, which help make every area feel distinct from the last, and, for the avid completionists, accomplishing eveything didn't feel as great a chore as Assassin's Creed 2 did, although the reasons for that may vary according to each player.Completionist Playthrough: 36 hours ",29,4,0,10,2,0,2

												Although the core gameplay of the Assassin's Creed franchise remains undoubtedly fun, enjoying AC:Brotherhood is made more difficult by an excessive amount of grinding and minutiae. Despite the lively environments, the game desperately cries out for an improved fast-travel system; at least half of the game is spent running between the start points of the various missions, which quickly becomes tiresome. The game is further padded out by a heavy reliance on collectibles which rarely offer any benefit even if you do catch them all. The conspiracy-laden plot that stretches imagination at times (if /everybody/ is involved in the secret conspiracy, how can they claim nobody knows about it?). The graphics were too subdued and could have used a splash more color; another victim of the ""real is brown"" design school. And a host of bugs and gameplay issues - including a flaky camera, AI scripting problems and a finicky jumping mechanic that far too often had me leaping to my doom rather than at the obvious target right in front of me - did nothing to improve things. On the other hand, the combat system was well done, with excellent and numerous animations, as was the parkour climbing that is the heart of the game. The level design were interesting, if too beige, and the voice-acting was excellent. Brotherhood shows that the Assassins Creed franchise remains enjoyable, even if it is growing a bit long in the tooth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Note: As of now, this review covers only the single player portion of the game.Assassin's Creed II was, for all intents and purposes, the game the original wanted to be but fell short of, do to a variety of reasons perhaps most largely its own incredible ambition. With the sequel, Ubisoft managed to monumentally improve virtually every aspect of the series, giving us a tightly wound narrative, a charismatic lead, and refined mechanics that came together for one of the best games of the last few years. Following up this achievement is Brotherhood, arriving barely a year after the first and on the surface seeming little more than a retread of what we already saw, and an easy cash grab before a full fledged sequel can be made. In some ways this is accurate, as Brotherhood in many ways is incredibly similar to its predecessors, but to call it anything less than an entire new experience would be a disservice, as for how short a time it had in the oven it's just as large and engrossing as the games that came before it, while also adding an assortment of excellent new mechanics that push the game forward even when it occasionally stumbles in the wake of critical acclaim. Being a direct sequel, Brotherhood picks up mere moments after the end of II, with the surprising (arguably convoluted) events that transpired still fresh in Ezio's mind though it would appear he has finally arrived at a moment of peace after all his struggles. Of course nothing good ever lasts long, and it doesn't take long for his enemies to catch up with him, kill yet more of what little family he has left, and send Italy tumbling into chaos, leaving you to pick up the pieces (though for once you aren't alone).After the fantastic birth to assassin story of II, Brotherhood's more traditional tail of revenge mixed with some incomprehensible supernatural elements never quite manages to achieve the same level of intrigue and pacing. Though perfectly solid and enough to drive the experience, aside from the first and last few hours it meanders through much of its plot, spiraling off into dozens of disconnected tangents that feel more like side missions than an overarching narrative which left me feeling rather disengaged with everything that was happening. By the end I had lost the investment I previously had in these characters, and simply wanted it all to wrap up in a way that somehow made it all pull together, which again it unfortunately failed to. This isn't to say that Brotherhood isn't entertaining, or that the story is terrible, but it lacked the sense of urgency and tightness that exuded from every moment of II and came off a tad rushed.Thankfully, Brotherhood plays incredibly well, taking everything that worked with II and adding in enough fresh elements and interesting mission types to be just as engaging. The most readily apparent change is that of the scenery, moving away from Venice and into the sprawling city of Rome. It's a far larger environment, that feels more alive than ever thanks in part to the expanded town building system which now encompasses the whole of the city, allowing you to renovate shops and tunnels to provide income, more areas to purchase items, and fast travel across the map. It also makes it easier to feel invested in the city as you see it build up around you with each new renovation. It's a huge world to explore, yet every inch of it is packed with an enormous amount of things to do, leaving little idle space and a never ending stream of missions the vast majority of which are surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable.As the name implies, Brotherhood no longer sees you fighting alone but instead building up an army of assassins which you can then send on contracts and call in when you need aid. It's a tad underdeveloped in its current state, but it nonetheless greatly changes how you can approach an encounter, as often times calling in assassins which can pop out of anywhere is far less risky than attempting to get close to a target yourself. They also work as convenient distractions, and add a layer to encounters that feels especially needed when the combat is still trapped in a fairly dull design that despite numerous cool kill animations never became very fun and was best avoided whenever possible.Other minor tweaks in takedowns, platforming, and general movement add some noticeable refinement to the series core gameplay, though there are still moments when the camera will freak out or the free running system will send you jumping randomly completely in the wrong direction. Animations in particular continue to stick out to me as incredibly well done, with Ezio in particular moving with as much grace and fluidity as you'd expect from an assassin. Lastly Jasper Kyd's original score is utterly gorgeous and sets the mode strikingly well at every moment, as if his music is deeply tied into the world and speaking to you as you traverse it.Despite its narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is by no means the sloppily churned out annualized rubbish it very well could be, instead a brilliant successor to what I would consider an utter masterpiece, and a remarkably well crafted game on its own measures. If you've yet to touch the series this certainly isn't the place to jump in, but if you were left wanting more after II, Brotherhood will certainly satisfy and then some.			",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

												The best about this game is just the simpleness yet its still very inovating. I liked the Assassin recruits and those challenges that you can do with them. What I also like is just the concept of the time. Great game.			",37,1,0,3,2,0,1

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.The game is superb in every aspect and worth your time. Play it if you like Historic Action Adventure. UBI-Soft made some great improvements in gameplay story and graphics over the time and AC Brotherhood is best among the series up-till now.The game is so much alive like you are living in real life, Amazing Graphics and details.Story is really improved in this part as well as gameplay managing all the other assassins, traveling in the city, helping people, completing the story line(Which keeps getting better and better) all of them really cast a spell on you so that you keep playing it and don't want to leave your PC until you completed everything.This game shows that how hard game developers are working to make perfect/good games for you.

												Fantastic addition to Assassin's Creed. Great story and setting revolving around Ezio in Rome, aguably the best character and story in the whole series. Not much different from AC2, but for me, that's a good thing. You can ride horses in cities, call them from anywhere, recruit assassins to your brotherhood, carry double-handed weapons, use parachutes, and play with Leonardo's war machines. Also has a few nice flashbacks to Florence and Venice. A few glitches and hiccups here and there, but the setting is otherwise stunning. Beautiful graphics and visuals, combined with a killer soundtrack, makes 16th century Rome look very enticing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Single-player:You got new location - it's Rome, weps from Assassin's Creed II and few new: instant poison and arbalest (same time here we are can select battle tactics), long story and big open world, good graphic (for me graphic from Assassin's Creed II was looks to much better). Much cute girls like at Assassin's Creed II (‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ls <3 which can fallow you :3).Here we are got again Leonardo da Vinci. Will got much interesting quest from him.I Love Italy <3 But location at Rome for me is bored.Multiplayer:Assassin's Creed Brotherhood it's first game of Assassin's Creed which got multiplayer.

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore in a single huge city (Rome) that is dotted with hills, ruins, narrow streets and platforming opportunities aplenty. The twin stories of Ezio and Desmond are some of the most effective in the Ezio trilogy. Marred by some poor keyboard & mouse platforming controls and bad implementation of v-sync, but there is controller support. If you‚Äôve enjoyed other Assassin‚Äôs Creed games, this is a must-own. Uplay is required.You can view the opening of the game here.Total size on my hard drive: 11GBNote: If you are new to Assassin‚Äôs Creed games and wondering where to start, I‚Äôd recommend Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, not Brotherhood.Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Brotherhood picks up right where Assassin‚Äôs Creed II left off: Ezio is in Rome, having just fought the previous game‚Äôs final boss, and Desmond et. al. are on the run after having their hideout crashed by Abstergo. Having completed the battle in Rome, Ezio returns to Monteriggioni to have sexy times with Catarina Sforza, only to have the idyll interrupted by Cesare Borgia laying siege to the fortress. After it falls, Ezio and his family flee to Rome, determined to destroy the Borgia‚Äôs near-complete control of the city‚Äôs districts, and rebuild the Assassins (and Rome) in the process. Several popular characters return; Catarina as previously mentioned, Leonardo, Claudia and Maria Auditore, and Machiavelli. Rodrigo Borgia has a few brief scenes as well, but the primary antagonist is Rodrigo‚Äôs son, Cesare. Now, instead of only upgrading your headquarters, Ezio is buying and refurbishing shops (and landmarks) all over Rome. Completing all the ‚ÄúSons of Romulus‚Äù lairs unlocks a special dagger and armor. Completing memories with full synchronization unlocks hidden (‚Äúrepressed‚Äù) Ezio memories of Cristina Vespucci‚Äôs fate. Leonardo is a minor character in the main game, but gets an entire DLC to himself (which is included). The Copernicus DLC is also included in the game files, but isn‚Äôt accessible to PC players without a mod (search the Steam forums). Add in the huge amount of loot found throughout the game which is used to unlock unique items at shops, the Animus ‚Äútraining mode‚Äù which is an arcade for honing your combat skills, and there is a wealth of content in Assassin‚Äôs Creed Brotherhood.The combat is the largest improvement to Brotherhood over the previous games. The addition of the chain-kill mechanic allows for the rapid dispatch of hordes of enemies. Combat in general flows quicker and smoother in the hands of a skilled player. A strange step backward, though, is the inability to use secondary weapons (like the pistol or crossbow) without selecting them in the weapon wheel first. Also, if you have a secondary weapon selected, doing a hand-focused act ‚Äì like tearing down wanted posters ‚Äì switches the weapon selection to unarmed. And the platforming was clearly designed for a controller. It‚Äôs doable with a keyboard and mouse, but not always intuitive. Expect Ezio to occasionally leap to his death without explanation.The graphics are among the best of the earlier Assassin‚Äôs Creed games (Revelations‚Äô are better, but are also much more demanding). Maxing Brotherhood‚Äôs graphics settings and hitting 120fps at 1080p proved an easy task (I have an R7 260X graphics card). Texture quality, detail, light, and reflections are the biggest advances over Assassin‚Äôs Creed II. Brotherhood is marred, however, by the poor implementation of vertical-sync: turning it on results in horrific frame-rate micro-stutter. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a fix, other than not turning v-sync on. Setting v-sync on in the Radeon Crimson settings didn‚Äôt help, either.These are small drawbacks, though. With swift and deadly combat, tons of things to do, and great stories, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic second part of the ‚ÄúEzio trilogy‚Äù of games. A superb sequel and a great game in its own right. It discounts quite low, too, so if you‚Äôre a fan of Ezio or Assassin‚Äôs Creed in general, there is no reason not to get it.

												While biased towards the series and this game in particular. This is still my favorite installment in the Assassin's Creed series so far and still keeps in tradition with a big open map (although there are areas blocked up until a certain point in the game), easy, fun combat, a cinemeaticstory, and lots of activities and challenges. It continues Ezio's story right after the end of AC2 as well as continuing Desmond's story (modern times). I very much recommend this installment.			",538,66,47,53,10,4,15

												First of all Ubisoft failed at Mac-ing this game, WARNING: Mac Users Do Not Buy This Easily!!! Check System requirements!!I have mavericks and it took a long time to fix it, I had to replace several things including the game launcher. After I fixed AC brotherhood, it was quite awesome. A delicate open world stealth game, with graphics better than the games made in 2014, and of course frustrating parkour that makes u look cool.  Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore Da La La La in Rome, with intense main storyline, and lots and lots of side missions. Once again I have to warn mac users that before you buy this game think twice, or you can add me on steam, i'll tell you how to fix it.			",27,1,0,3,1,0,0

												The third game in the Assassin's franchise, Brotherhood, introduces Ezio to well uhm the Brotherhood! The first few games of the franchise are the best in my own opinion, as they introduce a very interesting and different approach to the everyday game. Brotherhood stands out to its predecessors due to the fact that you can train other assassins and send them out to do missions. + Interesting storyline with real life-inspired facts+ Parkour and freerunning over the roofs or Rome+ Great progression of protagonist (he 'ages' as you play)+ Still has the Assassin's Creed vibe to it- The Uplay business is bearable but quite annoying- No Steam Achievements- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- Some missions can be really frustratingPersonal Ranking: 8/10 ",468,210,14,42,30,6,43

												Like the rest of the series, Brotherhood is a great game and maintains the best parts of the previous two games.  However, the sheer size of the map this time somewhat takes away from the experience.  It's good for a sandbox-type game to be large and varied, but when it gets to the point where you're running for 15 minutes of gameplay, you get bored quicker than you otherwise would.

 Introduction Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes placed in the 21st century.You play as Ezio Auditore, who is wiser and older than his previous game.This game is the second chapter of three in the ""Ezio Trilogy.""Continuing the story of Ezio, you innovate in new fighting techniques as you restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed Brotherhood's main source of gameplay in missions is generally tailing your target.Not much different from the second game.You can now have your own Assassins do tasks for you, or help you in battles. Combat The advancements that this game brings over it's predecessor would be smoother combat from what I can tell.There are more movements in your combat fighting, and enemies will fight correctly, unlike the other games.Overall pretty similar to the previous game, though has a few minor changes.StoryContinues from the second game, and is pretty interesting.You're trying to get back the piece of Eden, while taking down Templar leaders.Completing various tasks to cripple the Borgias', to slowly restore Rome to it's former glory. Graphics They're pretty good, with some nice lighting and overall a pretty massive improvement over the second game.Colors are nice, and no SweetFX was needed to correct or, give more color.I played in 4K DSR 60fps maxed, and the game looked quite nicely, aside from the low textures. Optimization Optimization has improved from the previous games, though there are some issues still.Frame rate jumps around 55-60fps constantly, and will occasionally drop down to sub 40s.My PC is very powerful, and should be able to run this game without a problem. Bugs Not optimized.Occasional invisible spots that you can't walk through. Personal Experience I've played this game a few times, well mostly.I completed half the game twice, to have my save get wiped from switching computers.After restarting and finishing the game, I enjoyed it aside from the very annoying tailing missions. Pros Interesting continuation.Great voice acting and character models.Good graphics. Cons Poor performance.Micro-stutters.Tailing missions. Conclusion If you played Assassin's Creed II, this is a must play as it's a two part game.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Continuing my revisiting of the Assassin's Creed franchise, here comes AC: Brotherhood! Having previously played this game on the PS3 when it launched back in 2010, I can say it was a fun revisit! Gameplay speaking, this Assassin's Creed ""2.5"" adds more mechanics for playability, you can recruit assassins to join the Assassins' cause.Brotherhood continues the trilogy story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and now focus solely on Rome. The city is big, really big to explore. Although, even if it is quite big, I much preferred the different locations in AC2 than ""only being in Rome"". There is a tons of collectibles in this game... too many for my taste. 101 Borgia Flags does unlock you the Borgia Cape, which sets the notoriety permanently at none. Same effects occurs if you completely rebuild Rome with renovations, you unlock the Auditore Cape. I had the Auditore Cape on my PlayStation 3 playthrough and it was satisfactory to go on a rampage without being chased by guards all the time. But you're more than likely to unlock that cape quite late in the game which makes it almost pointless.PROS:+Strong narrative, both in the present with Desmond Miles and in the Animus, Ezio Auditore da Firenze.+Graphically improved compared to AC2 albeit contains visual glitches at times.+Soundtrack is excellent and again, composed by Jesper Kyd.+Same as AC2, the voice acting is solid.+Improved combat system.+More weapons and you can now carry heavy weapons.+Recruiting and using assassins on targets.+Multiplayer ain't my fort√© in the AC franchise, but it is very original nonetheless.+Ability to replay missions.+High replay value.CONS:-Uplay DRM.-Horrendous WASD keyboard + mouse scheme. Play this game with a gamepad! (I played Brotherhood with the Xbox One controller and it worked without any issues).-AC: Brotherhood feels like a big filler and not a proper sequel or expansion.-Silly timer on pretty much every assassination missions. Very irritating!-Some stupid requirements during missions like to not be seen or it causes desynchronisation.-Draw distance in this game seems broken at times, especially when you see guards appearing right in front of you, i.e.-Rome pretty much looks like the same anywhere you go in Italy.-Steep learning curve for the Multiplayer mode.-The cliffhanger ending is very irritating.-Too many collectibles... however, once seen in Eagle Vision, it sticks on your map for later acquisition.-Annoying ""Full synchronisation"" on missions / side-missions that don't do anything except unlock Trophies (PS3) or Achievements.OVERALL:Brotherhood ain't perfect for sure. But if you loved previous AC games, you'll enjoy this game very much. If you're a newcomer in the AC franchise, you could love this game a lot as well but you're gonna feel lost in the story. My best advice, you better play the previous games or at least, get informed by reading / watching wikia and videos online or you're gonna feel completely off the track!This game adds a few great mechanics which is always welcomed. Although, I felt this game to be more of a filler than a sequel / expansion. It is a good filler that is well paced... right until the very end scene which leaves you in a cliffhanger!RECOMMENDATION:Yes, I highly recommend this game for anyone loving this playstyle. The story is very interesting and you feel quite engaged with it as much as the past and the future events. My favorite AC game so far is still AC2 but Brotherhood continues on the same premise so you won't feel lost when playing it.RATING:8.0 / 10And now, going to revisit AC: Revelations...

												The missions are much more varied than in AC2 and they added some pretty neat new gameplay mechanics, like the assassin scholars for example. On top of that, every mission now has a secondary objective you can complete for 100% synchronisation, which adds a fun extra challenge. The gameworld is not as interesting, mainly since you only have one city instead of the 4 featured in AC2.Also, in order to buy something at a shop, or unlock a fast travel location, you first have to liberate the district by lighting a heavily guarded tower on fire, and then buy the shop. You have to do this for EVERY shop in the game, which is incredibly annoying. This annoyance is however balanced out by the fact that you don't have to go all the way back to the villa every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing time you want to deposit your feathers or collect your income.In order to get the best items in the shop, you have to collect specific items of vendor trash that are dropped by enemies and are found in chests. Luckily this is completely optional, since just like in AC2 you get the best armor in the game for free by completing enough freerunning levels.(Aside, someone needs to find the guy who thought it was a good idea to have sudden switches to a fixed camera in the middle of timed jumping puzzles, and grant him a swift punch in the stomach)The combat is a lot easier, since the window for counterattacking is a lot bigger and you can chain counterkills. There are also more ranged weapons and if you're lazy you can just press one button and let your assassins murder everyone for you while you sit on a bench nearby watching the fight while eating popcorn.As for the story, there is a lot less character development for Ezio, but the game does have way more interesting villains,  and there is a fantastic subplot concerning a conflict between the assassins themselves about halfway through. Especially Bartholomeo, Machiavelli and La Volpe get some nice character development. Overall, the pros and cons compared to AC2 pretty much balance eachother out, and it is definately worth buying.			",183,23,7,17,23,2,8

												It seems a majority of these negative reviews aren't for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, but are for the Uplay client. When this game came out, Uplay was in it's infancy, and it has undergone many updates since. Uplay is completely stable these days and hasn't given me a single problem in about a year.Whenever I hear somebody say Assassin's Creed II is the best game of the series, I just want to tell them to replay it. It's glitchy and controls terribly, especially after being used to the updated control refinements that AC:III and Black Flag introduced. That being said, This game doesn't control as well as the aforementioned two games, but the controls are tighter and, overall, the intuitive nature of the parkour/jumping algorithms are significantly improved.The graphics, while not a drastic overhaul from its predecessor, are quite good and there seems to be more attention to detail in the texture work within the environment. Also the lighting is noticably superior.I would say the only thing that may be worse in this game than it's predecessor is the story. But that's only because everyone loves an origin story, which was the heart of the first game. Although, the villains in this installment are far more fleshed out and it's really fun seeing the family dynamic of the Borgia's play out.In conclusion, this is an A game that refines it's previous entries shortcomings and is really the peak of the Ezio trilogy, if not the entire Assassin's Creed franchise.

												The follow up of AC2. If you liked the way AC2 was build youre gona love this game. It takes the good parts from AC2 and adds even more to it. Like building youre own familiy of assassins to do work for you.And this is the 2th game of the history of Etzio one of the grates assassins.All in all if you likes AC2 this is a must have game.

												9.0/10 - Third Game, best in series so far!This game really takes this great series to another level. So many more things to do. You can tell they listen to feedback from past games. This game has more chase and stealth missions than the previous game. This is both frustrating and rewarding once you succeed. Timer is off some but it's a pretty lengthy game.Worth $20, buy for less Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. When beginning the game you start right where you left off in AC2. Without giving too much away you leave Rome only to return where the main game takes place. In Brotherhood a new mechanic was added that let you perform kill streaks much more easily. This new feature included easier kills and the ability to immediatly take out enemies one after another. This made combat a lot faster however it felt almost too easy. The city is quite large however it is lacking in actual buildings too parkour across once outside the region.Even though the main story was quite short it is made up for in the free dlc and side quests. Hope this review has helped you form an opinion on this game. :D			",34,6,0,4,3,1,3

												One of the better AC games. Good story, and good humor. Mechanics? Well, you will probably jump five hundred times when all you tried to do was climb up. Cart/carriage battles are just the bloody worst. And so on and on. But anyone who ever played AC games know this, and know that it's still worth it.			",112,27,0,14,8,0,3

												One of, if not the best, Assassin's Creed games ever made, Brotherhood brings us to Renaissance Rome, picking up where the second game left off. While there are a few dull and frustrating moments, mostly related to insane 100% sync requirements in some missions (looking at you, Hell on Wheels), the game is very well done and very worth the price when it's on sale. However, I'd only buy the deluxe edition these days if you REALLY want the two short single player missions, since multiplayer is very dead. If I were you, I'd just buy the base game.

												One of the games that I finished 100%.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood begins where the previous part ended. If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢: Director's Cut Edition first because of the story.Where to begin... History is playground.This game is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city. Brotherhood only gives a small extra to Assassin's Creed 2. I often felt this is AC2, but thanks to the small extras this is a step forward.Ezio is probably one of the best and well-written characters in gaming history, I was a little disappointed in AC2 last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to ""Rome"", which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican. Luckily Ubisoft finished what they begun, and we got a beautiful ancient Rome.This is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters' life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore ""the truth"". You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.All things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassin's Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it. Even it with Uplay.			",302,70,7,15,26,3,55

												It falls short of Assassin's Creed 2, but It was better than Assassin's Creed Revelations and Assassin's Creed 3.In terms of gameplay it takes the same formula of Assassin's Creed 2 and refresh it.In terms of plotline, well, think of it as a really big stand-alone expansion to ACII.In terms of graphics, they ain't the best, but when the game was released the graphics were top of the line.

												Better than Assassin's Creed 2. After playing this I started a rerun for the previous game and I feel that as a game experience, this one is a lot more solid and fun to play. Rome as a city feels better for the gameplay than Florence&Venice. Also concentrating only on one city, the game area becomes more familiar and yet has almost as much to offer as all the areas in AC2. Also the ""subplot"" makes now more sense, although it still takes only baby steps. Animus interface and controls are less akward and running in the roof tops seem more intuitive and fun. I still don't like the idea, that some areas are unreachable until advancement in the main plot, but atleast it isn't as annoying as in the previous game.If you are looking an entrance to the series, this might be the one to start with. Although the subplot might not make much sense, it does not do that even with previous games played. So you might just enjoy this games main plot and then think about getting the other games if you like. I took the bit harder road and purchased AC2 first and almost didn't buy this because the flaws in it. Now I'm glad I did buy this.			",192,41,1,16,12,4,50

Great characters, a lot of exploring and a bunch of collectibles for the ""extra challenge"".The only negative that you might see others mention: Uplay.... *sighs*But get it and enjoy it! :) Overall very smooth!

												Technically the third in the Assassin's Creed series, this expands even more the realm of the assassin including forming and recruiting for an assassin guild (single player mode). If you love stealing from the poor, you should probably be a politician, if you love murdering guards and politicians, you should probably be locked behind bars, if you love doing both then this game is for you.My favorite part, you can now kick someone in the nads until they die...I just can't stop laughing			",523,101,40,73,65,3,76

												Wow, this game is only that tiny bit different to Assassin's Creed II and maybe it is only the fully clothed sexscene that got me into buying this one... nah, just kidding. It was the Return of Ezio Auditore aka manlyman who came to rescue the day and place some punchlines (with blades I mean).This game seems to go out to the unreachable guys and gamers that like to play other games like GTA San Andreas or True Crimes: Streets of LA. I can not think of any other reason why they should name this one Brotherhood, x-capt for your crip in which you be hustling together with the girls of the streets and 5-fingers of the subs when you are going to kick some dog's who go by their crip of the Wolfpack - Yo (Sorry, I got no idea where this is going)9/10 Assassin attack!

												Wonderful game. Beautiful graphics (with improved faces) and long lasting, open world gameplay. The game has some great new additions as well, in comparison to ACII. Running around also feels more natural this time.I continued playing this even after I finished it, and I don't do that very often. The multiplayer is great as well, very tense.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Retrospective ReviewAC:Brotherhood while a good game is a bit disappointing in a few ways. So after the so called ‚ÄúGods-Not-Gods‚Äù you interact with at the end of AC 2, Brotherhood picks up shortly after that moment in what will become a tireless exercise for the series. The tireless exercise is that from this point on, Assassin‚Äôs Creed drip feeds you it‚Äôs story. If you thought the story was moving at a snail's pace, well AC:Brotherhood moves a heck of a lot slower which unfortunately becomes a common occurrence in the series. This is completely frustrating and really an unforgivable indictment on the series. In present time, a some plot threads from AC 2 are just dropped and forgotten. In AC 2 you learn that Desmond starts seeing things from the Animus in the real world, like glimpses or ‚Äúghosts‚Äù of Acre, which then turns into a dream that controls much like an Animus session except without all the help of the Animus. In AC: Brotherhood, nothing like that ever happens. As a matter of fact it‚Äôs a plot point that is dropped to never be returned to again. This strikes me as Ubisoft redacting certain story elements that would then converge into a new story that would allow them to drip feed the story from game to game. Also the present story is rendered moot, because there is almost zero emotional ties to what is happening. In AC2 you learn that Desmond is sorry for the way he treated Lucy at Abstergo and that Lucy believes in him. In AC Brotherhood you get none of that. Just exposition piled on exposition and it‚Äôs quite unfortunate. Ultimately the only moment that moves our characters along in their respective arcs is the ending which tries to ape the crazy ending of AC2, but is a lot less successful. This ending doesn‚Äôt help anything at all. All it does is raise questions and answers none of the ones that were raised last time. At this point, the more I think about the state of the present story, the more it pisses me off. Look, the present story in AC1 and 2 wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about, but it did give us a hook to latch on to. We could empathize with the characters and hope that they would get out of this okay, but in Brotherhood and subsequent iterations  or at least in Brotherhood, there is nothing that moves their arcs in any direction and it‚Äôs downright frustrating. When it comes to Ezio‚Äôs story thankfully there‚Äôs a lot less inconsistencies although they are still there. It‚Äôs thoroughly enjoyable story that shows us the weakness‚Äô that the Assassins have. Ezio‚Äôs in particular. You see that he cares about people in a way others just don‚Äôt. It leads him to go out of his way to help his friends and comrades and make sure they make it out alright and he doesn‚Äôt leave them to just die. It endeared me to the character and makes him much more relatable. Also there is a lot less exposition, which helps. Lastly the inconsistencies are few, but still present. Ezio‚Äôs mother for example seems to have forgotten that half of her family has died. She is in a chipper mood and it just strikes me as unbelievable. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if the game took place years after the second, but it doesn‚Äôt it literally takes place right after the second. By the end of the second game, Ezio‚Äôs mother was talking again, but only slightly she was still mourning. In this game we see none of that, and I‚Äôm not saying that she should be completely depressed, but the fact that she is happy strikes me as odd. We are left to assume that she‚Äôs just over it, like the death of her family ‚Äúis sooo last year‚Äù. Okay you can see that it bothers me, but it‚Äôs true.The gameplay is where Assassin‚Äôs Creed Brotherhood suffers the most. It‚Äôs entirely playable, but it‚Äôs much the same as AC 2. If that bothers you then you probably won‚Äôt find much to like in this game beyond the story and environment. However, there‚Äôs no criticism I can give that you haven‚Äôt already heard a thousand times before, but what I can say is positive things. Yes, Positive! For one the A.I thankfully is far more consistent. In AC2 it felt like every other enemy I sneaked up to would turn around like I was making tons of noise. Now, for the most part they will only turn around if you are making a ruckus, now I said for the most part, unfortunately there are still times that enemies will turn around even if you sneak up to them and other times where they won‚Äôt see you whatsoever. Now the game adds some mechanics that I thought were pretty fine, but some reviewers seemingly lambasted the game for. You eventually pick up a crossbow that shoots as fast and as far as a gun. This is great for the rooftop excursions where I just shoot a guard so it won‚Äôt just start chasing me. Also there is the chain kill mechanic in where once you subdue a foe you can then kill others by just clicking the button which will turn into a one hit kill for each enemy until you are interrupted. All these things might take away from the challenge, but honestly if I got two more AC‚Äôs with AC2 controls I don‚Äôt care. It makes the game less frustrating and then more enjoyable. Now the last thing I want to touch on is optional objectives. Some people don‚Äôt like them, but I never had any trouble with them, which makes me wonder why people are complaining in the first place. I loved them, because it forced me to actually be an assassin. It was awesome, even if it kinda forces you on a scripted path. I enjoyed them and I personally think they are a great addition to the series. Now  when it comes to environments, it‚Äôs as always awesome. I have actually been to Rome once before and when I went to Coliseum in this game, it was cool just, how much it was like the real thing. That‚Äôs pretty much it. Rome is a beautifully rendered environment and Nuff said.My experience might be unique with my system, but if AC 2 gave you graphical performance issues then you are in for much of the same in AC Brotherhood. The game would drop frames out of nowhere and for one stretch was stuttering uncontrollably. It was incredibly annoying. So it pains me to say that AC Brotherhood is poorly optimized with the caveat, that it might be unique to my setup, maybe you might have more luck. On the plus side it never gets to the point where the game is just unplayable. Assassin‚Äôs creed Brotherhood is a double edged sword. It‚Äôs is technically a better game than AC2, but it also suffers from some of the same problems, but as well as some new ones. I do recommend the game and it is a good addition to the series, but not a great one.  I played about 62 hours I got 86% synchronization I unlocked ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1/Windows 10 computer When I switched to Windows 10 for the last 4 hours that I played the game, I didn‚Äôt come across the out of place        framerate drops.

Now the game adds some mechanics that I thought were pretty fine, but some reviewers seemingly lambasted the game for. You eventually pick up a crossbow that shoots as fast and as far as a gun. This is great for the rooftop excursions where I just shoot a guard so it won‚Äôt just start chasing me. Also there is the chain kill mechanic in where once you subdue a foe you can then kill others by just clicking the button which will turn into a one hit kill for each enemy until you are interrupted. All these things might take away from the challenge, but honestly if I got two more AC‚Äôs with AC2 controls I don‚Äôt care. It makes the game less frustrating and then more enjoyable. Now the last thing I want to touch on is optional objectives. Some people don‚Äôt like them, but I never had any trouble with them, which makes me wonder why people are complaining in the first place. I loved them, because it forced me to actually be an assassin. It was awesome, even if it kinda forces you on a scripted path. I enjoyed them and I personally think they are a great addition to the series. Now  when it comes to environments, it‚Äôs as always awesome. I have actually been to Rome once before and when I went to Coliseum in this game, it was cool just, how much it was like the real thing. That‚Äôs pretty much it. Rome is a beautifully rendered environment and Nuff said.My experience might be unique with my system, but if AC 2 gave you graphical performance issues then you are in for much of the same in AC Brotherhood. The game would drop frames out of nowhere and for one stretch was stuttering uncontrollably. It was incredibly annoying. So it pains me to say that AC Brotherhood is poorly optimized with the caveat, that it might be unique to my setup, maybe you might have more luck. On the plus side it never gets to the point where the game is just unplayable. Assassin‚Äôs creed Brotherhood is a double edged sword. It‚Äôs is technically a better game than AC2, but it also suffers from some of the same problems, but as well as some new ones. I do recommend the game and it is a good addition to the series, but not a great one.  I played about 62 hours I got 86% synchronization I unlocked ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1/Windows 10 computer When I switched to Windows 10 for the last 4 hours that I played the game, I didn‚Äôt come across the out of place        framerate drops.

												TL:DR - If you liked Assassin's Creed II, you'll more than likely like AC: Brotherhood.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the story of AC2 right where you leave off. After Ezio fails to assassinate the Borgia Pope, he receives the message for Desmond in the vault. Confused, he returns to Monteriggioni to live a life of peace. That is shortly disrupted when Cesare Borgia appears and lays siege to Monteriggioni in revenge for Ezio's attack on Rodrigo Borgia. Mario, Ezio's uncle, is killed, Ezio is injured, and he flees. Ezio wakes up in the suburbs of Rome, mysteriously healed, and given new Assassin gear. Ezio must now meet up with the Assassins (or what's left of them) in Rome and seek revenge. Not only does Ezio have to do this himself, he must rebuild the Assassin Order. To take on the Pope, you'll need more than just a single, skilled assassin.The gameplay is very similar to AC2. Same type of missions, but with a few extras. Leondardo was forced to build weapons of war based off of some of his most famous drawings and Ezio has to go destroy them to prevent the Templars from using them for their nefarious means. The game also keeps everything in the extremely expansive city of Rome, which feels like it's a much closer scale replica than the other maps. The game even allows you to ride horses to help make the trip around Rome much shorter (although I ended up running or using the sewers instead). The game also introduces Borgia Towers, which prevent you from restoring various areas of the city and gaining income from it. You have to kill the captain in charge of the area and then climb the tower and destroy it. It's a nice little minigame, so many of the towers are blocked off by invisible walls (or basically the restriction of Ezio's memories) so you have to wait to be able to clear them all. The game also gives you another powerful set of armor to retrieve by going through and clearing the lairs of the Followers of Romulus, a pagan cult controlled by the Templars. So much of the gameplay is recycled from the previous game that it feels more like an expansion to AC2 rather than its own game. Building up the Brotherhood was not as exciting as it sounds since you basically rescue some random citizen in the city, they join the cause, and then you send them on missions around the Mediterranean to level up and become full-fledged Assassins. They can also play a role in fights, if you want them to, but I rarely used them, since it wasn't necessary most of the time.The story is in the game is compelling, however, as the story shifts from Rodrigo Borgia, the Pope, to his son, Cesare. It is unclear if Cesare is really loyal to the Templar cause, however, and it kind also seems to distract from the primary Assassin vs. Templar showdown. In fact, that portion of the story doesn't advance very much and few new clues are given. The whole story revolves around Ezio regaining control over the Apple so it's not in the hands of the Templars or Cesare, who wants to use it for his own ends.But Rome seriously makes up for the lackluster gameplay. The scenery was amazing, the landmarks recognizable, and just being in the Eternal City was great for a hobby historian like myself. You find yourself getting lost in the winding streets of the city and learning more about its place in the Renaissance world was fascinating.Overall, I think it's not as good as AC2, but if you liked AC2 you'll still enjoy Brotherhood. Enjoy your trip to Rome and continue Ezio's legacy!			",252,59,1,63,72,4,91

												AC Brotherhood is on the same level of quality as AC 2. It improves on a lot of things from AC 2 and it is overall a masterpiece in design and execution but I personally prefer AC 2 because I think the story was slightly better and I preferred Venice and Florence over Rome for the setting but I still really love Rome in this game. Just like AC 2 the recreation of the city really makes the world feel real and the attention to detail is just outstanding. The combat is much improved from AC 2 with the kill streak mechanic they added and it overall just feels more natural and free flowing. The animations are so fluid and on point it‚Äôs great to look at. The way Ezio dodges each attack when he counters with the hidden blade and then just going seamlessly between enemy to enemy is masterfully done. The combat in this game is the best in the series and it slowly started going downhill after this game to the point where I started to dislike the combat by the time AC Black Flag came out. Soundtrack is beautiful and just as good as AC 2‚Äôs. They added so many new little features and tweaks to the overall gameplay and design (just like AC2 did from AC1) that it feels like a whole new experience and not more of the same like the franchise ended up being called out for later. When people say this game is their favourite in the franchise I can definitely see why. 9/10 (Amazing)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Finish AC2 and you'll know whether you want to play Brotherhood, which serves to extend the storyline and gameplay of its predecessor. As a fan of the epic nature of the series, Brotherhood was a satisfying experience, if somewhat tedious in parts (I found myself watching another screen while playing through the more mundane activities, and idled in-game for for several hours while AFK, waiting to earn income for city improvements), however by the end I was excited to continue the adventure in the ""Ezio"" trilogy finale Revelations.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) ",819,262,7,104,70,5,166

												This title expands to what Assassin's Creed II so great, but also takes a small step back. And that step back is for the better. ACII wanted to make everything bigger and better. They made a lot of things better as opposed to AC1, but some of the cities and locations felt very empty. In this title (which in my opinion should be could Assassin's Creed III: Brotherhood) the entire adventure takes place in Rome. It is gigantic and very well detailed. It looks way better then Assassin's Creed II and there are some subtle improvements to the gameplay of ACII.The Story is not as good as the last two games in the series. The ending is great and leaves you guessing. Ezio is now becoming a Master Assassin and thus recruits new Assassin's. You can call these brothers in arms into battle whenever you wish. Yes, it's a cheap and overpowered way to get yourself out of a tough fight, but I love the way these Assassin's come out of hiding places just like Alta√Ør or Ezio would. You bond with a lot of characters and I love that.In other words, did you play the wonderful Assassin's Creed II and you want to know the next chapter in the story? Brotherhood is a very safe purchase. Fun, beautiful and exciting! Love it.			",380,50,6,16,21,2,20

												AC Brotherhood is the sequel to the highly regarded Assassins Creed 2. While they didn't reinvent the wheel with this game, they certainly improved and enhanced it.Rather than the game taking place in multiple cities across Italy, AC:B takes place mostly in the city of Rome. However, Rome is by far the most detailed location in the game up to this point. You can upgrade local buisinesses in the world, take out guard outposts and burn them to the ground, and  run a local assassin guild you build from the ground up. Among many other things. The game is also noticeably harder and basically expects that you already played through AC2 before this one. It also features V/R missions like Metal Gear Solid so you can test your skills in the combat and stealth challenges. There's plenty to do in this game and the focus on side content is very noticeable.So if you liked AC2, AC:B is the next thing to check out. On the other hand if you haven't played AC2, or didn't really like it I don't recommend this one. It expects that you have already played through AC2 and apart from the setting and the inclusion of a few new weapons it's virtually the same game.

												WOW! there are no other words to describe this game it is fantastic. Set between 1499-1509 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring the 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve ""Borgia towers"" around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards.There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassin's Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, Co-Op and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect; The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more. I really recommend this for the mere fact that it's just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game. I absolutely cannot recommend this game to you enough it really is just absolutely outstanding. So once again I highly recommend that you get this game because I'm sure you won't regret it. I am definitely without even a single doubt 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood will not disappoint you!.			",211,18,1,20,8,2,27

PROS:+ awesome and long story+ good mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge map of Rome (4 districts)+ LOTS of side-quests+ main assassination missions+ Cristina side story+ extra content in The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC+ smooth combat with cool combos+ big weapon selectionCONS:- uPlay- really funky camera in some places- some annoying 100% requirements for missions- occassional graphical glitches- a couple of rare AI glitches- another cliffhanger endingComment:We continue our adventure with Ezio. While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money. Recommended!			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Uplay.I wish I could just put that in but I wont. So it was about 4am and i was a little tired. I went on steam and saw ubisoft having a sale and thought ""Why not buy assassin's creed?"" But of course I forgot about Uplay that comes with it on the pc. Basicly It is an add-on you have to download to play any ubisoft games and it is really annoying. I'm not trying to discourage assassins creed, it is a good game, brotherhood i've played on xbox and loved it, the same with black flag. But Uplay creates problems with gameplay.(Also takes up a bit of space in a Uplay folder it makes in your computer's Program files/x86.)  And it can be seen in all of ubisofts public reviews; 1.[i.imgur.com] : 2.[i.imgur.com]. This is part of the reason their games get poor reviews from the public due to non-needed add on's that make it hard to actualy get to the gameplay. (Example: EA's Origin or Rockstar's online social club.) If your going to buy a game from these companies I would strongly advise buying it on a Playstation or Xbox, but if your like me ond only like to use PC there isn't much to do about it.

												This PC Port is even better than ACII was. A Clearer picture, constant 60 FPS, and almost no game crashes has been so far my best experience on PC with an Ubisoft game that I've played outside of South Park: The Stick of Truth.Graphics: They are a step up from ACII, with more colors, a clearer picture, and more detail on everything from buildings and architecture to character models. Some common citizens as well as the new assassin recruits/their faces, however, look a little too low poly and low rez as far as the game world is around them, but this is just a minor concern. The game, for the most part, makes Rome look stunning, even by 2015 standards (if you have an open mind for older titles, anyway). I did have a weird problem with citizens/guards popping in right in front of me, as they took longer to load, and they scared the heck outta me when that happened, but this didn't take away much from my experience. Story/Plot/Setting: It picks up right where ACII leaves up and continues to be compelling and engaging. Ezio is still ever the charming personality. The people he interacts with are, for the most part, well written and interesting. Ezio continues to learn and grow as a character. The new assassin recruits make for an interesting side game as well as a great story mechanic. The side missions expand on the story even further, especially the Christina Memories. You spend more time as Desmond in this game than you did in ACII, but not enough to take away from the experience as Ezio. The ending is an interesting plot device to push the story even further and ends on an outrageous cliffhanger.Gameplay: It's the AC gameplay we all knew and loved from the 2nd game, with better platforming and new side missions. The Assassin recruits are simple to handle, though not very engaging. A lot of the side missions that you may or may not have loved, like contracts, races, the like, have returned. Collectibles have also returned. However there is a lack of the puzzles you did in ACII. The Romulus missions work similar to the Assassin Tombs in ACII, which I loved! I beat the game in 26 hours, about 4 hours shy of the time I spent in ACII, but if you're a completionist or enjoyed a lot of the side stuff that ACII had to offer you could easily spend more time than that with this game. There is also the ""investments"" in stores outside of buying them, but considering that the community has moved on to the newer titles, they don't really matter much. I did not play Multiplayer so I am not sure how well this game has retained a community but keep in mind this game was released in 2011. But I highly recommend playing this version if you have not played the series before. A shame that recommendation is harder to give for the final part of Ezio's story, Revelations. Stay tuned for that review once I finish the game.			",129,9,1,2,5,0,1

												Recommended! If you want some more of Ezio, that is what you gonna get.Let's see, its a very buggy game, not game breaking bugs but your gonna find yourself in situations where you expect the game to do something but you either freeze or the action your taking keeps repeating itself until you have the brains to turn your brain off for a few seconds and let go off your anger. Now to the good part, I very much keep enjoying the music, this time in only one city(Rome) so the game is very static in terms of music but it is a shorter game than Assasin Creed 2 so I was perfectly fine with it. 8/10 musicThe highlight of the game is again Ezio and Desmond, they are so damn awesome to follow around. They are not this amazing inspiring characther but they have the ability to make the journey from point A to B awesome.I cannot believe you guys killed X, I swear to god if Ezio or Desmond dies, there will be violence!Ps: The game could have done better connecting all the sidequest with the main story, I never got the chance to collect the ancient armour and now that the game is over I dont really care. That and it would have been cool if you had made us conquer some more Borgia towers like in one of those war games where you need to keep the city X colour and yu could win prizes by having X % of the city in your colour. It would make for a more insteresting game and longer without me finishing the game and be slapped with ""Here is 30 more hours of repatead free content that you already pay, dirty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•""Ps2: The game was too easy, if there was a dificulty change option then perhaps I made a mistake.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is what you come to expect from an AAA product. Granted it would be a daunting task to do a reasonable follow up to the ever-so-popular Assassin's Creed 2 however considering it's very slow and somewhat confusing start, stay with it as from sequence four onwards catapults this game into a newer dimension ‚Äì not as much as from Assassins Creed 1 to 2 however it's a total blast to play. For a newcomer for the series, if you can handle the spoilers, this game is a wonderful entry point as it has a lot to offer. Overall I felt Brotherhood is a better game than AC2 however without AC2, there's no Brotherhood.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews/2200-12597266/9 / 10			",729,439,34,169,129,5,186

												The successor is a worthy one, rife with changes.Heavy weapons can now finally be bought, allowing you to weild big swords and axes whenever you please. You'll just not use them on a horse.The setting is different now though. Largely, you'll spend your time in Rome. A confusing change. Not only for you, but your horse too it seems. Horse AI never needed to be very intelligent in past games, but here their intelligence' true nature seems to really surface. It's limited to silly situations, thankfully.However, being one city, Rome is one big city to be in. You'll be busy renovating stores and freeing districts from Borgia influence. Which partly is entwined in the story.That said, the story becomes quite a bit more interesting. A matured Ezio is becoming the driving force behind the goals of the Assassins, and will later on be able to command a handful of his own trainees. This forms a new method of approaching a problem. You'll have assassin signals assigned to you, which you can use to send one of your apprentices out of hiding, and attack your target.Or, when you have enough signals saved up with enough aprentices, you can launch an arrow storm attack, killing almost all hostile in the vicinity. These signals slowly replenish over time.If the story of AC2 engaged you, you will not be hard pressed to enjoy it here as well. Ezio is the child you've seen from birth, growing into a confident and strong man.			",467,55,7,42,17,3,37

												Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Brotherhood is a direct continuation of Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, in pretty much every sense. The story picks up exactly where the last one left off (both in the past and the present), and the game mechanics are more or less identical. In some ways, the need for this game to exist seems a bit unnecessary (i.e. it feels more like the result of a corporate mandate to make an annual franchise than a creative decision). That said, it‚Äôs forgivable if only for the fact that it‚Äôs just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Part of what feels forced is the contrived story revolving around Ezio losing his Apple of Eden and having to retrieve it. But there you go... it is what it is - basically, a flimsy excuse to move to a new setting and do more cool things with a well-loved character. The game takes place in the early 1500s, almost entirely in Rome. While that may sound like a reduced scope in setting from the prior games, it‚Äôs actually not. Rome is huge. Like, really huge. There are also a few other places that you get to explore in some of the main story missions as well, so there is plenty of variety in the environments. As usual, it‚Äôs a lot of fun just to explore the city and discover its secrets. Brotherhood also greatly expands the role of horses (you can ride them pretty much anywhere), and there are some fun combat mechanics added as well. The missions in the game are similar to those from AC2, so nothing major has changed on that front. The other primary mechanics introduced in AC2 (notoriety, blending, etc) all return here as well and are also just as good. The main addition this game brings to the series is the titular Brotherhood. Ezio can now recruit citizens to the Assassin Brotherhood. As you progress through the game, more recruit slots are unlocked. Once recruited, you can call your Assassins to assist in combat or send them on missions in a sort of optional sub-game. Doing either of these things awards XP to the recruits and eventually they level up and become more powerful. Though hardly revelatory by any means, it‚Äôs a fun new aspect to the game and is a welcome addition. While Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Brotherhood doesn‚Äôt really do anything groundbreaking or expand on the established formula in any major way, it is still worth playing if you enjoyed AC2. While it is essentially more of the same, at least it‚Äôs a *good* more of the same. Grade: A-Note: I don‚Äôt recommend playing any of the Assassin‚Äôs Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the third game in the series, and the second game in the Ezio trilogy (composed of Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). Mechanically, it's not very different from other games in the series - it is a third person open-world historical fiction action game, where you play as an assassin in 16th century Italy, working to improve the standing of your faction and reduce the power of your opposing faction.Like seems to be the case in this series, controls are improved over predecessors in that it makes combat easier, but that also serves to transition the game from being a stealthy assassin and more into being the sort of person who just jumps into combat and runs rampant. The primary change in this game is the ability to summon other assassins to help with combat/kills, which actually is pretty fantastic.I played this game on the 360, and enjoyed it a great deal - it's very much ""more of Assassin's Creed II"" with very minor changes. If that sounds like a good time, by all means - check it out. The game's a lot of fun. But by the end of this game, the mechanics and such were starting to wear thin - it's probably why I've taken as long as I have to get started in Revelations.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an extremely difficult game.  The combat is surreal in which you have to hit your mouse buttons multiple times on the 'Play' button to actually attempt to make Uplay work, and it's a never ending process as Uplay never works.  AC:B is one of those games where you have to make your own story.  One I made is that the main character (who I pretend is actually me) is in a world where when he wants to play a game, and the only way to play that game is through an extremely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing service named Uplay.  It's a really rivetting story of greed, greed, greed, and greed.10/10Origin is better (I can't believe I just said that.....).  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing UbiSoft.....			",190,25,1,32,7,0,24

												This game is better than it's predecessors in certain ways and worse in others. The shadow war between the Assassins and Templars seems to be happening in the public now, with Rome knowing about the Assassins.The story is the most simplistic in the series to date, and the main villain the same. Luckily the side characters are more actively developed and featured, and Ezio is shown as a leader, but we don't really see his development into that role. The gameplay, however, has been improved from the last entry into the series, with combat being more fluid and the side missions correlating more into the story.In this game you finally get a place to free-roam around as Desmond in, although it's small, but he also gets an interesting sequence at the end of the game.89/100			",140,20,1,19,1,0,12

ACB is typical in how the franchise provides a rich historical background of the events during that period of Rome and also provides its usual outstanding landscapes and architecture. ACB is basically a better version of AC2, training your own army of assassins and continuing the rich story. ACB will not disappoint if you liked the last game. 9/10			",134,9,2,11,3,1,6

												Initially, you get the impression that this should have been the DLC for Assassins Creed 2, but then they decided to stretch it into a full game. However, that is quickly shaken off and Brotherhood is a solid entry in the Ezio series. Playing as Ezio is as fun as always, possibly more so as he's got more gadgets than Batman.Theres quite a heavy emphasis on management, with rebuilding rome or recruiting your own assassins. I like this sort of thing, but if it doesnt set your world on fire you can pretty much ignore it once the training wheels are let loose. The graphics are good, especially considering this was released nearly 7 years ago. Rome can sometimes feel overwhelming, with there literally being tons of stuff to do - hundreds of side objectives are available. And this is where I feel it has overstretched itself, content for the sake of content. The plot is quite thin and tends to jump around, with no real sense of flow, just a series of disconnected objectives. I hold my hands up and admit that I found Assasins Creed skull-crushing difficult at times, with Altair dying more times than I could count. Ezio seems almost overpowered in this game, and sometimes battles can feel a little too easy when you perform a 15-count execution streak. Overall, Brotherhood is an enjoyable game with possibly too much stuff in it, but saying that, I suspect I will lose a few more hours running around Rome before I'm finished with it. .

												A good continuation of the Ezio's story. Roma is magnificent. Gameplay is fun and polished, but as any AC game it has many repetitive aspects, one of the reasons I decided to mostly focus on the story to not get bored. Multiplayer's hide and seek can be fun, though I hate players that hide within a crowd of NPCs that have identical character models. I always kill the wrong one :P Anyways, if you like the previous AC games you will this one too. Do not play this one if you didn't play AC2.			",215,22,9,21,16,2,25

												If you liked Assassin's Creed II and you want more of that, this is the game for you. It is more or less the same thing in terms of mechanics, with some additional weapons and the option to summon assassins to eliminate targets for you. You also get to head the assassin's guild which allows you to recruit new assassins, send them on missions and stuff. The world is, like in the previous game, amazingly crafted, with lots of areas to explore and rooftops to parkour on. Parkouring is fun, although you'll sometimes fly off a wall because the camera spazzed out or you were moving too fast to direct your character adequately etc. When this happens it breaks the flow and can feel quite frustrating. While assassinating targets remains fun (pulling them to their deaths when hanging off ledges or dropping on them from above etc), the combat is still awful (guards stand around you in a circle, waiting for their turn to attack), and the voice acting is just as atrocious as in the previous game, with a bunch of North American voice actors continuing to do an awful job at faking Italian accents... I suggest turning on Italian audio, it improves the immersion anyway.			",120,43,0,10,3,0,3

												After an initial feeling of being stretched thin with so many things to do and tasks pulling in many directions, the game really pulls together nicely. I sincerely had been close to calling my time with it quits before finishing Mem Seq 1. It was just  an overload of content. But perseverance won out and I'm glad it did. Currently through with Mem Seq 8 and have completed the majority of renovations and purchases and have a couple assassins in my brotherhood - working toward that magic number 5. I'm pretty much just map-clearing before going on with the main plot thread to afford my brotherhood the chance to level up. I have the feeling that the rest of the story missions will go quite smoothly. Perhaps the opening interval made me wary of Brotherhood and its standing as a sequel to ACII, but I think it works out the kinks smoothly. A good romp through Rome.			",448,106,15,71,43,7,102

I made up my mind to ""complete"" rome by buying all shops and upgrades and this left a good 10 more hours to play. Additionaly the game is really old, so it will be cheap during every steamsale.

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (AC:B) should be considered a worthy expansion of Assassin's Creed II, but it serves as a standalone game that continues where AC2 left off. The game continues the narrative saga, but quickly becomes tedious in its constant parkour maneuvers and climbing. However, AC:B is the first of the series to offer a multiplayer mode which in itself becomes just as tedious. Still, AC:B provides a crucial extension to the AC2's story line that again leaves fan hanging on for more. Essentially, AC:B feels like a paid expansion to properly conclude AC2 and begins to really show the repetitive nature of the series.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												A good continuation from where it left off. Assasins Creed Brotherhood tells the story of Ezio's journey after his time in Florence. Once again Ubisoft has done wonderfully in terms of graphics and gameplay. The city of Rome is an excellent place to perform parkour and free run. Some new additions were also nice, such as being able to recruit your own assasins to help you on your missions. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games (game series) I've ever played. And since Half-Life and Max Payne are quite inactive at the moment, I'm willing to pay Ubisoft almost anything for the Collector's edition of every new release from the AC series. Yes, it's THAT good.I won't spend precious time writing information you already read in million reviews, I'll put it simply - go buy it. Now. You won't regret it.Oh, and one more thing - if you haven't played the first two parts before, you should -at least the second one which is equally outstanding (and read the plot of the first one somewhere).

												The Assassin's Creed series just keeps getting better and better. The first game was a solid start, but the missions got repetitive after a while. AC II blew me away with the number of things they added; a compelling plot and characters that felt authentic, interesting platforming sequences, and a real sense of humor!I just finished the story campaign of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and I can't decide whether I liked it better than Assassin's Creed II or not.Graphically Brotherhood is obviously better, but it is not as big a difference as the change from AC to AC II. Also, 3D gaming is really useful while freerunning around Renaissance Italy because depth perception helps me to know whether I can make a jump or not.I think I preferred the story of AC II because it was an epic narrative of Ezio's journey over several decades to train and grow from a rather self-centered lady-killer young adult to a mature assassin (still a lady-killer). AC Brotherhood was much more limited in scope, as it takes place over the course of a few years in the city of Rome. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I liked the tangible progression that Ezio went through in AC II.However, I definitely preferred the gameplay of Brotherhood. They improved on a few of the things that had been iffy in the previous games (like horses!) and they added some really great things as well. The big one of course is recruiting assassins to help you out. I felt like a total badass whenever I walked by a group of guards, raised my hand and whistled, and a moment later they were dead. I also became rather attached to the recruits, and it made me very proud when they gained enough experience to become full-fledged assassins. Losing recruits didn't have quite as big an emotional impact as losing people in The Walking Dead did, but when I accidentally killed one it came pretty close.The endings of these games keep getting more and more mind-blowing; I have heard that Revelations raises the bar once again, and I can't wait to get there. One thing that definitely gave me the chills was the date that the finale takes place on. Ubisoft has intentionally been converging all events on December 21, 2012 and the final scenes of Brotherhood take place 72 days before that.So if you were to ask me which Assassin's Creed games you should play, I would say all of them. If you are short on time/money skipping the first one is excusable. AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations make a nice little trilogy, so don't start after AC II.			",216,87,1,26,10,3,40

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood √© uma sequ√™ncia  direta de AC2, se iniciando logo ap√≥s o seu final. O jogo tr√°s algumas novidades em rela√ß√£o ao seu antecessor, mas n√£o muitas, de forma que parece mais ser uma expans√£o que um jogo novo. Digo isto n√£o querendo desmerecer, at√© porque se trata de um t√≠tulo de grande qualidade, mas se n√£o fosse pelas cidades de ocorr√™ncia serem diferentes, facilmente poderia se confundir os dois jogos.A trama, como sempre muito bem elaborada, diz respeito a liberta√ß√£o de Roma do dom√≠nio dos Borgia, poderosa fam√≠lia de templ√°rios que al√©m de tudo estavam no controle de um dos artefatos m√°gicos. No entanto, o final √© meio desanimador, por ser totalmente inconclusivo  deixando o jogador com a impress√£o de que o jogo acabou antes do final.Entre as novidades, a que mais chama aten√ß√£o √© a possibilidade de recrutar pessoas entre a popula√ß√£o e trein√°-los em batalha para que se tornem assassinos, inclusive com ritual de passagem e tudo que tem direito! A Irmandade tamb√©m pode ser usada para se livrar de um pelot√£o de inimigos inteiro com a chuva de flechas, caso estejam todos os recrutas dispon√≠veis.Outra coisa legal √© que existem desafios extras durante as miss√µes, como, por exemplo, complet√°-la sem ser visto ou matar usando determinado item, criando assim um grande est√≠mulo a rejogar para tentar 100% de sincroniza√ß√£o.Al√©m destas citadas, h√° outras novidades como uma maior utiliza√ß√£o da economia, de forma que √© poss√≠vel adquirir pr√©dios p√∫blicos e com√©rcios para depois investir neles, na pr√°tica uma ideia meio desperdi√ßada. Para liberar os estabelecimentos para compra, √© necess√°rio destruir uma torre de vigil√¢ncia pr√≥xima e matar seu capit√£o, para que as tropas recuem e parem de intimidar os comerciantes.Uma coisa chata √© a forma de se adquirir as armaduras e armas novas, que precisam ser desbloqueadas atrav√©s de miss√µes para as lojinhas em que s√£o vendidas. Essas ""miss√µes"" consistem em encontrar determinado n√∫mero de itens espec√≠ficos, e feito isso a pe√ßa √© desbloqueada.  D√° para fazer as miss√µes mesmo sem saber que est√° fazendo, mas de qualquer forma √© chato ficar dependendo de sorte para encontrar os itens certos.Outra coisa ruim √© que, al√©m de possuir apenas uma cidade dispon√≠vel (muito embora esta seja enorme), as partes desbloqueadas a cada mem√≥ria s√£o inescrupulosamente misturadas, de forma que h√° locais no meio do mapa que s√≥ s√£o desbloqueados nas fases finais e peda√ßos da ponta que est√£o dispon√≠veis desde o in√≠cio, tornando tudo muito confuso.No fim das contas, AC Brotherhood √© um jogo divertido e apesar de parecer mais uma expans√£o que um jogo novo, n√£o cai na mesmice e apresenta uma qualidade t√£o alta quanto o seu antecessor. √â altamente recomendado para todos aqueles que gostam de um jogo com uma boa hist√≥ria. EXCELENTE (9/10). ",361,80,9,41,16,3,26

												Yes, I would reccomend you DO play this game. I love the gameplay, graphics, animation (major advantage for the game), and a lot more. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has its evens and odds (like Uplay), but the odds can be reasoned with. I like most of the game, but what bugs kme the most is that when you want to play it, you MUST go through Uplay: meaning that you MUST have or create a(n) account in order to play the game you just (bought and) want to play. But other than Uplay, I would reccomend this game, it goes for the win, so you should buy it! And if you're feeling nastolgic, then you might want to play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some call it an ""Assassin's Creed 2.5"", but that's a heavy understatement. Ezio is back with even more clever and amusing ways to kill Italian (and later, French) guards throughout Rome as you strive to rebuild the city for its people, along with additional character development with Desmond.Perhaps the most innovative thing about Brotherhood is its introduction of a multiplayer deathmatch, where the objective is to find and assassinate other chosen target players throughout a town or other similar map.

												Brotherhood is AC II but with more to it. Theres more content, more missions of a wider variety and lets you ride your horse in town, which AC II flatly refused to do. Also introduces a fast travel which makes things a little nicer. The story is better (in my opinion) in this game than the AC II and has a far more interesting antagonist.I'd recommend this game to anyone, but strongly suggest you play Assassin's Creed II first, as the story really requires you too.A criticism, probably my only one, is that on my PC the graphics have to be right down, and there are still a few stutters in the video. The sound is also out of sync with the video, meaning the lips say their part 10 seconds after the character has. But I still think this game is amazing.			",37,7,1,8,4,1,5

												Yes, I would reccomend you DO play this game. I love the gameplay, graphics, animation (major advantage for the game), and a lot more. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has its evens and odds (like Uplay), but the odds can be reasoned with. I like most of the game, but what bugs kme the most is that when you want to play it, you MUST go through Uplay: meaning that you MUST have or create a(n) account in order to play the game you just (bought and) want to play. But other than Uplay, I would reccomend this game, it goes for the win, so you should buy it! And if you're feeling nastolgic, then you might want to play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some call it an ""Assassin's Creed 2.5"", but that's a heavy understatement. Ezio is back with even more clever and amusing ways to kill Italian (and later, French) guards throughout Rome as you strive to rebuild the city for its people, along with additional character development with Desmond.Perhaps the most innovative thing about Brotherhood is its introduction of a multiplayer deathmatch, where the objective is to find and assassinate other chosen target players throughout a town or other similar map.

												AC:BH is a beautiful story, on both sides of the Animus. We get a deeper view of Ezio Auditore da Firenze reconstruction of the Assassin order complete with your own Assassin's to train and summon. I'll personally make claim that if you even slightly enjoy political drama you will love the story, even as cliche as it is and full of conspiracy theory. The combat is definately smoother and more satisfying without removing any of the fun of the PK, although the detection can be a little bit sorry if you don't use a controller, which you should for playing this game. I wasn't a personal fan of the revitize rome system in this game but I can see how one might be. Really the most interesting, not really the most fun for me (I like solo games) is the multiplayer which is created under the guise of a training program for the Templar corperation Abstergo, trying to capitalize on the bleedthrough effect that they are using to train Desmond. ~10/10~			",427,173,6,141,73,3,146

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the sequel of Assassin's Creed II.Best way to describe it is to simply say that this game is even more interesting and awesome from the previous one.The story continues with the same main character from Assassin's Creed II.This time everything is placed around the Rome of ~1500 with a complete design of how all city designes used to be.The game's storyline is as interesting as ever, with more great surprises and revealed infrmation.Very well designed graphics with details and great animations.A lot more RPG elements and a great quantity of extra features and new weapons.Just like Assassin's Creed II,you will not get bored of the game.Either by choosing to follow only the main quests or by going freeroam or by doing some of teh many sidequests you can just choose whatever you like.The game is really awesome!Found some bugs but this was a minor to what i experienced by playing this.Can't wait for Assassin's Creed Revelations.Recommended!

												Beat the game in about 17 hours.It solidly improves upon Assassin's Creed II in many ways. The writing and facial animation seems just a little bit more believable and better overall, the sandbox gameplay is enhanced with the addition of new mechanics like upgrading shops and managing assassins, and the mission design manages to be less frustrating and, in general, less bug-ridden than AC2. Also, the combat feels a lot more fun and interesting than AC2 - they've added mechanics so you can effectively deal with all enemy types without resorting to just hitting them over and over again (which I felt was all I could do in the previous game - if there were other techniques I was having a hard time figuring them out), and added an insta-kill mechanic that keeps things moving along more quickly. This is a big thing for this game - in my opinion, the combat was one of the things that made me really not like AC2. The actual story and characters involved in the story feel more fleshed out due to the better voice acting, direction, animation, and writing. Finally, the length feels a bit better, or, even if the expected clear-time was around the same, felt more justified. AC2 felt like it dragged on without adding anything interesting.There's still some stuff that might've been better. The variety in voice clips from enemies and civilians seems pretty much unchanged from AC2. It gets somewhat immersion breaking hearing the same voices from all of the same enemies, as if you're always just fighting an army of clones. The parkour/traversal sections feel like a bit of a slow, boring slog, because there's really not much to do other than slowly climb your way through the only route forward, and if you mess up, re-do the slow climbing. Being able to move faster through those sections would have been nice, as well as maybe adding some variety or challenge so it doesn't just feel like you're ""going through the motions"". I just wanted those sections (like the optional temples of Romulus) to be over. The levels and the way you move through them are interesting and clearly a lot of thought and attention to detail went into them, but they just manage to be kind of boring. The only time they end up being challenging is when Ezio ends up not doing what you thought he was going to do or what you wanted him to do, and you have to re-do a boring climbing section.Overall, a fun sandbox / open world action game. I would say it's not quite as fun as other games in the genre due to the aforementioned problems, but it still manages to be enjoyable for most of the game.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												No supone el sorprendente salto de calidad que presenciamos entre la primera y segunda entrega, pero tampoco pretende alcanzarlo. Lo que si ofrece es una mas que aceptable continuacion de la atrapante historia de Ezio y Desmond, la cual se va entra√±ando mas a medida que trazamos nuestro camino por las 9 secuencias principales, y eso sin contar las varias actividades extra curriculares que se pueden realizar. Lograr acabarlo al 100% supondra un desafio apto para el mas leal de los asesinos.El paquete se ve completado por la primera inclusion de un componente multijugador en la saga, el cual es un soplo de aire fresco bien recibido, incluyendo habilidades que mejorar, objetos que desbloquear y templarios por silenciar.En fin, no decepcionara a los fans de la segunda parte, pero la caida en la calidad es evidente, reflejandose en su corta historia, la cual abarca pocos sucesos relevantes, y en su falta general de innovacion.Valoracion final: ""Un Assassin¬¥s Creed 2.5"" Nota: 8.5/10			",105,8,6,8,5,2,3

												This game is packed with endless side missions, quests, and features. It brings back the best of everything from its two predecessors and adds its own improvements. If Brotherhood has any weakness worth mentioning, it it's that the main story loses a bit of steam in the middle; with all the other stuff to do, though, you probably won't care.

												PROS:-you can throw axes and swords, extremly satisfying-economy-shops-buying landmarks-training recruits-lot of bussiness outside of storyCONS:-terrible controls (slightly better with gamepad)-boring story, nothing happened at all-prone to crashes-apple of eden is useless, I kill faster with my axeThe game was good when I was buying out landmarks and shops, renovating stuff and training recruits. When there wasn't anything else left to do, I completed the plot which was pretty bad.TL;DR:Lots of sideactivities, including interesting economy and recruit training. You can throw axes. Plot is boring. Controls are extremly annoying.6/10 (would be 9/10 if I ignored the story and stopped playing after finishing all bussiness in the economy and recruit training).			",85,2,1,4,6,0,6

												This games pretty cool, I liked the new features they added to it. Being a part of the brotherhood comes in handy and makes you feel like your character really means something. I would suggest this game to anyone who has played any of the assassins creed games thus far, I would suggest playing the second game before this one so the story line makes more sense.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is an aging title but still contains the core gameplay dynamic. The single player story is good and follows Desmond Miles on his quest to understand his ancestors and their pasts. Despite it's age it's still a good pick up, especially when it's on sale!

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the 3rd installment to the Assassin's Creed franchise. It's not a spin off, despite what many say. It's relevant to Ezio's story and the modern day story. The gameplay is basically the same from 2 except enhanced a bit so it feels easier. You can now kick your opponents in the knob to weaken them so that's fun. The story is great and still had that Assassin's Creed feel (Which ends in 3) and the modern day story is pretty good too.. I've 100% the game on PS3 before, but I downloaded a save file for the PC version. I haven't seen any glitches so far and the game is pretty easy to run. I think this is a good Assassin's Creed game to start off with. I'd give it a 8/10 because... Why not Now can Ubisoft return to this level please? When they were good.			",43,3,0,2,3,0,1

												The Assassins Creed series is definiitely one of my favourites. From the story to the gameplay it's just outstanding. I love the freedom of hopping between rooftops and doing quests and assassination missions while at the same time restoring different towns/cities. Brotherhood lets you recruit and manage your own Assassins group allowing you to send them on their own missions to get you money or have to assist you when you're in a tough situation. Brotherhood is definitely a must-buy if you've played the other games and if you haven't, I suggest you play Assassin's Creed 2 first as this is a direct sequel to that. Playing Assassins Creed 1 is not entirely necessary, but it helps.			",79,10,0,15,7,0,5

												Are you all excited for AC: Revelations? Well then You better get this now and get practicing. Oh, If you care about the story, start with AC2, but NOT AC1. AC1 is a waste of your time. AC2 is WAY better and they got everything right. come to think of it, I'd say AC:B had better game play, but AC2 Had the better story and ending. Have fun going around killing people, and hang in there until you can recruit assasin trainees in sequence 4, THATS when the game really shines. Prototype meets GTA in the rennesance, BETTER than both games and you need to play now. BTW the multiplayer is first rate once you get the hang of it. It's less than $30 and there's no excuse not to own and play it. It's just DAMN good and there's nothing else like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was pleased with AC2, and to be perfectly honest AssCreeBro is the same basic game under the hood. But I cannot recommend this installment in the series like I did its predecessor.The real shame here is that Rome has none of the charm of AC2's brilliant levels. Where Florence was towering and beautiful, Venice labyrinthine and mysterious, and Tuscany open and warm, Rome is just a dissapointment. It feels lifeless and indistinct, even small at times.Adding to the problem is AssCreeBro's story. AC2 got it right, by telling a straightforward story about the protagonist's journey from simple vengeance to deciphering his role in a larger mystery. AssCreeBro falters, picking up immediately after the admitedly weak finale of AC2 and going nowhere slowly. After the Borgia launch a counter attack that an idiot should have seen coming a mile away, Ezio heads to Rome to regain the Apple and thwart his enemies. The plan includes rebuilding the Assassin order, which plays out in a profoundly boring way. You meet bland, faceless citizens who are under attack, save them, then recruit them to your cause, where they become bland, faceless assassins who do nothing of plot significance. You'll slowly ""liberate"" Rome by climbing towers (and setting them on fire for some reason), and then buying all the shops in the area.AssCreeBro adds a few features (like the Assassin recruits). The disappointing part is that most of those new features are bland or unnecessary. The investment minigame seems to exist only to fuel itself. The missions you send your recruits on earn a tiny amount of gold and do nothing for the plot. New ""full syncronization"" challenges have been added to every mission, further restricting the way you experience this open world adventure (usually in arbitrary ways that don't make any sense and often with bugs).Without the charm of the setting or story, issues that have plagued Assassin's Creed gameplay since the original begin to take center stage. The controls are atrocious. On PC, the stronger option is to use an Xbox controller rather than wrestle with the horrible keyboard/mouse options. On the controller, one must hold the left trigger to perform all the most common actions. The X and A buttons on the controller are each map to dozens of different (often contradictory) context sensitive commands, and other buttons are under-utilized or outright ignored. Keep in mind, none of these issues is new to AssCreeBro, its just that without the distractions these issues swiftly come to dominate the experience.Its not that AssCreeBro is bad - its just not good enough to overlook the flaws. If you're already invested in the series, you might want to power through this chapter, but if not, I'd skip right past it.			",203,42,3,40,12,3,25

												Remember when this game came out 5 years ago? Remember how much uplay sucked and people were frustrated and outraged? Well it's 5 years later, and nothing has changed or been fixed. Have fun not even being able to play the game. Fortunately I own a mac and a pc, and while I literally cannot log into uplay without it crashing on pc, it worked okay (not great, but okay) on my macbook. So while uplay is a massive pain, I'll try to stick to reviewing the actual game. The most important part of a game in my opinion is the gameplay, and that is definitely the best part of AC: Brotherhood. Freerunning around Rome, climbing all over mysterious ruins, and generally exploring and getting around the map, even outside of missions, is a lot of fun. Solving the various puzzles within the levels is also a blast. The combat is definitely too easy, and I could confidently take on dozens of enemies at once, as they just stand around yelling at me, attacking one by one. I understand why it is like this, where's the fun in realistically being beaten to death by dozens of guards at once, however fights with large numbers of enemies happens regularly, and it is extremely noticeable. As to plot, AC: Brotherhood has a decent story going for it, but I found it a bit over the top a lot of the time, kinda melodramatic, then again it's a videogame, and that's par for the course, almost required. The plot is definitely a good length, not cutting off too abruptly or dragging on forever, and outside of the story missions there is a lot to do. It's difficult to say how long the plot is, since my game time is not displaying properly. I've actually played through the game twice, and played a significant amount of the multiplayer, which isn't terribly active these days, but can be an absolute blast if you find a time where enough people are playing. There is some replayability to the game, but not tons. Going back through the memories and replaying specific missions that you enjoyed is a nice feature, so that you don't have to replay the entire game, can just enjoy the 'highlight reel'.Overall, I think the game is worth playing, and is one of the stronger entries to the series, but would Ubisoft please just kill uplay with fire already?

												If you definitely want to get this game make sure you play AC2 first because this game is a continuation on the story.So the best way I can describe this game is: it's enjoyable bs. I recommend the game because it's fun and entertaining and if that's what you're looking for then great but if you're a seasoned gamer then you probably want to avoid this; it's going to bore you. The combat is so dumbed down and an example of this is countering. All you have to do is press the counter button at the right time and your guy will automatically position himself and rotate to take out the enemy. Large groups of enemies pose barely any threat as they basically wait their turn to attack you. ""I see you're attacking my friend there, no problem buddy I‚Äôll wait until you're finished before I start to attack you"". It's so easy, I haven't died once yet, and have barely lost any health. In fact I've lost more health from fall damage because he often wouldn't jump the direction I was pointing lol.The game is also so planned out for you. So much hand holding. Sneak in without being detected by guards. There just happens to be a big pile of hay to jump down into, and the only guard in the vicinity just happens to be standing in front, with his back to you for an easy kill.However, the story in the game is well done and there is quite a lot of depth in this game which is awesome. For example you can invest in places or you can hire and send assassin recruits on missions and you can train them up to help you in battle. That's why I recommend this game. It may be a bit simple but the fact is the game is still entertaining and I'm having fun playing it. ",105,17,3,6,5,1,7

												Rome is awesome.In AC: Brotherhood, Ezio travels to Rome to confront the younger Cesare Borgia for being an evil twit. The plot revolves around the Assassin brotherhood, and gaining ground in society. That was my favorite aspect of the game, the recruiting and training of the assassins.The actual plot involves Cesare Borgia, the son of the Rodrigo Borgia, or Pope Alexander VI. Cesare is a psychopath in the truest standards. He's relentless and lusts for blood.As you can imagine, the gameplay is much like the previous game, but with some fixes to the parkour. Also, the graphics look a little bit better. Not much else changed in technical terms though.It's a great game regardless, and the vast openness of Rome was epic, yet a little boring in the area south of the Coliseum.9.2/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												The  parts of the game that I played are great, I played for 12 hours straight one day. Then I came across the Leonardo missions, and like many other people could not steer the bomber, I tried everything that was said in forums but none worked. But, that was just a side quest so I just said meh, who needs it.I got all the way to seq 9, and I was like oh‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•boys I'm ready, I was staring down the head of the Borgia, but the fight wouldn't trigger and he was stuck there with no collision just fighting some random grunts, I tried again some of the things forums suggested but none have worked yet, verifing game cache right now.Along with moments of pure frustration when the controls make you jump off a borgia tower, it has to be negative.And I know that I most probably could fix my game but backing up my save and reinstalling, but why should I have to.But a positive is I didn't have to do anything to get a screen res for a 21:9 monitor.Requiescat en Pace my AC Brotherhood career.Update: Verifying game cache fixed my problem so it's back at it!

												Good Assassins Creed game if you like the type. Story continues well and ends suprisingly. Some small annoyances like some parts of the game bugging out if you don't have VSync on which is... confusing. And at the end of the game, be prepared to go for a coffee, walk or watch a movie since you can't skip the 36mins long credits.			",38,1,0,8,0,0,1

												This was my first Assassin's Creed game and I throughly enjoyed it. There were a couple of plot details from AC2 that I didnt get, but I still picked it up rather well. The graphics look surprisingly good despite its age and this is a gleaming light of what Assassin's Creed used to be.			",239,36,4,31,36,2,42

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third development in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood continues the narrative of Ezio Auditore, the Master Assassin from Florence, introduced in Assassin's Creed II. As Ezio and his ally, Machiavelli are forced to relocate their guild to Roma (Rome) following persecution from the ruling party of Roma, the Borgia. Ezio continues his quest to secure the Apple of Eden and keep it from the hands of the Templars. Brotherhood has exhilirating combat, semi-fluent parkour, and a large basin of armour, melee and ranged weapons, equipment, and aesthetic colours to add to your ever-developing costume. Brotherhood introduced recruiting Assassins into the series, personally one of my favourite mechanics. Being able to send your comrades out on tasks for the Brotherhood, call them into battle to assist you, or have them rain arrows in defense of their mentor is quite appealing to the Assassin's Creed fan. You have the ability to increase your Assassin follower's armour levels by equipping them with sturdier armour upon leveling up, and equipping them with better weapons, all the while developing their skills as an Assassin. The game does encounter some relatively frequent graphical glitches and rare crash errors. Especially towards the late game, the cinematics will often not trigger or a required clause will not register as 'met', causing the need to revert to a checkpoint or restart a memory, which can sometimes be considered gamebreaking. In total, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic development in the Assassin's Creed series, which sets up the story for the fourth game, Assassin's Creed Revelations.Score: 94/100			",120,6,0,13,11,0,19

												This is a pretty decent sequel. It ties up the loose ends of 2, and I like that we get to spend some time in the present. It's got to be a stroke of genius that you get to explore Monteriggioni in the present as Desmond. Inventory management is a lot better, you can equip different weapons without having to go all the way back to your safehouse. It's also pretty neat that you get to form your own guild of assassins.One thing I didn't like is the ""shop quests"" system, which requires you to collect trinkets like wool and tomatoes just so you can buy a sword that's relevant to the game, and the specific trinkets are hard to come by. It requires you to grind and loot and hunt for chests which takes away from the fun.I also didn't like the addition of random encounters, especially since they increase notoriety. I don't want to have to digress from the quest I'm on to kill a bunch of guys and hunt down posters to tear down. It gets really old, really fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is recommended for the good storyline and great character building of Ezio, however the last hour was pretty boring. This was also horribly gltchy for me. Allies behaving like enemies, following allies and they just stop in place, falling through the bottom of the map, teleporting onto the edge of a cliff and falling, people in missions not appearing, also the last minute of Desmond dosnt work for me it just feezes and wont go onto the next scene, also for a couple days the game did not start for me. It seems like im the only one with these problems so it may just be me. Altough the story still allowed me to look past all that stuff and still be a good AC game.			",87,8,0,7,4,0,4

												Pros: you can raise litttle assassin ducklings and make them into full fledged badasses who can save you when you do something stupid like aggro every borgia in italy, you get to kill templars in increasingly clever ways, and shaun/rebecca is some good stuff.Cons: more forced camera angles. I do not enjoy when I'm running forward and ezio suddenly takes a sharp right and plummets to his doom. If you can get past that, I'd recommend it. I enjoyed the II characters that carried over, usually more than I did in II.			",50,15,0,9,3,0,1

												Again, you play Desmond who plays a game set in the past in order to find clues in the future. Sadly still for Desmond, the character he controls in the game still likes to vere to the left when told to jump straight and assassinate bystanders standing behind guards. Though, Desmond seems to care little for those he kills in game as the Death toll really peeks in this game. In this title you rise up in the ranks from mere Assassin and owner of a small kingdom to the man who bought all of Rome through the proceeds of his personal vendetta. You earn followers along the way and can begin outsourcing much of the killing so you can focus on walking slowly through the streets and avoiding minstrels.Over time you will gain all the coolest gear that you had in the previous game but as with many games you are just handed a BFG for part of the finale and the tools you have earned can not be used in the lead up to the final pay off.  Luckily you hand that BFG and all your wealth to DaVinci and go in search of the bad guy at the end. Sadly, your posse of outsourced Assassins which you have earned throughout the game and painstakingly leveled up will not join you in the final battles so you will have to kill this final bad guy yourself.. and boy is it tedious. Why are the cowardly bad guys in games that throw wave after wave of guards at you always the most tedious to kill?4 stars.			",593,222,45,89,83,1,128

												Definitly a step up from AC2, combat, weaponry and customization are way better than its predecesser. The mission are tough and can be very annoying. Out of all the AC games I own (basically all except one) it has the most bugs e.g. versing Cesare Borgia, for some reason Caesare decides o fall down and not get up. Ten minutes later and I have to start the memory again, sucky. But this is a worthwhile game. 8/10.			",13,2,0,1,1,0,0

Playing Assassin's creed II I just had to buy this game just to see what would happen to Ezio, then following this game: Assassin's Creed Revelations Ezio's story just gets even better. anyone who has enjoyed Assassin's creed games in the past will definitely want to play this game, just be sure to play Assassin's Creed II before playing this one to understand the story line.

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an excellent game. It offers plenty of playtime and a great city to explore. While it isn't much different from the gameplay in AC2, it does change and add a few new things. It does only offer 1 city (Rome) to explore while AC2 offers 4 cities (Venice, Florence, Forli, and Tuscany). For that reason and a few others, AC2 is the better game in my opinion. Nonetheless, Brotherhood is a worthy sequel to an amazing franchise. 9/10 Great Game :)			",37,2,0,4,1,0,0

												Starting immediatly after the ending of Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood continues and finishes Ezio's story through Italy. Compared to it's predecessor, the story is much weaker, but everything else is greatly improved. This game also signaled the beginning of annual Assassin's Creed games, but this is a very good one. The map is shorter than all the combined maps of the previous game, but Rome feels more cohesive and alive, because the crowds are more dynamic and diversified. The combat is mostly the same, except for a new ""kill streak"" that makes it easier but more fluid. The stealth sections are also unchanged, but a new crossbow also makes it easier. This game also introduced a replay mission feature, optional objectives, and your own assassin's guild, making combat and stealth even easier, but it's a nice addition. A true sequel that feels both old and new in a good way. Even the Desmond sections are fun to play this time around. This was also the first Assassin's Creed with multiplayer, and although the servers are still online, almost no one plays it anymore, so i can't review it.Regarding Uplay, i also didn't run into problems this time (no cloud saving), but that doesn't mean that i still agree with it.

												now, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is really simular to AC2 so you will propably see the samePositive and Negative things.Positives.-Multiplayer (nowadays it doesnt have so many players but they can be found)-Your Assassin's have differences so they are not all the same you can choose in wich order to level up your. Assassins you can choose to go Amor, Weapons or both. You can choose to Dye your Assassin's with a few presets. You can send your Assassins to missions giving you money and them experience.-Alot of side quests-A big Variety of Gear-Controller support-Amazing Kill AnimationsNegatives.-Lack of Customization-Messy Keyboard & Mouse Controlls (at start)-Very low amount of Missions in the Real life-Full Synchronazition for Missions is very Minor-Combat is Very easy and Stealth is only Nececary in Missions-Collectable Prizes are nothing but Outfits and AchievementsAssassin's Creed Brotherhood is The best in my opinion 9/10			",93,3,1,5,2,0,2

												So first off, Uplay. Ew. And figuring it out can be a pain. But Brotherhood is an excellent game. Traversing Rome (which is absolutely gorgeous) by way of the roofs, streets, or on horseback is enjoyable. The combat system is fluid and easy to master while still being fun. You start the game feeling like a badass and end feeling like an even badasser badass. Slowly taking over the city and recruiting and upgrading your assassins is gratifying. The missions aren't incredibly varied (though some differ incredibly, like the ones with Leonardo da Vinci's war machines) but they remain fun, because, again, you feel like a badass. I'd definitely recommend this game, even at full price.			",94,7,0,16,6,0,6

												The jumping puzzles were more obnoxious than what was in AC2, but the story was all around stronger to me, in that I actually understood who I was fighting and why, which is more than I could say about AC2. All in all, a good game for me. I enjoyed the city-rebuilding aspects and the crit-path chain isn't obnoxiously long like it felt in AC2. I did skip some of the side content, like the tomb explorations, since I hated those in AC2 and they're not critical anyway. Storywise, it ends on a definite cliffhanger, so there's definitely an impetus to head into AC: Revelations right afterward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without any concernable doubt, this is by far the greatest game to ever grace the Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood has the most enjoyable and free flowing combat system that truly makes you feel like a real master Assassin. Be sure to exploit every single crevice of Rome to find all the sidequests, because once you're hooked to this game, (which you will without a doubt be,) you will be thirsting for every drop of this game's content.

												Great continuation of the series.Like any other AC game, some of the missions can get boring, and a bit of the same over and over.But the story, voice acting and non-linear pacing helps for any play style.The ending is a real cliff hanger but really sets you up for the other installment, and continues the tradition of a great storyline.If you're into the AC story, this part is necessary.

												AC Brotherhood may not be as fresh as AC2, but it's an excellent example of improving what was already good, and implementing good new things. Besides, if you played the second game, you owe it to yourself to play this one. 4/5*			",157,38,3,36,5,2,7

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes what it's predecessor did and moved it further into a commanding role of the assassins. While it does hold it's own missions, there's an interesting meta-layer that is used to improve Rome's economy and business which in turn helps you outfit you and yours.The only downside is that if you invest the time into making sure you have Rome fully supported, you practically end up swimming in money which really damages the balance of the game.Despite that flaw, it's more of the same with a bit of new on top that again justifies the asking price over it's predecessor, DRM not withstanding.

												This game's alright. It's not as good as Assassin's Creed II. It's not terribly worse, but it doesn't really add anything. It continues the adventures of Ezio Auditore: the renaissance-y murder specialist and Desmond. Desmond deserves no description as he is blander than wet graham crackers. This might sound like I'm jumping on the Hate-Desmond bandwagon. I am because said bandwagon is warm and has free wifi and is GENERALLY CORRECT. This game is good if your a fan of the series and curious to see what happens to Ezio, but it doesn't do anything that interesting or new. As usual it adds some new weapons and a new setting. They have replaced the two fairly large cities of Florence and Venice with the pretty large city of Rome. You went to Rome briefly in the last game for an oddly linear mission, but it's back and fleshed out into a totally new map. Rome is neat, considering it has it's fair share of cool landmarks. The Colosseum comes to mind. Rome is one of the only things that is new though. You still follow the same group of modern day people: Lucy (who falls a bit deep into the uncanny valley), the british guy and the other woman. You still follow Ezio (now a bit older, with a beard, but still as spritely as ever.) The bad guys are still the Borgias and you still take down key members of the family in a quite brutal game of Family Feud. Money is back too. This time you have to renovate all of Rome, which leads me to ask how the f*ck does Ezio have permission to fix the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Colosseum. Anyway, the game's pretty good. If you plan on playing the Assassin's Creed series then I suggest picking this one up, at least to fill in the story holes. It's pretty fun, but doesn't do much. The name is a key indicator. It's not Assassin's Creed III (that's a different game). It's not a straight sequel. It's more of a time occupier. However, it's pretty good.			",166,30,6,7,12,0,2

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is essentially a large expansion to Assassin's Creed II. However, do not let that determine your impression. Brotherhood is a fantastic game, building upon Assassin's Creed II while resolving issues from the previous title simultaneously. Renaissance Rome is also truly and remarkably beautiful, as is the seamless combat when finally mastered. The multiplayer support is a little shakey, at best, but the single player campaign is worth the purchase on its own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is there to say about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood? It's definitely an amazing game that can entertain you for hours and still make you want to come back for more. It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely bada**ery that both Assassin's Creed 1&2 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I won't spoilt it ;)If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.I also recommend Assassin's Creed 1&2 as well.EDIT: I would also recommend to play this game with a gaming controller.			",236,18,2,17,20,1,26

												The jumping puzzles were more obnoxious than what was in AC2, but the story was all around stronger to me, in that I actually understood who I was fighting and why, which is more than I could say about AC2. All in all, a good game for me. I enjoyed the city-rebuilding aspects and the crit-path chain isn't obnoxiously long like it felt in AC2. I did skip some of the side content, like the tomb explorations, since I hated those in AC2 and they're not critical anyway. Storywise, it ends on a definite cliffhanger, so there's definitely an impetus to head into AC: Revelations right afterward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without any concernable doubt, this is by far the greatest game to ever grace the Assassin's Creed series. Brotherhood has the most enjoyable and free flowing combat system that truly makes you feel like a real master Assassin. Be sure to exploit every single crevice of Rome to find all the sidequests, because once you're hooked to this game, (which you will without a doubt be,) you will be thirsting for every drop of this game's content.

												When compared to AC2, Sisterhood to a large extent is more of the same, although it brings back some elements from AC1 (flags, begging women, citizens tackling enemies, occasional trips out of animus to read other people's emails) and adds new things, too (most importantly, you're getting to be head of assassin's guild in single player campaing; and yes, there's multiplayer added). Instead of segmentation into many smaller cities though, the majority of the action is on one huge map (Rome) with heaps of side missions to chose from at any single moment so it has more sandboxy feeling.I actually liked this more than AC2. Mostly due to this game having more actual ""game"" in it. Gamification is above all present in the missions that sport an additional requirement for 100%ing it. Sometimes it gives real challenge like time trial, sometimes it actually limits your choices to specific weapons or angles of approach but sort of works to keep things varied. And the whole sandboxy aspect is also what I liked.'Cause yeah lack of challenge, mostly in the fights (guards actually hit harder now and there's more of them, but conversely you get more efficient ways of killing them so it's still too easy), and feel of an interactive movie instead or something, is a beef I have with the series. I guess I embraced it though by now and even started to somewhat enjoy those overpowered fights. Still missing focus on stealth, but I don't mind it either anymore (I adjusted my expectations, eh? :D some missions ask you to remain undetected but stealth never seems to be the focus, really, you just charge head on or literally flick your fingers to kill every enemy on screen)You still gotta love the parkour, rooftop jumping aspect, raiding tombs is fun too, there's a dash of puzzling involved tho not much, and story continuing present day and Ezio's day affairs still enjoyable, even though it doesn't really touch me deep on an emotional level.About the story... The side missions don't directly connect to the main arc of retrieving the ""magic apple"", they have more to do with Ezio going all ""I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I'm gonna bring the whole f*n' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head"" on the Borgias or, rather, living in denial that he fudged up royally and instead explaining to everyone that you gotta have more systemic approach rather than playing the cutting-down-hydra's-heads game. Hence all the Rome rebuilding, winning minds of various factions and citizens etc.So the main story may feel somewhat diluted and I guess people mostly enjoying the story aspect may be bit underwhelmed. Like I said, I personally didn't mind and actually like the game more even though it seems actually less focused on whole assassin's creed ordeal.Oh, and Desmond Miles in present day finally gets some of focus and action, after all ac2 was supposed to prepare him for some parkouring in the present day so yeah, he gets some :3			",360,123,16,65,24,3,110

												Brotherhood is Assassin's Creed at its best. It takes what's best from AC2 and makes it even better, while changing the mission structure to be more open-world than previous games. I love the ability to call assassins at any time during the game. There's only one city to explore, but Rome is absolutely big and varied, and full of things to do. It's a great and geographically varied setting, ranging from rural areas to densely populated city areas. There's also some additional levels outside the city (Leonardo's war machines missions) and some nice surprises along the way. The secret locations from AC2 also make a return as fantastically designed Lairs of Romulus - these are some great platforming levels and completing them is a real pleasure.Brotherhood has a great cast of characters and the overall story is interesting. My only gripe is lack of character development for side characters later in the game - Claudia, Maria and Leonardo all suffer from this, leaving their stories a bit incomplete. What's great about Brotherhood is also the modern day bit of the story. It's fantastic - and you actually get to do things as Desmond.This Assassin's Creed outing has also introduced multiplayer for the first time in the series. Keep in mind that unfortunately multiplayer is mostly dead, as the player base moved to newer games in the series.One last thing: you can also unofficially unlock a free Copernicus DLC that was previously PS3 exclusive.

												Apparently I've played AC II Brotherhood way longer then AC II, which already speaks for itself.This game is awesome by all means, and has few improvements and new stuff not witnessed in earlier games of the series:Pros:- Storyline. Still captivating, interesting, with lots of likable and not likable characters. - If AC I was repetitive and AC II not so much, AC II Brotherhood is a mixture of the two, but in a positive way. If you like grinding (like I do, especially in beautiful Roman surroundings), there is a lot of it  (A LOT). And somehow it didn't bore me. On a contrary: additional quests were interesting, many of them different, only some of them felt lazy. Flags are back, and of course feathers and treasure chests. - Game gives you option to either buy maps which point to all the hidden stuff, but you don't have to buy them. You can grind them by yourself. Options are always a good thing.- Environment, architecture, Rome, graphics, music: sometimes you just want to ride around Colosseum with no purpose other then admire stuff around you and in distant perspective.- Eagle vision is still useful!- Leonardo's war machines quest line was one hell of a ride.- You will be able to rebuild assassins brotherhood, recruit your own people, train them and use their help should you choose so. This is a blast. One completely new instalment and it is awesome.Cons:- So many weapons, and majority of it still serves only as collection trophies.- I remember that throwing knives were useful in AC I. Somehow they are not useful here (as they weren't in AC II).- Combat is as it was. I think I got used to it, but it has not been improved. Oh, wait, you can kick people now to break their guard.- Freakin camera angle almost made me pull my hair out during few missions.- There is this new stuff I don't recall from before: full synch. To fully synchronize you are required to finish the memory in given way. Sometimes it will demand from you to take no damage (really? Where's fun in taking no damage?), sometimes it requires you to complete memory in few minutes (forcing you to get back to the location for full discovery which can take three times that long). The only synch requirements I liked were the ones that enforced stealth play (aka. not being detected). But I guess it's a matter of taste.- I don't remember any outstanding bug. Oh, but it's a cons section. I guess I expected them as a ""fun"" part of the game. Ubisoft is bending perspectives ;)Overall: I love this game. Brotherhood is also the first AC  game where you can play online. I have yet to try it, though I'm not very eager at the moment. Heading to part 3 of Ezio trilogy. ",128,23,1,19,2,0,6

												Like its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a better game than its predecessor. It too, has numerous flaws and many shortcomings. While there is one game in this series that really stands out, this one, again, isn't it. What you have here is polished, prettier Assassin's Creed II. I'm not really sure how I logged 117 hours on it. I think some of it was me trying to convince myself that there was more to this game than there really is.In contrast to ACII's sprawling-conspiracy-web story spanned across several cities and decades, here we get a more tension-based story based in one city over about 5 years.That change is for the better, though the story doesn't improve -- we still get the same absurd plans. Befriend the courtesans then use them to acquire an outfit to follow a chest of money back to a party to kill 'The Banker' to cut off Cesare's funds to stop his war effort? What? Get a key to the Castello di Sant'Angelo by befriending the thieves so you can steal outfits to a play so you can sneak into the play so you can save an actor Cesare wants dead so the actor can give you the key? Again, what? The plot is nonsense.Fight Cesare to the death of his neck armor. His neck armor is endless.Particularly painful, and Assassin's Creed as a series is often guilty of this, are the missions where you are assigned the task of killing the primary antagonists early in the game. It is so obvious that you will not succeed in this task and that it will turn into a 'mission-gone wrong' situation that it's painful.Clumsily extending 1 memory in 1 sequence into 5 memories to make the game seem longer than it really is -- pretty common for this game. The soundtrack, while it does use some of AC2's great tracks, develops its own style. This style is sort of a lower, thumping, tension-building sort of music. It works, the game succeeds at developing its own atmosphere apart from AC2.Visually, the game is still gorgeous. The beautiful color saturation and the way the whites and reds stand out in this 1500s depiction of Rome really add to the atmosphere and feel of the game. Rome is great to look at. There is plenty of side content, most of it fun. Christina missions fill in some blank spaces about Ezio's past with Christina in AC2. Leonardo's war machines are entertaining but ridiculous -- destroy Leonardo's machine gun, tank, and air-cannon to stop the Borgia from using them. The followers of Romulus missions are similar to the crypt-exploration missions from AC2. There are also many thief, courtesan, and assassin contracts to undertake.So there is definitely plenty to do. I should warn that most of these things simply have little replay value. The novelty and enjoyment of completing these tasks wears off the first time you do them.The reason for this is that the game is incredibly easy and there is not much way of making it harder. Assassin's Creed has always lacked difficulty settings. In Brotherhood, especially, they would be appreciated. The simple addition of chain kills makes the game so ridiculously easy that some form of higher difficulty is really needed to justify playing through this game again. This is even without using your assassin recruits. However, higher difficulties often involves taking different strategies, new approaches, rethinking how you play the game. Clearly, every task in this game was designed for there to be 1 way to complete it. It's not really all that open in what approach you take.So, in the end, what we have here is a beautiful expansion pack to Assassin's Creed II that outdoes Assassin's Creed II in nearly every way. One can excuse it's horrible story because, well, every game in this series prior to this one also has a horrible story! What did you expect? Pick it up for $10 or less for a good time.

												Assassin`s Creed Brotherhood is a direct sequel to Assassin`s Creed 2.New stuff- You can enter into cities with your horse.- You can whistle for call to a horse, when you click the key ""E"".- You can do assassination from a horse.- You can combine a kill with the main weapon and pistol.- Blood added to.- You can recruit people to the brotherhood from the city, and call them for help when you click the key ""T"".* You can send them to assassinations around the worldwide.* You can improve there skills, change there color suit.- New guns are added to the game.- New Combo kills.Poor:- The combat system become easier and it`s not good at all, becauseit`s make the batlles more EZ to win.- There are some problems with the ""Artificial Intelligence' of the game.General* Good graphics for 2011. * The Sound effects and background music are ok.* Nice story.* A lot of ""side missions"" that you can do.* A huge open world map.* Nice parkour animation.9/10I liked more the ""gameplay"" of AC 2 but... in general ""Assassin`s Creed Brotherhood"" is a good continue to Assassin`s Creed 2.I'm recommend this game.

												+) Epic ending like previous series. Actually more epic. I was in tears.+) Controlling became LITTLE better I suppose? Maybe it was just me who got a little more used to it.+) If I want to finish it, I'd say it's a fun game. However just like the previous series it has serious bugs and aggravating parts. So prepare yourself spilling some harsh language at Etzio. Ezio? Who cares. That stupidly running parkour maniac. PULL FASTER! You will know waht I mean if you play. Hahahahahaha.+) Action became much more efficient and smoothing.+) I liked the graphics. These days games tend to become requiring needlessly high spec PC but I'd say this, The Division, and GTA 5 is where graphics should stop and focus on programming you know? This is enough.-) Too many side quests! What the heck! Did you see the map? How did you even manage to put icons so close to each other like that? Jesus!-) Hey, if you're going to jump whole chunk of story because you spent too much time on side quests, just reduce it and focus on main quests! What the heck are you doing?-) Gliding quest was irritating as my grand mother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. Runs flawlessly. Combat is addictive. The continued plotline is fantastic. Game is let down by an incessant need to upgrade and purchase everything, which distracts from the idea of being an ""assassin"". Or at least for me this felt odd compare to the previous entries in the series. The highlights for me have always been the modern day sections out of the animus. I'd like it more if ubisoft played around a bit more with the character you adopt in the animus rather than fixating on ezio. Sure he's a great character but I'm getting tired and it's obvious that Revelations will still feature Ezio... when I wish they moved on. Still it's their project and not mine, so it's up to them to deliver what they envisage			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Although not as good as it's predecessor in terms of depth and story, Brotherhood is to be considered to be more an expansion than a full game, if you take away pointless side missions and multiplayer (dead) you have a game with half the content than the previous. The combat system is really improved and new game modes are added like recruiting other assassins and territory control by killing captains and burning towers.The city of Rome is massive but not as appealing as Venice or Florence, but that is realistic because Rome in that time period was mostly ruins and old houses.The game finishes up the Borgia arc. It's not as epic as the previous one but it's still a good storyWhat really bugs me is the white gradient on the top of the screen otherwise the graphics improve especially the shadows.The Score:Gameplay: 9/10 (improves a lot, adds more fluidity)Story: 7/10 (Good but short)Graphics: 7/10 (The white gradient prevents from being 9)Setting: 7/10 (Rome is realistic but too much of the same, several cities is better)Innovation: 8/10 (several new modes are added to the game)Overall: 7.6 If you loved AC2 buy this one but expect more of an expansion than a really fresh game.

 And this game is considere to be the best AC game ever? AJAJAJAJAJA, don't make me laugh. It is not a bad game, nor a great one neither.PROS:- Good graphics for the release year.- A charismatic protagonist.- It is fun, sometimes.- I like the economy mechanic, but it is so unreal.- It is a beautiful game.NEUTRAL:- The soundtrack isn't remarkably good, but not remarkably bad neither.- The open world isn't a great deal.- Voice acting. CONS:- Not very good story.- Boring gameplay.- Ubisoft.- Uplay.- You don't play as Altair.Basicaly it is the same of all the years, nothing really shines in Brotherhood, but still is fun, so, yes, i recommend it.RATING: 50/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man, a Assassin's creed game from back when they were still good, and not just mediocre. There isn't much at all to say, if your a fan of these games, you'll be a fan of this one. I personally still think the second one is better, but this one isn't too far off. The game is fun, beautiful, has an engaging plot, and even sound nice. I can't say anything about this one is bad, but I can say it isn't quite as good as the two that cam before it.			",189,25,2,15,3,0,4

 And this game is considere to be the best AC game ever? AJAJAJAJAJA, don't make me laugh. It is not a bad game, nor a great one neither.PROS:- Good graphics for the release year.- A charismatic protagonist.- It is fun, sometimes.- I like the economy mechanic, but it is so unreal.- It is a beautiful game.NEUTRAL:- The soundtrack isn't remarkably good, but not remarkably bad neither.- The open world isn't a great deal.- Voice acting. CONS:- Not very good story.- Boring gameplay.- Ubisoft.- Uplay.- You don't play as Altair.Basicaly it is the same of all the years, nothing really shines in Brotherhood, but still is fun, so, yes, i recommend it.RATING: 50/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although not as good as it's predecessor in terms of depth and story, Brotherhood is to be considered to be more an expansion than a full game, if you take away pointless side missions and multiplayer (dead) you have a game with half the content than the previous. The combat system is really improved and new game modes are added like recruiting other assassins and territory control by killing captains and burning towers.The city of Rome is massive but not as appealing as Venice or Florence, but that is realistic because Rome in that time period was mostly ruins and old houses.The game finishes up the Borgia arc. It's not as epic as the previous one but it's still a good storyWhat really bugs me is the white gradient on the top of the screen otherwise the graphics improve especially the shadows.The Score:Gameplay: 9/10 (improves a lot, adds more fluidity)Story: 7/10 (Good but short)Graphics: 7/10 (The white gradient prevents from being 9)Setting: 7/10 (Rome is realistic but too much of the same, several cities is better)Innovation: 8/10 (several new modes are added to the game)Overall: 7.6 If you loved AC2 buy this one but expect more of an expansion than a really fresh game.

												Sadly this is the final decent game in my opinion from the Assasins Creed Francise- Not only did it carry with it everything that was great from the previous 2 games but it added more game machanics and improved on what AC 1 and 2 brought to the table. I felt this was outstanding and an original masterpiece in it's own right - a game that stood on it's own completly. This is an all time classic and deserves to get a 9.5 out of 10. Sadly after playing all AC titles after this, they all suffered greatly from the cash grab syndrome, being released with numorous bugs glitches and sound desync bugs otherwise known as rush jobs.

												This game I thought had been just as good as Assassin's Creed II, with the exception that some of the scaleable walls don't look so obvious anymore, the graphics have improved since the last game, but does not make it easy to see knobs at all times. Sometimes there are weird camera angles, making it hard for trick jumps where they are required and controls get a bit mixed up with the camera angle as it is. Dying clothes and capes requires money, which wasn't required in the previous game. You can now have execution streaks which are always dead useful when you're surrounded, counters are now 100% guaranteed to work everytime. Some of the viewpoints are at the top of the Borgia Towers (makes sense) but Borgia Towers that are lv5 will have Captains that will run, which was a pain to catch. Lastly, the Armor of Brutus (the best armor in the game) just doesn't look very nice to me, Altair's Armor had been swag, but Armor of Brutus....eh. All in all, this was a great game and definitely should be fun for those new to the Assassin's Creed series, but if you are new, I suggest you start from Assassin Creed II since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a direct afterward of Assassin's Creed II			",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Honestly in my opinion so far one of the worst of the Assassin's Creed games for perfectionists and myself here is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Also probably gonna ignore multiplayer for this game and all other AC's so forgive me.WARNING:Contains SpoilersSTORY:Again you assume the role of Desmond Miles as he,Lucy,Rebecca,and Shaun head to Ezio's villa to escape Abstergo. You find the room where Ezio had attained Altair's armour and set up shop here but not without doing a little mission. After that you assume Ezio once again going into his final memorie where he fought the main antagonist of the game Cesare Borgia but Desmond is locked out of the memory. Just like AC1 he must go through the earlier memories before he can go back to the final one. This story honestly is one of the best, second to AC2 and better than Revelations it's gone it's own deaths, accomplishes, twists and turns. Again it wasn't as good as AC2's story but at least it was better than Revelation's story.7.9/10GRAPHICS: The graphics here are better than AC2, cleaner textures, better frames, ect. It's great for it's age (2010) and still in my opinion hasn't dated yet.9/10GAMEPLAY:Oh boy here we go where do I even start.......the gameplay was okay? If I just spill it out this game made me ragequit it multiple times, not for the main missions but for the side missions. The tank mission was horrible, one hit and you were done you couldn't get hit once or your full sync would fail. The young at heart sucked too, and those side missions where you only had 6 minutes to complete the mission or no full sync. Also to clarify, full sync is supposed to represent how Ezio did completed his missions and side missions but honestely Ubisoft shouldn't have integrated this yet because there was extreme difficulty issues in some missions. Yeah it would be a breeze for normal fans, but full sync fans would learn that the levels did not suit for full sync, they had to find that out the hard way and it was a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sorry for the rant but the other gameplay elements are at least better than this, with you calling out Assassin's and taking out your enemies like a boss you truly feel like a grandmaster assassin also mentioning finding items to get armor, fast poison ect was stupid on Ubisoft's part too.6.5/10CONCLUSION: AC:B was honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There was too difficult side missions, finding ridiculus items to get other items, and full sync. But it balances this by putting in a good story, calling assassins and new gear and weapons but I still can't forgive it's frustratingness and hopefully I won't play this game again.BUY RANK:1-2 (Putting this in because the game is like 20 bucks)			",169,30,0,30,4,2,1

												One of the best assassin creed games. This is pretty much assassins creed 2 but with the added ability of gaining more members for your brotherhood by saving them from templars.Also there is multiplayer but noone plays it anymore so dont bother.And i dont know why everyone's complaning about uplay, I just put in the code and its done. The added ability to get outfits and weapons in the game for uplay points is cool as well.I should also mention that you should not get the dulexe edition unless you want 2 admittedly cool characters for multiplayer but noone plays it so theirs no point, you get a outfit for singleplayer, and also the songtrack of the game,and some more singleplayer maps.8/10 Get it on sale			",142,5,3,3,6,1,2

												It's legitimately better than Assassin's Creed II.  While Assassin's Creed II may have had more locales to explore, Brotherhood's single locale is straight up better.

So as far as environments go, it blows II out of the water.Now I know you all like bullet points, so let me run some bullet points on you.ProsThe environment, which I already said, is supreme.Investing in Rome gives the game staying power, and the collectibles are more fun to search for.It's more of the same.ConsIt's more of the same.Ridiculously buggy.

												A lovely game and a worthy sequel to Assassins Creed 2. The main plot is a little shorter than the previous game but the actual missions are more varied and fun. The game world is absolutely packed to the brim with various missions and sidequests that are extremely entertaining and completing them becomes addictive. The single player should last over 30 hours easily. It's missing the magic and freshness that AC2 had but it is a better game in basically every other respect.			",789,294,26,123,81,5,113

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood, hmmm.. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a Wholesome Gory, Enjoyable and Deadly Stabbing frenzy through Roma. Set in Renaissance Italy spanning 7 years of Ezio's life (1500-1507). Assassins Creed 2 was a work of art so naturally Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows in its footsteps and the style of combat is the same but improved drastically. Perhaps the best edition to ACB is Assassin Recruits. Assassin recruits are like Ezios entorauge, as you explore Roma you gain the chance to recruit new brothers into the brotherhood, hence the name. The story takes off from AC2 and Ezio must kill Ceasre Borgia. Along the way you must assassinate lower ranking Templars and work your way up.This is the best Assassins Creed game yet to come in my opinion. 9/10			",31,3,0,9,7,0,1

												This game is tremendously fun. The single player campaign provided me with over 80 hours of entertainment (I'm somewhat of a completionist), and even after that, I just had fun free-running across the enormous open-world map. The storyline is extremely interesting and I don't have a reason to dislike this game. The combat is also extremely satisfying, with chaining kills together being easy to learn, but difficult to master.Overall, this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite franchises.

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood, hmmm.. Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a Wholesome Gory, Enjoyable and Deadly Stabbing frenzy through Roma. Set in Renaissance Italy spanning 7 years of Ezio's life (1500-1507). Assassins Creed 2 was a work of art so naturally Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows in its footsteps and the style of combat is the same but improved drastically. Perhaps the best edition to ACB is Assassin Recruits. Assassin recruits are like Ezios entorauge, as you explore Roma you gain the chance to recruit new brothers into the brotherhood, hence the name. The story takes off from AC2 and Ezio must kill Ceasre Borgia. Along the way you must assassinate lower ranking Templars and work your way up.This is the best Assassins Creed game yet to come in my opinion. 9/10			",31,3,0,9,7,0,1

												A lovely game and a worthy sequel to Assassins Creed 2. The main plot is a little shorter than the previous game but the actual missions are more varied and fun. The game world is absolutely packed to the brim with various missions and sidequests that are extremely entertaining and completing them becomes addictive. The single player should last over 30 hours easily. It's missing the magic and freshness that AC2 had but it is a better game in basically every other respect.			",789,294,26,123,81,5,113

												One of the best assassin creed games. This is pretty much assassins creed 2 but with the added ability of gaining more members for your brotherhood by saving them from templars.Also there is multiplayer but noone plays it anymore so dont bother.And i dont know why everyone's complaning about uplay, I just put in the code and its done. The added ability to get outfits and weapons in the game for uplay points is cool as well.I should also mention that you should not get the dulexe edition unless you want 2 admittedly cool characters for multiplayer but noone plays it so theirs no point, you get a outfit for singleplayer, and also the songtrack of the game,and some more singleplayer maps.8/10 Get it on sale			",142,5,3,3,6,1,2

												This is a fun game, but the community is horrid and the single-player in my opinion was boring. Multi-player is a lot of fun but people seem to be.. cheating somehow? Or at a higher rank you have ridiculous spy capabilities.. that in itself, ruin the multiplayer? It's.. odd. Anyways. It's fun, but meh. Community kind of ruins it. It's also at least since last I was on, kind of dead. great FUN with FRIENDS. I don't recommend playing online with random people though. With friends yes, online, no. Maybe you'll get lucky though, who knows. I enjoy it though. Multiplayer anyways. :D			",581,165,13,87,43,8,76

Rome, a big city, beautifully build and atmospheric. The characters are well made and known.It was a little bit too big I just couldnt achieve everything.Completion time about 25 hours.

												After completing the first AC and second AC I had to move on the third installment. At the moment I think this was one of the least orginal of the series being heavily influenced by the second game. I feel like it is more of a just an improvment from the last game, yet the game really stands to be great. The graphics are better, the characters still remain people you can connect to, and the scenery of course is excellent. Good game, really recommend this series.			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

Because it doesn't show how much I LOVE THIS GAME! Now, before playing this I played every other Assassin's Creed title on the Xbox360... clearly it didn't do it justice, the assassin's creed stories were amazing on the console yes... But the PC was a whole other level! And some of the graphics modifications for Brotherhood online just make me wish I lived in 1500 Rome.			",110,24,4,11,22,2,9

												If you like the Assassin's Creed games, you'll want this one.  It's the best.  Ubisoft has backed off the DRM debacle a bit, so feel free to grab this when it goes on sale.  It probably won't sell for less than $20 for a long while, so that's a good buying point.			",549,178,17,88,37,2,93

												Probably important to note that this game (as I found out after 3 hours of downloading) is not compatible with windows 10, and will crash before even getting into the game. I'm sure it's a wonderful game, but unfortunately I will not be finding that out myself.			",14,1,0,1,2,0,1

												I waited 5 hours to download  8GB worth of data only to find out that I could not play this game..I do not recommend this game simply because Uplay (the system by which assassins creed brotherhood is launched from) crashes incessantly when I want to play it........Which is a real shame because this particular stealthy variant of Assassins creed looked like so much fun to play!It's ridiculous that I can't play a good 2011 game in 2014. I'll try troubleshooting launching this game again tomorrow........Will probably uninstall it if unsuccessful..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here ends my personal journey with Assassin's Creed, having completed the trilogy and now Brotherhood.  And what a beast of a game, a series.  Was it worth my time, you ask?  Let's start at the beginning.Space expanded rapidly.  Particles gathered into hydrogen atoms, stars and planets were formed, and Assassin's Creed was made.  I played that game and loved it.  It was impressive technically and visually, on a level that only millions of dollars could produce, and perhaps more astonishing was the total commitment to their freerunning system.  Ubisoft promised players could freely climb and scale virtually any solid object in the game, and I say they knocked it out-of-the-park on their first go.  Not everyone agrees with me.  A lot of folks complained that it was too repetitive (a peeve of mine, but that's another tale).Cue the sequels and I'm utterly baffled.  You see, freerunning is the CORE of Assassin's Creed, its bread and butter, its heart and soul.  Almost everything you do somehow involves climbing on things.  Taking the original game as a successful prototype, with the primary complaint being that people want more of it, the natural path is to focus on the one thing that defines the game and use it to springboard to something more.  But every game in the series has taken bizarre 90-degree turns that don't add up to anything.  Consider:""There's a rad freerunning system and now you can construct a brothel in your villa!""""There's a rad freerunning system and now there's a simulated economy!""""There's a rad freerunning system and now you can play bocce ball with George Washington!""...And the games are praised to high heavens.  Is this what people really want?  It's a crying shame that the core gameplay remains constant while getting buried under a mountain of crap.  Are layered mechanics not more interesting than disconnected ones?  Meanwhile, almost every activity can be reduced to ""go to the waypoint marker and/or beat up some guys"".  The problem is the freerunning, and to some extent the combat, really carries the game.  Your fun is absolutely dependent on whether these two things are compelling enough on their own.And therein lies the crux of why I think the Assassin's Creed series as a whole, stinks, because they can boiled down to nothing.  ""Go here"" involves holding two buttons and pointing the stick toward the waypoint.  ""Beating up guys"" involves repeatedly pressing attack and occasionally pressing block as an enemy strikes.  Following this strategy will get you through most of the game.  Perhaps one could say the game is just too easy.  I used the stock hidden blades throughout the whole game, and never felt the need to purchase any weapons, upgrades, or gadgets (except for DaVinci's climbing gloves, bless his heart).Occassionally you will sense that Assassin's Creed wants to be a stealth game, and I think it could be an outstanding one, except it bungles this as well.  The game falls into the very unforgiving trap of instant failure if you are detected at all, even if you stab a guy through the throat as he glimpses you upon his dying breath.  More perplexing design decisions abound.  Don't get caught freerunning or the Roman Rooftop Gestapo will get you!  Why punish players for climbing and exploring?Of course the story context is a monster in itself.  Apparently Ubisoft was so wowed by their own material that they felt it acceptable to ram the story down players' throats.  The sheer quantity and length of cutscenes is unreal.  Now I ain't no literary scholar, but I think the writing throughout the Assassin's Creed series is abysmal.  You spend so much time watching one-dimensional characters standing around yakking endlessly about some garbage you don't care about.  Every other line of dialogue is contrived to get you to ""go"" and ""kill"", and there just isn't a story being told, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't constantly interrupt the game.  You can hardly pick your nose without it bookended by boring cinematics.The main conflict feels equally contrived.  Antagonists are either ridiculously villanous or guilty by association.  Of course you hardly ever see any of the alleged wrongdoing -- you're just told that person X is ""corrupt"" for vague reasons and they have an unfriendly disposition when you meet them in person.  I also can't get past the grand irony of the evil Templars condemned by the rightous ""Assassins"".  They fight back by murdering hundreds of people.  Other moments of brilliance are wasted.  Fallen foes, in their dying moments, try to get you to understand their motivation, their ideology.  But Ezio doesn't care.  He doesn't reflect upon or question his choices.  There's no personal growth; the story takes no risks.  It's just... flat.  The overarching sci-fi plot is actually quite interesting but so sparse that it hardly matters.I probably ought to explain my beef with cutscenes.  They never sit right with me, but they are the most obvious way to tell a story.  The nature of authorship is such that it conflicts with input from the audience.  The more input, the less control the author has.  Thus, taking control away from players is the most direct approach.  I'm fine with this, but I begin to take issue when cutscenes are used as a crutch for sloppy game design.There's a depressing trend among modern games to take the mechanics and tease out narrow, compartmentalized segments of gameplay, which are then shuffled throughout the experience.  The result is a game which is ultimately simpler, more predictable, and presumably easier to develop.  The first example that comes to mind is the Tomb Raider reboot, and the game suffers for it.  You are either climbing things or shooting things, but never both.  However, Tomb Raider is somewhat forgiven because it smoothly transitions between gameplay segments with smart level design, pacing, context, etc.  Assassin's Creed, on the other hand, glues together disjointed segments of gameplay with cutscenes, jerking you all over the place.  Cutscene - CHASE - cutscene - KILL - cutscene - FOLLOW - cutscene - KILL... I hate this.  It's like Warioware without the creativity (or fun).  This is how you can tell a game's design is oversimplified.If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game, it may be too late for you.  There was a day when the freerunning was cutting-edge and the sci-fi story was a surprise.  My advice is to play the original because it's the most ""pure"" experience and the medival setting really fits.  Otherwise, ask yourself ""can the freerunning carry my enjoyment for another 10-20 hours?"".  Gamers will always mentally strip away a game's fluff and reduce its moving parts to an abstract model, and at this point Assassin's Creed immediately goes stale.  It just doesn't have enough complexity to last beyond the initial novelty.  Sure, the game is punctuated by interesting moments in its enormous story, but these moments are mere hydrogen atoms in the vastness of space.			",155,40,1,11,4,0,5

												I couldn't get past the part where you're running through the underground place with that girl in modern times. Not because it was too challenging, but because it was unbelievably boring puzzle platforming, frustrating when you would fall and have to start over, and it NEVER ENDED! Rubbish!

												I just couldn't be bothered to finish this. Assassin's Creed 2 was long and tedious enough that even a fistfight with the Pope and a crazy twist ending barely justified it, and here we're right back to the map-clearing trudge. I might be missing another wacky ending or a multiplayer mode that does a nice reimplimentation of The Ship, but the core of the game is so tired at this point that I simply can't reccomend it.Play the first one instead, at least that one has tension and some charm between the sloppy mechanics.

												This game had a lot going for it but for me, fell flat everywhere. The story was more convoluted and even harder to follow than in Assassins Creed 2, and had one of what I consider the laziest cliches where there's an enemy (who I still don't know what his name is) you have to kill but all he does is run away and is always just barely out of your grasp until the final fight. The final fight was pretty cool, but it was a little sad having to wait around 15 hours for that.Like Assassins Creed 2 there's some secret caves you can explore to unlock some cool armor, but unlike in Assassins Creed 2 by the time you get all these caves unlocked, the end of the game is just a few missions away. It's hardly worth using that awesome armor when you've already done everything in game. They also managed to make the menus even worse than the previous two games, and while Brotherhood definitely isn't as obvious of a console port as Assassins Creed 2 the horrendous map mechanics make me wish I was playing with the terrible console port controls of 2.And finally, the ending (while good) was totally ruined by 18 yes 18 minutes of unskippable credits. It doesn't count as you finishing the game unless you sit through all 18 minutes, but I don't care enough to see whatever post-credit scene there might be so I just closed the game after using my phone for 5 minutes and realizing the credits weren't going to end anytime soon.It's sad that just minor things like this really downed my feelings on Brotherhood. It's ambitions compared to the last two and may even have more things to do in it than Assassins Creed 2, even if it's in a smaller world, but the all over the place story and honestly just the credits made me dislike this game in the end. If you're planning on playing all the Assassins Creed games then this review won't stop you from playing Brotherhood but if you want to get Brotherhood on its own, I don't think it's worth it.

												// This game is just wounderfull, everything is good with it. Buy it now! // 31st of December 13I have decided to re-make this review since, originally, I just wrote it because I saw a negative review of this game. So here goes!Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place just where the second game ends, making it a direct sequel. In this game you still relive the memories of your ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In the real world however, things change a bit. Desmond and the crew have moved the entire operation to Monteriggioni, the town that Ezio's family had earlier lived in. This means that you can, at any given time, exit out of the Animus and wander around in the real world. This is a nice edition, but is sadly not that well made as there are little to none things to do.The gameplay of this installment has been improved from the previous games. The fighting is well made and you will feel a sense of progression as enemies will be easier to defeat as your skill goes up. Also combos have been introduced, making fighting 2+ enemies will not feel as rubish anymore. But fighting is only have the game, of cource the climbing has been improved. This is not as noticable though, as it was good in the older games aswell. This game features alot of quests, aside from the main storyline, that are well fitted into the story and helps you get a better understanding on how Ezio was as a person. The most well made once were the once featuring no one else that your friend, Leonardo da Vinci. He is back with long, well made mission for you to complete. But not only that, he also sells you items that will spice up the gameplay, giving you tons of new options on how to do thing.Generaly speaking this game is a masterpiece in the Assassin's Creed series. The story is great, you will come to care about the characters, the gameplay mechanics are improved, still same stunning visuals as the last game. Basically a worthy sequel that was not made to cash in on the Assassin's Creed name.			",92,7,0,7,11,3,8

 Assassin's Creed Brotherhood  It's not a great title. The game is just a big DLC/expansion, with a lot of unusefull stuff sold a full price. The story is bad, only Cesare is a good character, the gameplay is a copy-paste of the previous one and the online is really really bad. The ""new"" stuff in the game are all secondary things that don't really give a reason to call this a new Title. The only thing that's truly good is the location (Rome 1500).			",131,14,4,12,13,0,14

												One of the most broken games I've played. When I heard that people thought this game was great I had high hopes, however it appears to be the worst of all the series.-I had a section of the game that if I failed stealth the game would crash.-The cannon section at the start is incredibly unforgiving.-The port is terrible and controls make no sense. (for those of you just saying I should play with a controler, this proves its a bad port and the only thing a controller fixes is this part.)-A gap that Ezio can cross one time won't work the next time you try it.-I jumped onto a ledge with a horse that was about 30cm (12"") of the ground and it couldn't get off the ledge.-The camera changes to an awkward angle the worst moments and the slightest movement of the mouse makes it look like a 2year old with a handy cam. -While the camera changes the directions don't work the way you would expect and you can often jump to your death.This is a buggy piece of Bovine Fecal Matter and unless you care about the overall Assassin's Creed story avoid at all costs.

												Don't buy this game on PC.I had high hopes for it, as my friends had told me that it was one of the best of the AC series. However, on PC, it's just a blatant and extremely badly executed console port, to the point that you can tell with ease.Combat is clunky to the extreme, controls are the worst I've seen (and they are entirely uncustomisable beyond the three profiles you're given at the start), parkour is disappointing (just hold down the run button and point towards where you want to go), and it's very poorly optimised. Oh, and you have to debug Uplay before you can launch the game for the first time.For once, I suggest you just buy it on a console if you really want to play the game. The story was alright before I became entirely fed up with the controls and poor optimisation, so I would hope that these issues are not present on the console version.			",108,17,5,5,8,1,9

This is my opinion of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood   Aspect Rating   Story 8.0   Graphics 8.0   Sound 9.0   Gameplay 8.0   Overall 8.3 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average A step up from Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, The city of Rome comes to life in incredible detail. Animations and character models are beautiful. Controls are nearly identical to previous iterations of the franchise, although combat mechanics have been greatly improved. Fans of the last game will notice some familiar tunes, but the score as a whole suits the action well. Voice acting is solid. With the new ability to switch between memories, a plethora of side-missions, and an engaging multiplayer component, there is no shortage of content here.			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												a great game that brings back many memories. although it gets me thinking as to how is it that i'm getting frame drops between 15-33fps every single damn time i start to play the game in open world and it stays between 13-29fps on previews. it bugs me aas i have an intel hd 5500u gpu and a core i5 duo with 2.7ghz max and 8gb ram!! it's an old game but really, it requires more than what i got? it's rediculous! i tried running on very low settings and still get the sme results and very high as in maxing everything out is the same except i get little flashes as if my game will crash. it does not skip when running down to 15fps but rather good enouph yt it still frustrates me at the thought of it. i recommend this game if you love the series and if you have the hardware. i'll be keeping this copy, but i just hope AC3 won't dissapoint in framerate as well.

												Assasin's Creed Brotherhood is a very exciting game, where you live and breath as Ezio Auditore, the legendary assasin. I like how Assasin's Creed Brotherhood has used colourful and good graphics. I also like how Assasin's Creed has used many fashionable assasination moves, i.e if you press f, you lock in a target and air assasinate it.  Overall, the game is well made, and I especially like the graphical effects. This game is totally awesome! I recommend you to play this game!			",13,1,0,1,1,0,0

												For me, this was the best part of the AC series. It surpassess ACII mechanics of combat and movement in almost every way and even now, years after its publishing is still a lot of fun to play. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy and entetained and there is the synchronization system and collectibles which add a little more. The plot is the weakest point, sadly, not due to low quality, but because it seems so short. It is also a shame that you cannot explore monteregioni anymore, and while you do get your own base, it just isn't the same. The BEST thing about the game is the world, which is open and well designed. Walking, running and climbing through rome is a joy, the finest city experience any part of the game has served up yet. It is a shame that the multiplayer isn't active anymore, but u guess that's just how it is.Summing up, i recommend this game. The best argument i can find is that it really is a very enjoyable gaming experience, and really, isn't that what matters?			",122,46,1,23,9,2,5

												It was exactly what I expected it to be: a continuation of the second one. Again, fantastic story, amazing music, good graphics, it keeps the same style of the second one. The gameplay is pretty much exactly the same. The real kicker for this one is the actual brotherhood system; being able to pick and choose your allies and stuff, it's really neat and engaging. Also this game had a totally kickass ending. All in all, 9.5/10. On to Revalations! :D			",296,67,5,19,14,2,17

												Only unity ranks worse than this game, 90% of the fights involve ezio in the attack stance and no attacking, but just watching, This is what happens when you map the attack button to the button that enables you to do things like attack people, if you let go, you can't attack, but while your pressing it, you can't attack either. Also, once you enter a battle, you can't leave, there no no such option as running away, even though the entire first mission is comprised of you running away. This is a complete piece of sht. Also, the game crashes everytime I try to leave it. Guess it can't even handle it's own awfulness.			",1393,509,58,124,166,15,202

The fact that the assassins are recruted by him and they can be sent on missions around Europe is one of the best things and the only game where u have that much controll over your assasins. It was a pleasure to play it for the first time and the same way it was a pleasure to play it recently.			",16,0,0,2,4,0,6

												AC:B is IMO the peak of ACs storyline. I loved every corner of Rome^^ If you are, like me, more a fan of good storytelling nad want to explore regions you may not be able to see quit soon just do yourself a favor (yeah, I don't like UPlay either..) and buy it. Personally my last recommendation for a AC titel.			",207,52,3,35,16,3,25

												You don't buy this game for the gameplay. It plays almost exactly the same as the previous games. You should only get this game if you are interested in the story. It is a bit of a filler but it builds on Ezio's and Desmond's characters quite well. I think it's worth the money (during a sale though) if you're into the Assassin's Creed story.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----I'm basing my rating on the game being part of a larger whole of the series. I do not recommend playing this game on it's own.Story: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 2.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 3.5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 2.5/5Music: 4/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												6/10Fairly dissappointed. The story campaign was not as expected. Controls are obviously not optimized for PC gameplay, although still playable. Combat system improved since previous titles but not as good as the new ones. Parkour system is awful. Missions (including side missions) are too repetetive. Story length is equivalent to other AC games. It's honestly not as ""epic"" as the trailer makes it seem like it is.			",23,3,0,1,1,0,0

												At first, I was confused with the multiplayer addition ‚Äì I thought all those awesome guys on the cover are to be assassins, alas, they are your targets in singleplayer portion of the game. Despite this, the real brotherhood was something new and experimental. As usual, I would list the best points from the game:Multiplayer is innovative, not your usual killing, it‚Äôs stalking, hunting and chasing. It had its drawbacks, not stable servers, for instance. What I like most about this part is that everybody provides different animation for a different weapon, no two weapons or techniques are the same.Assassin brotherhood is a huge innovation, since Ezio is Il Mentore now. Even though the apprentices appear out of thin air sometimes, it is still interesting to have them by your side.Comparing to the previous game, it became more saturated in terms of colours. The previous game literally pales in comparison. Here everything is rich ‚Äì from the colours of the robes to the landscapes of the levels.In my opinion, this game has the weakest soundtrack from the series, save for some tracks, it is quite repetitive (I believe this is due to the fact that we are in the same city and the need to differentiate does not arise).Also, because of unknown reasons (only in Steam version), two missions are bugged - the final mission, unable to interact with Cesare after climbing the siege tower, and locked controls during flying the bomber. Don't know if I am the only one who encountered this problem.Still, it is a good sequel to Ezio story, recommend it.			",43,3,0,4,1,0,2

												In spite of the hours I've logged on AC:B and ACII, don't be fooled: only about half of those hours are worth the playing. Most of all the AC games involves running around and trying to avoid being attacked by guards, who seem to spawn just in time to complicate your escape. The storyline and actual missions are great, but they tend to be variations on the same basic types: tail someone. Assassinate someone without being detected. Hold down W + RMB + SHFT indefnitely (what the game calls ""freerunning""). AC:B seems to be particularly annoying with regards to how the controls and freerunning works: sometimes Ezio will leap off a tall building even though you told him to walk cautiously in the opposite direction, and sometimes he will lock on to something you didn't even know was there and save your hide before you even realized it was in danger. There are also several annoying features of the game, like the camera switching perspective, which throws off the direction Ezio moves in.			",103,11,0,14,9,3,19

												I've got a bit of a love hate relationship wth this game. I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but found myself frustrated with the mechanics of this game on a regular basis. It is in many ways an improvement on ACII, the addition of assassin recruits that you can call to assist when fighting is awesome. The story is also solid, both animus and Desmond arcs, even if there aren't many targets for Ezio to kill (outside of the optional side quests). And the addition of parachutes is great as you don't nhave to worry about falling to your death when you accidently fall from the top of the Colloseum.However there in lies one of many things that are a niggle aboput this game. The movement is a back step from ACII. Oftenwhen trying to free run Ezio will either jump in the wrong direction, miss a leap of faith or sometimes just stop entirely and star hopping up and down on the spot. Add to this the you will often find that your weapon has been dissarmed and replaced with fists and in one of the Leonardo warmachine levels your vechicle stops responding to your input and this game becomes as frustrating as it is satisfying.I'm still going to reccomend this game as there are so many more games out there that are worse than Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is full of redeeming qualities. That said I would advise against paying full price and look to get it when it's on sale.6.5/10			",66,6,5,0,2,0,1

												Hi again, last time I was reviewing Rogue (AC) and now time for Brotherhood!!!So, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood have epic and intresting story of Ezio Auditore. It takes place in Monteriggioni, small, peaceful city, but peaceful for not so long. Game itself have great graphic and clear details. Characters there are awsome (as in every AC series). But Now, let's see + and - :Good:+Great Graphic+Superb story+Amazing Fights+Epic Brotherhood+City is a great parkour place+MultiplayerNow, Bad stuff:-Extra short story-Some missions are boring or easy-MemesSo Buy this awsome game if you wish to join Ezio brotherhood!!!!

												I'm pretty sure I bought this on a summer sale when I was like 13.From what I remember of AC:B on my old Playstation, it's basically just AC2 except with one big city (Rome) instead of a bunch of smaller cities and that the Rome map isn't that great.If you're looking to get an Assassins Creed game, just get 2 or Revelations.

												Assassin's Creed Broterhood is at its core not a bad game, but it has a few too many flaws in order for me to be able to recommend it to anyone who does not intend to play it just for the story.Pros:-The main city is quite big and well made-Logical continuation of the story-The parkour feels really satisfying, when it works-A good amount of sidequests and other activitesCons:-When the parkour does not work, it's quite frustrating-Highly inconsistent controls-Broken economy-Simplistic combat and overlong kill animations-Rushed endingAssassin's Creed Brotherhood starts right where Assassin's Creed 2 left, and the makers of the game seem to take for granted that you've played the previous game. The gameplay in Brotherhood is nigh identical to that of Assassin's Creed 2, and that sadly also means that they did not bother fixing some of the flaws that that game had.A core part of what makes the Assassin's Creed games is the parkour system. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop can be a real joy, and many of the missions also have lengthy parkour elements. The system is not without its flaws though, the game sometimes has a hard time telling where you want to jump, and decides to jump to something to the side rather than straight ahead, resulting in some embarrassing deaths. It's at least not as bad as it was in Assassin's Creed 1, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. The game designers also decided to lock the camera at some points during these parkour segments, but as movement is relative to the camera, when the camera locks at an awkward angle (and it always does), jumping in the right direction becomes harder than it should be.One flaw that seem to have become bigger with the introduction of some new elements is the problem with the inconsistent controls. Most games would simply have a ""use"" key that you would press when using levers, opening doors, talking to people, looting bodies  and opening chests, but Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has 3 different keys that is being used here. E, Shift and the dreaded ""any key"" (which can be a hassle if you're close to the object and intend to run in any direction). And it's not entirely consistent about which key you're supposed to use at any given moment. This is made even more annoying by the fact that tutorial message that tell you very basic things keep popping up through the entire game, which covers the button prompts. Attacking is also a bit inconsistent.  For most attacks, the left mouse button is used, like in any other game, but when using cannons (and other more exotic mounted weapons), it's suddenly the right mouse button that is used instead. This inconsistency makes no sense, as the left mouse button is not used at all during these segments. When mounting or dismounting things (boats, horses & cannons) there is again an inconsistency in regards to what button you're supposed to press. Shift, space and the left mouse button are all used for this. Finally, when using the crossbow or pistol you suddenly aim with WASD and can't control the camera at all, which makes those weapons really awkward to use. The story is for the most part quite nice, for an action game. What's going on makes sense within the confines of the universe and most of the characters also behave in a relatively believable way. The voice actors that voice the major characters do a good job at portraying them. Sadly the later parts of the game feel rushed and the story end up feeling a bit disjointed towards the end, jumping from place to place with no logical transition. It felt like I missed several cutscenes during the final 2 hours of the game. The level design of these parts also show signs of being rushed, as I found 3 spots where I got stuck (without looking for them) during chapter 7 alone. Getting stuck in the level geometry is generally a sign of lack of playtesting.Finally, the economy system is just as broken in Brotherhood as it was in Assassin's Creed 2. The game showers you with money as soon as you've started to make a few investments, and money ends up being a non-issue, to the point where it might as well not be there in the first place. In closing, I find it very hard to actually recommend Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to anyone. While it has its share of good elements, it also has quite a few problems that make what otherwise would have been a good action game a so-so one. There are just too many better games out there for Brotherhood to be worth playing, unless you're just playing it to get the complete Assassin's Creed story.			",1471,542,60,221,169,15,312

												There are three reasons why I cannot recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood; chief of which is how there's not enough new content for this to qualify as anything more than a DLC. No new notable characters have been introduced, additions to gameplay are minor and differences to the script similarly so: you essentially lose everything from Assassin's Creed 2 during the prologue and spend the rest of the game trying to build back your base of operation. Meaning, don't begin your Assassin's Creed experience from this title onwards because you start immediately as Assassin's Creed 2 drops off; so yes, spoilers.Secondly, one of the defining aspects of the game (specifically, the brotherhood of assassins whom you recruit) works entirely by a time-passage mechanic.  If Assassin's Creed 2 allowed you to cheat the system by waiting so as to gain additional income, Brotherhood sends your assassin recruits away on missions where success is based entirely on a percentage, with no involvement on your part.Third, although I love how your missions now have additional challenges, autosaving on your failures and the inability to skip cutscenes are just artificial obstacles that any game producer respectful of their customers would've removed already. Neither can you skip the end credits, and the game won't acknowledge you've finished the story until the whole 20 minute thing has passed. Alt-tabbing pauses the credits.Production was so lazy, it warped the whole story stupid. They've copy-pasted the villa restoration system from 2, but it's one thing to rebuild a decrepit villa so as to attract tourists and another one entirely to renovate ROME. You wage war on the open seas against battle ships sculling about your little gondola oar, because of course they kept the gondola and they couldn't be arsed in building an appropriate boat. I should add that the filler returns WITH A VENGEANCE: the missions I don't mind, it's the list of tasks such as ""kill 20 guards with a crossbow while undetected"" which are nothing but a chore. Expect around 40 of those.So don't do like I did and buy a whole bunch of discounted Assassin's Creed products in bulk, but pick and choose amongst the goodish ones. Or imagine everyone lived happily ever after the events of Assassin's Creed 2. That works too.			",62,3,0,4,1,2,13

This game installs another launcher (ubisoft launcher), and I believe it requires an internet connection. Ubisoft is everything wrong with PC gaming. Never giving them another dime.

Seems to happen right during complex portions of a memory or fight with lots of soldiers. Also, the keyboard doesn't work on startup more than half the times I start the game.

												NOTE: this is a review of the singleplayer, not the multiplayer, and I have also completed the main story and did a few of the side misssions.This game has some good points, so I'll go over them first.In ACB, the graphics have been slighly upgraded from ACII, so you'll still be able to run it if you have a way way weak PC, which is good, and the story for the most part is quite fluid and follows on nicely from ACII. The combat, IMO, is still great with a few added improvements.But then, This game, to me, falls on so many levels compared to Assassins Creed II.First, the map you play in, Rome. Rome seems to feel more empty and barren compared to Florence and Venice. In those games, you always had somewhere interesting to go, something to dominate the view, but in this game, most of the map is just open countryside with a few Roman ruins scattered around. You may get a slight sense of awe when you first see the places like the Pantheon or the Colloseum, but after a while that novelty wears off and they just become another thing to climb. It also seems to have sparce few people, making rome feel empty, which is never really good.the ending to the story is just confusing to wrap your head around, and they just seem to throw in charecters from ACII randomly. And then the main feature of the game: the Brotherhood ability.This ability is quite fun recruiting people and them using them to earn you money and kill guards without you having to do much. But it becomes that: getting money and killing guards; not very exciting.So, in MY opinion, I beleive this game fell far from the greateness of ACII. I would only get it in a sale and if you want to carry on the story of Ezio.			",99,13,1,12,13,1,15

												The game that broke Assassin's Creed, both in terms of combat and world design.  It's not completely terrible; it's no III, Revelations, or (god forbid) Unity, but it's not quite as good as 2 either.  If you're okay with pathetically easy combat that basically gives any pretense of this being a stealth game the middle finger and spending large portions of your time trotting slowly around big empty fields on a horse, hey, more power to you.I really wish Steam would let me give a 'meh' score; not quite yes, not quite no.

												OK graphics, decent controls, plenty of different mechanics (exploration, economy, rebuilding, conquering, assassinations).  A decent game overall but it has too much handholding and the open-world aspect is, as always with Ubisoft games, very restricted. You cannot play the game the way you want, you have to follow the footsteps of the devs.The combat! Combat feels disconnected and loose. You do not have direct control over your actions during combat, you feel like a spectator where you have to push a button as soon as someone attacks you; very frustrating.The game also lacks the atmosphere and details of the previous games, it feels like a copypaste of AC2 and somehow the essence got lost.Alright game but not worth your time.

												88 hours and I've yet to finish this game! And no, it's not because of fiddling with the banks.Look, I don't really care whether the game has a 3rd party EULA or not. However, when said EULA not only fails to put your save files on a cloud, but actively prevents you from backing them up yourself, that's where we have problems.You see, twice I either had to do a system reset on my PC, or change to a new one. All my games either kept their save files on a cloud and survived, or allowed me to back those up on an external drive. All my games except AC brotherhood, where both times I was quite near the end of the game.While it was fun to play and all, it's basically AC II all over again in terms of gameplay. Not really worth it unless you get it at a ridiculously low price.Maybe one day I'll be able to finish it. ",304,104,10,67,29,7,45

												If you simply change the name of your UPlay account, then UPlay deletes all your games. This is a common problem with UPlay, so common that the internet is full of information about this. (Legacy account name change.)BUT when you contact UPlay support to get your son's account fixed so he has all the games you bought him for Christmas and his birthday and even Summer and Halloween, the customer service rep will pretend to not understand what is going on. Then when you explain to her the exactness of the problem, she will get really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•y with you that she does understand the issue, but instead of fixing the issue she will insist on argueing with you constantly.I will not purchase UPlay games anymore because of this issue.--Old Review--If you are getting this for multiplayer, its dead as a door nail.You need 6 players to start a match, but there was only one other player in the world who wanted to play too.Single Player, too much monoteny.

												I previously had bought the game Assassins Creed III. It crashed. Every time. My whole pc. I would have to force restart it. But i figured, hey maybe Brotherhood will be different! So i bought it. Same problem. I contacted Ubisoft support, useless. Tired of your bull Ubisoft. Why do your games crash my computer.			",89,13,0,5,8,0,9

												I didn't think it possible for the deranged, dissentient, masochistic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s responsible for AC 2 to create something worse.. When I see *Very Positive* in blue up there.. I feel sick. Shame on every single one of you simian mongoloids who revere this inexplicably disgusting, abhorrent creation. Thos who dismissed the failures in this failure of an excuse of a pitiful defeat. I bought this game knowing full well what lie after AC 2, It could be worse. but it couldn't be THIS cunting bad. I bought it for the story.. One of the, if not the best, most enthralling, enjoyable storylines I have ever experienced.. But the gameplay? I just finished Brotherhood. It's an abomination. Every single ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing thing you can conceive of that comprises in some way an aspect of this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING BROKEN. Everything. Everything. EVERY SINGLE LITTLE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING THING. From the movement to the combat to the camera angles, AI, pathing, texture glitches, mounted movement/combat/interaction, general crashes, secondary objectives failing to sync, hitboxes, LOS, animation, the mechaincs, the triggers, the algorithms, the processes in their entirety, direction control, delayed responsiveness, flawed environmental interactivity placements. Oh and enjoy the cutscenes. Especially if you want to get a full Sync.. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing enjoy that masochists, as I didn't. Common sense.. Within the confines of this game.. It doen't exist. The single worst game I have ever played. Period.			",95,6,0,9,13,0,29

												Like with II has problems confusing it's self with 360 to side scroll movements at times, not terrible, worth the cost now, not have said go for it as a new game.  It also continues that annoying hard to escape turn based (almost) battle system.  The glyphs are rifts and more annoying.  Not mandatory, but this is where % sync effects most story events first happens.  Hated that too.  It's got a slightly better flow than most.			",53,14,1,17,2,0,4

												The continuation of the story line is great, but I'm disappointed that the gameplay is very similar to the previous two - fights can essentially be won by mashing your attack button and finding objectives is super straightforward.  However, the graphics and scenery are still wonderful, and the open-world exploration is thrilling.I would definitely recommend the game if you don't mind a lot more repetition, but I just can't get myself past that part to continue the story line.  In this rare case, I'm fine just looking up the plot on Wikipedia.			",17,1,0,4,0,0,6

												To play the game you must create a ubisoft account. I created one with no problem. Then it told me grats! Account made, logged in all fine. Then it begins to launch and then that launcher just disappears. Not like a usual crash where it says error, something wrong. It just exits itself. Every time i try to play it on through steam the launcher goes up, and crashes a few seconds later. I am on a windows 8 and have no firewall blocking it. Any help would be appreiciated but i cant find the support page on the ubisoft website. Ive seen awesome gameplay but i can get the game to start. In addition, my mac friend tries to play and it doesnt recongnize his keyboard so he can just afk in a lobby every time he tries to play. All in all, it doesnt work and is super buggy with nowhere to look for help.			",8,2,0,0,1,0,0

												I'm going to review this as a PC game. This review is based on my experience of buying the PC version of this game, and not about what the game offers itself, simply because I have not had the chance to truly play it.I do not recommend this game on PC. When buying it on Steam, you will be redirected to a software called: ""Uplay""Everytime this program tries to open the game up, it crashes. It won't even update, because it crashes before you have a chance to. I recommend buying this on PS3 or Xbox 360.			",70,11,0,4,10,0,8

												... Eh. Only if you've already beaten ACII and are hungry for more.Don't get me wrong- there's nothing much wrong with it. It's solid, it's just more of the same. There are changes here and there that make it more polished, but at the end of the day, ACII had a solid and interesting, if not terribly inspired, story backing up its gameplay and exploration every step of the way, supporting its flaws. Brotherhood... kinda doesn't. It's fine, it's just less engaging than its predecessor, and while some of the new gameplay tools are quite fun, it's hard to justify buying a whole game for ""more of the last one"" without having a story of some sort worth carrying it.

												If u haven't play any next-gen or say newest Assassin's Creed series, this one is really great. I kinda like it storyline, even tho its not as good as AC II, and its feature that we can call backup since the fight sometime kinda annoying to do it by yourself. Its graphic doesn't really bad either.But if u already play newest AC series e.g. unity and syndicate, u'll find the control system might be frustating since its more complex and similar to previous series. Its gameplay also sometimes annoying, like when u try to climb a wall that actually he can but then he just jump off to the opposie side, and unlike in unity and syndicate, everytime I enter a battle mode, I unable to run away to directly kill the captain for example, etcThats my personal opinion :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So my lack of a recommendation for this game has nothing to do with the story or gameplay. It was a solid Assassin's Creed entry as far as I'm concerned, coming with a diversity of side quests that I was planning on enjoying more of until I saw that I had already stumbled on the closing phase of the game. So this thumbs down is because my laptop has an I7-4720HQ, GTX 960M 4GB, and 16GB of ram and this game has a hard time running even with all the graphical settings turned down. So poor optomization is my rationale for this rating. Both of the other games on the Ezio trilogy are running well at high-ultra settings  quite well. Even AC Rogue worked on my old laptop that had an R7 M260DX in it. So yeah, good game, tough time with the gameplay a lot of the time. Still on the lower end of playable most of the time. So if you're just trying to play through all the AC games like I'm trying to do get it for the story and see if you can bear it or maybe your PC will just fare better than mine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Concept:Mostly teh same as previous ACs.  A great game with great (albeit simple and very easy) combat, Excellent platforming scaling detailed walls where teh main character grabs onto handholds realistically (for a super assassin) and where intricate leaps can be made onto small skinny poles and lamps and what not.  Overall the platforming is very well done.  Unfortunately, this very promising and potentially great game is plagued by unskippable lengthy dialogue and downright monotonous cutscenes that caused me to quit the game early.  I cannot remember perfectly, but I believe this was the AC that introduced property purchases and interval revenue (earning money over time.)Graphics:Nothing remarkable, but definitely passable.  Overall good.Sound:All good, nice horse sounds, city sounds, crowd gossip and what not.Entertainment:An extremely promising game, ruined by certain sequences.Replay:Atrocious, unless you enjoy boring, lengthy dialogue/cutscenes/sequences.Rating:Out of 60 USD, 10.(Opinion on teh monetary worth of the game scaled 1 to 60$)Conclusion:Coulda been excellent, spoiled by poor game design.  Still, worth checking out if on sale. ",150,1,2,25,0,0,22

												AC Brotherhood is a great game, but it gets a thumbs down because having a game launcher within a game launcher is the most ridiculous thing I've seen all week. Yes, I'm talking about the cancer that is ""Uplay"".I purchased the game on Steam. I have a Steam account. It is absolutely unnecessary to force upon players an additional hoop to jump through just so they can access the content they've paid for the pleasure to use. I will gladly change this review to a positive if Ubisoft ever digs their head out of their‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and stops forcing bloatware on its customers.			",16,1,4,0,3,0,1

												For those of you who played Assassin's Creed II, you will probably like Brotherhood, as it plays pretty much the same. It starts out fun and introduces a few new features and modifications that are definitely for the better.However, as soon as one reaches Rome, it quickly gets frustrating. Me, I stopped there after a while. Here's a few reasons why (it's basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying it's unbearable):1) You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because ""this memory is not available"".2) You want to return to a place you've been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? You'll notice that, other than in every other Assassin's Creed before, areas you've been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are ""not available"" anymore.3) I feel like I'm squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of ""available memory"", with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I can't continue because ""this area is not available"". Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassin's Creed experience I came to know and love.4) I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is ""not available"". WTF?!?At this point I was so‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•that I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.Seriously, it's a great game. Gameplay-wise, it's even better than the original Assassin's Creed 2. But the way it limits the player to a rather small area really kills it for me. So much for ""open world"".

												Pros:- The story is not bad.- To be able to recruit new assassins and send them on missions is an interesting new feature.- The game mechanics are ok.Cons:- This game has a double DRM (UPlay) which does not work for some people.- Regarding bugs and gliches this game is really messed up.- The missions are very repetitive.- It crashes a lot and you can't Alt-Tab out of it.I loved AC1 and bought this game because I really wanted to know how the story continues - now it is the last Ubisoft game I ever bought.Ubisoft tried a few interesting new things (mainly the recruitment system and flying one of leonardo's inventions), but the bugs were awfull. Unfotunately one mission couldn't be solved (the flying mission) because the controlls stopped working. After that my motivation to take on other missions or try multiplayer was gone and I tried to end the game as fast as possible.Some of the bugs are well known to Ubisoft, but they never provided patches as I've learned on some message boards.UPlay worked on my playthrough (others weren't as lucky), but I still don't understand the need for a double DRM. Being forced to make an account for playing offline really got on my nerves.This game was also very prone to crashes and Alt-Tabbing out of it was completely out of the question.Whereas in AC 2 you visit different cities, in this game you just remain in Rome. This and the repetitive missions killed most of the replay value.All in all I'd give this game 3 out of 10 points mainly for the story and the whole climbing and stealth mechanics - if that's also what you love about the AC series I'd reccomend you to buy AC 1 and leave it at that.This game was a total waste of money. If you really need to buy it, buy it when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why do you put this available on mac when it's not working?? Shame...Edit: For those who gonna say this fix or that fix: Tryed every single one, run on blind mode even, got to the actual game keyboard doesn't work. Is that a game that works? not for me. Still gonna play it on bootcamp when i have the chance but sell a game for a platform that the user as to hack the game and for my case doesn't even work shouln'd be selled.Be aware that I'm writing this review based on a mac game not a windows one.

												After trying, over and over, to get into this game, all I can say is its one big disappointment. As much as I'm sure the story and later levels are fantastic, I simply cannot get into this game because of the combat. Having played a whole lot of Black Flag, trying to learn the combat system for this game is a measure in frustration, incredulity, and stupidity. Sometimes you can counter. Often you can't. There's no indicator for when your attempt to counter is going to work or not, and I cannot get the combat system to respond in any manner of consistent way.Sometimes you can break a hold, sometimes you can't. It seems to be entirely random whether or not your attempts to attack, counter, block, or dodge are going to work, resulting in even a modest number of guards able to whittle your health down significantly.I understand that the focus should be on NOT engaging in combat, but often the game forces you into it, and punishes you for doing so. I so very much want to like this game. I really, really, really want to like it. But the combat system is total trash.			",229,22,3,37,52,1,73

												I was not even able to play this game because UBISOFT/UPLAY is a bunch of garbage. So many other  people are having the same issues and yet nothing is being done. In my opinon I would not purchase this because uplay is a bunch of crap that barely works. I have never had any other problems from any other game producers/companies besides ubisoft. What i would like to know is why would they create this uplay crap when it does not even work. My only guess is that they do not care if the program works correctly but only care if they receive the amount of profit they desire. I'm sure this is a GREAT game, just due to the fact that I can't even play it, will make me reer AWAY from UBISOFT in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One and Two were in my view better. This is too crazy. Main story relatively ok. But all over too long, sometimes wierd or complicated.Too much jumping and way to many lairs. Finished just the story, didnt bother with much else but there is it on youtube so I watched bits that way. Some games are just better watched on youtube, I guess.  Didnt interestet me that much this time.. Also I dont like games which are built in a way that you should play them more times to finish them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood ultimately is another Assassin's Creed game. These games sit on the borderline between recommendation and non-recommendation for me; they're okay games, and do solid enough stuff, but also contain an unpleasantly large amount of tedium in them which isn't much fun. Some of the missions are solid, some of them are boring, and overall the game is kind of variable in how good it is over its length.I don't really regret playing these games, but it is hard to really recommend them either, as while the conspiracy ideas underpinning the game are neat, and the game is cool in places, there's a lot of time spent doing things which just aren't very interesting.Overall grade: C			",507,173,10,70,51,7,84

												a game that will continue the previous one from the moment you left off will start out as a blast first 3 secuences were a whole lot of fun i cant say that there is anything bad about the game until that point but ofcourse since this is a negetave comment i will say them:1. a game with so little story (the story is good but it feels too short) that ubisoft just sqeezed in so many side challanges i spent over half my game time on these side challanges that the story was not fun.2. the game contains a DLC ""The Da Vinchi Disapearnce"" which for some reason feels longer than the main game and has a more solid story3. assassins - nice touch but overuse of the same npc face (i went to reqruit my last assassin and 4 of the first faces i saw were exactually the sameSPOILER4. the game is too easy going at first but on the last misson it jumps you 9 years forward with no explanation of to how the bad guy is leader of a different army unless you read it in TABmaybe i didnt play it right though....

												Editied...At first this game refused to work on a really good rig. Didnt know why (see EDIT*).I use a (good) keyboard for games like this. If I wanted to use only a controller, I would buy a fkn console.It takes a bit of practice to get used to the controls, but at least its keyboard-coded far better than the garbage spewed out of KONAMI Studio called Metal Gear Solid 5, which REFUSES to allow you to re-map all the controls for disabled players (missing fingers) or the left-handed, Unlike this far older game.In regard to MSG5, I dont think Hideo Kojima was responsible for that re-mapping MESS, but I think he/his team was Ordered to make it a Console port, and not cater for PC specifically (especially in regards to Controls re-mapping). Asanine twerps wanted to chop costs. This game (Brotherhood), I have not have much chance to really test it out. Buy it in a Sale if you can if AC Creed games work for you.EDIT*.Now I fixed AC Brotherhood with switching Steam BETA on and rebooting and Switching Steam BETAS back off, and re-booting, and now the game works after hours of determination to find a fix.I updated my review (to thumbs-up) when I got the frustration out of my blood enough to play the thing without gritting my teeth trying to get it to simply start.As for Peonza`s comment (when I initially game the game a thumbs-down [when the game refused to start]), I can certainly understand why some people hate such awkward-to-control games; but like I said, its Keyboard controlled FAR BETTER than Metal Gear Solid 5.

												What a tragedy! Why, Ubi? Why did you let this game die and give it no love? AC:B won several GOTY awards, and frankly if I could give one, it'd win one from me, too. The atmospere is immersive, the voice acting is spectacular, and the music gives it a soul. With the exception of the controls often being the most epic boss in the game and the plot never going anywhere, story mode is worth the trip! But the MP flattens the SP by far! Vibrant, colorful, well-voiced, well MO-CAP player models and genius design, the MP is arguably the best gaming has ever seen. Unfortuantely, Ubi decided to go all COD on it, releasing another AC every year. The legendary MP that they did so well to make is now dead forever. What a shame. This game deserved to live forever like QUAKE or CS. Still recommended, just don't expect to get a MP game.			",93,5,0,12,3,0,7

												This is a tough game to review, like all AC games the controls are garbage.  Is this game fun, thats debatable, it doesnt feel fun, but it is challenging.  Every mission is 100% is possible but ONLY if youre real hardcore, because your not playing to beat the game, your playing to beat bad game design.  Every time I get 100% sync on a mission, I feel like its sticking it in the face of the devs, as if as a mere player I can overcome how bad they are at making games.  Lets step into BAD game design 101 a class where everyone at Ubisfot is an A student: There is a side mission where you drive around in a tank, the bonus goal to get 100% on this mission is to not let the tank take any damage.  Any normal player would think that makes sense so we can preserve the tank, keep it undamaged to use later.  HA!  FOOLED YOU!  This is bad game design, no lets make the mission ungodly difficult, then after you beat the mission, lets have th player jump out of the tank and blow it up!  *Bonus bad design:  Make it a looOOoooong mission, where if you get damaged in the tank, instead of going back to a checkpoint, you need to restart the entire mission.Next chapter in Bad Game Design:  Build open world, imagine a big world you can explore, gamers would like that!  That isnt how its done in this game, thanks to more bad game design there are stupid white walls everywhere that just kill you if you touch them.  There is no excuse for this, I found it altered none of the story if you could just go to different places.  How that would ruin any game is just beyond me.   Multiple endings:  Games that offer different ways of achieving a goal through creative thoughtful strategy is often rewarded.  Not in AC brotherhood, most missions if someone looks at you, you just die and have to restart.  Suddenly everyone of the bad guys in Italy are medusas, and if they look at you apparently you die.Playing this I often picture the developers, who are in their corporate headquarters on a hill as the sky grows dark lightning crashes around it.  They sit in a meeting room making lists of how to make the game worse.  Ringing their hands in dark rooms lighted only by the glow of their overhead projector used for presentations, while laughing maniacally at the thoughts of people suffereing through their horrible game, MuWaHaHaHaHa....Multiplayer is dead...  Game is so boring that people sitting in the same room watching me would fall asleep as I had to retry missions again, and again.  They tried to play it and thought the controls sucked, and it wasnt fun.  There so for average people or fun gamers, this game is terribad, only for people who really want a challenge is it fun, and challenging isnt that much fun to be honest, its just challenging...Regular Gamer:    Rating:  0/10  Value  $0.00Hardcore Gamer:  Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99 ",2654,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												This game is such disappointment after the AC2 it has so little extra game content, it should be a DLC, but even for that wouldn't have been too great.To be fair, I have to say, it has some values, and I have to highlight the parts, I liked about it.These are like the crossbow you get, and basically all the new weapons. Also you totally get the good old AC2 feeling with it, wich you probably expect when you buy this.But other then these above sadly you geta disappointing storylinebunch of  annoying missions when you have to jump on walls seeing Ezio from awkward camera positionsa horse that's useless in fights but always knows how to be in your wayloads of business and assasin's order micromanagment, that has to be done, or you are financially ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•edetc...(believe me there is a lot more)to sum up this, only buy this episode if you are a huge fanboy otherwise you going to find a better piece of this series (just not the Revelations, it's even a bit below this one)			",38,2,0,1,2,2,1

												I had forgotten the AC franchise didn't get good until ACIII. The early Assassin's Creed games (and Chronicles) make me cuss at my computer more than any other game series. Your character never moves the way you want him to, the combat is wonky, block is the same button to run so there are times where your character will just stand there. Parts are fun sure, and I'm going to beat it but damn, it doesn't deserve the 89% it has on Steam. The controls ruin it. ACIII and ACIV are where it's at.			",215,88,0,57,24,1,79

												Well, actually my favourite Assassin creed game is the second title but i have it in another website. Brotherhood tries to follow the same way of the second, with secondary missions less tedious (as tedious as the first title). I think the goal is having the player in game the more possible hours. The story is nice like the others and you can do a lot of things, fight, jump, climb, etc.I saw in this game missions like Tomb Rider saga. To me its impossible not to recomend at least 1 game of Assassin's creed series.			",70,24,0,4,1,0,5

												GG! :D Continues the story of Ezio Auditore in his quest against the Templar scum. The Assassin's liberate the city from the hands of the church. Many cool additions since AC2 such as having assassin's do your bidding, new weapons like a crossbow, better ways of getting around Rome via fast travel, etc. improves upon every aspect of AC2. Now I can't wait to get AC:R then AC3 but when they are on sale like this one was. :)			",160,20,5,16,7,2,21

												A fantastic game with a lot of content, it's basically more of the same we saw in AC2, which is a good thing as that game was great. The main storyline undergoes little evolution, as has become common in AC games, but all is forgiven since reliving Ezio's memories in Rome during the Renaissance is a great experience.

												Definitely my favorite Assassin's Creed game.  It has a great story and the setting is just terrific.  My favorite part of all the Assassin's Creed games is the free-running puzzles, and this game had a ton of them!  Combat was also improved, allowing you to chain executes, so that you don't need to wait to counterattack, making a really smooth and flowing gameplay.  My only real critique for this game is that the crossbow makes some parts of the game too easy.  A ranged silent execute is just really overpowered.  However, even though the crossbow may make some missions speed by, this game still offers many hours of fun, so buy it and play it.			",249,82,2,19,11,2,19

												I kind of hated this game. I liked Assassin's Creed 2, but this game just kept ramming itself into walls. The missions are terrible and boring. I'm tired of following people through crowds to eavesdrop on their conversations - it's not fun. Then you have some completely buggy and broken stuff to go along with it. Some of the side missions or optional stuff let's you assassinate a Borgia family captain who walks around a general area. One time I came across a ship yard, where clearly the developers wanted you to dive off the mast of a ship and air assassinate him. I didn't want to do this - I had seen it done many times and I wanted to do it my way. The problem? Approaching him made him run, which is fine, but he runs about 10 feet before he disappears into the side of a building. No doors or anything around, he just vanishes. I felt like I was playing a Playstation 2 game. There were frequent occurrences of ridiculous design like that and I had enough of it. I did not finish the game nor do I want to. It also turned me off of the rest of the series.			",207,29,5,18,22,2,28

												The third AC game is a step down from the second, but is a very good game in itself. There are some moments that top anything in 2, but nothing substantial is added to the gameplay, making it feel more like a (gigantic) expansion pack.SCORE: 8.5/10			",318,48,18,26,12,2,9

												The 2nd of the Ezio trilogy. And if you are new to the games, I would reccomend starting with AC2 first justto understand the story. A definite sequel. Improves upon nearly every single game mechanic of Assassin's Creed 2, and is personally my favorite in the series. The combat is more fluid. The guilds make sense and are utilized in the story. Even capturing areas and exploring the world are tied into the 'story' of the game. I only wish the other games in the series took more notes from this one.			",63,4,1,7,5,0,10

												If you have just finished ACII and jump right into Brotherhood, you may feel a bit weird at first. Part of this weirdness feeling is good: Ezio ‚Äúfeels‚Äù older ‚Äì he should be. The patchy beard, the slight comments from NPC‚Äôs here and there, the louder noise he makes when he drops from a height, it all adds to the feeling that the character you have played with since his teenage days in Firenze is now close to or in his  40‚Äôs ‚Äì but don‚Äôt worry; he can still do all the good stuff. This, ageing, is not an easy thing to convey in a game and many developers will not do it at all, keeping their character closer to a young aged audience, but for a story like AC it is both needed and, in this case, well executed.The other part of the weirdness is perhaps not so good. AC Brotherhood needs time. In the beginning you feel a bit thrown into the game world without much to go on, no real idea where to begin. Perhaps that is a good thing. Ultimately, the small pieces of your ‚Äúwork‚Äù here and there begin to consolidate the picture and you start to tread on more solid ground. One point of complaint is the map and menu navigation which Ubisoft for some reason messed with from the previous game, with not so good results.Ultimately, Brotherhood continues the story from ACII nicely, deepens the plot, creates more questions but is all in all enjoyable. The recruitment of assassins adds a nice touch to the feeling that you are part of something larger and eventually ‚Äì at its head.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game! Assassin's Creed II was a great addition to the series and Brotherhood makes the series even better. I only wish that they made the Mac version of Revelations so we can FINALLY see how Ezio's story ends! I'm not sure if the multiplayer server is working anymore. It keeps saying that it can't connect to Ubisoft's server, but it could be all of Ubisoft that's down.

The plot is great and has some fun twists which make playing it over and over easy to do.  Like in most game series it is best to play the games in order but if you really don't want to get them all and just want to try one I would recommend starting with this one.

												The Single Player is not much more than Assassin's Creed 2, just one or two new ways to kill people or get around the city, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but any gripes with the series so far probably haven't been addressed with this installment, and what people have liked about the series is still in the game.  My favorite aspect of Brotherhood was the multiplayer.  I personally haven't played any game that had this style of gameplay, so it was ""fresh"" so to say, something new to learn, new mechanics to wrap my head around and master, a different way to use the mechanics we were given in single player.  I greatly enjoyed the way the multiplayer emulated the feeling that the original assassin's creed created when it first released, which was the feeling of being an assassin, which I personally haven't felt since AC 1 was released.

												You thought the crazy Adventures of Dezmond and Ezio are over? Think again. In this third and most likely last installment for a while, you are thrown right back to where AS:2 finished.Anyway, the graphics engine has been completly overhauled to provide an even more interesting immersive experience over the previous two games. Its hungry for hardware so perhaps make sure you can play AS and AS:2 at least on medium to ensure you can play this much detailed sequal.Story wise its been improved and as previously stated, its a direct continuation from AS:2. More quirks and additions are in this packed game, so if you are an Assasin at heart, this is a MUST buy. If you have a controller, then all the best, good luck and remember, you are an elite assasin in the 1500's.Where will the fight with Astergo lead you? What answers does Subject 16 still have for you? Where did Leonardo get to? All will be revealed in this action packed, beautifully detailed game.Final Score: 4 / 5			",233,8,12,16,31,1,42

												DONT BUY THIS GAME      the game itself is pretty freaking awesome... but it's next to impossible to get working on PC. Fisrt off, you need to create a Uplay account, and, normally, i would be completely fine with this, but the code you use to play the game DOESN'T WORK. it took me a crazy amount of time to find a work around to get the code to activate, but after that I managed to play the game without much trouble. The whole campaign, all the way through, and it was fun. However, a couple months later, on a new computer, i'm trying to get the game installed, but once again the Uplay system is screwing me over, telling me ""this game is already installed on a Uplay account."" Yes, yes it is, ON MY ACCOUNT, but it won't register with my new computer. It has me so frustrated i don't even want to bother with it anymore. I just want whoever created Uplay, to fall down a well. Look, do yourself a huge favor: shut down your steam acount, logon to Amazon, and buy it for a PS3 or Xbox. It's really a great game, but only if you can play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the changes are not as drastic as the ones from the first Assassin's Creed to the second,Brotherhood goes a nice way to improve upon the already extremely solid formula cemented by its predecessor.Combat is made quicker and flashier through the ability to use both meele and long-range weapons together and the introduction of a chain-kill mechanic. The Assassin recruits create a simple, yet surprisingly engaging past time that pays off big in the long run and for those who enjoyed renovating Ezio's villa in the last game, there is now the entirity of Rome to do as you please with. Even with all this, there is no doubt that this does feel like ""Assassin's Creed 2: 2"", but when the changes that are there build so well upon the last game all the same, one can't really complain.

												I can say without hesitation that Brotherhood is easily the best installment out of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise. Ubisoft Montreal took the massive breakthrough that was AC2's gameplay and refined it, expanded it, and built on top of it - giving the player an experience with an immense amount of depth and ceaseless enjoyment. While some might say that this game was more ""expansion"" than a true release the continuation of Ezio Auditore's storyline did wonders for the character, the historical time period, and the AC universe in general.Brotherhood was also the first title in the series to feature an online multiplayer that not only amazed us with its addictiveness but also really challenged us - rewarding players for being patient and clever instead of relentless and clumsy.

												Whasmattayou, Altiar?The second game in the Ezio Trilogy, The Auditore in question just finished his life long 20 year goal to get in a slap fight with the pope. Everything's cool yeah? No conflict? Ezio can move on with his life? THINK AGAIN. A raid on the Auditore Villa from an incest spoiled backstabbing murdering brat of a bad guy and the death of his Uncle Mario leads Ezio and the assassins to Rome. The place he just came back from. With everything lost, Ezio must build the assassins up like no one else, save Masyaf, has done in years.This game was hard to tell if it is worthy to get and play. On the one hand, the new multiplayer mode is very weak. I'd like to meet the person who thought a stealth action single player needed a team deathmatch multiplayer... and thought it was a good idea because they kept doing it. The story was nice, the bad guy was compelling in the sense he would not stop ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing and I wanted to stab him in the neck. That was the point, right? AC:II left a major question as to what's worse then templars and doesn't seem to stop with that. Finally, Desmond suffers a mild break down after being controlled by the apple to kill off one of the crew. WHO WILL IT BE? It seems to be ubisoft hell bent goal to ground the AC series as a present day action and certianly not the lives of Ezio's Ancestors. Because starting out a game where it's in the past and you know history as a little bit differently is very restricting in the drama department. I mean, it's not like you can nuke greece and say ""Well, it wasn't in the history books, but our games should get great ratings now.""The bad taste to this game is Multiplayer and Optional objectives. In order for 100% sync, you no long have to collected treasure, feathers, and flags. Oh wait, no, you do. But you also have to finish each memory, except for a few, with optional objectives. ""Ezio's a bad‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and took no damage in this fight. You should too"" was probably the most annoying one. Actually, no, the ""Finish this wolf pack temple in 8 minutes or less"" was probably more annoying. Even if you knew the layout, it was rare that this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•was possible. It doesn't stop you from finishing the game but does not make it fun to know the game is saying ""Your way is nice but you could have done better.""Muiltiplayer. Seriously, who looks at stealth action and says ""This needs more people playing together! Let't make everyone feel like ninjas."" It gets worse as the series continues, as they've added Multiplayer actions in rewards to Ubisoft's Uplay DRM- I mean Steam Client- I mean ""Play and Win"" system that certianly has not been added to a majority of new games for the securROM feature that you can use to buy games, rewards, and snacks from. This game has no uplay action and everything can be completed within single player itself, but Revalation, III, and Black Flag does and I'm going to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• uncontrollable about that when the time comes to review them. In the mean time...Would I recommend getting this game? AC:II tied it off nice and neat. If you've got to find a reason to kill more things with your hidden blade, O.P. hidden gun, or poison dart, I suppose you can get this game. Just don't say no one warned you about the multiplayer.P.S. Oh, I almost forgot. Pre-rendered trailer at the start of the first assassin's creed? It took them three games but they finally added the crossbow. Too bad it's a waste on ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• guards who wonder why their drinking buddy to their left seemed to mysteriously drop for no reason. Maybe it's that giant arrow sticking out of their eye socket? I'm no doctor, but that'd be my guess.			",1048,364,27,181,126,13,182

												I thought I'd re-recommend some games due to how poorly written and dumb my old recommendations were.The Assassin's Creed series has always been a great series (with a few exceptions ;3), and its games often are amazing and enjoyable, with breathtaking scenery and amazing gameplay: this one is no exception.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood consists of a fairly long storyline, filled with enjoyable and interesting missions.  Playing in the beautiful city of Roma as Ezio Auditore is a great experience, and the city allows for much adventure and open world exploration outside of the storyline.  In fact, there are multiple stories you can follow, for instance there is a free addition you can download where you play a story that takes place shortly after the main adventure.  The game also intertwines with historical places, facts, and people, such as the Borgias.  The main antagonist is Cesare Borgia, a well-developed and historically-based character.  The storyline shows how you attack him from various directions and slowly take back the city.  This installment of the series introduces a new concept: Assassin Recruits.  The game allows you to pick up fellow citizens and teach them in the ways of the assassin, and throughout the story you can call upon them to help you.  In general, this can lead to many fun battles: I personally enjoyed running around and attracting as many guards as possible, then just call in fellow assassins and murder them all. >:DThe multiplayer mode of this game is great.  To run around and attack others while being chased yourself in a small area is so much fun, and there are all sorts of gimmicks and hiding places you can use to make chases and escapes even more exhilirating.  However, it can be difficult to get a multiplayer game going, since there aren't often many people on the network.  If you manage to get a game though, stay in it and play around for a while, you'lll unlock new bonuses and rewards as you level up from playing.One last thing to note about this game is the enviornment.  I mentioned before that the game takes place in Roma, and in case you didn't know, Rome is a pretty vast and beautiful place. :P  You don't play through Rome during its days of glory, but long after when many of its structures are in ruins and the Borgia have complete control and power over the city.  As you gain wealth and status in the city (usually from not-so friendly ways... protip: Borgia Towers are strangely very flammable), you can repair old buildings, buy renown places such as the Coliseum and the Pantheon and gain the trust of nearby factions such as theives and courtesans.  In general, the envoirnment is very large yet extremely detailed and gorgeous.  With so much to do in the city, oftentimes you may set out to go get something done but find yourself trying to kill a Borgia Captain and igniting a tower hours later.In general, the game is amazing.  As I said in my previous 2-word review: ""Awesome shtuff.""			",49,7,4,9,4,0,1

												Being a fan of the Assassin's Creed series, this is the game to which I compare any of the following storylines, by far. With simple, yet elegant physics and a storyline which actually made me cry in a side-mission (no spoilers), this game first drew my attention just to edge closer to fulfilling the story of Assasin's Creed 2. Which it does with perfection (by my standards, of course).Never before or since this game have I felt so truly free to roam a map and to choose my battles by myself. ",312,99,7,38,48,4,33

												The 2nd of the Ezio trilogy. And if you are new to the games, I would reccomend starting with AC2 first justto understand the story. A definite sequel. Improves upon nearly every single game mechanic of Assassin's Creed 2, and is personally my favorite in the series. The combat is more fluid. The guilds make sense and are utilized in the story. Even capturing areas and exploring the world are tied into the 'story' of the game. I only wish the other games in the series took more notes from this one.			",63,4,1,7,5,0,10

												I'm going to keep this review as straight forward as possible: Is ACB good? On a techincal level, if not mediocre.Will you enjoy it? If you can be ok with a ton of repitition, other wise avoid or take caution.Brotherhood is probably one of the more boring games i've played, which is dissapointing considering I thought Assassin's Creed 2 was quite good. All the story missions are the same thing over and over game, kill that thing, go here, don't get caught, and of course FOLLOW MISSIONS, which are one of the worst mission types for any sandbox game ever considering the stealth in this game is shoddy.In comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 it is staggering how much quality has been lost.Optimization: Assassin's Creed 2 was nicely optomized for pc, it ran well and I don't recall many issues. For ACB the game is laggy, it looks kinda bleh at times, and the video settings keep going to their defaults every single time you re-enter the game, and I found no way to fix this. Gameplay: Already covered above; story mission too repetitive, and not really varied. Nothing memorable here.Setting: Rome is dull. The landscape is bland and honestly uninteresting. We wen't from the streets of Venice to the open grass lands of...Well Rome. I don't know if it might suit someone else's tastes, but I find it uninteresting.This is honestly a pretty weak game in my opinion, not bad persay, but following Assassin's Creed 2 it just doesn't hold up as well, considering its more of the same plus it being incredibly boring and repetative at times. I wouldn't really recommend it that much, not even if you are trying to follow the story because the two timeline plots have simple start and end points, no real inner 'meat' to add anything signifigant or worth noting or caring about.Worth a skip.

												Another year, another turgid crapfest from the AssCreed series. Unskippable cutscenes (really, we're still doing these in 2010?), sticky cameras, lousy storytelling, etc. To be fair, though, this isn't QUITE the same sweaty nutsack that AssCreed II was; the combat is vaguely improved, and the scenery looks as nice as ever. Eventually, Ubisoft might make a worthwhile entry in the AssCreed series that's actually worth the 10 bucks I pay for them during Steam sales, but I doubt it. In the meantime, I'll keep slogging through the pigshit that the AssCreed series leaves in its wake, all the while posting whiny non-recommendations on Steam.			",203,41,1,8,5,1,7

												Combat is flashy but too simple and with only 3 attack moves needed {Normal attack, Counter and kicking}. Controls are not very good and parkour is too simple. Stealth is not very good as you will find yourself running all over the place. The a.i. is not very smart and does not notice you during stealth and attacks you one at a time.But, the graphics are very good even in 2014. The storyline is interesting {notice I did not say bad or good} and there is quite a lot to do, and you are in a beautifully made Rome. The reason why I did not thumbs this up because the combat, while flashy bores me and I like more complicated combat, and the a.i. is very stupid and stealth is too sensitive, I did not like it but if you are okay with simple combat you will like it.

												Just as much fun content as Assassin's Creed II, and the same basic ideas and gameplay too, but not as well put together. The main story doesn't drive you to the more fun missions in the game. Do run around and find every Leo mission and clear every borgia tower.Worth playing if you enjoyed the second game, but if you passed that one up, don't pick this over it.			",187,56,1,10,5,0,30

												Score : 9/10+ Like other game of AC series, great fighting and free running system.+ A lot of various side quest and activity.+ u can recruit ur own assassin brotherhood for help u to assassinate or fight enemy.+ all collectible marked on map but u have to buy some treasure map. - investment in shop is online. It sounds good but it often disable and take a time for load in investment page. It's unnecessarily to be online. I understand that developer try to annoy piracy but the victem is license customer. - Sometimes, the fighting and movement lock on system is very troublesome.			",438,84,4,46,24,2,53

												A purely awesome game. Even after you complete the story, there are many other side objectives to complete, and I mean, come on, free-running across buildings and strategically planning assassinations never get's old, when in Rome ;) Although it is worth adding that I would not suggest purchasing the game for it's multi-player,  since there are problems searching for sessions, AND it's scarce to see someone actually searching for one. However, the great single-player definately makes up for that. All-in-all, this game is great and I would seriously recommend it. :D			",14,1,0,3,3,0,1

												Same game as Assassin's Creed 2. Slightly streamlined, but lots more sandbox stuff if you really want to get into it. That content is entirely skippable, luckily.Ubisoft ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up the UI controls in this one, however, by separating them from the character controls. So annoying now to switch back and forth on the keyboard just to buy a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• potion. Too bad the humour in the game dies after the first fifteen minutes, too. I liked Ezio getting made fun of.If you liked 2, play Brotherhood. Just be prepared for the longest, worst credit roll in history.			",95,17,2,9,7,0,21

The story is not as great as AC2, but it is a fantastic entry to the series, unlike some of the newer AC games.			",118,11,2,14,10,1,12

												You thought the crazy Adventures of Dezmond and Ezio are over? Think again. In this third and most likely last installment for a while, you are thrown right back to where AS:2 finished.Anyway, the graphics engine has been completly overhauled to provide an even more interesting immersive experience over the previous two games. Its hungry for hardware so perhaps make sure you can play AS and AS:2 at least on medium to ensure you can play this much detailed sequal.Story wise its been improved and as previously stated, its a direct continuation from AS:2. More quirks and additions are in this packed game, so if you are an Assasin at heart, this is a MUST buy. If you have a controller, then all the best, good luck and remember, you are an elite assasin in the 1500's.Where will the fight with Astergo lead you? What answers does Subject 16 still have for you? Where did Leonardo get to? All will be revealed in this action packed, beautifully detailed game.Final Score: 4 / 5			",233,8,12,16,31,1,42

												Assassin's Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of 'The Matrix' in which you play a protagonist in the 'real world' who becomes someone else inside a 'virtual world'. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars - and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few - which tells a massive story back-to-back instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Awesome franchise!			",376,87,11,48,43,0,73

												For only one area you deal in (Rome) it's so in detail it's almost amazing. The characters look wonderful and I have to say, Ezio, Desmon and even the Altair outfit for Ezio looks great. They really should have used the models for Revelations. At times it does almost feel like a DLC for AC2, but I feel that it holds up on its own as a separate game.

												Brotherhood picks up the story exactly (literally!) when AC2 left it. And I must say, I'm pretty amazed by what the producers did with this game. The combat system is much better now, with introduction of killing streaks, but also with stronger and more difficult enemies. To get 100% in the mission, you have to also do some additional objectives (which sometimes are quite troublesome!). The city of Rome is an amazingly big area, unlike anything you have seen in the previous games. Characters are very interesting and the whole storyline is quite good (though, not as good as in AC2 in my opinion). Also, there are multitudes of additional missions and content, so finishing the entire game takes tremendeous amount of time. All in all, this game will definitely not dissapoint you so I can recommend it to anyone that loves AC.Actually, after playing AC:R, AC3 and AC4, I must say that if you love AC franchise, that would be the last game I would recommend to play, if you don't want a huge letdown.

The plot is great and has some fun twists which make playing it over and over easy to do.  Like in most game series it is best to play the games in order but if you really don't want to get them all and just want to try one I would recommend starting with this one.

												The Single Player is not much more than Assassin's Creed 2, just one or two new ways to kill people or get around the city, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but any gripes with the series so far probably haven't been addressed with this installment, and what people have liked about the series is still in the game.  My favorite aspect of Brotherhood was the multiplayer.  I personally haven't played any game that had this style of gameplay, so it was ""fresh"" so to say, something new to learn, new mechanics to wrap my head around and master, a different way to use the mechanics we were given in single player.  I greatly enjoyed the way the multiplayer emulated the feeling that the original assassin's creed created when it first released, which was the feeling of being an assassin, which I personally haven't felt since AC 1 was released.

												For only one area you deal in (Rome) it's so in detail it's almost amazing. The characters look wonderful and I have to say, Ezio, Desmon and even the Altair outfit for Ezio looks great. They really should have used the models for Revelations. At times it does almost feel like a DLC for AC2, but I feel that it holds up on its own as a separate game.

												This game REALLY took a *leap of faith* in giving us a whole new story and gameplay to associate Desmond Miles and Ezio Auditore with. (Leap of faith-- yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.) Honestly, though, it isn't the story that takes frontrunner here, as it seems that with each entry the story gets more and more confusing (not that that is necessarily a bad thing in this case), but the thrills that come with being able to call forth allies on a moments notice to help you take out your enemies. Leveling up your Brotherhood and becoming more engrossed in the brilliant side tasks gives players more reason to come back than any other entry in the AC series, and that is saying a lot. Of course, however, those who would try to play this without playing at least AC2 will be making a gross mistake. Fair warning to any who haven't touched upon this fantastic series.

												16th century Rome is beautiful, a great continuation of the Ezio trilogy. Gameplay is identical to ACII with a few new mechanics so you have nothing to get used to. Difficulty feels like it has been increased but nothing too frustrating. The most notable new mechanic is right in the title, being able to recruit assassins and help you out when you call upon them. However the game starts to feels like a grindfest when you want to rebuild Rome, it's the same mechanic on liberating each sector: muder captain, climb tower, set fire. Rennovating the shops is also just as tedious.But if you a fan of the Assassin's Creed series or open world gamplay, this is something you will enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great game. I liked the story and enjoyed exploring Rom. I remember that I often lost track of time while playing, wanted to finish just this one quest and ended up spending another hour. Some of the quests are very challenging and others are very easy, but almost all of them are fun. There were a few quests I needed more time to figure out how to solve them. I also tried the Multiplayer Part, but had a similar problem like I had with Splinter Cell. Other than with Splinter Cell I at least found a friend online, but couldn't make it work. I do play a lot of other Multiplayer games and had only problems with Ubisoft games so far. I know that I am not the only one, found many posts in forums and on blogs about that subject and think Ubisoft needs to make it easier for players to enjoy the Multiplayer portion of their games.But I still can recommend this game, because the single player is fun and will keep you occupied for some time.

												The first Assassin's Creed was clearly a game with great potential and cool ideas, a new approach to the ""sneak and stealh""-genre. But alas, it turned out weak due mostly to it's highly repetitive missions and completion structure, unintresting plotline and world and it's generally unpolished finish. Cue Brotherhood, the third installment in the franchise. This is Assassin's Creed in it's top form. A beautifully rendered Rome in the Reneissance Era with characters, buildings and events from real-life combined with the fictionous Ezio and his quest, vastly imporved controls that add to the fluidity of the parkour movements and the general feeling that now I, the player, am in control of not only Ezio but also Rome.

												Pretty good game overall. There is definetly a ton of things to do in Unity. I havent grinded this hard since got damned skyrim. That 100% is a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to get and hell I'm still trying. My only complaint thus far is that not all features of the game are in effect yet which is a little dissapointing. Oh well guess Ill just keep grinding until then. But what kinda irks me is how long it takes to find players for certain co-op missions and the fact that the clan or brotherhood system kinda sucks as far as communicating with members, or rarely even being able to invite even the online members so you can complete the club objectives. I wish there was a much better form of communication between club members, otherwise whats the damn point of even having the feature of the game if you can't talk to people. Its like coop with ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• AI. And lastly there is NO VOIP or even type chat. Really?! again whats the point of even having a multiplayer feature if you cant tell the retard ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing up your coop mission to get it together or be able to kick their stupid asses. This game needs a few tweaks and Ubisoft needs to kick in into gear quite a bit for the multplayer and coop features. But as far as singleplayer goes, Unity surpasses the previous games and for that reason I am content. For now.			",5,0,0,2,0,0,2

Sending in your 6 ""tag-alongs"" to destroy every single guard that you decided to mess with ( basically going around, assassinating one and running all over the town into the Vatican then sending in your assassins to fight off the 20+ guards you've managed to get on your tail).

												As a fan of the series this one is one of my personal favorites with arguably the best templar antagonist. The middle chapter of the Ezio trilogy this game does a great job of continuing Ezio's adventures. However if you have not played Assassin's Creed 2 I recomend playing that first as this picks up right after the cliff hanger ending of AC 2. In my opinion the game serves more than an Assassin's Creed 2.5 it is a true sequel.10/10			",10,3,0,1,0,0,0

												By and far one of my personal favorite iterations of the AC series! Brotherhood felt like the peak of the series (at least until the release of Black Flag) especially after the poor showings of Revelations and AC3. In my opinion Brotherhood's expansive content trumps even AC 2, and the story is top notch as well. Recommend purchasing on sale given the long shelf life.			",171,35,0,42,18,1,39

												This was my introduction to the Assassin's Creed franchise.  I chose to try this one first because it seemed to be the best reviewed entry.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  You have so much freedom to do missions as you like, and the parkour and platforming is very well done.  It deserves all the praise it has received.  It's not without its flaws, but it's such a fun game. I regret not purchasing the whole series while they were on sale during Christmas.  I hope there's another Steam sale for this franchise soon.

I have played it on console and love it.the problem is that the whole uplay thing screws up the game so bad u litterally cannot play it. I cant even open the game to play. It just crashes at the uplay thing which annoys the heck out of me. Until its fixed, I am going to feel like I just wasted 20$....However the game is a great game. Best in the series next to AC4.

												16th century Rome is beautiful, a great continuation of the Ezio trilogy. Gameplay is identical to ACII with a few new mechanics so you have nothing to get used to. Difficulty feels like it has been increased but nothing too frustrating. The most notable new mechanic is right in the title, being able to recruit assassins and help you out when you call upon them. However the game starts to feels like a grindfest when you want to rebuild Rome, it's the same mechanic on liberating each sector: muder captain, climb tower, set fire. Rennovating the shops is also just as tedious.But if you a fan of the Assassin's Creed series or open world gamplay, this is something you will enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Atmosphere of roma so real, from the building, how people speak, etc. Its 100% Italy. The combat is easy to learn and easy to use. You can recruit people to join the Brotherhood, and you can call them when you're fight. 100% synchronization is the challenge in here. Ignite the Borgia tower to unlocked the building around the tower. Crossbow and Gun blade is too overpower weapon. Power of Apple of Eden is very strong! Its easy to get money from bank!

												Considerig how this game just came out for mac, I figured I'd inform my fellow mac users on how it performs. Short answer: great.Long answer:I am playing this game with my 2015 macbook pro 15"". This game has been incredibly optimised for this system, for I can run the game at 60 fps and maximum settings. However, since the game is so well ported, it works much better than most other ports. I'm sure it can be run on any mac at various settings. As someone frequently concerned with port quality, I can confirm that this one is beautiful. One more thing: There is a new problem where on some systems where the game crashes on launch. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2183652 . There you go :).			",45,7,0,4,7,0,1

												Let me start off by saying that I love the Assassin's Creed game franchise, but this game is literally unplayable on windows 10. First, you have to download the crappy Uplay DRM launcher. It barely works and I had to reinstall it several times. Once opening the game, it lags and stutters at horrible speeds. I can barely get through th game menu at 5 fps. I am running dual GTX 970's.... my hardware is not the problem, the software is. Do not get this game if you have windows 10, I recommend reading the online forums about this game.

The ending was terrible and the overall game value was poor, it serves as a time gap filler between 2 and 3.Makes a lot more sense and becomes better if you play Revelations, but some of the gameplay additions to this one make the game break even to alright.

												Fantastic multiplayer!!! And more of the great campaign tied to AC2 that makes you feel like the coolest dude in the world.  But what's special about Brotherhood is the multiplayer, it provides a much needed break away from all the shooters out there in the industry.  You'll love trying to pick out your targets in the crowd of citizens but also trying to keep a low profile.  If you want a unique and refreshing multiplayer experience, or just plain love Assassin's Creed then you need to get this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite Revelations being the newer title, Brotherhood is what I consider to be the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed game concept. If you like the pairing of third-person action with RPG elements and free roam, you can easily sink 50 hours into it if you seek out the side quests! Multiplayer is also quite serviceable, though it's probably hard to find a community playing it now - better spent playing with friends.			",534,175,18,49,57,10,68

												Brotherhood exhibits most of the known [standalone] expansion symptoms, but that doesn't make it worse by default. Addition of requirements to 100% memories in general doesn't do much in terms of difficulty, but it's a baby step in the right direction. Story-wise the game holds up mainly thanks to a charismatic new villain because the rest of the opposition is generally forgettable and Brotherhood itself continues on with the same characters from the previous game with no major twists in sight. Speaking of which the ending goes for full-on cliffhanger bait, but all it manages to do is show that the same trick won't work twice. Usually.Also worth of note is Brotherhood's multiplayer which delivers a surprisingly compelling experience for the series' first foray into uncharted waters, even if it is essentially a rip-off of The Ship. Provided you can get enough players of similar rank in the game because higher ranks easily fall under ""Look Ma, no hands!"" builds with their abilities, though.			",906,388,16,192,89,8,171

												Whereas AC 2 struck the right balance between varied main story line missions and more random openworld sidequests, AC:Bro drowns the player in pointless, repetitive, busywork. Upgrading stores, recruiting and managing assassins, destroying towers, thieves guild tasks, brothel tasks...and the list goes on and on. In fact, it seems like halfway through the game new stuff is still being introduced, to the point that I kept wondering ""So when does the tutorial end and the game begin?""None of this would be a problem if all of this inconsequential fluff was interesting, but most is simply repeating the same things over and over again. When they aren't acting as dry tutorials for all the busywork the main quest missions can be quite good, but unfortunately they tend to be drowned out by all the added nonsense. Ultimately there's a good game beneath all the bloat (if you look for it), but this is still a small step backwards for the series.			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												This game picks up where Assassin's Creed 2 left off, continuing the story as Ezio Auditore (via Desmond). There is a lot of content to play through if you want to complete the whole thing.There are definitely some fun things here. The addition of the crossbow and poison darts as stealthy alternatives to the pistol is good. Being able to use a parachute glide anywhere is quite a nice feature, but I didn't find it useful very often. The best bit is being able to recruit and call-in your own assassins to take out whoever you like.Unfortunately, it's all let down by the implementation and design being inexcusably sloppy in places. I found quite a number of bugs which made me lose progress (although in most cases the check-points are quite frequent so I didn't lose much time overall). I also had almost constant controller problems. I'm not sure if this is specific to using the Xbox 360 controller, but it was very hard to make Ezio actually go where I wanted during climbing/free-running. He frequently leapt in the wrong direction.The worst part though is the mission design. A ridiculous number of them assumed you'd do things in a specific way which wasn't obvious at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why mission events didn't trigger and so on. In addition, the tasks were often very repetitive and dull. Way too many ""follow this person"" objectives.Having completed the story now, I wish I hadn't bothered with this game. The plot is quite weak and un-engaging. Playing through it became a frustrating chore, and I certainly won't bother trying to get 100% sync. It's a pity because (as I mentioned above) there are some fun bits. I would recommend steering clear though unless you're madly in love with Ezio.			",193,76,4,6,34,4,54

												ACII ended fine, but I suppose the series had to go on.  Its a great game.  The camera angles seem to have gotten a slight fix, they still go all wonky when you don't want them to, but not as common as they did before.  Two questions linger in my mind though.  How were players supposed to figure out some of these button combos for required puzzles?  Also, how did Ezio age so many years in the couple weeks that pass between ACII and this game?

												For what is arguably the long DLC to AC2, brotherhood is a romp well worth having and even more i found, enjoyable than AC2.Its basically AC2 but with more content and in my opinion, a better story driven plot. I enjoyed grooming my own assassins, finding rewards and galloping everywhere be it a little difficult in the narrow streets from time to time. The fightings good be it a little too easy once your assassin numbers swell not that you have to use them what with having thieves, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s and the likes to hand and the graphics is well, AC typical fine.Well worth a play and again, well worth picking up in a collection steam sale.

												Brotherhood... where do I start, So a about 20 minutes ago I wrote a review on AC2, if I where you I would read that and then read this. ACB took everything that was good about AC2 and added a little more, the world no longer has multiple cities and takes place only in Rome. A new mechanic has been added where the player can save citizens kind of like in AC1, after saving the citizen they can be added to the Assassin's guild. These assassin recruits can be summoned in combat. ACB has a slow story in the begining, but as the story heats up it gets better. I'm kind of bored so I'm gonna stop writing, its a great game so get it10/10EDIT: oh and it added muliplayer			",86,3,2,10,2,0,2

												I had this game sitting there for about 4 years because it wouldn't run properly.I recently decided to reinstall it and go through a bunch of Google searches trying to find a way to make it work. The solution was so simple and silly it was infuriating: Download Uplay. That was all. The game runs like a charm.Despite Ubisoft being, well, Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is a great series and I'm glad I can finally resume playing through it. Brotherhood has all the great things about AC2 and takes a little further.Good times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dont bother with ubisoft / uplay games.----------------------------------------------------------The review is base on story mode.-There are improvements in graphics, but the mod does not suit well causing some disappearances of structures, while switching the camera view.-The menu takes too long to load, which is frustrating.It is only play-able to reveal the destiny of Ezio. Recomended for those who are willing to find out the journey of Ezio, otherwise, wait until the next sale.I have bought the Assassins Creed franchise 1~4 during the summer sale.so far, my rating goesAC 2 > AC 1 > AC 2 Brotherhood			",31,1,0,0,2,0,4

												Coming in off AC:II, which is undeniably one of the high points in the Assassin's Creed  series, the bar is set high for Brotherhood. Set in Rome several years after the events in AC:II, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city (and then the entirety of Italy).Personally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a '100% Sync%' on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the (sometimes ridiculous) extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and it's impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.Rome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassin's Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100% sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.Combat hasn't really evolved from the second game, you'll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassin's, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassin's and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezio's name.Brotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like they've tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassin's Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just don't expect it to light up your life.(Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.)			",262,46,6,47,17,0,31

Moving around the Rome is actually pretty fun, and if you feel like learning something, the Animus Database has some interesting facts and knowledge of history.The new Assassin Recruiting -mechanic was really fun, and it helps in some situations a lot.The game itself plays just like AC2, but the plot isn't actually as compelling, although still pretty good.The end of the game was hectic as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and I loved it the most in the game.There's not enough Da Vinci, though.

												This game is great: it runs very smoothly and efficiently, the plot is well developed, and the freerunning is a little less linear or obvious now. There are some zones that you navigate like a 3-dimmensional maze. Combat is a lot more fluid and you can kill many more units at once, so there are now much larger battles in place.The plot is well-written, and, as with the environments, attention was taken on details-- at least until about 60% synched. I'm not spoiling anything, but just know that the game is about 90% complete when it gets to about 60%, and you can't access any more of the world (shops, training, etc.) once you get to this point. (With broken armor it made this part incredibly hard.)The multiplayer is also very well done. It's pretty unique to the market, even in its execution: it's a game where not only do you match your abilities versus your opponents, but your ability to play mind-games as well. Incredibly well done.			",151,17,1,17,19,2,20

												The second Assassin's Creed title I've played.  The core mechanics remain the same, which in most cases is a mixed blessing.  In this case I think it worked out for the best, since the level design and a handful of new mechanics encouraged me to try out new tactics I hadn't attempted in the previous game.  In particular I made much use of the crossbow, poison darts, and minion attacks, the combination of which allowed me to take on much larger groups of guards without losing health.  As a strategic minded player, I greatly enjoyed leveling up my minions by sending them on missions.  I spent 24 hours on the game, and overall I think I got my moneys worth.8/10			",326,96,5,39,53,1,49

												Good game, too short.So ACII was pretty good, it was a true upgrade from the AC experience and yet I guess Ubisoft decided to make money and ruin a great franchise going the CoD way, the only thing wrong is that they don't have 3 teams to build a game in a 3 year cycle. Anyway I really thought it would be better since people recommended me the game so much but it just feels like an episode from ACII.I was hoping the game to contribute more to the main story and not just give you the intro, play 10 in game hours and then give you another clue about the ""actual story"" of the franchise. If you like these games, then I'm sure you'll like to do the same stuff that ACII brought to us. If you're not that into AC then I'd probably pass Brotherhood and Revelations to play ACIII. I hope Revelations isn't that bad since most people say it is.PROS-Assasins are a really a great feature of the game, but I would've like to use them earlier on the game.CONS-Game is too short compared to ACII, it's actually half the story in game time.-Story doesn't tells you much about what the heck is going on with Desmond.-Rebuilding things is cool, but feels empty anyway it doesnt help much in the game to do everysingle shop.-Gather all the *insert anything that comes to your mind here*.The game is good, but nothing great which I was expecting after playing ACII. I guess this is where money and Ubisoft face the downfall of AC franchise? Well I hope not because I will play Revelations for Reviewer's sake and hope it has more to offer...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although it seems like a long time away, there was a time when after the announcement of brotherhood people thought Ubisoft was going to fall into money laundering with unfinished and broken games annually.Eventually they did but not before making a game as fantastic a brotherhood.Pros-+Takes the strenghts of the previous game and adds some new features.+Ezio as charming as ever.+New chain streak kills and animations.+Full synchronization option puts a new spin to the classic mission design.Makes it more replayable.+Leonardo's war machine sequences.+Side quests are more engrossing than ac 2.+A healthy albeit a shorter campaign.+Innovate multiplayer is tense and an exercise in restrain.Cons--While the game manages enough to feel different from 2 but the streets and art of Rome feel too similar Florence.-Recruiting assassin's makes an already easier game like this a cool breeze.Hence it's best avoided.Score-9/10			",187,35,2,18,5,2,18

												AC Brotherhood continues just where we left off in AC2: this time we'll be spending almost the entire game in Rome only fighting the Borgia.The general gameplay is further improved, being able to ride horses in the city and quicktraveling through the sewers are appreciated additions. I liked the idea of freeing zones from Borgia's influence making the classic towers' unlock more challenging and fun, while also allowing you to develop Rome's economy, just like AC2's Monteriggioni on a larger scale. Oh, did I mention the assassins? The more areas you free, the more assassins you can recruit in the brotherhood, helping you out in combat when you don't feel like END GAME SPOILER AHEAD killing all those guards with a freaking apple only, just let me take out one blade, will you?The map is once again well designed and we finally have a little action going on in the present with Desmond as well.The game is on par with AC2, if not slightly better, only negative thing to mention is the shorter play time, it ended too soon and unexpectedly for my taste, penalizing the final score.82/100			",107,19,1,10,4,0,10

Even though there are a lot of simultaneous missions and lots of areas open at the same time, which might cause a headache to some, it also gives the opportunity to choose what you want to do instead of following the plot all the time. Also features tradable items and maps that help you find feathers and flags.			",92,43,1,13,7,0,15

												Holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I never really believed it was possible to out-do Assassin's Creed II, but they did it. And they did it in style.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place almost entirely in Roma. The plot of the game is intriguing, and, unlike Assassin's Creed II, most of the side-missions are short but just as sweet. There is some DLC one could purchase and, honestly, I recommend it highly.They improved everything that has to do with combat without sacrificing the difficulty all-together. Wall climbing is also substantially faster without being too much easier. The graphics are breathtaking, a whole step up from ACII. Horses make a comeback, and it is now much easier to move about a large portion of a city (besides quick travels through the sewers) and, more importantly, horses are now another variable in combat.I can't really think of anything that his game got wrong! Even the multiplayer is fantastic! Albeit, somewhat dead nowadays.YOU SHOULD PLAY AC & ACII BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME9 OF 10Silence Dogood			",136,13,3,17,19,0,29

												Amazing Game. Update to the graphics engine improves so much on the look and feel, auditory sounds in the cities make it so much more lifelike than in the past two games, the HUD has been slimmed down and the optimization of the game is just amazing. New interactions, items, weapons, city economies, additional parkour elements and a brand new storyline makes this much less an upgrade with the same characters and different storyline, but a fully new game with four times the facets as the previous one.The multiplayer has been flawless since release day, being able to choose your own character skin and just the simple way to play multiplayer with the quick tutorial is so much fun and before you know it 2 hours have gone by in extreme fun. This was worth my $50 by a long shot.			",151,29,3,14,11,1,13

												For what is arguably the long DLC to AC2, brotherhood is a romp well worth having and even more i found, enjoyable than AC2.Its basically AC2 but with more content and in my opinion, a better story driven plot. I enjoyed grooming my own assassins, finding rewards and galloping everywhere be it a little difficult in the narrow streets from time to time. The fightings good be it a little too easy once your assassin numbers swell not that you have to use them what with having thieves, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s and the likes to hand and the graphics is well, AC typical fine.Well worth a play and again, well worth picking up in a collection steam sale.

												ACII ended fine, but I suppose the series had to go on.  Its a great game.  The camera angles seem to have gotten a slight fix, they still go all wonky when you don't want them to, but not as common as they did before.  Two questions linger in my mind though.  How were players supposed to figure out some of these button combos for required puzzles?  Also, how did Ezio age so many years in the couple weeks that pass between ACII and this game?

												This game picks up where Assassin's Creed 2 left off, continuing the story as Ezio Auditore (via Desmond). There is a lot of content to play through if you want to complete the whole thing.There are definitely some fun things here. The addition of the crossbow and poison darts as stealthy alternatives to the pistol is good. Being able to use a parachute glide anywhere is quite a nice feature, but I didn't find it useful very often. The best bit is being able to recruit and call-in your own assassins to take out whoever you like.Unfortunately, it's all let down by the implementation and design being inexcusably sloppy in places. I found quite a number of bugs which made me lose progress (although in most cases the check-points are quite frequent so I didn't lose much time overall). I also had almost constant controller problems. I'm not sure if this is specific to using the Xbox 360 controller, but it was very hard to make Ezio actually go where I wanted during climbing/free-running. He frequently leapt in the wrong direction.The worst part though is the mission design. A ridiculous number of them assumed you'd do things in a specific way which wasn't obvious at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why mission events didn't trigger and so on. In addition, the tasks were often very repetitive and dull. Way too many ""follow this person"" objectives.Having completed the story now, I wish I hadn't bothered with this game. The plot is quite weak and un-engaging. Playing through it became a frustrating chore, and I certainly won't bother trying to get 100% sync. It's a pity because (as I mentioned above) there are some fun bits. I would recommend steering clear though unless you're madly in love with Ezio.			",193,76,4,6,34,4,54

												Do you like doing the same frustrating thing over and over again, and looking at the same flashing red FAIL screen everytime when you do not play the game exactly  the way the game wants you to play it?  Well this is the game for you!  This game is such a mix-up of playing styles, some really fun and some really frustrating and totally not fun.  It really seems like a frankenstein game made up of different parts by different programming teams - as the INCREDIBLY long credits proves!  Just too much design by committee here instead of a single vision.  Yes, I did finish the game but it was such a chore to do so, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I guess I do recommend it as I did finish the game, but it's really not as much fun as the first 2 games in the series in my opinion.  And that ended - wtf!  Really a total letdown to end the game like that especially after the previous game ended so well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It keeps glitching. ALL OF THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING TIME. Ohh... and the last Ezio chapter or sequence or how ever the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you want to call it... I couldn't start the last part, the game didn't load the cinematic. I did a quick google search and it turns out I'm not the only one who had this problem.

												It isn't Assassin‚Äôs Creed Brotherhood, it's more Assassin‚Äôs Creed 2, and that is not a bad thing. The main problem is that the story is perhaps not as enthralling as its predecessor, but if you've played through Assassin‚Äôs Creed 2, the entire situation is given a little more context. If you found some annoying problems with the movement or combat in Assassin‚Äôs Creed 2, they will probably still be present, so be warned. The resource management minigame is an interesting distraction, and there is some satisfaction to be had in seeing your hired assassins become more skillful.			",173,36,4,29,8,3,27

												Amazing Game. Update to the graphics engine improves so much on the look and feel, auditory sounds in the cities make it so much more lifelike than in the past two games, the HUD has been slimmed down and the optimization of the game is just amazing. New interactions, items, weapons, city economies, additional parkour elements and a brand new storyline makes this much less an upgrade with the same characters and different storyline, but a fully new game with four times the facets as the previous one.The multiplayer has been flawless since release day, being able to choose your own character skin and just the simple way to play multiplayer with the quick tutorial is so much fun and before you know it 2 hours have gone by in extreme fun. This was worth my $50 by a long shot.			",151,29,3,14,11,1,13

												+ Classic stabby-climby gameplay still not getting old.+ Improves a lot of little things from ACII (everything is more expensive so money has more meaning, ability to buy maps to find all those damn flags & feathers)+ Challenge modes in crazy virtual-land are actually quite fun.+ Rome setting pretty awesome - climbing all over the Colosseum is cool.+ Ordering instant assassinations from the Brotherhood: OP or hilarious every time?- Story is confusing for the first few hours unless you've just played ACII.- Is there any practical difference between the crossbow, throwing knives and pistol?- Played 40 hours, still don't understand investment system.

												Didn't buy this originally because I thought it would play like a DLC money grab but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Sure it's still the same game I know and love but there's a good 20 hours plus of single player content set in Rome and they've introduced the most original multiplayer mode there has been for decades based around blending in with the AI civilians. They've also added challenges and some hard time trial stages which are very much welcome. Ended up getting 100% as usual too because I'm so fond of the free running and climbing.

												A refinement of part 2, which I liked more but which I also did not play on Steam, so you're getting a recommendation of this and not that. The gameplay is standard Assassin's Creed stuff with a few additions that make it much easier, it's up to you whether that's a good or bad thing. I found a lot of the upgrade systems to be largely unecessary and mostly just busywork. If you play it stealthy like you're supposed to you won't need more powerful weapons and armor. And as long as you learn the combat you can get by with anything. The dialogue is not always great but at least the overall story is not insufferably bad. Requiescat in pace, videogioch.

												A sequel to AC2, you could easily say that this is AC2 again but extending the storyline further with some better closure than the previous game delivered (It's basically AC2's second half). It picks up right where AC2 ends and continues on with more funtimes and stuff to do. There are new improvements here to the gameplay, graphics, and the gigantic city of Rome is much larger and unique than any other location in the previous games. It's slightly bigger than its predecessor, and it adds multiplayer (which probably nobody plays anymore) as well. If you want innovation, there isn't much here. But if you enjoyed AC2 and want to keep running with that, this is the game for you.			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												I have always loved the assassins creed games but this one remains my favourite, (not including new releases, unity and rogue, and black flag) as I have yet to play those.  Being able to recruit your own assassins and train them up is a great feature they added to the assasssins creed games.  As well as Etzio remembering where you have seen things like flags and feathers by adding them onto the map once you have seen them in eagle vision, this way you can come back for them later and not have to remember where they are.  Such a simple improvement and useful feature.  Love this game so much !!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10Overall not a bad expansion, Ezio is a likeable protagonist though the story is a little dull and feels a bit drawn out and padded with too many side quests. If you're looking for more ACII then this will not disappoint.++ Builds on the same solid gameplay as ACII+Some interesting developments in Desmonds story line (Main reason I played this in the first place)+Leonardo's warmachines are a blast+/- Lots of new mechanics, to the point that at times it feels like there are too many.+/- Tons of side missions (Played 60 hours and didn't even come close to doing them all). Good if you want to spend lots of time playing the game but they feel shallow and tacked on at times.---""Why would you jump that way Ezio!?!  Of course I don't want you to jump to your death, there's a ledge right there, wouldn't you like to grab it instead?!""-Never get to use Leonardo's warmachines outside of their individual missions!-Would REALLY like if the achievements showed in Steam! (Not the games fault obviously).-Some missions have vague objectives where you'll keep failing and not really know why.Definitely recommend if you enjoyed ACII, just don't expect any ground breaking changes.

However once you have completed the campaign and sides missions the game really just drops since multiplayer is lacking players based on the games age. But still if you are looking for a 15-25 hour long campaign with a great story this would be a game to check out. Worth the price and worth the time.			",68,15,1,4,5,1,2

												Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (henceforth referred to as AC:B) is the third title in the Assassin's Creed series. Chronologically taking place after AC2, this is a nice sequel. Admittedly the numerous graphical glitches (ground not loading, birds stretching into the sky, enemies sliding on hills) are distracting and do take you out of the moment. The story is gripping, and the addition of heavy weapons is a nice touch. However, AC:B fails in the respect of convenience: you have to buy the stores yourself in order for them to sell you things, and you often need quite a bit of money to do that. Frankly they should have not included that facet, it was the worst part of the game. The combat was much to easy, AC1 had the right idea in preventing you from using the counter move until halfway through the game, forcing you to dodge and such. Despite this, I still reccomend this game.			",108,25,0,10,7,0,2

												The Single Player is not much more than Assassin's Creed 2, just one or two new ways to kill people or get around the city, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but any gripes with the series so far probably haven't been addressed with this installment, and what people have liked about the series is still in the game.  My favorite aspect of Brotherhood was the multiplayer.  I personally haven't played any game that had this style of gameplay, so it was ""fresh"" so to say, something new to learn, new mechanics to wrap my head around and master, a different way to use the mechanics we were given in single player.  I greatly enjoyed the way the multiplayer emulated the feeling that the original assassin's creed created when it first released, which was the feeling of being an assassin, which I personally haven't felt since AC 1 was released.

												A must have for any Assassin's Creed fan!The game adds substantial new content and improvements to make it worth the full price. While some people, myself included. Thought before launch that it would simply be a rehash of AsC 2 with little new content in terms of the singleplayer. We have definitely been proven wrong.This game is also a proper PC port with vastly upgraded graphics in comparison to AsC-B on consoles. Proper UI, HUD and menus and for the first time in a while, the ability to play offline (yes, that's right the DRM that was so hated in AsC 2 is now gone!)The multiplayer is extremely fun and while some might say it bears resemblence to the Ship, the similarities are small, if any at all. At most one could say it was inspired by the Ship.The multiplayer mechanics work well and leave a lot of room for player skill to play a role. There is also a decent variety of modes, all of which provide different feel and play tactics.All in all the best AsC to date!			",226,32,5,11,15,2,53

												Brotherhood picks up the story exactly (literally!) when AC2 left it. And I must say, I'm pretty amazed by what the producers did with this game. The combat system is much better now, with introduction of killing streaks, but also with stronger and more difficult enemies. To get 100% in the mission, you have to also do some additional objectives (which sometimes are quite troublesome!). The city of Rome is an amazingly big area, unlike anything you have seen in the previous games. Characters are very interesting and the whole storyline is quite good (though, not as good as in AC2 in my opinion). Also, there are multitudes of additional missions and content, so finishing the entire game takes tremendeous amount of time. All in all, this game will definitely not dissapoint you so I can recommend it to anyone that loves AC.Actually, after playing AC:R, AC3 and AC4, I must say that if you love AC franchise, that would be the last game I would recommend to play, if you don't want a huge letdown.

												In my opinion this is one of the best Assassins Creed games out of the thousands that are now available.Ezio is in his prime and on the prowl for the ladies and revenge.Great brotherhood mechanics involve recruiting people to join your creed which add depth and a sense of impact on the world as you call in you brothers and sister to help you if things go wrong.This is one of the last Assassins Creeds to have a have decent story that I really enjoyed progressing through the game.

												While the Assassin's Creed series isn't exactly shining at the time that I write this, this game is, and likely always will be, my favorite Assassin's Creed game and one of my favorite games of all time. It has a vast and realistic depiction of Rome, with details so accurate you can find some of the small alleys that really exist there in-game. It has complex characters and a charismatic lead who is questionable but sympathetic. It has side missions that actually engross you. It is essentially everything that AC2 was, but with a little more gameplay variety, and in Rome to boot. I strongly recommend this game.			",97,12,0,6,6,2,5

												Assassin's Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of 'The Matrix' in which you play a protagonist in the 'real world' who becomes someone else inside a 'virtual world'. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars - and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few - which tells a massive story back-to-back instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Awesome franchise!			",376,87,11,48,43,0,73

It just crashes at the uplay thing which annoys the heck out of me. Until its fixed, I am going to feel like I just wasted 20$....However the game is a great game. Best in the series next to AC4.

												This is in truth of of the greatest games I have ever played. Packing not only a story and some gameplay, it also delivers an ideology.The story is good, although not as fantastic as the game in the series prior to this (Assassin's Creed II). The gameplay on the other hand is brilliant, and odds are you won't be 100% done before you've spent a couple of days with it.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers multiple ways to deal with objectives, as well as a lot of small side missions- and quests. You're able to build and customize both yourself, but also your allies. At the top of my head, you can do just about anything you would want to do in the rennesaince, apart from killing innocents. Including riding around on a unicorn.			",117,11,3,4,6,0,15

												This game is great: it runs very smoothly and efficiently, the plot is well developed, and the freerunning is a little less linear or obvious now. There are some zones that you navigate like a 3-dimmensional maze. Combat is a lot more fluid and you can kill many more units at once, so there are now much larger battles in place.The plot is well-written, and, as with the environments, attention was taken on details-- at least until about 60% synched. I'm not spoiling anything, but just know that the game is about 90% complete when it gets to about 60%, and you can't access any more of the world (shops, training, etc.) once you get to this point. (With broken armor it made this part incredibly hard.)The multiplayer is also very well done. It's pretty unique to the market, even in its execution: it's a game where not only do you match your abilities versus your opponents, but your ability to play mind-games as well. Incredibly well done.			",151,17,1,17,19,2,20

												Amazing game. A lot like AC2 but even better in every way except the length. I found that the end came a bit quickly after playing the second game and expecting something similar. I suppose I could have explored more and done more of the side missions, but it felt like I was maybe half way through exploration and side quests and then I was finding myself at the end of the story. Well I shouldn't focus this review on that as the game itself was incredible and the story was great. Overall it was better than the second one and I can't wait to start Revelations to complete this trilogy. Side note, If you didn't play AC2 first, do that for sure, then play this.

												Awesome follow up to AC2.  Plenty of stuff to do after you've done the main quest, including assassinations, training your own apprentices, rebuilding parts of Rome, investing in small businesses and just soaking up the amazing atmosphere of Renaissance Italy!  It will take you well over 100 hours of gameplay to 100% complete (I have only about half of this because my game client used to glitch out and not count hours).  Anyway I would 100% recommend this game if you have previously played AC2, otherwise you will have no clue about what is going on when you come to start.

												Good way to continue from where AC2 has ended. If you want to play a good Assassin's Creed game, here's more of it where AC2 left off. Combat is still lawful, and I was in no hurry trying to get the best armour of the game. I finished the story mode without it.I haven't really played the multiplayer. I'm not the one to judge it. I tried the tutorial & it required a re-bind to the controller, but I haven't really done much in that.I recomend it for the story mode.Update after 102 hours of playing: If you're a fan of the series & you have a SSD, go on and have a go, but if you don't you can't 100% the singleplayer. Ubisoft back in 2010 decided to make galloping a SSD only feature in freeroam mode. My second playthrough was not as enjoyable as the first. Also to note some the Da-Vinci machines are awkward to control and completing the no hit requirement in the memory just makes it infuriating.			",120,5,1,11,7,0,2

												The sequel to ACII didn't disappoint, Brotherhood was really fun to play. The story continues the fight against the Borgia and their Templar agents in Rome, Ezio takes it upon himself to lead the Assassin Order as they try to free Rome from their influence. This was nicely portrayed as you rebuild your Assassin Order while crippling Templar presence. The story was shorter than the previous game, but it was still very well made and packed with intriguing characters.The gameplay didn‚Äôt change much from ACII, but did add some entertaining side missions like liberating sectors of Rome from Borgia oppression, further develop the city‚Äôs economy and various assassination contracts. Ezio develops his leadership skills while training recruits and managing the Order, this also allows the ability to call assassins as backup or send them on mission across Europe.The graphics and animations are amazing, the streets, the architecture and monuments and landmarks of Rome are breathtaking and really add to the game‚Äôs immersion. The soundtrack itself adds to this, combining some old songs with new ones, really good work.Definately a game worth buying and a great addition to the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very much an iteration on Assassin's Creed II, but not necessarily in a bad way. The combat and movement of Ezio feels more fluid and refined, and so does everything else in this sequel.Rome is a fantastic location with tons of unique scenery and history. The missions are varied and fun and the game is about the right length. A bit shorter than Assassin's Creed 2 which was a bit too long in my opinion.Make sure you activate the free Leonardo Da'Vinci expansion in UPlay, it contains a couple of great missions.The biggest difference from the last game is that you're not on your own as much anymore. You get to recruit and train followers that can earn you money and aid you in combat.Lastly it's great to see proper controller bindings now, bindings that actually makes sense. Assassin's Creed II controller binds were just all over the place but now it works like it should.Overall a great, refined game!			",47,7,2,1,10,0,5

												Do you like doing the same frustrating thing over and over again, and looking at the same flashing red FAIL screen everytime when you do not play the game exactly  the way the game wants you to play it?  Well this is the game for you!  This game is such a mix-up of playing styles, some really fun and some really frustrating and totally not fun.  It really seems like a frankenstein game made up of different parts by different programming teams - as the INCREDIBLY long credits proves!  Just too much design by committee here instead of a single vision.  Yes, I did finish the game but it was such a chore to do so, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I guess I do recommend it as I did finish the game, but it's really not as much fun as the first 2 games in the series in my opinion.  And that ended - wtf!  Really a total letdown to end the game like that especially after the previous game ended so well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! Good successor after Assassin's Creed II. Rome has been made well and after the initial confusion it turns out to be very huge and explorable. There are lot's to do for everyone, who has even bit of an adventurious nature and even though combat is way too easy and crossbow is significantly overpowered, one can easily overcome these by trying pacifistic (hurt minimal amount) or ghostlike (not been seen or vanquish right away when seen), or what ever the player feels like. Little problems setting up ubisoft user but game made it all quickly up. Also I was suprised that the online player vs player was still plentifully occupied with fellow assassins.			",42,3,0,8,2,0,9

												The second Assassin's Creed title I've played.  The core mechanics remain the same, which in most cases is a mixed blessing.  In this case I think it worked out for the best, since the level design and a handful of new mechanics encouraged me to try out new tactics I hadn't attempted in the previous game.  In particular I made much use of the crossbow, poison darts, and minion attacks, the combination of which allowed me to take on much larger groups of guards without losing health.  As a strategic minded player, I greatly enjoyed leveling up my minions by sending them on missions.  I spent 24 hours on the game, and overall I think I got my moneys worth.8/10			",326,96,5,39,53,1,49

Atmosphere of roma so real, from the building, how people speak, etc. Its 100% Italy. The combat is easy to learn and easy to use. You can recruit people to join the Brotherhood, and you can call them when you're fight. 100% synchronization is the challenge in here. Ignite the Borgia tower to unlocked the building around the tower. Crossbow and Gun blade is too overpower weapon. Power of Apple of Eden is very strong! Its easy to get money from bank!

												I thought I'd re-recommend some games due to how poorly written and dumb my old recommendations were.The Assassin's Creed series has always been a great series (with a few exceptions ;3), and its games often are amazing and enjoyable, with breathtaking scenery and amazing gameplay: this one is no exception.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood consists of a fairly long storyline, filled with enjoyable and interesting missions.  Playing in the beautiful city of Roma as Ezio Auditore is a great experience, and the city allows for much adventure and open world exploration outside of the storyline.  In fact, there are multiple stories you can follow, for instance there is a free addition you can download where you play a story that takes place shortly after the main adventure.  The game also intertwines with historical places, facts, and people, such as the Borgias.  The main antagonist is Cesare Borgia, a well-developed and historically-based character.  The storyline shows how you attack him from various directions and slowly take back the city.  This installment of the series introduces a new concept: Assassin Recruits.  The game allows you to pick up fellow citizens and teach them in the ways of the assassin, and throughout the story you can call upon them to help you.  In general, this can lead to many fun battles: I personally enjoyed running around and attracting as many guards as possible, then just call in fellow assassins and murder them all. >:DThe multiplayer mode of this game is great.  To run around and attack others while being chased yourself in a small area is so much fun, and there are all sorts of gimmicks and hiding places you can use to make chases and escapes even more exhilirating.  However, it can be difficult to get a multiplayer game going, since there aren't often many people on the network.  If you manage to get a game though, stay in it and play around for a while, you'lll unlock new bonuses and rewards as you level up from playing.One last thing to note about this game is the enviornment.  I mentioned before that the game takes place in Roma, and in case you didn't know, Rome is a pretty vast and beautiful place. :P  You don't play through Rome during its days of glory, but long after when many of its structures are in ruins and the Borgia have complete control and power over the city.  As you gain wealth and status in the city (usually from not-so friendly ways... protip: Borgia Towers are strangely very flammable), you can repair old buildings, buy renown places such as the Coliseum and the Pantheon and gain the trust of nearby factions such as theives and courtesans.  In general, the envoirnment is very large yet extremely detailed and gorgeous.  With so much to do in the city, oftentimes you may set out to go get something done but find yourself trying to kill a Borgia Captain and igniting a tower hours later.In general, the game is amazing.  As I said in my previous 2-word review: ""Awesome shtuff.""			",49,7,4,9,4,0,1

												The 2nd of the Ezio trilogy. And if you are new to the games, I would reccomend starting with AC2 first justto understand the story. A definite sequel. Improves upon nearly every single game mechanic of Assassin's Creed 2, and is personally my favorite in the series. The combat is more fluid. The guilds make sense and are utilized in the story. Even capturing areas and exploring the world are tied into the 'story' of the game. I only wish the other games in the series took more notes from this one.			",63,4,1,7,5,0,10

												Being a fan of the Assassin's Creed series, this is the game to which I compare any of the following storylines, by far. With simple, yet elegant physics and a storyline which actually made me cry in a side-mission (no spoilers), this game first drew my attention just to edge closer to fulfilling the story of Assasin's Creed 2. Which it does with perfection (by my standards, of course).Never before or since this game have I felt so truly free to roam a map and to choose my battles by myself. ",312,99,7,38,48,4,33

												Assassins Creed Brotherhood is what I would consider a very good expansion to AC2. Ubisoft refined the combat system and the storyline is as enticing as ever. Sure, the Desmond parts are just the usual acrobatic feats but it's great. Ezio, now in his 40's and an experienced Assassin heads to Rome, and Rome is huuuuuge! I won't waste time on the SP experience as I loved it. As for the story? It was good but it doesn't top AC2 in terms of the wow-factor.The Mulitplayer is what shocked me. It's so fun. It's really fun! I thought it would fail but it didn't and I can't get enough of it! Sure you have the nooby roof runners which will‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•you off and the MP will get on your nerves and have you raging, but it's great nevertheless. 8/10 from me overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brotherhood in a way is a great sequal to Assassin's Creed 2, the story picks up literally right where you left it in the 2nd game. Graphics are a bit more refined but still retain the same quality and style as the 2nd making the transition to this one easier I feel than the transition to Revalations. Story wise it is gripping and intersting, very enjoyable and rewarding system of gaining assassins and watching them grow up under your wing into ruthless effective killers. Most certainly worth it, even though i'm a bit slow to get through the Assassin's Creed games, I still agree that these games are worth checking out.			",265,36,1,34,22,0,21

												Another good installment of AC.  8/10.  Picks up after AC 2, with Ezio again a few years after AC 2 took place.  Focused solely in Rome with 4 areas that unlock as you progress.  The story was interesting.  Ezio pulls together the 3 factions to defat a common enemy, and ends with a decent addition to the lore.  Graphics look good.  Combat is the same as usual.  Entertaining but frustrating.  Running through streets will enevitibly result in you running up a wall you didn't intend to, or hoping up on a barrel killing your progress in timed missions.  The camera will hide behind a tree during a battle with multiple enemies.  If Ubisoft could solve these issues this series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but as of AC 4, they are still present.  I liked the economic twist they added in this installment.  Investing money in shops to get rewards to unlock more weapons, although it looks like they dropped the mechanic at some point, since it wasn't in AC 4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brotherhood starts off immediately where the previous game left off. When I say this, I really mean you start in the exact spot, wearing the same gear you were at the end of the previous game. The story picks up right away and continues to entice.This game, while different in various ways, keeps the same essence of the last game. You explore Roma during the Borgia reign of the early 16th century. This allows for, like all the games, some splendid views and the ability to truly appreiciate the thought and effort put into the design of the city and surrounding areas plus the attention to detail that I have come to enjoy and appreiciate. There is a lot to do in this game. The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale. The added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage. It made the replay value, for even the first time through, appealing and challenging. Overall, if you like the series and played the games up until this point, continue to do so. You won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Single-Player: More of the same from AC2, but nonetheless very enjoyable. Side missions have more variety, and the combat styles are more complex than ever.

However it's also a real pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to your connection settings; for me, I have to sit for literally hours just to find a session and play for about  2-3 rounds. This issue has not been resolved since its launch on PC.Overall: SP is great, MP is great, but the matchmaking downright sucks.

And while I realize it's a sequel, a good sequel should bring something new to the table while preserving the thing that made the original entertaining.  The game basically just continued the story and gave Edzio a few new toys.If you want to play the Assassin Creed games for the storyline (and you should), then you should play this game.  It's still fun, it's just a bit tiring in the gameplay department since we've done all of this already.			",155,18,0,39,16,1,27

												Okay, all Assassin's Creeds have the same basic idea, but they are different usually. But, AC: Brotherhood and AC II are VERY similar in many respects, and since I haven't played them for awhile, I am literally copy-pasting the same review to both of them because I can't remember all the little things that are different, because really, they are very similar. So here we go:I love the Assassin's Creed series. I played the first AC about seven years ago, and I played it nonstop. The basic idea of AC is that you are and assassin, and you have a city as your assassination-playground, usually multiple locations. You start the game as Desmond, a guy who uses a machine called the Animus to shoot back in time to his ancestors' history. This is accomplished from the Animus being able to use his mind as a channel for those ancestors' memories. Then, you are his ancestor, an assassin. and you have to kill things. The story is usually deep and intriguing, and it brings you along, and the gameplay of it is awesome too. And then you can just do random things as sidequests, usually pickpocketing, or another assassination target, stuff like that. You have two profiles: Low profile, where you don't draw attention, and just push past people, or walk. Then High profile, by holding right trigger, where then you start running and you can parkour, fight, shove through people, and sprint. The combat is fun, and the sneaky-assassinating is satisfying. There's some flaws, but Brotherhood and AC II are probably the best out of this series. Would recommend anybody to try.			",146,18,2,3,4,0,3

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is in my opinion, the best Assassin's Creed game out there.Let me tell you why.The story picks up right after Assassins Creed II's ending, so I can't really talk much about what it happens in it, but what I can say is that Desmond finds himself in Monteriggioni reliving the rest of the memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze to look for clues as to where is the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact from an advanced civilization of old.Ezio's story itself also takes place right after the ending of Assassins Creed II, but to keep it spoiler free, all I can tell is that Ezio now finds himself in Rome trying to take on The Borgia family's tyranny while building his own Assassin Brotherhood.From this little synopsis of the plot you can pretty much tell the most important draw fromt he game, it doesn't feel 100% new in it's assassin story. It just expands upon Ezio's story in AC II. Plus the game doesn't do many things differently from AC II in terms of presentation or even core gameplay, BUT it does add many other good things.For instance, the game adds dual wielding to some weapons, which removes the tediousness of constantly having to switch weapons using the weapon wheel to change weapons. Not only that, but now you can customize the d-pad weapon shortcuts. The game also adds a killstreak feature which allows you to make chain kills in combat, while it's fun to use, it makes the combat a little too easy. The game adds new weapons like: The crossbow or the Poison Darts, which offer new approaches to each situation that's presented to you. Another feature is that you can now use horses everywhere in the city of Rome, making navigation much faster. Another great feature is that now you can exit the Animus at any time to play as Desmond and interact with your crew and surroundings, and I must admit that it comes close to the the great moments as Desmond from AC I, disgracely roaming in Monteriggioni is timed and you cannot do much. But seeing how Monteriggioni has aged is considerably interesting.Now the main gameplay feature from Brotherhood is that you can now recruit Assassins into your own Brotherhood, which can aid you in battle or on assasinations. This assassins can be sent on missions for experience and other rewards until they reach the Asassin rank. This system can essentially bring more hours of gameplay and enjoyment into the game. The last system added unto the game is the Rome renovation system, in which you can invest on locales from Rome after you've eliminated Borgia controll, which can give you money in return. While similar to the Monteriggioni system from AC II it does add some more depth to it.The only issue I have from all of this is that there are far too many things to do in the game eventually leaving you overwhelmed by all the choices.The story is presented in the same way as AC II, while adding the much needed memory replay option and some interesting optional objectives to get cheats or costumes for your character.Another feature from this game is a multiplayer component, which consists in assassinating other players while trying not to be assasinated. I couldn't really check it out because of the following issue, THE COMMUNITY IS BASICALLY DEAD. It is pretty much impossible to play a good MP match nowadays because of the lack of dedicated servers or an active community to play with.Overall, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood does everything that Assassin's Creed II did right, while at the same time adding new content to the game. This is a must play for every AC fan out there and a worthwhile check to everyone else.If you are not a big fan of AC get it on sale at least but check it out at least once in your life.PC PORT REPORT: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU UPLAY I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING HATE YOU. Same issues with AC I though. Poor controls that can be rebindable, so if you plan on checking this game out I recommend getting a controller compatible with a PC beforehand. If you have the console version I recommend staying away from this PC port because it doesn't add anything worthwhile to the core game.			",38,4,3,9,3,0,1

Not that great for keyboard and mouse (uses four keys alternating not including the movements and camera on the mouse). There was a lot of fustrating parts where you are climbing when you mean to run.Best mechanic is the companion leveling system.I recommend this game for AC fans.

												Out of the series, this is my favourite so far. Familiarity of AC 2's HUD system and combat mechanics with additional in-game features such as building up your very own troupe of Assassins and sending them on missions to gain levels and become more powerful. One of my favourite features was having the Assassin's at my beck and call to terminate any tricky targets or just to troll the guards for a bit of fun. Great continuation of the story so far with even more intrigue thrown in and questions raised. Definitely a worthy addition to your AC collection, or just a fun game all around. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												Well, actually my favourite Assassin creed game is the second title but i have it in another website. Brotherhood tries to follow the same way of the second, with secondary missions less tedious (as tedious as the first title). I think the goal is having the player in game the more possible hours. The story is nice like the others and you can do a lot of things, fight, jump, climb, etc.I saw in this game missions like Tomb Rider saga. To me its impossible not to recomend at least 1 game of Assassin's creed series.			",70,24,0,4,1,0,5

												GG! :D Continues the story of Ezio Auditore in his quest against the Templar scum. The Assassin's liberate the city from the hands of the church. Many cool additions since AC2 such as having assassin's do your bidding, new weapons like a crossbow, better ways of getting around Rome via fast travel, etc. improves upon every aspect of AC2. Now I can't wait to get AC:R then AC3 but when they are on sale like this one was. :)			",160,20,5,16,7,2,21

I mean you're the boss in the ring, no enemy matchs you. and now, you can sit on your horse, call your recruits on your enemies and look bored like a boss-- to many boring side missions-- the main missions are also boring--- the whole singleplayer game feels like an add-on for the multiplayer mode--- I could'nt follow the story anymore, I don't understand the ending and I don't really care---- the glyph riddles are very boring			",99,32,0,11,4,1,4

												Single-Player: More of the same from AC2, but nonetheless very enjoyable. Side missions have more variety, and the combat styles are more complex than ever. The sandbox (Rome) itself feels somewhat smaller from the previous games.Multi-Player: Very unique concept, completely deviated from other multiplayer games. However it's also a real pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to your connection settings; for me, I have to sit for literally hours just to find a session and play for about  2-3 rounds.

Ubisoft has yet to release a patch to fix this, and their support isn't helping at all.			",38,2,0,1,1,1,1

												Overall still recommendable though the game is not without its minor and major flaws.The PC controls are inexplicably worse from part 2. A real mystery because they improved mucho between AC1 and AC2 and then in Brotherhood it's worse again (like the req to hit 'enter' instead of 'space' on many confirmation dialogues or how 'TAB' opens the map but does not close it again... WTF). The story did not grab me as much as part 2. Leo Da Vinci added a nice touch in AC2 that was sorely missing in Brotherhood. Many story and optional missions were quite grindy and drawn out. I'm not a fan of the lengthy escorts or tailing missions of which there seemed to be too many. There was also too much trial & error, in part due to the absence of mission critical info,  which led to IMHO unnecessary repetition due to the console checkpoint save system.I liked the 15th/16th century depiction of Rome though. The atmosphere and ambience was great. The story, while not stellar, was still motivating enough to make me keep playing and finishing the game. So overall it gets a thumbs up but I'd warn anyone to be prepared to lose some hair over the game's annoyances that are mostly owed to the game's console heritage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! Felt short compared to Assassin's Creed 2, but still great. Only issue I've had is that the video tends to lag in the cutscenes so you'll hear things happen before seeing them, but the gameplay is lag free.Running on:Macbook Pro 15inch Mid-2010OS X 10.8.52.66 GHz Intel Core i78GB RAM 1067 MHz DDR3NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MBTip:If you're a Mac user and download AC Brotherhood, you may find that it doesn't work when you first launch it. All you need to do is the following:1. Go to /Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/2. Go into the AC2 folder (assuming you have already bought AC2) and copy the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Ubisoft folder.3. Go into the AC Brotherhood folder and replaced the Ubisoft Game Launcher in there with the version from the AC2 folder.I did this and it works fine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic 3rd game in the series filled with rich 15th century history (loved the twised and sordid history of the Borgias), great characters (more Ezio is a good thing), combat and gameplay. One of the best storylines in a game series to date. The downsides are that the Assassin's Brotherhood gameplay addition is more of a gimmick than anything else which is a damn shame as it could have been awesome to train up your fellow assassins by being able to engage with them more directly instead of just sending them on pre-scripted text based missions. Also, being able to call them to help you in a fight is cool and all but can be used to easily cheese your way through the tougher encounters in the game.8.5-9/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												Fun to play but extremely bad bugs exists, tip is to turn graphics to 'console specs' i.e. do not have above 60Hz on the graphics and so on. Otherwise you'll have huge troubles with one of the 'L' missions (to avoid spoilers).They've skimped on quality assesement and it's noticeable through the whole game.... suspect some frustrating times parkouring. Big two minuses are the bugs and the story, and the story part is probably just not my cup of tea.Otherwise a really good game!			",232,39,1,31,50,2,77

A continuation from ACII.Elements from ACII are carried to this game and the story continues with a little more of everything. This time around, the player feels more included in the Assassin band because you could send in a team at your command. The story is as interesting as ACII if not a little less, because the game tries to answer everyone's questions, both the audience and Ezio's. There are a few more gadgets and a brotherhood, otherwise that is it. The gameplay is basically the same as in ACII. By the end of ACII, Ezio got a bit comfortable, but right from the beginning of this game, it is clear that there are other powers out there that are constantly uprising. As usual, the game design is beautiful. The city of Italy has a lot to take in with many areas to explore. The missions are roughly the same as in ACII, but there are a few new ones that were refreshing. This iteration of the series was not as amazing as ACII, but was still a fun game to experience.The StrengthsThe developers played it a bit safe by just using the same formula from the previous game. I enjoyed the sense of 'Brotherhood' when interaction with the assassin family in the game. I thought that the addition of the crossbow was awesome, and on top of that the arrow storm proved to be very useful in many situations that I encountered.The LimitationsAlthough there was a good amount of features added to the game, I did not get the same sense of awe throughout the game.

												Assassin's Creed Brotherhood adalah lanjutan kisah Desmond yang kembali meneruskan ingatan Ezio Auditore yang pindah ke Roma untuk membebaskan Roma dari kekuasaan keluarga Borgia.Cerita (8/10)Lanjutan AC II tentang Ezio yang membebaskan kota Roma dari kekuasaan kekuasaan Borgia, setelah sebelumnya pada AC II, Rodrigo Borgia kabur dari Ezio di Vatikan. Terkesan seperti memperpanjang AC II, AC Brotherhood bertujuan untuk mendapatkan lokasi Piece of Eden. Twist paling menarik ada pada endingnya yang membuat kisah Desmond makin penasaran.Gameplay (9/10)AC Brotherhood memberikan beberapa fitur baru setelah AC II. Salah satu yang paling menarik adalah adanya Assassin Recruit. Dengan fitur ini, Ezio tidak perlu menyerang semua pasukan sendirian. Cukup dekati pasukan sebelum menyadari keberadaannya, Ezio cukup beri aba2 dan semua pasukan mati ditikam / dipanah. Tidak perlu bertarung &  dikeroyok sendirian seperti sebelumnya.Grafis (8/10)Perbaikan grafis paling terlihat dari desain karakter & tekstur yang lebih detil dan proporsional dari AC II yang masih terkesan kasar & membuat Desmond terlihat gemuk.

												While the changes are not as drastic as the ones from the first Assassin's Creed to the second,Brotherhood goes a nice way to improve upon the already extremely solid formula cemented by its predecessor.Combat is made quicker and flashier through the ability to use both meele and long-range weapons together and the introduction of a chain-kill mechanic. The Assassin recruits create a simple, yet surprisingly engaging past time that pays off big in the long run and for those who enjoyed renovating Ezio's villa in the last game, there is now the entirity of Rome to do as you please with. Even with all this, there is no doubt that this does feel like ""Assassin's Creed 2: 2"", but when the changes that are there build so well upon the last game all the same, one can't really complain.

												I can say without hesitation that Brotherhood is easily the best installment out of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise. Ubisoft Montreal took the massive breakthrough that was AC2's gameplay and refined it, expanded it, and built on top of it - giving the player an experience with an immense amount of depth and ceaseless enjoyment. While some might say that this game was more ""expansion"" than a true release the continuation of Ezio Auditore's storyline did wonders for the character, the historical time period, and the AC universe in general.Brotherhood was also the first title in the series to feature an online multiplayer that not only amazed us with its addictiveness but also really challenged us - rewarding players for being patient and clever instead of relentless and clumsy.

												Another great entry in the Assassin's Creed Franchise. The story was cool, the scenery was great, and the setting was awesome(its Rome). This game brought one of the biggest changes to the Assassin's Creed games, htis change is the Multiplayer. Which has a really cool concept. The only bad thing about the multiplayer is that people rarely play it (ive only tried to play online once, so it may have been just that one time.) I would highly reccommend this game, it is on par with the first game. And far better than Revelations(which isnt a bad game, its just really short... like i beat it in 8 hours including sidequests, and someone i know beat it in 4 hours while just doing the story.) 9/10			",341,57,2,39,24,3,53

												It is a very good game. The addition of assassin followers is the newest and most exciting feature which sets AC: Brotherhood apart from the earlier AC games (and makes it a definite improvement). The only real problem I had with the game was the very ending. It offers no sense of closure and instead of doing something good, you kill a close friend and ally with no explanation. Even aside from the ending, the game still isn't quite perfect, but it is easily worth its current $40.00 price tag. I'd give it a reluctant 9 out of 10.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

												I originally skipped this AC game since I felt it didn't wrap the Ezio storyline when it was released, and I only got it since it was on special.Given that I payed little for it, I felt that I got my money's worth. This game doesn't add much to the AC story, but Ezio is one of the coolest assassins in the franchise and it was a blast to play through another adventure as him.The gameplay of AC2 before it were polished to a tee in this game, and the new features allowing you to hire assassins, level them up, and call them in for assists was pretty cool. Taking over the new city 'Rome', purchasing buildings, and restoring it to its former glory was cool as well.Assassin's Creed - Brotherhood is pretty fun if you're a fan of the franchise, you can find it for cheap, and you have some time to burn.

												Brotherhood starts off immediately where the previous game left off. When I say this, I really mean you start in the exact spot, wearing the same gear you were at the end of the previous game. The story picks up right away and continues to entice.This game, while different in various ways, keeps the same essence of the last game. You explore Roma during the Borgia reign of the early 16th century. This allows for, like all the games, some splendid views and the ability to truly appreiciate the thought and effort put into the design of the city and surrounding areas plus the attention to detail that I have come to enjoy and appreiciate. There is a lot to do in this game. The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale. The added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage. It made the replay value, for even the first time through, appealing and challenging. Overall, if you like the series and played the games up until this point, continue to do so. You won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game feels like the best of the series. Uplay, and by association, the developer for designing and implementing it, is a complete, complete (did I say complete) piece of crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy it if it's cheap, don't buy it if it's not. The only really great game in this series is the second one IMO.			",216,36,1,17,5,3,12

												I played ACB immediately after AC2, and the game was way above what I had expected. Nearly all good parts of AC2 were kept and some flows were improved too(especially the combot execution system). The Assassin recruit system is very awesome, I litearally yelled when I used a recruit to easily assassinate my mission target. The recruits provide a lot of help during combat and I sometimes think that  they are better assasins than me. However, the game seriously lacks custimization for the recruits, which is very disappointing. All recruits look pretty much the same once they reach max level. This is very different from the trailer where Ezio have different looking recruits holding different weapons on his side. The main storyline is pretty short compared to that of AC2. In order to compensate this, ACB has a ridicuously large amount of side missions for players to experience, although some are not that fun to play. Assasinating in ACB is easier compared to AC2 as players can easily use the crossbow and hidden balde poison to kill targets from distance without being detected. Although you can see I am criticizing the game from different angles, I have to say, ACB is definitly a good game that every AC fan should consider buying, as it has too much good parts that I can't explain simply in this review.
