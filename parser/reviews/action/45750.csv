DO NOT buy this game if you are running Windows 10 or 8.1!UPDATED: There is a possible fix to get around this!This is meant to be a possible fix for existing owners. I heavily advise people not to buy this game in its current state.Lost Planet 2 was a guilty pleasure of mine on consoles, holding over 100+ hours of my personal time. I would easily give this game a thumbs up. However, as you can see, this is not the case sadly... In short, Lost Planet 2 is a wonderful game plagued by terrible DRM. This issue affects many but not all of Windows 10 users. If you have Windows 10, do not waste your money until these technical issues are fixed. Also, be weary if you have Windows 8.1, since this issue plagues some users that have this OS as well.As of the time of this review, under normal circumstances, it is impossible to play this game for many due to Games For Windows Live (GFWL) on Windows 10 and 8.1. GFWL has immense compatibility issues on Windows 10 currently. Starting the game up in Direct x9 or x11 results in an instant crash. Starting up the game in compatibility mode does not work. Installing the GFWL client is also a dead end. The programs freezes up when attempting to log in. It is also worth mentioning that several other GFWL titles have similar issues.Unfortunately, these issues have completely rendered the game unplayable. I do hope that GFWL is removed from this game, or at the very least some fix is made available. I will be contacting Microsoft support regarding this. I suggest that others do so as well, for the sake of this game and others. Until this issue is resolved, I highly recommend looking elsewhere.A possible fix for both Windows 8.1 and 10!After doing some research and spending some time messing around with various theories, I have been able to find a possib;e temporary fix!Despite this fix, I strongly advise people not to buy this game in its current state. Please due note that this fix may not work for everyone, so caution is still heavily advised for people who plan to buy this. If you do buy this title, I advise not going over the 2 week/1 hours of gameplay limit for returning games! This is so that you can return the game if it still fails to properly play. Also, this issue affects many but not all Windows 10 users, as well as Windows 8.1 users.For Windows 10 usersFor Windows 8.1 users, skip below these steps to ""For WIndows 8.1 users"" for a possibly simpler, faster fix.1. Go to Programs and Features and see if you have ""Microsoft Games For Windows Marketplace"" and/or ""Microsoft Games For Windows - LIVE Redistributable"" installed.2. If you do, uninstall them and restart your computer. If you don't have them installed, simply proceed to the next step.3. Go to the official Microsoft website and download (but DO NOT install) the latest version of Games For Windows Live. The download link is found here: http://www.xbox.com/en-IE/Live/PC/DownloadClient4. Right click on the GFWL install file and go to Properties. From there, turn compatibility mode on to Windows 7, and check off so that it will always run on administration mode.5. Activate the GFWL install file and complete the installation. However, do not boot up GFWL after it is installed.6. Boot up Lost Planet 2. Picking Directx 9 or 11 does not matter. At this point, instead of the game crashing instantly, it should actually start to boot up now, bringing you to the main menu.7. After setting your resolution, press ""Start Game"" to prompt a login to your Microsoft account. Enter your information and sign in. It will take several minutes of loading before anything happens. You should see a spinning circle as it loads.8. After it loads, enter your unique key for Lost Planet 2.9. From here, it will state that GFWL needs to update. Confirm the update and close the game a few seconds later. Make sure to confirm any installs that pop up. You may need to do this 2-3 times or so before everything is properly installed.10. Once everything is successfully installed, you should be able to finally log in and be prompted to create a new save file.For WIndows 8.1 UsersFor Windows 8.1 users, complete step 1 and 2. Then skip the rest and complete the following: See if you can install GFWL normally (without backwards compatibility mode). Attempt to boot up GFWL (the program itself) and sign in directly there. Whether you are able to sign in or not, try booting up Lost Planet 2. If the game will still not play, then go back to step one (make sure to uninstall GFWL) and instead attempt the Windows 10 method.Final ThoughtsI cannot recommend this game enough on console. However, for PC, I honestly cannot recommend this title in its current state. My rating for the game will not change for now, since it is ridiculous that all of this strain and effort must be put out simply to get this game working. I hope that this is able to help some people out there that are having issues with this game as well.Also, as a side note, you can skip signing in once you have GFWL installed by simply clicking on the red ""X"" in the corner of the GFWL login overlay. However, if you do, you will be unable to save your game or access online play.			",1217,324,30,128,104,13,129

												I remember back in 2007 when a game called Lost Planet came out for the Xbox 360. I was immediately impressed by the Vital Suits (big robots you jump into and steer) and the Akrids (giant bugs) you fight using your VS. Unfortunately however, the original Lost Planet was a rather dull game despite these things. So when I heard it was getting a sequel, I didn't really pay it any attention for the longest time. What a mistake that was.Lost Planet 2 takes the strengths of the original game and develops them even further. It gets rid of weaknesses like actually taking itself seriously and the uninspired levels. I'll get this out of the way already now though, Lost Planet 2 is not a game meant to be played in singleplayer. It of course can be, but it would be the equivalent of playing a Borderlands game solo. Where the game truly shines is in the co-op campaign, which is possibly one of the best experiences I've ever had in a video game.The game is a third person shooter, a very Japanese one at that, with some rather heavy weight to it's control scheme. The controls are very tight, even though the default control scheme on PC is, to put it lightly, very lacking. In the campaign, you and up to three of your friends are given the very simple task of shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of all the Akrids that have come to mess up your planet. Simple as that. At your disposal you have a wide variety of weapons, various Vital Suits and a grappling hook. The Vital Suits of Lost Planet 2 have been, to put it simply, taken to the next level. Some suits require several players to properly operate, some can transform, there's one for every need basically. As you play through the game you'll be able to unlock ridiculous amounts of weapons, titles, emotes and costumes, as well.The game has very good replayability with several levels featuring secret routes and the silly things the game encourages and rewards you for doing, like entering the stomach of one of the bosses among other things. It features four different difficulty settings, ranging from easy to extreme, so you won't have to worry about difficulty being too easy or too hard. There's a full training mode which works fairly well too, if needed. If you and your friends die too many times and start arguing, there's a PVP multiplayer as well with plenty of game modes to mess around in.But to get back more to the meat of the matter, as I mentioned earlier what really sets the game apart is the cooperative campaign. You won't get an experience like this anywhere else. In a time when cooperative campaigns have been more and more getting discarded, it's a wonderful thing to see a game like this. Just how many other games let you have several players controlling the same robot together and using it to mow down giant alien bugs? I know I can't think of anything at least. I really can't possibly emphasize enough just how much simple stupid fun this game is. I know I've tried with this review, but the only way to truly convey what a joy this game is, is by getting people to play it.			",463,91,11,79,46,4,56

												The only thing negative that I can say about this game (other than, you know, using GFWL on Steam, for great redundancy, and not even offer cross-platform multiplayer) is that I didn't get to play it in 2010, the launch date. Because DAMN did I lost the fun!A third-person shooter with Keiji Inafune's seal. This should speak volumes, I mean, what kind of game you'd expect from the father of Megaman? Unfortunately, that didn't panned out for the antecessor, the first Lost Planet. But LP2 redeemed it big time, at least in my opinion.The problem with LP1? Bad narrative, choppy storytelling. In a game built mostly around the singleplayer, that's a serious issue. Graphics were good though, and the playability was solid. Still didn't helped, however, to add this title to my list of games to finish-and-forget .But here's the funny part: those two complaints weren't solved in LP2. Instead, the series retooled its flaws into a workable and actually enjoyable storyline. And how do you do that with choppy sequences, lack of details and a great potential of development not being throughly harvested? Multiple protagonists, and multiple storylines seemingly disconnected one from another, until a certain part, that's how. And it worked marvelously.But even so I doubt you'd think of this as the greatest point of this game. You'll feel like you're playing the surrogate child of Battlefied - career levels, loadouts, and five profiles denoting each PC - with Borderlands  - alien planet where everything in it is big, mean, carnivorous, tough-hided and spiky, with a corrupt megacorp trying its best to hog the motherload and trample everyone in the way... Heck there's even a group of stupid wasteland bandits with scrapyard-level gear! XDJust play it. It's a great co-op TPS, even if dated and with Lost Planet 3 around for almost a year. The fact that there's online players rolling since four years and counting should hint you about its quality.			",114,14,1,23,4,0,7

												I've beaten this game on the X360, the PS3, and on the PC. I've gotten everything from the in-game slot machine. And it is glorious. This game is a solid arcade-style shooter like Binary Domain or Vanquish and gives you a veritable arsenal of weapons to fight off a large variety of enemies. The dialogue is somewhat cheesy, but it fits the tone of the game since it doesn't try to be a ""war is hell"" shooter ot take itself too seriously. C'mon, you can even set a variety of emotes like waving, dancing, or even crotch thrusts! Most everything the enemies do or characters in the cutscenes can do, you can do. Want to grapple on to a giant arthropod and shoot its glowing spot for massive damage? You can do that.Want to use a VS [basically mechs] that you saw a boss use? You can use it at some point in the story.Want to shoot a giant spider in the face with a laser? You can do that too.Want to fuse two VSes together to make a super-VS to kill everyone around you? You can do that.Want to use VS weapons while on foot to blow someone across the room? You guessed it, you can do that!The game gives you a set of default weapons, and you unlock more through an in-game slot machine using in-game currency. If you don't want to do that, then you can unlock a number of weapons, character parts, and items through levelling up your character in Campaign. You have a variety of game mechanics at your disposal to fight your enemies. You've got a grappling anchor you can use to latch on to enemies and you aren't only able to use it in a single stage, but rather it's available throughout the game in every stage. You can shoot grenades to blow them up in a larger explosion, or just use another type of grenade like the Gum [sticky] grenade to fight your foes off. Most of your foes are large insects and invertebrates called Akrid. They also happen to have giant glowing points along their bodies, such as their limbs and abdomens. The first large Akrid you meet in the campaign has weak spots on its arms that you can use to blow them off. The Akrid will regenerate their limbs over time, but I reccomend just blowing them off again! On other occasions, you get to shoot people in the face.The human enemies have access to most of the same primary weapons as you do, like the Energy Gun and the variants of the machine gun. They'll also occasionally use VS weapons, in which case they will probably become one of your primary targets.While you can't pick up a dead enemy's weapon, there are a variety of weapons scattered throughout the level. All of these weapons match what you've selected in your character customisation, which helps when you want a particular style of weapon. If you happen to play the co-op, then the items appear as whatever items the host has set in customisation. The game keeps up a constant flow of action by continuously throwing pre-placed enemies that will run around the area in a futile attempt to survive. While their durability varies based upon which of the three pre-unlocked difficulty settings, so do the weapon and armor placements. For example, I played the first few stages on Normal and found the usual VSes and weapons, but playing it on Easy scattered a number of suits of power armor that you could use around the early levels. All of this helps to show the level of work put into making this game enjoyable, and in my opinion, they succeeded at making a good, engaging game. I'd wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone looking for a good shooter that you can jump in and out of if you're busy or play in co-op with someone else.			",202,56,0,49,14,0,14

												One of the most underappreciated games of all time. And one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life. Don't look at steam playing hours, I bought it here because I lost my old GFWL-based key.Gameplay-wise it's a pinnacle of japanese TPS, e.g. alien planet, twisted story, global conflict, evil (or, of course, not so evil) megacorporation, tons of weapons, mecha war machines (not just to look at, to ride!), adrenaline-packed boss fights with enormous bosses, 4 player co-op for all this meat(!!!).Music-wise... I have no words. Ah, wait no. I have some. Gorgeous. One of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to, performed by full-blown symphonic orchestra.How comes it's so underestimated then, you ask me? Blame GFWL (Games for Windows Live), the platform always was a puddle of mud and it still ruins some nerve cells (because it's still in the game so you should technically activate your game twice using notorious Miscrosoft user-friendliness, good luck with that). Also blame ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Capcom PR campaign for PCs at the time.Ah, but anyway, I am so jealous about you guys who never played it and will do this for the first time. See ya on E.D.N.III!

												Okay, before you look at the pricetag and say ""Lost Planet 3 is cheaper!!!"". DON'T BUY IT... This game is better in many ways, let me point it out:Chapter Select screen: + (Not in LP3)Big variety of enemies and entertaining/Epic monsters: + (Not in LP3, you only fight ""Akrid""(Aliens) and NEVEC soldiers in this game (SPOILER, SORRY))Big variety of weapons and Vital Suits (Robot suits): + (Not in LP3, Why do I ONLY HAVE 8 DIFFERENT WEAPONS?!)Teamwork and Co-op campaign: + (Not in LP3, LP3 is based on a singleplayer campaign.)Laser/Plasma weapons and Rocket Launchers: + (Not in LP3, Why the hell not?!)Character Customization, and the ability to use them in multiplayer and co-op/singleplayer: + (Not in LP3)Free traversal of Environment with Grapplehook: + (Not in LP3, How do you restrict A GRAPPLEHOOK?!)A great point system that counts your deaths, points and kills. Then gives a Devil May Cry styled Letter score from S to D. (S, A, B, C, D, from best to worst)(Also, not in LP3. All these great features are stripped from the 3rd game, which gives a too linear experience.)Apart from that, the gameplay is an Instant classic, it's not too advanced, and easy to learn. The graphics are great on max settings, not the worst I've seen even though they're a little dated. The teamwork works splendid, there is in-game voicechat but is mostly used in Multiplayer battles, not so much in co-op. The weapons range from the single Handgun to a VS Artillery Barrage, yes, you can take it off the VS and carry it around...! All in all, this is one of my Favorite 3rd person shooters of all time. Sad it went the way of Max Payne with the first 2 games being good, and the 3rd being a so-so. But atleast we still have the 2 first games. This was kind of 2 reviews in one, but I hope it changed your mind on LP2 and LP3.-EDIT: I Completed Lost Planet 3 and the story improves a lot down the line, but the gameplay does not. The story is just as Epic as in Lost Planet 1, so if you still consider getting the 3rd game, do it for the story and you will not be disappointed. Only by the gameplay limitations.

												One of the best Co-op Games I've played. The art design is superb and engaging,the visuals are impressive even 3 years later, and the game runs beatifully on pc.  Story isn't deep but if you're in the cheesy b-movie it's incredibly entertaining. Voice acting is good again in that B-movie feel.  The sound effects are top notch, especially those gun sound effects. The Music is well fantastic gives the game a very epic feel to it. The gameplay is just as good, actually forget that it's better. Shooting feels rewarding with lots of varying  guns from hand cannons,revolvers, to a gunsword (yes that exists in the game). Vital Suits add another layer of variety and are a blast to use especially the PTX. Lots of levels with mutliple objectives in them that Give the game Variety. And then there is the awesomeness that is the co-op playing with 3 other players hell even with one other it's still really fun. there is also competative multiplayer, but no where near as good as co-op. I have 2 issues with this gamone of which is just for the pc version of this. First off games for windows live and because the pc version uses it, no one plays it, so you're better off getting the other versions or just buy an extra copy for friends. 2nd one is that, you can't drop in a game, You have to wait until the party is done completing a level, I have no idea who though this was a legitamet good idea.  Aside from those minor problems This is a Fantastic Third person co-op Shooter Well worth the 20$.9/10			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												the good:1. Awesome co-op campaign2. Good graphic and sound, good optimization, support DX11, looks good plays smoothly3. Lots, Lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from4. Some of the best singleplayer/coop Mech action on PC, you can even transform and combine with mechs your friend is piloting, awesome!5. Awesome boss fight, and you fight a lot of them, it is kinda like Monster Hunter with guns and Mechs6. Good character customization options, and they shows up in the cutscene, it makes the cutscenes even more enjoyable if you have 4 dudes in funny dress (or vixen in skimpy bikini)7. Overall good production value, lots of entertainmentthe bad:1. GFWL (not much a big deal for me)2. This game has a small but dedicated community. You can usually find a player match during weekend, good luck trying to do pvp during weekdays. 3. There is no spectator mode in Co-op, and you can do nothing in the waiting room. Well, at least on PC you can leave the game in the background and browse the internet or do something else.4. Players from all over the world, and many them do not speak English, some of them rather play solo or with their own friends.5. Like most of the Capcom, story in this one does not make much sense, the actions in cutscene are great though. 6. I have never seen it on sale, the best you can do is grab it when its 50% off during big sales like summer sales.7. You have to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off in order to 100% this game.Overall, this game is a total blast to play if you have a few friends to play with you (or make a few friends in game)			",349,25,15,50,17,2,73

												+ Very well optimized game, very pretty+ Controls are slightly different than other third person shooters, but fits the arcade-styled nature of it all+ Highly replayable with a friend because of how good the gameplay feels+ Very ""epic"" sized bosses scattered throughout the episodes- GFWL (although in-game it is not a nuisance at all)- Apparently may or may not work at all for people on Windows 8 and up- Has literally never been on sale once because for some reason Capcom treats LP2 like it never existed.- You cannot join games in progress. You need to sit and wait in the lobby for the players in-game to finish their mission.- (FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER USED GFWL BEFORE OR HAVE IT UNINSTALLED) A very annoying, complex multi-step process is something you need to go through to even have this game launch.It's a very fun co-op game that I would instantly recommend if it ever went on sale, but it never has.If you have trouble launching the game, it's due to GFWL. Please uninstall GFWL entirely from your system. Uninstall the Games for Windows/Marketplace as well. Then reinstall it.			",165,14,2,18,6,1,8

												Solid PC Port. One of my favorite coop campaign third person shoooters.MT Framework at some of its best in DX11.Best enjoyed with friends. Coop is a blast and is the soul of the game.Has GFWL, has caused problems for others, but this never affected me.If you do encounter a problem with GFWL needing to update to connect continuously, you need to directly download the Games for Windos client and install.Having unwilling GFWL on a coop partner's game is one of my only gripes about this.

												This is a fun shooter that I really want to reccomendUnfortunately, it relies on GFWL, so co-op is impossible, and even playing solo is difficult to do since you can't seem to keep your saves after each play session.Capcom, PLEASE port this game to SteamworksEdit: I actually returned this game shortly after righting this review, and I'm getting the impression that things have changed since I've last-played.

												So here is the deal with Lost planet 2...I actully like this game.  I still have it on the Ps3, so i got it here so me and my friends could play.  Someting no1 tells you is that you need Games For Windows Live.  You know the nonsense that won't even be supported in 4 months by MS? So then what? Why sell a game that we may not be able to log into in a few months? Not cool Steam.  There really needs to be a patch for this puppy very soon.Other than that....game is AWESOME ( if you like the type of game it is ).  Big bosses, meh musical score, cool enviorments, meh story ( again...know why you are here ). If you like blowing things up with mechs, giant weapons and four friends, then here you go.  If you are looking for dep player development in a four player co-op game...then look elsewhere...and let me know what you find cause i would like to play it ( BL1 and 2 don't count lol ).P.I.T			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Planet 2 was a ridiculously cool game. It was over-the-top, filled to the brim with action and the amount of guns, emotes and vehicles you get to play with is just incredible. The story is not too great, for it is not the main focus of the game.It has everything. Co-op campaign. PvP. You can play solo if you'd like. There is also public matchmaking if you don't have anyone to play with. However, the game's population has dwindled since long ago. Capcom seem to be hesitant to put a sale on the game. Sales usually help promote a game's population.I whole-heartedly recommend this game. But I also recommend that you play with a friend. Or two. Or three.			",166,11,7,34,8,2,26

												Take the giant creatures from Monster Hunter, the shooting and punchyness of Gears of War (plus some of the bro love), install some giant mechs from Mech Warrior, add the manic, over the top ridiculousness of Takeshi's, strike a pose and then you got yourself Lost Planet 2.The real magic of this game is the multiplayer, but alas that was tied to Games fo Windows Live (GWFL). This was a bit of a mistake, GWFL was a horrendous beast. Still.. once you got past that ugly beast of a DRM gate there where greener pastures. Not one for PVP my view is mostly of single-player and co-op. With the depth and breadth for weapons to choose from, the class and unlocks, missions rankings and awesome boss fights with different approaches, the game has a great deal of replayablility, I personally already played it on console many times over and bought another copy on PC hoping to play with others.As a side note most negative reviews for this game appear to be about Games for Windows Live. While you can say that this is at the fault of the game developers and is reflective of the game itself I personally feel that that is unfair. GWFL is horrific and the game would be better without it, but once overcome the game is still just as enjoyable. As for the game itself it is well reviewed from what I can see (though I am clearly bias).There are fixes for problems related to GFWL, I suggest heading to the forums first and checking to see if there are fixes available for you and your system before purchasing, and if they don't work you can always get a refund!

												I think I saw a anime like this once...But on a serious note, the story and the voice acting arn't the ebst, there are some probelms with GFWL, but its actually a pretty decent port, and runs very smooth almost the whole time I've played it.  The audio is superb in every way (except above voice acting), and the visuals are much better than the consoles this game migrated from.  Gameplay is very different from standard shooters, and the multiplayer options are very large and interchangable.Definitely of the most under-rated games in recent memory.			",105,3,1,2,3,0,11

This game does still use GFWL.  Don't believe anyone that says the service has been shut down.  It still works and you CAN still play online.  There is a guide in the game's hub to help you get the game up and runningFantastic action shooter with a mix of on-foot and mech combat where you fight a mix of humans, mechs, and akrid.  A large variety of weapons to choose from.  The loadout system takes a new spin on the old pickup based gameplay that allows you to choose what specific weapon you want out of any given weapon types.  Co-op campaign is the main draw for a lot of people here.  Fight with three friends to take down massive bosses across a several environments, including space.  There is a lack of story but it more than makes up for it with fantastic gunplay and movement system.  There is also a huge amount of customization options, including emotes all without the fear of paying microtransactions like a lot of modern titles do.  PVP multiplayer is intense with games supporting up to 16 players.  Maps range from large to small.  Match hosts are given a decent degree of freedom to customize their games.			",105,2,1,5,3,0,2

												If you don't mind dealing with setting up Games For Windows Live, there is a very enjoyable game here.  To get it setup for Windows 10 you just need to download the latest GFWL from http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient, run it in compatability mode for Windows 7 and complete the installation, setup an account, start the game, download updates for GFWL a few times (requires closing the game), and then you should be good to go.I am a Lost Planet fan and have been having fun with the game so far.  Check out my review below or my other playthrough videos of the game if you want more info before deciding if it is for you.

												IMPORTANT: This game requires Games For Windows LIVE (GFWL).YOU CAN STILL PLAY THE GAME ONLINE. IT STILL WORKS ON WINDOWS 10 WITH SOME EFFORT. GUIDES ARE OUT THERE TO HELP, USE GOOGLE OR THE FORUMS.Note: I've played this on Xbox360, GFWL, and only recently bought it on Steam, please disregard the comparatively low hour count.SHORT REVIEW UP FRONT, PROS & CONS AT THE BOTTOM:Once you've gotten past the GFWL barrier, this game is among my favourite games of all time and I strongly recommend it as a coop game experience.If you like games like Monster Hunter, but also like Third Person Shooters, this game is for you! Alternatively, if you played and enjoyed Vanquish, you'll likely find a place for this game in your heart!I would not recommend this game to the kinds of people who get easily frustrated by losing - not to talk down on such people, but this game takes a lot of learning before you start getting good, despite its appearances. Many people complain that the first boss kicks their butt to the kerb several times like something out of Dark Souls, but by the time you get to the end of the game you'll find him a cakewalk.I strongly recommend playing this game with friends - there are different perspectives to some missions and most cutscenes per player!LONG REVIEW, PROS & CONS:Lost Planet 2 has earned a place in my list of top games of all time and is unlikely to shift from that position. Similar to say, Metal Gear, the game has a ostensibly serious premise with a layer of intense silliness under the surface and a whole lot of huge and fun boss battles.The game is not easy and many will find that the control take some getting used to - those who have played Monster Hunter or Vanquish will absolutely understand. However, they are more than adequate once you get adjusted to their nuances, unlike a lot of professional reviewers who started whining that they couldn't just push buttons and cancel out of animations at will rather than learning how the game works (sorry, pet peeve of mine).The story is a little lackluster and just ""kind of there"", but the game's primary selling point for me is just how absolutely over-the-top and fun the game is from start to finish - I'd even go so far as to compare it to a Platinum game (Bayonetta, Vanquish, Metal Gear Rising) in sheer awe factor!Gameplay wise and as I have mentioned, it takes some getting used to. On foot, it's somewhat basic for a TPS with the addition of a grappling hook (which always adds fun to any game). You can shoot, melee, jump and dodge-roll (for i-frames) and these actions may change depending on the weapon you have equipped.A big part of the game are the mecha (called Vital Suits or VS), which all come with mecha-sized weapons that you can also use on foot WITHOUT EXCEPTION. Every VS in the game has different controls and can perform different actions with manuals accessible at any time from the pause menu.Toward the start of the game you will encounter and use clunky, old mecha with poor controls, turn speed and armor. As you progress through the game you'll start using newer models of those old mecha, and the new features and mechanics are extremely noticeable!The game puts heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay, to the point that playing solo will make certain levels much harder on you. I STRONGLY recommend playing this with at least one friend - you'll not likely find anyone in public lobbies in this day and age.This game includes some of the best coop gameplay I've seen in my life, from such small features as being able to provide each other with energy (heals/ammo) or help out a stuck player to much, MUCH more important roles like piloting a multi-person VS or in some of the most important (and fun) sections, helping to control, load and fire an enormous vehicle that requires multiple ""drivers"" for boss battles!There are also a number of secrets that can only be achieved through coop actions which I will not spoil here. Suffice to say that there is a button combination that is barely mentioned anywhere that activates ""the fun stuff"" with certain equipment - you'll know it when you see it.PROS:+ The game is exceedingly fun once you get your bearings and is one of my top, most recommend games of all time.+ Includes solid mecha combat including mecha vs mecha, mecha vs ground troops, and mecha vs giant alien monsters.+ The game has a reasonably high skill ceiling, especially with regards to VS piloting and boss fights+ There's an in-game achievement system to work towards called ""Good Jobs"" - there are some global ones, and some specific ones per stage.+ The game is reasonably long and you may not be able to play through it in one sitting - especially not on your first run through.+ The game is full of over-the-top action from start to finish+ There is a heavy emphasis on coop gameplay and the game is best enjoyed with at least one friend. The game goes as far as to offer different perspectives per player slot in most missions!+ Supports high frame rates - though some models have animations that were obviously sampled at 30fps which is pretty amusing to see.NEUTRAL:= The game has QTEs - but they are largely inconsequential.= There's an equipment unlock mechanic with a reasonably large amount of content but it's tied to a slot machine. While it's nice to feel like you're always working toward unlocking new stuff, it can get irritating to pour all your hard earned cash into the machine and get nothing but basically useless player titles and maybe one weapon.= Some missions are a lot more frustrating without friends to help, but these are few and far between. However, in missions where coop assistance is almost necessary, the AI will endeavour to do their best to help rather than sitting around like lemons.= The graphics are pretty good for the time but are starting to look just a little bit dated now.CONS:- You have to use Games for Windows Live to play this game. Unlike LP1, this was never updated for Steamworks for some reason. It still works though, somehow.- The playerbase has long departed. You'll need to play this with your friends if you want the coop or versus experience.- The controls and animations are initially a bit stiff and take a lot of getting used to which will definitely put some people off - though much like Dark Souls, Monster Hunter or other high quality Japanese video games, once you ""git gud"" they're absolutely fine.- If you're playing with high latency to your coop partners, certain parts of the game will be extremely janky and hard to play through. Specifically an underwater section, and riding on certain VSs. ",492,65,7,45,34,4,56

												Lost Planet 2 has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. Recently I picked it up again, on PC this time though. I remember whn I first played it, I thought it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. Coming back to it now a few years later, I see some of its flaws, but does that mean that ths game is terrible? No, not in the slightest. But I will leave that choice to you, the reader.This is just giving personal experince from what I have seen in my time of getting it again: Flaws: At first glance the game seems quite solid. Good textures, good voice acting (Most of the time) but one thing the game at times struggles to hold up is combat. This is very bad considering this is a combat based game. Is the worst I have ever seen? Not at all, but it definetly needed to be checked again. At points in the game I would try to shoot at an NPC and instead of where I was aiming it would aim to the bottom left corner of where I was aiming nowhere near where they were. Also at points (I'm not sure if other people have seen this or not.) the weapons would be showing that they are firing due the clip number going down, but nothing actually was being fired. Another thing is with at least one of the bosses from my own experince has a broken atack from what I've seen. This boss is called Akrid X. The attack I am refering to s a charging attack you have to escape otherwise it will do massive to you. Most times though, with the map design trying to indicate to go into these little crevaces in the ground, you can't escape it. I may be wrong here and it instead has an incredibly large splash radius for the attack, i'm not sure. There are other things to talk about, but i'll wrap it up with the character models. The problem with them was that not all blended together. I don't mean by the different colors, but the fact that there are jagged textures of other pieces of armor sticking out if you decided to have different pieces of armor on. Another problem on that same thing was the face models. These are smalls details. but they are important details. To some they might not notice, but to others, it miht ruin they enitre sense of immersion. I felt at some times they characters were beingmade to move just to move. Their arms would move around very oddly, making it difficult to understand there emotions sometimes. They only way for them to be understood at some points was due to the voice actors. On the face models that weren't covered, it was quite terrible. It didn't matter about if their voice needed to fit the character in this case, but they should have at least be able to move there mouths. In my opinion, that's quite lazy. Those same models also needed a texture touch up as well due their faces looked slightly meshed.Positives:Though its shown this game has its flaws, it also has it positives. One such one is co-op. When you are able to get a whole group of your friends together for a big game, it can be one hell of a ball. This is definetly one of the game bi things is teamwork. Granted, you can play game by yourself, but most times its either much lengthier or much harder. If you like working as a team and have friends to play with or you just want to play with anyone really, this is a game for you. Though I complained about the characters, I was mostly referring to the different model problems and meshing of ""unfinished faces"" as I should say. Here though it's about the designs of the models themselves (without combining different ones). Their ow designs I thought were amazing. Some were slightly off from one another to give a sense of being in an army and showing that they come from the same group, while others were just in their own in creativity. The different personality of the different characters overall managed to keep on the positive side due to a few iconic characters. Many of the characters were good, but they felt like they were practically everywhere, making them seem bland in that sense. There were a select few though that made me love them. The Waysiders were a beautiful group to me as well as the Vagabundos and the NEVEC Clones, at times anyway. Each of them had their own flare that made them stick out as their unit saying, ""Hey! Here I am, as I am!"" Finally the best part of this game to me, is the music. In some of the tracks they are short nd loop, but regardless they are beautiful. It's due to the soundtrack that I even came back to the game for the most part. I must say Jamie Christopherson did a fantastic job here and I will even later on. Final Verdict (Reviewers Verdict):7.5/ 10Though I may have gone into detail about the different problems the Lost Planet 2 has it is still a very nice game. I it the best? No. Is it fun? Yes, indeed. If you know someone that owns it or if you want to buy it your self, it doesn't matter, you need to at least try it. This kind of game isn't for everyone, but you may be one of the people that does like it. So though you have it. Take it however you please, but remember, this is the review of someone else, not you. You are the ultimate decider, so make your choice. Hopefully I'll see some of you on the planet of E.D.N. III-Username (In-Game) : TheKimchiKing			",120,2,1,26,9,2,19

												It took quite awhile to get this game working due to the Games for Windows Live service required to run it, a service which is no longer running.To get it running, you will need to install the game, install the Games for Windows Live client (which can still be downloaded for free from the Microsoft Xbox website), then start the game.  After this, it will allow you to launch the game, but not to save it.  In order to save any games, you will also need to create a local profile for Games for Windows Live.  To do so, try to start a new game and it should prompt you to log in to Games for Windows Live.  Skip trying to sign in with an existing ID, and select the option to create a new profile.  Once you select this option, a new screen should come up.  Scroll all the way to the bottom and there is a small blue link to create a local profile.  Create the local profile and NOW you can start a new game.I hope this feedback helps someone (it took me awhile to figure out), and hopefully Steam will remove the GFWL requirement from this game at some point.  It was so much hassle to get a several year old game running that I can't give it a positive review.			",199,8,1,10,2,0,2

												This game is absolutely great as a coop multiplayer.  The movement is fluid, the weapons pack a punch and the replay value is very high.  Due to the coop focus of the game, the story can be difficult to follow and the map transitions/ playing as different factions don't initially make a lot of sense.Fighting akrid aliens is the absolute highlight of this game.  The bosses are gigantic and take a good beating.  The variety of boss akrid is great too, from a lumbering giant salamander to fast giant lizards.The only letdowns in this game are the somewhat minigame feel of a few of the levels, lack of space to really play around in the vehicles properly, and having a more open style map level or freeroam would have been welcome.The customization options are plentiful, for weapons, outfits and even emotes.  The destruction is abound in this game.Overall, this game is brilliant for jumping into a coop session with friends or randoms, with each mission lasting not more than 20mins usually.  It's great to pick up and play, shoot the heck out of everything, and then go unlock some more gear.  There is a multiplayer deathmatch mode that I was not interested in, but it seems quite good if you like vs mode.			",114,15,8,14,8,0,8

												Played Lost Planet 2 a ridiculous amount on 360 and now PC and for me one of the best  fun co-operative experiences ever. Even more fun if you have friends you can chat to and know some of the ins and outs of the game like the Support weapon attacks or the Combo VS.Story is little muddy as it jumps back and forth between the different factions and may take several runs to fully understand what on EDN III is going on. But it has the certificate of Capcom by being over the top and huge monsters that wanna eat ya!Gameplay is somewhat wonky and you may want to play with a controller or remap them if you use keyboard. But the main meat of this game is the co-op campaign which you try out various tactics or weapons you've unlocked to complete them. In addition you have the add on of using custom characters after you beat the campaign first time and all the craziness you and your friends can do. (For example, using the V-Device super nova attack in confined areas and wreck everything! >:D ) Then you've got hidden areas where you can get deadlier weapons or VSs slightly earlier than you should which add to the madness.On your own, 6/10 but with friends? 9/10 Small gripes but that's it :D ",81,3,0,10,4,0,5

												Played this game on the xbox:360 initially, so my hours are a little inaccurate. One of THE best games I have ever played. Big guns. Big bugs to kill using said big guns. MECH SUITS to carry 2x the amount of big guns! Custom characters! (you can easily see your character in cutscenes! [who would normally be indistinguishable from everyone else]) TAUNTS! ALL THE GOD DAMN TAUNTS!(the russian dance [aka: kotzky kick] is also included)Not foaming at the mouth yet?TANKS that can transform into spider tanks. THAT can also MERGE with a SPACE mech suit to make a SUPER MECH SUIT!!!Now get in there and kill all the bugs and pirates that you can lay your plasma weilding meat hooks on!Con: Requires Games for Windows Live to run [but really just install it, make sure it is running in the backround, then just play LP2] It's not that big of a deal unless you're lacking in terms of RAM/CPU/storage/or overall below recommended computer statsDid I mention you kill A LOT of giant bugs with giant mech suits weilding giant guns?(just buy it already)			",56,6,0,10,4,0,4

												I am changing the score on this one to thumbs up. The initial issues with this game have been resolved:SOLVED: Game does not start / crash on startGFWL: Remove the GFWL version the game installs (!) and then install this: http://www.xbox.com/en-IE/Live/PC/DownloadClient , which is an official Windows 10 capable GFWL client.Run the client and set the game folder to the same drive as the Steam folder in which you have installed LP2. For some reason some GFWL games seem to expect game to be on the same drive as the GFWL default game directory. The DX11 version does not seem to have this problem.SOLVED: D3DERR_DEVICELOST on NVIDIA Optimus/Mobile/passthroughI had this problem on four devices. The game would load a first time, but after the settings file had been written, D3DERR_DEVICELOST happened and the computer was frozen until after a full power cycle. This and a post settings file black screen, that had to be cured with windowed mode and alt+enter-during-load-screen tricks occurred in a lot of Capcom PC versions (LP2, Dragons Dogma, Resident Evil Zero), not only for me and all the computers in the house, but also to other people (a Google search brought many results). I initially ""accused"" Capcom of not getting their manure together, but I might have judged the issue a bit too harshly.This only seem to happen on certain NVIDIA configurations.On one device, the error simply stopped occurring after months of updates to Windows and the NVIDIA drivers. While I think the engine still is not robust enough, it looks like not Capcom, but the rest of the chain needed to get their crap together.On three of those devices, a hardware fault turned out to be the issue. One Optimus laptop had a faulty Geforce and two had defective RAM. I cannot be certain, whether the hardware change did the trick or if the months of driver patches solved it, because I didn't immediately test LP2 after the hardware swaps.Existing problemsFor some reason, forcing borderless fullscreen will set the game into normal fullscreen.PerformanceSince the issues above have been fixed, no weird workarounds are required anymore, so no unnecessary performance hits will get between you and a solid game. There are no unusual phenomena, like frame drops, stuttering or sound problems on a reasonably modern machine. The game works fine with Windows 10, if you take care of the GFWL issue.Original comment:The game is great, the port is really bad. I bought this cheap (five bucks), because I'm moving all my favorite games away from the PS3 in case it breaks.The following drastic problems exist in the PC version:- The GFWL installer does not run on Windows 10, you need to install a version from the MS website.- Speaking of GFWL: It uses GFWL, this alone qualifies as a ""drastic problem"". The ""Games for Windows Marketplace Client"", though, had me log in once and didn't show up again afterwards.- For some reason I do not understand, the DX9 version crashes on start. It might just be my Optimus setup. The DX11 version starts fine.- For some reason, the graphic settings are able to freeze the desktop, if you possess the audacity to switch from fullscreen to windowed mode and other little quirks. I had to put the computer in suspension to access the task manager after this.Although this is a great game, I cannot recommend the PC port. ",372,73,3,54,32,1,65

												I used to play this game competitively on the PS3 and stopped playing in 2012 with around 1000 hours of playtime. The single player is ok and fun, but the Multiplayer and Co-op is where this game really shines. If the servers were still active then I'd play this game everyday, although I'm told that there is a online gaming community that hosts its own servers every friday to keep the game alive. I I have just joined the community that I was referencing and the community is there every Friday.			",352,77,5,40,25,0,42

												One of my favorite co-op games. Tons of content, the campaign is long, there's plenty of customization for characters, weapons, abilities, emotes, etc., and the replayability is incredibly high. It's a fun game solo, but it's a much better experience with friends. If you have at least one other friend interested in playing through this with you then I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed.Huge enemies, even bigger bosses, plenty of different environments throughout the campaign (snow, desert, jungle, lava-ish, space, etc.) so that it never feels old, the grappling hook is fun to use and you'll learn new tricks with it (try picking up boxes and thermal energy with it!), and there's a large variety of enemies that you'll fight throughout the game, including mechs, Akrid (bug-like creatures), and humans, each with many different types. The Akrid alone have a couple dozen different forms that are unlike the one before it. I won't list them all, there's too many, but the Dune-style worm is one of my favorite boss fights from any game ever.There's a PvP multiplayer section to the game, though not many play it anymore. It's your basic deathmatch/capture the flag-style modes. Nothing crazy, but I appreciate that the game allows you to go into ""training matches"" which are basically just bot matches on a few maps. Something you don't see too often, sadly, which helps avoid a game's multiplayer become obsolete when the playerbase is gone.One thing I will mention that is somewhat of a downside, is that the game uses Games For Windows Live. Now, there's a lot of reviews for this here on Steam saying all multiplayer is broken because of it, but that's not true. My friend and I are both on Windows 10 and we got the game running perfectly fine in less than 30 minutes combined. All you need to do is install the GFWL client here, off the official Xbox site: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClientIf you install the one that Steam attempts to install when you first start the game, then you're gonna have a bad time. It's an old version of the client and it doesn't work!After you install the client from the link above it should work perfectly fine. That's all we had to do to get it running. Others have said in the forums that you may need to allow the game through your firewall, and/or restart your PC after installing the Client (my friend and I did neither of those and it still worked), but otherwise there's no loopholes to jump through. When you boot up the game you'll sign into your Xbox profile (if you don't have one you can just make one. It's free, and you don't need a Gold subscription to play online in any GFWL PC game) and you're in. There's plenty of others online at any given time doing the campaign, so obviously it's working fine for others.I should also mention that at first you may not see many lobbies, as it'll only show you ones that are playing levels you've also completed. It's to avoid letting some newbie join in on players beating the final level on Extreme difficulty or whatever. At first, you'll only see lobbies on Episode 1, Chapter 1. Keep that in mind!I did have a minor issue with mouse sensitivity at first, the game wasn't registering small movements. I was able to fix this by bumping up the mouse sensitivity setting one or two times and then it worked perfectly fine. Not really a big deal, and not everyone will have that issue, it depends on your mouse's DPI setting I believe.Those are the only downsides I can think of for this game. I've beaten the campaign once on Normal, I have 18+ hours in it, and I've not had any major issues with this PC port. I think a lot of people are installing the GWFL client that Steam attempts to install the first time you run the game, rather than the one in the link above, and then writing off the game when they can't get it to work. DO NOT INSTALL THE GFWL CLIENT THAT STEAM ATTEMPTS TO INSTALL. It's a very old version that's broken.Anyway, TL;DR: It's a fantastic co-op shooter with tons of variety and content. It's very replayable, and if you have at least one other friend to play this with then it's something you should definitely check out. You'll have a blast!			",695,129,22,58,38,2,37

												Although Games For Windows Live is a barrier that one has to cross to enjoy this game, after you have it installed and created an account the game is as good as it was when released, and holds up well in terms of graphical quality. Player population is low but if you can get a group of friends it is good, and there is usally at least one person playing the game. I particularly enjoy the Vital Suits that one can pilot, but without a vehicle the combat is designed well enough so that a player could take down another that is piloting a VS. I used to play this on the PS3, so the lack of splitscreen is a shame, but the game is compatible with xbox controllers and probably playstation ones if you feel a difference between the two. Overall a good and solid shooter, with consistent progression across the campaign and multiplayer modes. Which is good because the rare souls I do find playing multiplayer tend to absolutely destroy me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Planet 2 is a third-person shooter set on the planet EDN III, a planet that is just now recovering from a horrific ice age. Now a new threat emerges, threatening the planet once again. It’s up to you to save it. You will encounter huge big like creatures know as the Akrid and the bosses are even more colossal. They won’t be too much trouble once you get a hold of the enormous arsenal you posses. There is a plethora of weapons to use ranging from assault rifles and hand grenades to plasma cannons and portable black holes. If you feel overwhelmed hop into any one of the different types of VS mechs. These guys won’t let you down. Also, with 4 player co-op the insanity just expands. Now the multiplayer is where you can really have fun. With over 10 unique types of game modes you’ll find it hard to stop playing. With a campaign spanning over 8 hours, a co-op function and an amazing multiplayer, there is no reason why you shouldn’t get this game.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												Lost planet 2 is the best third person co-opt shooter you're going to find in my opinion. GFWL is not a problem at all , i first had an issue with it, but then i realised i need to manually run the instalation software of  it from it's folder before running lost planet 2. There are simple fixes for Win 10 too, just look at the forums. LP2 has lots of replayability because of the different weapons you unlock ingame and GJ awards to obtain. The community is still allive just head over to the Official LP group wich is dedicated to LP1 colonies , LP2 and 3.Unlike Left for dead or other similar 4 player co op games there are more possible co op atacks interactions and strategies to be used to take down huge akrid bosses, play a team deathmatch or just to make it throught certain parts of the game on extreme difficulty. I highly recommend this game.  For 20€ it is worth the money and then some, unlike other full price tripple A titles.			",184,29,1,11,17,2,10

So if you want to play it online (Which I recommend!), then get some friends to buy it with you.It has a very ""Arcade game"" kind of feel to it, going from level to level.It's very grindy if you want to unlock all the things, and considering PVP multiplayer is dead, you have to replay the campaign missions.It's very challenging though, when you play on the highest difficulty.

												An excellent 3PS game, with a lengthy campaign, and online play support. Lost Planet 2 is the second entry into the Lost Planet franchise. PROS: -lengthy campaign. For those of us casuals who like long single player campaigns, this game does not disappoint. The levels are intense and gripping, and actually fairly difficult. -sound effects are on-point. I love the sound of the machine gun firing. I could listen to it all day. The weapon sound effects are spot-on. the grappling sound is perfect. Just in general, this game has audio nailed down. -combat is intense. You will blaze through levels, shooting up anything that comes in your path. The boss fights take actual skill and strategy to work (most of the time), though there are the occasional few that you can just hammer with an RPG launcher until they die. Combat system works well, and doesn't need much improvement. AI isn't half bad. Could be better, but not embarrassing. *I don't have much knowledge about multiplayer, seeing as how I only recently got this, and need to completely set up my Windows Live account to play online. Sorry*CONS:-Windows Live. Unless you want to spend a bit of time finnagling Windows Live stuff, you will be unable to save progress in this game. I know that other reviews tell you how to set up a functioning Windows Live account, and I am in the process of doing so myself. If you do take the time to set one up, it's certainly worth it :)That's all I can think of for pros and cons. The game itself is surprisingly well-polished, and I enjoy the feel of combat a lot. Boss battles are engaging, but don't generally take more than 20-30 minutes at most (as far as I've played). Game doesn't look poor, or run badly, or anything like that. All in all, an excellent shooter game, that I would recommend to anyone. All you gotta do is take the time to set up a Windows Live account, and you're golden!(PLEASE NOTE: I PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER, SO MY OPIONION ON THE CONTROLS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. PLAYING ON KEYBOARD IS DIFFICULT, AS I DID THAT BEFORE TRYING OUT MY CONTROLLER. CONTROLLER RECOMMENDED TO PLAY)			",35,0,0,3,0,0,1

Being able to use and drive robots and/or vehiclesI used to play this game on PS3 and I almost beated it 100%, I was only missing some achievements and finishing leveling 100% all the characters.  The character is extremely customizable, and I recommed you to buy the game on PS3 or Xbox 360 since you can go online and redeem the codes for free apparel (not available on PC).  I used to play with random people online, it was fun.  Now I am playing it again with my fiance on PC and I must say it is lots of fun!  We get to make tactics on which is going to use the vehicles to go attack the enemies meanwhile the other activated this or that or just surprise attack.  The game is highly replayable, at least for me, I have never got tired of the story, OH! and yes you can co-op play with your squad on the story which is the best thing ever.  The game has a training option in case you want to warm up and practice your skills for Multiplayer.  It is useful before the real thing... believe me... those international players do not believe in oneself prayers XD THEY DON'T HAVE MERCY!  I have noticed there are more players on PS3 than on PC but it is still totally worth it to play it with friends!  Trust me on this!  If you really want something different than your typical co-op games, this is your title of must try!Any questions, feel free to contact me!			",73,10,0,5,1,0,1

												One of my favorite 3rd person shooters, and personally, the best entry into the Lost Planet series due to the immense scale of everything. The campaign is lengthy, the character customizer is extensive, and the multiplayer is barely there sadly. This is a game I would play with a group of friends and run through the campaign every once in a while for fun, because this is one of those games I just don't seem to get bored of and can keep on playing for a long time... and I have been since I've bought it on PC and even before that when I had it on PS3, where I put almost a hundred hours into it.This game would be better if they gave it a small update to remove the windows live, which can still be a bit annoying seeing as it still randomly disconnects me for a reason which I haven't figured out yet.To this day I await another Lost Planet game that goes back to the formula of this one. Hell... I'd be happy if even a new IP came out that did something as fun as this game. Except with more customization, more weapons, more mech suits, and more enemies, and some better controls and a better camera angle.It's never late to review a game, especially one such as this.

												I loved this game when I played it back in 2010 as a 16 year old, I love it now. Problem with buying this game is that it requires ""Games For Windows Live"". so basically you need to use your xbox live account, for me it was a huge hassle trying to get the damn game to work since I had no idea it needed GFWL, also need to make sure that you agree to another Terms of Use doc. GFWL will NOT tell you that it needs to be done, if you can't get your profile to work, that's why. This game doesn't really work with Steam and I guess thats the only problem I had with this game.  Other than that this game has huge boss monster fights, loads of guns and grenades, MECHAS, and character customization, what's not to love? Still waiting on an update including new title ""Swagmaster"" Capcom pls			",32,1,0,1,3,0,0

												My god... Games For Windows Live is actual garbage.So the story is I buyed LP2 and it could not even launch..off to a great start.I downloaded the GFWL thing, made a Gamertag and all that annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥.like I just want to play the game, geez.Then.. I was actually able to play the fckin game. I was so happy.To be honest I did not play the game very much and paused it only after playing like 4 hours.A few weeks later my operating system (Win 10) died and my PC needed to be repaired.My PC is now ok again.TODAY... I thought to play LP2 again, which means...DOING ALL THAT GFWL♥♥♥♥♥♥AGAIN.I started the game, logged in into GFWL, put in the product key and then it happened...""Your product key is invalid.""Yeah, of course. It's not like I used the same fckin account.I suppose it's because I made a new gametag (even though I already had one but Microsoft kept saying ""no u don't have one, make a new one prick."")So in conclusion..Lost Planet 2: Good game, I can recommend it.Games For Windows Live (which is dead since 2013): Actual fckin garbageDO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM.I am probably going to buy this game again on CD, in order to have a new product key. :/ ",129,11,4,0,4,2,2

												+Mix of on-foot and mech combat+Stuff in this game is big. The environments, the bosses, some of the guns, they are HUGE+Emotes to express your excitement, your saltiness, or perhaps just so you can be a kawaii+Co-op is a blast (when you can get it working)+The train level where you operate the giant laser is the best part of the game, in terms of cool-factor and how it enforces teamwork-Some of the guns don't have much weight to them-Co-op requires a bit of tinkering with Games For Windows Live, and inviting friends to your game is also done through the serviceOnce you're past the GFWL barrier, you'll have a good time shooting up nasties in this campy sci-fi co-op shoot fest.

												I am writing this 'review' because this game deserves more attention & a lot of my friends don't know about it.For those that don't know, Lost Planet is a series of games. There are 3 of them. The first and third game have single player and multiplayer, but no co-op. For some odd reason the 2nd game (THIS ONE) has co-op. Don't ask why they scrapped it in LP3, but yeah, that's Capcom for you.In LP2, you are put on a Planet with harsh conditions and you are able to get into these mech-suits from time to time & it's awesome.It plays a lot like any other 3rd person shooter, only there are mech-suit sections sometimes and you get a anchor/grappling hook (when you're not in the mech suit). So obvious comparisons are Just Cause 2 (grappling hook) and Red Faction: Guerilla (mech suits, setting, style of outfits, etc.).All I have to say is this game is under-rated and the co-op is hella fun. (can be up to 4-player co-op for each mission.) You run around, shooting things, you get rocket launchers (sometimes a rare mini-gun) and grapple around a little. Definitely worth picking up on sale for $5 like I did. :DPROS*grappling hook -you can even hang off of ceilings and walls while shooting*plenty of ammo, grenades, and other pickups throughout each level*Bosses are huge and feel EPIC usually*you do get 4 emotes you can doNEUTRALS*designed to be a co-op game. You have 3 teammates. AI or players they will be there, like it or notCONS*(has to) run(s) with GamesForWindowsLive, so sometimes you have to update the GFWL client*Can NOT take screenshots due to GFWL interferring with Steam. (There MAY be a work-around. I have to check into that more. *may update later*)*Anchor hook is kind of short-ranged, meaning you can't just attach to anything in sight*I don't think there is a text chat in the game, which is kind of odd considering you might need to communicate------P.S. So what's the deal- Why am I writing this review now?Well, to be honest I was looking at EDF 4.1 and I really want that, but it's at least $35 and only really fun with co-op. I'm lucky enough to play ANYTHING co-op, let alone a new game that none of my friends have yet.So I recommend getting ANOTHER fun co-op game *ahem* SUCH AS LOST PLANET 2 in the meantime, to uh, how can I say this...fill the ""co-op 3rd person shooter"" void in your life until EDF goes down in price. :)----------------------------Feb-02-2017 update: includes Pros, Cons, and Neutrals now; changed the whole review to accurately reflect how the levels, gear, pickups, etc. are set up.

And since that went down, All my character customizations are gone, haven't been able to start it. So if you decide to play it (And you should!)

												I played this game back on the PS3 multiple times over with a buddy of mine years ago and had a wonderful time playing each and every time.  The game just had a wondeful feel to it that I didn't find with any other game at the time.Large monsters: checkMultiplayer: checkCool aesthetic: checkLots of options: checkMechs: checkGot the game during the 2016 Summer Sale and has my opinion changed?  Not a bit!  I'm currently playing with 3 of my good friends and I've having even more fun than I did before.  Lost Planet 2 is still absolutely fantastic and just as much fun as I remember it being.  Of course, multiplayer is going to be the best part about the game (up to 4 people in a group) so if you have nobody to play it with then maybe this is a game you should pass on, but if you do have friends to play with then I would highly suggest you don't let this game go.You do need Games for Windows Live, but it's so easy to use that there's no reason for that to be a reason you don't pick this game up.  Just install it, boot up the game (you'll need to restart twice) and then you'll be able to play with your buddies to your hearts content!  Ignore the people giving the game negative ratings just because it requires GFWL.  The game works just fine (currently running on Windows 10).To wrap things up, Lost Planet 2 is definitely worth the money if you have friends to play it with.  I love this game through and through and am very glad that I was able to get the chance to play it with a full group of people.			",73,7,1,12,1,0,4

												The reviews have been rather harsh when it comes to this game, if your looking for good, solid 4 player fun in a gaming world which doesn't take itself seriously this is the place to be! a 3rd person shooter you take the role of a multitude of survivors facing off against enormous alien creatures and a sinister human organisation, think aliens mixed with godzilla! the story is negligable but the game more than makes up for itself with a wide array of weaponry unlockable as the game progresses along with a multitude of player titles, emotes, perks and player parts all available from a slot machine, you gotta spin to win! expect to see gargantuan alien creatures, giant pilotable mecha and some powerful guns, 4 player co-op mode and 16 player competitive multiplayer allows for massive replayability and is well worth the low asking price for entry.

												When talking about this game its hard for me not to be biased by nostalgia, so if your looking for a review from someone new to the game, then I'm sorry, but for those of you who don't care I can say without a doubt that Lost Planet 2 is one of the absolute best casual third person shooters you can find on the market. Fast paced and over-the-top combat, unique and abstract enemy designs, and short mission based chapters makes this an automatic go-to for anyone looking for a quick way to pass the time, or something 'different' from the usual more story oriented games of today. That being said I do love story based games and I'm sad to tell you that while this game is enjoyable from a gameplay perspective you shouldn't get it for anything else. Its entirely non-canon to the first and third games and treats itself more like an arcade shooter then a Tripple-A title, but if you ARE looking for that nice, fast paced co-op shooter thats not quite like the rest, this is the game for you.

Product received for free
												Far different than the original, but just as fun to play. With no real protagonist in the game, you play as multiple factions in a squad of 4, either with AI or your friends, and you are a player with no face and no name. The gameplay is solid, boss battles are action packed and the game itself is absolutely beautiful. If you can, pick this game up. The only downside to it is that it does require you to use Games for Windows Live, which can be a pain in the neck to configure. If you have issues with GFWL, make sure you have the most updated version and you have agreed to the most recent terms and conditions, which can be accessed by selecting the option ""create new..."" under the start up window for the GFWL application, even if you already have a GFWL account select this regardless as it will send you to the desired destination to update your terms and conditions - and then you're on your merry way to saving the planet once again!

												Lost Planet 2 is just as awesome as I remembered it. On PC, the port is actually quite good, the only singular setback is the requirement of Games For Windows Live. It really isn't too much of a hassle if you already have an X-Box 360/X-Box One profile, but it does require some downloading, installation, & patience. Even then, things might go wrong if you have an old version of GFWL, or you don't already have an X-Box profile, but for this game, I believe that this hassle is worth it.Lost Planet 2 is one of my top favorite games. It's so unique in almost everything it does, despite the game boiling down to just Monster Hunter with Guns N' Robots. The visuals still hold up very well in 2016, the gameplay is pretty smooth and satisfying, the game works perfectly on the PC once you get GFWL working, and everything in it is a smooth and fun experience once you get it kickstarted.Unlike Lost Planet 3, the menus work 100% smoothly with mouse and controller. You can choose to switch out controller or keyboard by just touching either one, no annoying game restarts or menu options needed. When it comes to controls, they are fairly unwieldly at first. I played it on PS3 & PC with a DualShock 3 controller, and even with a controller it can take getting used to. But once you do, the game is very rewarding and satisfying. There's plenty of settings for controls and stuff also.The game is built around co-op gameplay. This is a bad thing since almost no-body plays the game right? Well, yes & no. You can play the entire game with AI teammates (Or enemies in PvP modes) that have quite decent AI. Your computer teammates shoot enemies, drive mechs, activate objectives, and just do a good job at emulating actual other players. They even utilize the many emotes that the game has, responding to your taunts with their own, and even taunting the enemies when they feel like they did a good job. They occasionally bug out, sometimes not being able to jump onto your multi-person mech, or in more vertical levels shooting at the floor. But 90% of the time the AI team is acting very closely to actual players, and the game is very close to the quality of playing with randoms or your friends. Especially since you can play the PvP multiplayer aspects with AI.The gameplay itself is Monster Hunter, but with guns, and also robots. I haven't played a whole lot of Monster Hunter, but I'm pretty sure this has a lot more mobility with its grappling hooks and giant robot suits. You shoot a lot of stuff with weapons you find lying around, you activate checkpoints, and you aim for the glowing weakspots in the giant mosnters for an overall very fun, replayable and satisfying experience.I still totally recommend this game, despite how janky GFWL may be. It works great on PC, and it's still a really great game. It's a shame Lost Planet 3 had to be something that felt like it came 6 years BEFORE this one, but overall Lost Planet 2 is definitely a worthwhile experience if you can get past the first hurdle.

												The number one thing here that seems to drive people away from this is the GFWL.If you have about 15-30 min and you have basic troubleshooting skills, it's not that hard and there are tons of guides and reviews stating the usual fixes for almost any error you might encounter.If you want to talk about what was hard getting this to work, I had a cracked version back in the day and you had to use ""Teknogods.dll"" to get it going. You had to press F12 and wait for a voice to say ""WORKING"" then after you joined press F12 again and it would say ""TRANSFER COMPLETE"". Now imagine trying to coordinate that with 3 other random strangers. If anyone missed a beat or ever hit F12 an extra time, everyone would have to CTRL+ALT+DELETE and try again. Signing up for GFWL or troubleshooting your existing account with many guides to assist, is a cake walk.I'll admit it would be great if you didn't have to mess around with the GFWL stuff, but do yourself a favor and give it a go. I ended up nabbing this when it was like 4-5$. What do you have to lose?Also, Giant robots. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game possibly 100+ hours on console and I still believe this is an amazing game. There is the problem of getting GFWL to work on windows 10, but it only takes an hour at most with the help online. There is some problems like; some mechanics are meant for console and visual bugs, but so far nothing to ruin my experience. If you have $20 and maybe 30 min to troublshoot, without a doubt pick up this game (a couple timesover for some jolly-cooperation) and play the most underated game ever (in my opinion).

												Lost planet manages to deliver a story that makes you care (At least in the final hours) and gameplay that will put a smile on your face for hours. It is best played in co-op but you can solo it if you want to. The game rewards fun and your gonna have lots of fun piloting mechs, taking out enemy's and beating bosses with your friends. Multiplayer is also good and is better then what was featured in lost planet 1 but generally is the same with some differences like character customization and loadouts. Just know the game runs on games for windows live			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												[[[[UPDATE-- With the recent Lost Planet Sale a good load of people who haven't already picked up the tittles once more. In moments the outcry against GFWL has flooded the forums.  I say keep it up.   The game can be updated, and it's going to take you un installing your old Windows Live, Re installing what is NOW CALLED something WIndows MarketPlace, but it IS what you need, and you will need to update more than once. Even after a PC restart once it seems. But even I was able to get it to work.   You shouldn't have to go through this, but it's possible.   I'd like to see people come home, follow the guides, and get in on LP2 and try to occupy the online space as much as possible.  Let Capcom see we're not playing the falling short SFV as of this writing, and while waiting for it to hopefully become something, show them that LP2 was their last great Lost Planet we want to see fixed, and even MORE of.  I hope to see a chunk of you garner together to hit the snow, jungle, sands, and surly your Vital Suits as we attempt to show a company that after all this time, and even after all this frustration, we want our true LP experience back, and hopefully another. Not like Lost Planet 3, who's developer SPARK is now six feet under, but a TRUE LOST PLANET tittle.   Hope to see you out there. We might even have some matches where we do less fighting, and simply exploring all the fine details of what the mechs and weapons can do that have been forgotten by many.  It may be a pipe dream, but I plan on giving it a shot. I hope you will too......]] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There has been a whole lot of negative press about this game, witch is odd because it was one of the last times CAPCOM really did a bunch of things right.Take what you loved about the first one, add some faster running and pacing, a whole lotta things to unlock including weapons and emotes. Even a perk system where you should think about your role out there in the wild from having a lil advantage with a a certain weapon, or a lot with a certain weapon ammo type or type of weapon. You can even make your T Enge consumption a chunk lot less, or sacrafice it all on a load out that when you get yourself a mech, aka a VS, you don't spend ANY fuel. Sound broken? the ballance is in the other draw backs if you don't have what ya got, and you're still far from invincible.Different load outs will work for different people, and there is a whole lot to try. Some of your charachter branches you can even work up in the story experience that sends you through several different groups of EDN III and see how the new incident unfolds before the eyes of them all.You have your weapons of choice, and you find ammo catagories on the ground for what you've already chosen. So you're going to get what you WANT to play with and ammo for at least two or three in any givin mission or match, VS weapons that you can mount onto or OFF the mechs you find in the field. Just like the modern war machines of today have some basic pull from chopper and use packages. Something that we oddly don't see in modern warfare games. The mechs themselves are diverse, a couple even combind with other mechs!So what are the cons? Sadly a whole lot less people playing it last time I checked. But then again that was right after LP3 came out. Do I think the multi player or the LP3 experience is better? Hell just about nobody does.Pick this one up, epsecialy if it hits a sale as I see it right now it's just bloody five bucks. Some people are even using the LP games as training for the Titanfall experience they look forward too as of this writing. For some the game is faster and a whole lot of carnage can go down.The worst I really found with this game? Just that, not enough players, but I'll check back soon. Other past issues is that the frame work for the online play was sketchy for multi player, asking more bandwidth than some people had for a real good experience. But now a days we live with a lot more faster connection plans.If this game can work right now, and people get back involved, it's one of the few mech fests that truly show even non mech finatics they can do plenty in or out of the cockpit. The signature grapling hook game play to hang onto mechs, walls, hang about, even wheel yourself down to pop a friend in the head and slowly wheel yourself back up for a fun moment of comedy, it's all do able. Zip up, shoot something in the face, and back flip off the wall to continue your fight.This one was worth supporting, as said above it's one of the last time Capcom did things right. Not just in a good set of concepts, but it's actually a time a sci fi, mech including, inovative game poped out from the actual Capcom Developers when they were still with the company AND they were letting their fans and community shape it instead of just themselves. I suggest picking it up, the pros out weight the cons. Especialy now that the price tag is less than even most indie titles where the work here was put in for a true AAA attempt.

												I really cannot reccomend this game enough. It holds up well for a game made almost 6 years ago, both visually and mechanics/gameplay wise. The Combat both on foot and in Mechs is fun and promotes strong team-play. The mech designs are varied and really promote learning the secret functions (yes, each mech has it own individual secret functions) and promote learning the weak points of each mech so you can effectively take them down while on-foot. The campaign is a little bit of a departure from the first games story with one main character to focuing on 5 individual groups from different backgrounds. I feel this gives the game a terriffic focus of not one group nor several individuals, but the story of the planet, EDN III, and the population dwelling on it as a whole. The bosses in the game do a really good job of varying the tactics needed to beat them and the bosses in episodes 4 and 5 are GREAT in particular! I've played through the campaign at LEAST a dozen times on my old Xbox 360 copy and S-ranked around 95% of the levels. The campaign length is about 6-8 hours but there's tons of replay value as you unlock new guns and can customize your arsenal to your specific playstyle. Each playthrough can be something new, unique and fun if you play with friends and Capcoms signature hilarity shines through in every chapter of the game. For even $20 bucks this is a steal and even more so when it's on sale.			",75,12,0,3,5,2,5

												This is a fresh air for players who like third person shooters. Totally original game, not another Gears of War clone. Everything's different from Gears this time, even the engine and approach to level design!Playing the game is fun. The balance was improved in comparison with Lost Planet 1 - you're not invincible anymore if you have lots of T-ENG, that change removed boredom from the gameplay.The environments are beautiful and various, the cutscenes are stunning. Design of different enemy creatures is very imaginative. In addition to main campaign and multiplayer modes (even including single player matches with well-done bots!), interesting time trial challenges are available, which will require some thinking to find ways to complete obstacle course in time or be effective enough in deathmatch with bots.Looks like there is also hidden depth in the game, certain elements that will open only to seasoned players. I played coop once, and saw some heavy airstrike that required teamwork in order to call. Pretty rewarding.So it's a very enjoyable game overall, and you won't regret it if you get it. Totally worth your money and your time.			",223,39,7,19,4,2,8

												The majority of the hate of this game is from the GFWL (Games For Windows Live if you didn't know what it meant lolol) And of course, this DRM has stopped many players from playing this game, killing of the multiplayer option completely.BUT, there is a work around for playing the co-op with friends in this game. The people at TeknoGod has made it happen, and a HUGE thanks to them for making this. I'm not gonna type the step by step instructions on how to do it, but just follow this link, it'll teach you how to play it. You DO need either Tunngle or Hamachi to play (I recommend Hamachi if you have friends to play with, but use Tunngle to join random players.). After you get all that configured, and play the game with your friends, this game is a BLAST to play. Especially with the huge boss battles you do in the game.			",97,5,4,5,4,0,3

												This game takes Lost Planet 1's gameplay and pretty much shoves Monster Hunter-esque mechanics into the mix.You have your usual, campaign and multiplayer.But the thing I personally enjoyed the most is the Campaign. You can go trampling around in a giant robot, slice Akrid (aliens, basically) with a gun that's also a sword, go shoot stuff in a giant robot, did I mention the giant robots?Regarding gameplay... The campaign has you and 3 other allies (CPU or player controlled, I'll get to that later) take on a few chapters and missions. They're usually run from place to place, no big problem. But sometimes there will be larger threats, requiring the use of the 'Vital Suit' or VS. They're weaponised mechs that come in all kinds of variations, and they offer a lot of new strategies and ways to play.The gameplay is simple. It's just a shooter where you go to certain objectives and shoot the occasional orange/human thingy. There are bosses in chapters, so it's not always easy. Some require a lot of teamwork in order to pass, especially on higher difficulties.As for the story, well.... Eh? Story? It's rather hard to explain. The story follows multiple groups of people, and as chapters go along, you change between groups. One time you could be trying to overtake a gun on a train, the other you could be trying to take over a space asteroid. The point is that the story only comes in around halfway through. So there's not much.As for the multiplayer/co-op issue.. THIS GAME USES GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. YOU WILL NEED A LIVE ACCOUNT TO PLAY AND SAVE. IT IS NOT DOES NOT SUPPORT STEAM, THE ONLY WAY IT DOES IS THAT IT ASKS FOR A CD KEY FROM STEAM. GFWL has caused many issues in the past, especially crashes. You'd best get ready to refund if you don't know what you're doing.Overall, the game is fairly decent. I have barely played this version but I have played and completed the PS3 version. So I know what this game plays like. Not many people play it, but don't let that affect your opinion of it, it can still be pretty fun.			",38,2,1,1,8,1,2

												Lost Planet 2: Graphics are Excellent, Sounds are Better then the first Lost Planet. I had Lost Planet Extreme Condition - Colonies Edition. Music was Splendid, Story was Great but like the first game they had two or three cheap bosses I didn't mind it so much this time around. Co-op was the best part of the game teaming up with friend's and taking on the mission's and bosses. Now down to business Lost Planet 2 is a 8 out of 10			",154,8,0,19,3,0,10

												Time Bought: Dec 24, 2010Money Spent: $26.79Worth The Price?: YES, and then somePosition In Game At Time Of Review: finished the story mode on Easy Normal and Hard settings, currently trying to finish up Extreme.  Got all the skins, weapons, emotes, and abilities.  Got all the 'slots'.  All characters are level 50 or over.FIRST OF ALL, this will be a REAL UNBIAS PLAYER REVIEW AND NOT A QUICK WHINEY TEMPERMENTAL FIT FROM SOMEONE WITH 0.5HRS OF ""PLAYTIME"".  Because you know, it's NEVER you and ALWAYS the game right people!?  With that being said, I didn't like it at first either, I did experience the frustrating GFWL account issues and the initial 'feel' that you can only play this game with friends definitely left a pessimistic aspect in me. I absolutely LOVED the first one and years ago when I sparked LP2 up I was very discouraged at how much it 'seemed' to change. BUT I started playing it for real last week and cannot stop myself from playing it more now. I pre-ordered The Division and want to play it but can't put this game down at the moment.  My advice is to let go of your pride and beat it on Easy first mostly to get acquainted or reacquainted with the game, but mostly so that you can wear the many different skins on multiplayer instead of the 1 default skin. Since beating it on Easy, I breezed past Normal, and am now on Hard in the Campaign mode. At first, I thought it was broken because I couldn't find out how to get past Episode 1 lol, since every Episode is divided into Chapters and then the Chapters are divided into Missions.  There are 6 Episodes in the Campaign mode consisting of 3-5 Chapters each.  MAKE SURE YOU FINISH A CHAPTER before turning off the game or stop playing, or you'll have to do that whole chapter again from the start.  The gameplay itself is very similar to the first Lost Planet.  I first tried to play with a xbox 360 controller but shortly reverted back to mouse & keyboard which instantly improved my aiming capabilities.  My first initial thoughts of the game when I first started it up was how absolutely stunning the graphics were (this was back in 2010), how fluid the gameplay was (the game comes with a benchmark tool to gauge if your computer can handle the gameplay), and the overwhelming (at first) menu screen.  Like most true gamers, I said forget reading the instruction booklet, and only took around 30 minutes of fiddling to fully understand it.  The port seemed very polished to me.  My only challenge now is finding friends who will play the multiplayer co op with me.  The community is pretty much dead (except for campaign play sometimes), but you will find a few people once in a while who will jump in your game.  Personally, to me, it's actually annoying when someone I don't know joins my game since there is no kick option.  But most of the time it's much better to have actual people play with you.  Since there is no kick option, you will either have to deal with them until the chapter is done, or recreate the game session again.  You can also set private slots to 3/3 so no one can join your game as well.  But I have met a couple people recently who aren't ""rushers"".  Now a days Steam, GMG, Gamersgate, etc has this game on sale for $5 which is an ABSOLUTE STEAL if you have the patience to actually do a little research on how to get it to play properly.  It is a console port after all.  I guarantee you will not regret it!!!!!  I am looking to put AT LEAST a couple hundred hours into this game.EDIT: I've completed Hard and am working on Extreme now.  I still play the other difficulties because I love playing this game.  My views of others playing with me has changed too since I've been thru the story mode so many repeated times.  So I actually like the run & gun people now :P  But if you're new to the story mode and game, then you should heed the original stand points.Rating:  8/10			",626,123,31,73,49,6,89

												That same month, two months, lost to the earth, you'll get through. A distant memory insulated. We are very pleased with the new logo.To get the best price Lost Planet 2.Amazon UK159: -""Nothing really interesting is that this time can be flooded. This is a good thing, and see.""If you play a musical instrument or three or Lost Planet 2 and possibly ""be a lot of water in the right places"" and ""super happy"" is not going to be the same. But it is difficult when it is too late, on Tethys is very good for all ages here. First snow melting snow in the recording time, and now there are deserts and wild dreams, and even holes. But not necessarily looga but you have a different group of soldiers Capcom's seven chapters, you can find a new section of its parts. The shape and depth of the life and movement of the Battle of world domination to a higher level. at leastSome IT♥♥♥♥♥kickedI train very wild, arms, life, group, no worries, yes, but not oil. Construction area of ​​the size of the monster, and to remember a lot of the food is not good. I'm in trainingThis means that we will apply to all trains and helicopters in the animal's neck - grenade launchers, rifles and empty bottles - you want to stop the snake. But it is easy to eat a car with rage. We are not dog Terra teenage horror excited cries of joy pain.304 875Marcus Xbox Phoenix and San Diego, with many players have been ready to fight.Dealing with the spirit of the neck of some songs, then we have to re-train new left. It was not long ago, we have to make his way to the drought. But this time, I can not fight. Gerbils pistol rail link between the size. Work to install and use other animals Declan first Trojan cooled four trains on the road, if necessary. Armed officers immediately without any problem at any time of life.fourLost Planet 2 has a hard and fast all the various side normal and safe. The concept is basically one thing, Capcom company has a lot of the same game for the first time to do. Releasing a CD key component of the collaboration between the two. It's complicated, especially hair spray a serious, complex characters. (A type weapon), continues to move along the road, you can jump in one of dozens of key forward. The players have been wearing a suit two is especially important in the winter, my colleagues are very bad for the ride. So you can put human life epic air interface.Trailer about five minutes Click here to view high resolution pictures and Lost Planet 2.With global warming, you need fuel (more than) enough, sudden death, do not worry. But we have some kind of impact. Some biological weapons and a bunch of empty oil drums and other intelligence to bear fruit juice stand.West, beefy flavor Epic Games company.This is the first in many ways to pay for roads ideological manipulation, Capcom is filled with a certain depth of the industry. Lurking in the desert attitude forget a hut. Main battle is still to take a bus to continue the fight. The study was carried out good.No. 304 120The boss fights are based on simple and effective. Now we have a lot of riders, know next to Lost Planet.But all that glitters is not gold. The only thing that bothers me the first game, you will not be able to use it from hand to jump xkottet, I believe this is part of a large patent restrictions Capcom screen.However - do not play split screen! Although there can be only one of two players each have four separate images and other maps Papfammar talk about the series. How, in the Lost Planet game is different: the environment, which is a bit disappointing $ by more surprises bored to death. (Does not control, like killing animals, thank you very much effect), but here, ""call"" Thank the Lord runway. The two of you run, hide any type of organization and the rest of the draw has been devoted to the poor western wild marsupials.It has assumed most of the CD, you rojet of Lost Planet 2 after the Second World War Basta questions ready, this is not a difficult process.

												An amazing game that I love, and would highly recommend.Also would like to mention (this was edited after the original review) that I got the game from a friend, hence I'm putting it as free. Also, the multiplayer may not work for connecting to everyone, but you can still make games and invite friends, and it's great fun to play with friends.Now, we have to move onto the topic of GFWL, which a lot of people have trouble with for some reason.I highly recommend Creating a microsoft/xbox account BEFORE HAND, AND DOWNLOADING GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE BEFORE HAND, don't be stupid and not download it, and then try to create and download through their service, you're just ♥♥♥♥ing yourself or trying to find a way to hate it.After your nice account is created, boot up Lost Planet 2, do your settings (make sure to click select to apply them). Then click play, where the apparent nightmare happens, GFWL. So, you already have an account, click log into existing account or whatever it is, type your info (password thing may not show you typing one in, just type it anyways and make sure you have it correct) then click log in.Now, it should after this tell you there is an update, say yes to it, and when it gives you a profile screen saying you need a profile, press alt f4, exit the game. As behind the game is the update you need to download, click yes, you know, all the stuff. Now, if done correctly, it should now launch the game again, click play, login (highly recommend having it remember everything and logging in automatically), then it should take a while to download your profile, and you should be able to play.If this doesn't work, then look up other guides.Other than that, I recommend checking out gameplay before you purchase the game, making sure it's the kind of game you will like. Other than that, have fun with whatever you're doing!			",99,6,2,13,13,0,19

There's multiplayer vehicles, a team support weapon, healing, managing T-Energy, ""not"" blowing up your teammates. There are game mechanics here you won't see anywhere else.It may not have done as well in sales since it's just OK as a single player game. This is one of those games where professional critics dump on it but, gamers love it.

												This is probably one of, if not, my favorite Co-Op game out there.  Yeah, there are a few hurdles you have to go through to get this game to work (Thanks, GFWL), but once you do, you're in for one hell of a time.Lost Planet 2 is the sequel that not only does as well as the first game, but does it BETTER.  The only gripe I could say is that the Story is very cheesy, but not to the point where'd you hate it.  The main focus here is the gameplay, and it's just great!  The story mode, alone, is alright, but not as fun, (Sound familiar, Resident Evil 5?) With at least 1 person or a full lobby of 4, including yourself, you're in for one hell of a time.  There's also an option too to turn on Friendly Fire, so if you wanna have some even more fun dicking around, you know what to do.  If using the same weapon over and over isn't your cup of tea, then no worries!  Lost Planet 2 includes a customization option that is very vast.  From the look of your character, to your guns, to abilites (That change how you play a bit), and even Emotes.  Ever wanted to pose like the Ginyu Force with your friends with everyone wearing a Servbot Mask?  You can do that!  Have you wanted to mow down giant creatures and mechs alike with a shotgun that shoots confetti and a grenade with an explosion so big that it gives Micheal Bay a raging erection?  You can do that!  Do you want to take one mech and find another only to find out that you can transform it, Power Rangers Style, and make it one of the most badass machines to pilot? You can do that!Lost Planet 2 is one of those games that stuck out to me in a good way, and for good reasons.  If you are going to get this game, get this with a friend.  Unfortunately, the servers have absolutely NO ONE playing, so good luck trying to find a party of people playing the game.  Other than that, this is one game that I whole heartedly recommend.

												The Game is LOVELY, its a game I sank literal, cumulative months worth of time into on the xbox. BUT WAIT, THIS IS PC! It is subjected to the cancerous, DRM tumor that is Games for Windows Live, the forgotten, barely maintained piece of discarded offal that plagues far too many microsoft and capcom pc titles. My advice is to get this on console, because though this game is a gift from the video gaming gods, it's wings are chained by iron-strength chains of DRM. Lets just say, there's a reason the store is tryign to pass this off on people for 3.99 right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Between the extra steps the user potentially has to take to get GFWL to work properly, and then, at least for me, after I did get GFWL working, it reduced my resolution to 800x600... with no option to put it back to my native resolution. I refunded this broken mess of a game, and honestly have reported it as a broken product on the steam store page. Maybe that will light a fire under someone's butt to get this fixed.

 Lost Planet 2 - Review === Rating  7.0 / 10 - A fun co-op game with issues, but enjoyable still. === Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Excellent gameplay concepts+ Multiple storylines involving different factions+ Good variety of enemies+ Good variety of weapons and vehicles+ Long campaign+ Many things to unlock between Emotes, Skins, Weapons and Skills - Cons -  - Bad save system: if a player disconnects, crashes or anything during a ongoing chapter, progress will not save and will have to do all over again.- RNG (Randomness) determines what weapons or skills you unlock- Games For Windows Live majorly cripples the game's functioning, requiring extensive manual operations to make the game run, correctly login and host a match.- For a 2010 game, graphics, animations, detail level, map design, and shaders are borderline ridiculous.

												This is very easily my absolute favorite! Whether you want to play it casually or srs bsns, with a couple of friends or alone, LP² won't fail to appease. Pretty and very diverse landscapes, bizarre and real huge boss monsters, a story that is impossible to follow along with, plus totally customisable character to play as.. The only major downside is that you have to put up with Games for Windows Live, which was created to even drive the Devil himself to despair, but other than that, I like this onea whole lot.. Give it a try some time.			",570,106,2,72,17,0,53

												This is honestly the best co-op game I have ever played in my life, and you all probably know how much I loved my Left 4 Dead. The level of interaction you have with your friends is insane; you can support your buddy driving a mech by switching out his weapons on the ground, giving him energy, repairing him, getting in a co-pilot gunner seat, or simply just grabbing on the side and adding firepower. That already useful shield that gives cover? If your allies help you by giving you energy, it can transform into a giant beam weapon of destruction!And the Ancients will always sing of the triumph of coop game design that is Train Gun.Buy it immediately, message me when you do, we're playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥			",291,62,3,29,16,2,25

												Let me start by saying that this is a fun game. That being said, Lost Planet 1 is a much superior game. The problem is they focused so much on the multiplayer aspect that it leaves the game lacking. First of all, you can't play it without windows live which sucks. I hate having to download and use a system in order to play a game. I even don't like Uplay or Origin so Live sucks too. Plus the game is good but not great. The story is all over the place and your AI suck. It was meant to be co op but the game is so old that the community is pretty much dead. If the map is big your AI wander around doing nothing. Plus the game has the lost planet 1 problem in that there is no running. You go everywhere at a leisurely pace. Also the game does not nearly have enough mech combat which is what made the first game such a major success. I don't think this game was worth the 5 bucks I spent but at least the game has some good length with a 10 hour campaign. The problem is because it’s a multiplayer co op game; you can't save the game until you finish the entire mission. Worse, you can't even pause it! This means you have to devote a half an hour to an hour to the game without stopping. Also you can't get the really good weapons unless you get lucky in their lame slot machine. Now don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun playing it. I think it was a major letdown from the first game and they could have done better. In its prime this was probably a great game but now it’s just a relic. Honestly, I didn't want to pay five bucks but that was a cheap as it would go and I want to play the whole franchise. I'll probably end up paying 6 bucks for Lost Planet 3. A great game but it is sadly very aggravating.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Yes it sucks they don't just revert this to a Steam edition. But it's a great co-op game, there's a guide right here on Steam giving out steps to fix any GFWL issues. For my case I just had to allow two GFWL programs through my firewall, took 5 minutes, already had a username from my xbox days. (likely another 5 minutes to create a gamertag/ID.) Yes it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but it's quite a unique game that's only comparable to a handful of other games. If people didn't jack off so hard for competitive shooters, this game would be more popular and thus have a Steam Edition, so blame the community if it makes you feel better ;)Short analogy of this game: What you get if Earth Defence Force took itself seriously and there were sometimes guys with guns/bipedal piloted robots.

												Literally unplayable due to Games For Windows Live being required to launch it. Fix it already Capcom.==EDIT AS OF FEBUARY 28, 2017.==A real cool guy managed to post a fix for GFWL, here is his guideUninstall GFWL completely from your PC, do not uninstall LP2. Then download http://www.xbox.com/en-IE/Live/PC/DownloadClientIf you can't sign into your GFWL account through that due to an error, check this url below.http://keeppcquiet.blogspot.com/2012/11/games-for-windows-live-8015403a-login.htmlIf you still don't get the results that page explains, read the bottom comment, which is this:""I fixed it by going to my microsoft account page athttps://account.microsoft.com/Then I clicked on the 'Your info' tabThen I clicked on ""Go to your Xbox profile""Which brought me to another sign in page even though I was already signed in to my microsoft live accountThen I just re-signed in using the same Microsoft account and I was able to accept the agreement and now GFWL works.""Then sign in with your now magically working was-broken-a-few-minutes-ago info in the GFWL marketplace client, and voila.If GFWL prompts for an update then say yes and completley close the game in order to install it. (This sometimes takes two or more tries before it works)After this it WILL work from now on, you dont even need to start GFWL from desktop.Now any game that requires GFWL will work forever for you because no other game in the future is going to use it anyway.

												A great game made just for a good Co-op experience. I wouldn't understand why someone would buy this game to play alone. This game is just a good Co-op experience that dosen't try to take itself seriesly. Its feels like Gears Of War and Monster Hunter had a baby and this was the result. And don't listen to the negative comments about Games for windows, it took me 2 second to download it and sign in with my old Xbox account. If you really have a hard time then look it up on the internet, your on a computer right now. There are lots of guides on how to set up games for windows/this game. In the end if you just want a game to play with your buds and laugh at stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥then this is your game.			",262,41,5,40,17,1,46

												installed the latest version of Games for Windows Live Marketplace from Microsoft's website, zero problems with GFWL on Windows 10.Multiplayer co-op and head-to-head play is amazing. The game itself is a 10/10, GFWL just needs to be removed from the game and replaced with Steamworks so that there isn't the barrier of networking knowledge seperating the very little amount of players from matching with each other.

												A pretty great game in the series. A bit more annoying than 1 because you will take a lot of dmg and possibly die a lot because your squad mates are as dumb as can be, but there are respawn points and you should have plenty of T-energy. Team members in this game are dumber than hell so expect to be a one-man army. The graphics are awesome and hold up well even by today's standards. The game runs pretty smoothly and combat is great. The worst thing though about the game is that when you fire your view rises up so you need to correct it often which is horribly annoying. Actually the worst part of the game is that mouse control feels horrible because of its delayed reaction feeling. I would say do not bother unless you have a gamepad. I use my xbox 360 pad and it works fine. The cut scenes are enjoyable and the voice acting is pretty good. Definitely worth it on sale for a solid once-through.

Whoever gave the order to create this piece of software should loose his job and never be allowed to work again.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game is a straight 9/10, one of the few games that have coop in their essence. PvP and PvE are both fun as hell, with lots of customization options, guns, game modes and the most epic battles against giant monsters you will find in video game history.  The levels are well designed with different ways to approach them, everyone has a grappling hook that he can use to move or kill enemies creatively.If this game ever gets the deserved migration to steam works I cab highly recommend it. It has the potential of a cult classic that GFWL has completely ruined.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two of my friends got this game and after much hassle got it working on their win 10 machines.They are playing co-op together so I bought the game (win 7) and after all the hassle of an 8gig download, getting windows live/xbox account, changing windows firewall settings, updates for whatever it wanted, restarting pc, and having to mess around with all sorts of things I have no idea what was going on with some of them, I finally got the game to work only to find out I can't join my friends in co-op for some mysterious reason. They tried inviting me and I got the error message and if I tried to invite them then they got the message.  I have googled the problem (lost communication, returning to main title) and there are a couple of pages of people having the same problem. I tried the solutions suggested but nothing has worked. Reluctantly I have requested a refund. TBH a game this messed up with installing shouldn't even be on Steam imo. Sure, it's probably a great game, if one can get it to work.			",18,0,0,5,1,0,1

												Lost Planet 2 is one of the best games I have ever played! The co-op campaign is super fun; the variety of areas players have to fight in is astonishing (ranging from arid deserts and lush jungles to underwater military bases and space stations).Player characters are highly customizable and there is an abundance of vehicles to drive - walking robots, tanks, giant railway cannons and futuristic helicopters - you name it.Such a pity that Lost Planet 2 so underappreciated by the general public. But the game’s good, this is why you still can find partners for the co-op campaign, even though the game is like 4 years old.			",222,15,3,14,10,0,47

												Extremely fun co-op game for just $3.99, buy it for your friends! It's even fun with just two people. I've never had any real issues with GFWL games besides it simply being down once or twice. It's something you have to work with but I've never failed to find a solution (feel free to ask the discussion board). The competitive multiplayer is also OK and very much alive through a steam group that plays a few days a week.As for the actual game, it's a third person co-op shooter where you primarily kill both humans and bug-like aliens in either a ""wave"" type fashion or through a linear level. You play as several different factions through their own branch of the story in which you'll play through several unique missions and then face off against a gigantic boss. The game is left a little unfinished towards the end but the 12~ hour ride is well worth playing. It's also extremely replayable, my friend and I started hard mode very shortly after beating it on normal and were having just as much fun. This is a Japanese game. This is a Capcom game. If you understand what that means, find someone to play Lost Planet 2 with you.			",205,32,3,17,7,3,29

												DISAPOINTED.I loved the first Lost Planet. It had a very interesting history, with a nice amount of everything: adventure, action, shooter... With variate situations, weapons, vehicles.Why am I disapointed?:This time LP2 is more oriented to Online Deathmatch fights and, it resembles as a lifted version of the old known Quake, if you like.That's ok. The game has rythm, intensity and a nice look. It's funny, as usual with Namco games.But, I was expecting a similar  approach for single player as in the first Lost Planet.If you are expecting the same, don't buy it.If you just wanted an Online Multiplayer frenetic deathmatch game, this is a good one.

												I beat the game a long long time ago, back on console. And besides the advanced video settings, the game is still as much fun on PC. Some keyboard binding might be annoying (but customizable), but once it's passed, you'll have one hell of a trip!I remember the game mostly for its epic giant bosses, the crazy artistic direction, and the different storylines across the globes which make this game look like a road-trip meeting Monster Hunter.LP2 is one of those game you want them to remaster and bring forward today because it was beatiful, and it would offer a pretty good lengthy game we lack these days.I didn't play mutliplayer nor coop, but I assure the solo is good enough already. You travel across 4-5 places on the planet (desert, tundra, jungle, etc) and take control of different characters with different situation, motives, friends and climate, but one same goal : killing those creatures! Gameplay is simple : shoot the orange thingy, or headshot. Run, grapple, pilot a mech or vehicule. Grab nasty bigass weapons or play it human scale.The only thing I can blame on this game is that characters feel heavy to control, even with sprint. Moving in the levels sometime is boring and the fov isn't great neither. But if you handle the game how it is, you will have a great time.			",73,9,3,6,1,0,2

												Extremely fun co-op game for just $3.99, buy it for your friends! It's even fun with just two people. I've never had any real issues with GFWL games besides it simply being down once or twice. It's something you have to work with but I've never failed to find a solution (feel free to ask the discussion board). The competitive multiplayer is also OK and very much alive through a steam group that plays a few days a week.As for the actual game, it's a third person co-op shooter where you primarily kill both humans and bug-like aliens in either a ""wave"" type fashion or through a linear level. You play as several different factions through their own branch of the story in which you'll play through several unique missions and then face off against a gigantic boss. The game is left a little unfinished towards the end but the 12~ hour ride is well worth playing. It's also extremely replayable, my friend and I started hard mode very shortly after beating it on normal and were having just as much fun. This is a Japanese game. This is a Capcom game. If you understand what that means, find someone to play Lost Planet 2 with you.			",205,32,3,17,7,3,29

												I beat the game a long long time ago, back on console. And besides the advanced video settings, the game is still as much fun on PC. Some keyboard binding might be annoying (but customizable), but once it's passed, you'll have one hell of a trip!I remember the game mostly for its epic giant bosses, the crazy artistic direction, and the different storylines across the globes which make this game look like a road-trip meeting Monster Hunter.LP2 is one of those game you want them to remaster and bring forward today because it was beatiful, and it would offer a pretty good lengthy game we lack these days.I didn't play mutliplayer nor coop, but I assure the solo is good enough already. You travel across 4-5 places on the planet (desert, tundra, jungle, etc) and take control of different characters with different situation, motives, friends and climate, but one same goal : killing those creatures! Gameplay is simple : shoot the orange thingy, or headshot. Run, grapple, pilot a mech or vehicule. Grab nasty bigass weapons or play it human scale.The only thing I can blame on this game is that characters feel heavy to control, even with sprint. Moving in the levels sometime is boring and the fov isn't great neither. But if you handle the game how it is, you will have a great time.			",73,9,3,6,1,0,2

												This game is ok. Well, for my taste, that is. It's a third person co-op shooter in which you work together with a team to take down monsters and other enemies in a detailed jungle. Though the acting is pretty awkward with the dubbing and the gameplay can sometimes be repetitive, Lost Planet 2 is a pretty enjoyable game with a variety of missions. Though for some game veterans, this game can become boring. 6/10			",143,20,7,7,5,2,7

												Loved the first game, and was expecting alot more from this however there's somethings i can't stand and number 1 is the Key Bindings. Normaly I change up the key bindings to get as close as i can to the first game. 1:  After some time playing the first few mins of a solo champain game i noticed i forgot to look at the controls for the VS's since i saw one of my guns not firing at all. Back out and took a look and seriously....You can change your person's key bindings but not your VS controls!? The VS controls were great in the first game besides the anounying getting out instead of picking something up. They should of at least kept the VS firing keys for the left and right mouse button.2:  Really? Windows Live just to play? nothing more needs to be said here.3:  No singlepayer mode...all of it is online. Even if you host a game and made it to were only you are playing, you can't pause the game.There are only a few things I liked.1:  Having AI or friends playing with you in the Campain.2:  The story shifting to the War between the NEVEC and the Snow Pirates. its hard to say if i would recommend this game to others with some controls being unchangeable. depends if you care or don't care about the key bindings. Loved the first game and now; personally, i'm sorry to say no, i would not recommend it. ",92,18,0,10,21,1,25

												I logged countless hours of play time into the xbox 360 version of this game,at one point even after it had been a few years old it was one of the few titles that never left my limited hdd as I found myself playing it everyday,though I had played the game daily or at least weekly since its initial launch. Now my experience has come full circle as I have finally got the title on my prefered medium...the pc...I prefer the keyboard and mouse approach but am not prejudice toward my xbox controller...I don't think the game has local coop at all which is a big downside from it's console cousin. All in all this is one game you cannot afford to skip out on despite the games for windows live garbage system that ruins so many titles.			",222,12,1,21,1,0,15

												NOTE: This review is only evaluating the game concerning its single-player merits.You know that scene from the movies, right? Where the new kid in school gets introduced in front of the class, and everyone looks at him/her with a mild mixture of disinterest and disdain? That’s how I felt when I started up Lost Planet for the first time. The game is all like „Oooh, look at our multiplayer content! Shiny! Now grab some friends and play this game how we want you to, DAMMIT!“ My reply: „But… I want to play a single-player campaign. Is this possible, too?“ The game averts its gaze, annoyed: „Yeah, I guess… freak.“The game constantly hits you over your head with the fact that it’s really meant to be played in multi-player. For single-player fans, this makes things awkward. Where do I start? What about the AI stand-ins that accompany you, with silly “gamertag” names over their heads all the time? The “Battle Gauge” system, which is basically a multi-player “army strength” system? A system that respawns you right back into the running game without resetting to a checkpoint, complete with a respawn countdown? The team zones at the end of the levels, which are red boxes that all players – human and AI – have to be inside to complete the mission? Or that the game rewards you for using gestures in these team zones? I could go on and on, but you get the point. For single-player modes, immersion is key, and this game’s insistence on its multi-player infrastructure is a major immersion-killer.But even if you are able to ignore this, there are still the absence of a noteworthy story and the jarring transitions. As you are a part of an actually-meant-for-multiplayer squad, there is no real protagonist, a detriment which is exasperated by the fact that you switch back and forth through multiple squads belonging to different parties during the course of the campaign. This wouldn’t be bad if each squad was somehow distinct, but this isn't the case. They are all faceless soldiers. No, literally, they are all wearing masks or helmets all the time! Then, there are the transitions, a problem which was already present in the first game. Episodes which should be one consistent sequence of levels connected by cutscenes are always broken up into artificial “missions”. And it gets worse: A tense shootout against enemy dropships ends in the middle of combat because an arbitrary “energy bar” hit zero – with ships still in the air! All these things amount to the game’s greatest sin: Its clumsy and wasteful handling of its setpieces. Here’s where I have something positive to say about the game: Lost Planet 2 features a collection of stunning setpieces. Really, they are as epic as you can get. If they had been used by someone who knows how to craft a good single-player game, this could have been an action blockbuster for the ages. However, the dire reality is that without a meaningful story and an immersive presentation, these setpieces remain fragments without significance or emotional impact.If you’re looking for an opinion about the multi-player component of Lost Planet 2, please consult a review addressing this aspect. However, if you look for a great single-player experience, stay away. It’s sadly not worth the effort.			",443,110,7,59,33,3,71

												First off: i got this as a gift and i know that i haven't played it very long. I had no problems with windows live.I try to keep it short:+ coop action game+ nice designs and UI+ mechas- controls (the whole aim stutters with mouse and/or gamepad)- aimbot or failbot (chose between easymode aim or no aim - see above)- oversaturated graphics (wysiwyg - look at the screens)All in all it isn't a bad game but i always felt betrayed by the controls and the handling. I'm no fan of auto-aim and i don't like quicktime-events to rule the destiny of my 4 man group.If you're still looking for a nice co-op game, maybe rather go for borderlands or dying light.

												This game was such an awful single player experience to the point where I can’t be bothered to finish it which is rare because I usually finish every game I start playing. The game is obviously designed to be played in coop, I didn’t know that going into it so I’m just speaking on the single player side although I really feel like this would be a mediocre coop experience at best anyway. I was so bored playing this game, I hated the mission structure and how repetitive and boring the combat was, it was much more tedious than the original which is quite an achievement because I found the first game quite good at being tedious. I didn’t feel like they tried to improve the gameplay at all, in some ways it’s worse like the knockback in this game is ridiculous and they could how done so much more with that grappling hook. The story in this game is just setup for these very small, linear mini missions that last about an average of 5 minutes. It is wasted potential because I do think that there is an opportunity to tell a story in this world the developers created and they don’t use it well at all. I liked the graphics, i think the game still looks really good that’s the only redeeming thing about this game is that it’s pretty to look at. 2/10 (Awful)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Played this because GFWL is shutting down in less than a month- glad I bought this for $5. Just horrible in all aspects. The campaign isn't really a campaign, it's mini-levels that are placed in order so you and some co-op buddies can kill things without thinking. But for some reason, even if you're playing solo- there needs to be a 10 second countdown at the end of each chapter...Why? The story attempts to explain something about jungle pirates fighting your team (who are all nameless and generic) and along the way you kill the monsters of the planet. But the story isn't really where this game fails; it's everything else. It fails as PC port (from customizable controls), from a controls aspect (aiming with the mouse), from an objective aspect (if you're playing solo, the 4 AI characters that play with you can do 100% of the work. From turning on the waypoints, to killing enemies, you can basically spring from the start of the level to the end without lifting a finger. It's just not a well polished product. The only redeeming quality of Lost Planet 2 is the monster design. Everything else is bad and I won't be sad if this is unplayable after July 1, 2014.			",519,76,8,42,34,3,71

												Basically, they took Lost Planet, and turned it into a Squadshooter/escort game. Escort in the sense that your AI squaddies can't shoot for crap and left alone for 5 seconds, usually die.There were a few great looking sets don't get me wrong, but they were still few and far between.Each 'level' lasts about an average of 5 minutes, and involves running 20 feet in a certain direction, killing everything, and moving on to the next level.Even IF anyone played this game online, I don't see how anyone would enjoy the tiny maps.Although most of the Akrid were just reused from the first game, much of the time it felt like I was fighting human enemies. There weren't nearly as many mechs sitting around as there were in the first game, and you pretty much spent most of the game on foot.A step down from the original Lost Planet.Fortunately since the game is also infested with GFWL, no one else will probably find out just how bland and boring it is.Stay AWAY.

												Forced into coop, Even in single player the game riddles the map full of bots that use randomly generated ""XX_LEET_PWNER_XX"" names over their heads that do nothing but exist for the sake of existing and being cannon fodder.LP2 is MUCH MORE acceptable over Lost Planet 3, Although whenever you die, even in single player, The game just basically tells you, OH, you died, Here, Lets respawn you at the beggining of the map with NO PUNISHMENT what so ever, Except ""Battle Points""Battle points are ♥♥♥♥ing USELESS if you're playing this in single player, Which you most likely are.Sadly, As soon as i saw 'Respawning in 3' when i died, I quit and uninstalled the game becuase even on the hardest difficulty i get NO recompense for dying. at all, to me thats no fun at all and has NO challenge, If you die you dont have to take more care and be sure to clear out an area properly because you didnt see that last guy with a ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE AKRID, instead you can just walk for 10 minutes to where you just where back from the start of the mission with no progress resetting and just shoot at the same thing you already injured.♥♥♥♥ it.

												The absolute worst of modern Japanese game design, where it's just a bunch of assets and mechanics just thrown into a melting pot with no rhyme, reason or context. The last level is literally an hour and a half of running through a repetitive volcano city and shooting giant fire eyeballs that can kill you in one hit.Whether or not you get usuable upgrades instead of another emote you don't have room to equip  is completely up to a slot machine.It uses GFWL.Fighting giant bugs is fun so they make you fight sloggy space marines with hitscan weapons for most of the game.The story is nonsense even if you try to pay attention to the cutscenes.All this and it's still less bad than RE6.

												This game on the surface is quite deceiving, it looks great in videos but the lack of flow, over acting and basic premise is both off putting and tedious. It kind of works on a purely Arcade level (think Modern Warfares arcade mode) but doesn't really have enough there for me personally to get past the first hour or so. If you subscribe to the Japanese action tropes and enjoy those there might be something here for you, otherwise I'd avoid.One disclaimer is that I haven't played this game via co-op and from what I understand this is where the game shines, I just have no interest in going any further to find out.

It is the typical good vs bad with little or no player choice.I felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished, not because I'd beaten anything difficult but because I'd managed to persevere though a genuinely tedious and extremely linear game.Would not recomend.

												Paper thin story that goes all over the place (we follow 4/5 groups of characters).Speaking of going all over the place so does the keyboard layout. It amazes me how a modern game like this doesn't have a simple and intuitive button layout.Didn't like the gameplay also. It just seemed to mechanic with the character being stuck in animations most of times. (It would made sense to have the possibility to interrupt a reload animation to dodge an incoming attack and try the reload again after.)The sound appeared to have some issues. The volume would decrease randomly. Could have been something to do with my hardware. Not sure.I guess the only positive thing I have to say is about the visuals. They look pretty good, although there was a real lack of snow (from the first game). I guess no one can say the levels were repetitive.			",192,11,1,10,4,0,16

												I would love to be able to recommend this game to my friends to buy it I had it on the PS3 and personally loved the game, I played through the campaign 20+ times and always had a blast with it. So I figured since my PS3 died I'd buy it on here seeing it was never coming on sale I figured why not for $20 and all the fun i had before its still worth it for me well how wrong I was. This game doesn't even work right after installing and loading up it instantly crashes so do some hunting around and I didn't even se it say this on the Store page maybe I just missed it but its a damn Games for Windows Live game...basically that means its screwed since GFWL isn't even supported anymore.I see some people saying its hopefully coming to steam works and I sure as hell hope it is I really really want to be able to play it on PC with friends. Sadly as it stands I've tried a few things to try to get it to work and nothing has really wishing I just burned my $20 then giving it to Steam for a broken game would of had more fun that way.

Boss battles are sometimes confusing and dont tell you what your really doing. The VS's that made the game fun are few and fragile. Alot of the time you end up in older really terrible models from the previous game with weapons that wont help you in your situation. When you finally get a good VS its barely lasts 5 mins and then your left with crappy low end models again. The games bad and it should feel bad			",46,3,0,2,8,0,5

												To start, this game is not a sequel to Lost Planet. If you're reading this and were expecting to have a follow-up to the story in the first game, this is not it. The closest thing you get are brief mentions hinting back to the first game. This game is a military-themed co-op shooter where you play as a nameless, faceless snow pirate with other nameless, faceless snow pirates. There is no aiming. Aiming is handled by an auto-aim system. So you run through missions constructed for co-op firing in the general direction of things.The game is co-op only. You can play with 0-3 AI partners if you can't find people. Finding people requires a Games For Windows LIVE account.  If you run out of life you die and respawn in missions with a life system integrated into the game. If you want to stop and do not reach the end of a chapter, you will need to replay every mission in that chapter from the start should you want to continue.Buy at your own peril.

												It's loud, it's bombastic, it's utterly stupid. It's the result of Capcom trying to design a western-style game, so it's full of explosions, forced co-op, giant monsters, scripted nonsense, and not even a hint of balance or well-designed gameplay mechanics. The bosses are all giant impressive monsters that are all utterly boring to fight without the tells or tough but fair balance of MonHun, which this game tries to pretend it apes with all the heavy movement and plodding animations.Is it worth it? Probably. You've never played anything quite like it in the mindless shooting department, but it will forever remain a ""co-op only joke game"" along with EDF.			",783,138,12,70,45,1,71

												I very much enjoyed this game, even though I never touched the online. I played local co-op with a friend a few times, and played through the campaign many times by myself. Messing around with all the character options is a lot of fun, and I never get tired of the absurdly epic scenarios. I recommend it highly, unless you're looking for deep plot and character.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/07/post-launch-reviews-2-lost-planet-2-pc.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												DISCLAIMER:Do not buy this game if you are expecting a strong narrative, or story heavy campaign, or active multiplayer.However DO buy this game if you are looking for a great co-op game, with above average gameplay and variety in environments.Lost Planet 2 is a direct sequel to Lost Planet in that it takes place in the same planet, but does not follow the Wayne storyline.The game shows the effects of all the events which occurred in the previous Lost Planet, and takes its own spin on it, which introduces all the variety of environments in the game. The lush forests, infinite deserts, rocky shores and meteor filled locations in the game give the different story campaigns an identity. Different campaigns and locations bring a bit of fun with physics, namely some underwater and in outer space where your movement is altered due to lower gravity.Lost Planet 2 plays great on my PC, I run with an AMD 8350 processor with an HD 7950 GPU. I get constant 60 frames per second, which would be higer with Vsync disabled.Despite GFWL going down, the game does feature LAN connectivity for co-op and multiplayer, which can be emulated over the internet with programs like Evolve, so there is no reason to not go through the campaign after GFWL servers go down.

												If you liked the adventure feel of the first game, this is not going to feel the same.  If you enjoyed the multiplayer aspect to the game, LP2 is primarily focused on that part.  The single player mode is, basically.  short and direct point to point missions scattered through all the different storylines.  It really reminded me of Star Wars Battlefront, where the campaign is a single player version of the multiplayer experience.It's ok, but it isn't as fun as the first title.			",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												1. I'm playing the campaign only  . So far it's a TPS fun and with lots of weapons and small mechas . The story follows the first game but this time you're not the principal character but just a faceless soldier . This game has been designed for co-op play , for 4 players but you can still play alone with bots following you but they're not very bright ( it's like in left for dead 2 for example) . So I suppose it would be funnier to play with friends .You have a score system with points and it gives you a grade A,B,C etc.... at the end of each mission ( following the Capcom tradition ) . And you win competence points that will allow you to customise your character look and his abilities and/or get better weapons in multiplayer mode.2.) After playing some time: this game is ok but only if you play in multiplayer This game works with Game For Windows Live and you need to have it installed to save your game etc.. in fact you have to install GFWL just to be able to start the game : if your game doesn't start go check in steamapps/common/lost planet 2 , and start the GFWL setup.exe  if you didn't have it installed yet .

												REPOST NOTE: After many tries and attempts at getting this game to work, it finally happened. It is definetely games for windows live that was causing the problems, it was the fact that some of the dll files were missing and by simply cleaning windows live essentials it had solved the problem. The game is once again great but is a pain if you are experiencing problems to get it to work. I do not hate this game in any way but GFWL just seems to mess most games up. I would reccomend getting this game, it just depends on your will to get it to work.			",64,11,0,11,1,0,2

												Another fantastic game, being dragged down by Games for Windows Live. Once you get around that, and the choppy keyboard/mouse controls, wonderful game. It has awesome levels as well as massive boss fights. My one complaint is that it over-uses the ""Shoot glowing orange body part"" thing. I prefer this game on PS3 or XBOX because of the rushed PC port, but even on PC I would highly recommend getting it.			",221,40,10,18,22,3,21

												This game is actually fantastic. The poor rating is hugely misleading and I'm unaware as to why. It's a solid 3rd person shooter. To be fair, if you're looking for any kind of game with depth, it's a Capcom game. Then again, if you're looking for a game with depth, why are you looking at a Capcom game? Voice acting is actually solid for a such a foreign game, and the plot line is interesting enough. The visuals are gloriously fantastic and not too demanding. Overall, great game, if you're considering, it's for the right reasons. Buy it, don't expect a Saving Private Ryan esque plot, and get ready for a fun pure shooter.			",151,8,3,15,13,0,48

												This game is amazing, I would fully recommend for anyone that loves big boss battles and third person shooters.  This does require Game For Windows Live (GFWL) which requires a bit of time to get to work if you're running windows 8.  If you're using Windows 10, do not purchase this game.  I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and can't play this game anymore.  I've looked at dozens of guides to get GFWL to work, but no success.			",147,22,4,10,12,1,6

												GFWL may not be supported, but the game still has online functionalities.Summary: One of the best co-op games out there. Even playing with complete strangers is a fun experience. Suffers noticably in single player though. Plus GFWL makes the game unplayable for some.+Levels consisting of Episodes, broken into chapters, which in turn are broken into missions (in which weapons carry over from one to another) lends itself extremely well to co-op play and play sessions of varying length.+Satisfying weapon feedback+Large variety of vehicles that all handle differently. Many of which have 'secret' moves+Huge variety of environments; making each mission feel different from the last.+Large variety of abilities and weapons adds replay value and variety in play-styles.+Eight key-bound emotes, along with a huge pool of usable ones (some being more communicative, others being silly) can make characters feel alive if used liberally+Gunplay is not twitchy, making the game more accessible to those not as good at aiming. Positioning and cover is important in combat as well.+Giant monster fights. A must for kaiju fans.~Hammy, B-movie story and characters~Movement system along with non-standard keybind locations (I highly reccomend you don't change the Grenade/Shoot binds) can take some getting used-to~World does not feel ""built for the player"", but rather ""built for the character"". Many environments feel claustrophobic due to the distant third-person camera. Eyesight is also important as enemies are not immediately distingiushable from the environment in some levels. But this also means that levels feel 'natural' despite their linearity.-RNG-based unlock system (although not as bad as you might think, because it works from a limited pool; once you get all the boring stuff like name-tags out the way, you can get weapons and abilities en-masse because they're all thats left)-Weak single-player experience.-Games For Windows Live, which gives many people trouble (I didn't have any, but there's many reports of it)			",184,42,5,23,5,2,21

												Aw man this game came so close to being really cool and fun, but it really trips up on some of the more intricate gameplay details. The controls are really weird, but servicable. Player movement is slow, but feels responsive. What really trips me up is how this game doesn't play to its' own strengths. The most fun things in this game are fighting monsters, and piloting mechs. But you really rarely get to do either of those in this game, and in some cases when you do, there are usually different elements that get in the way or change the gameplay temporarily. For instance, after a long campaign of shooting up other soldiers, you have to fight this giant monster along side a train, but you fight it by loading and firing a giant gun. Its tedious. I wanna jump and run around the monster and fight on its back and junk! Its just not very creative or fun doing the same process of loading the canon, charging the bullet, and waiting for an opening on the monsters weak point (especially without co op partners). There's also this really interesting tool called the anchor, which is basically a grappling hook, that's really fun in theory but not polished enough to be very useful. You can anchor and mount on some enemies (monsters, mechs) and stick grenades to them or shoot them point blank. Its super cool! But there's not enough of it! This game came so close to beeing a cooler/different monster hunter, but blunders because of its focus on human enemies.			",155,16,0,21,3,0,5

												Played this game on the xbox few years ago.  To this day, the game still holds up.  The graphics, gameplay, and fun-factor (whatever that means) is still holding up.  Graphics still looks very good to this day, the monsters(or Akrid) are still fun to fight.  Story is, like usual, very simple and weak, but very understandable.  Mechas are still awesome to use:  There are also new variants added to the game.  Even now, there are still things I could do that I didn't know.  For example you can Combine VS (the spider-tank thing and one of the standard VS, forgot the name) and that if your team-mates are carrying that giant laser cannon thing, you can combine them together like some power-ranger/super-sentai thing.  This game is obviously made for Co-op.  Before this game was released, I had some doubts on why they made this game Co-op focused, I can see why.  ITS F*CKING FUN!  gameplay has been revamped and they added a sprint or dash feature: very helpful since some of the maps are big.  Downside?  Not a lot of people playing.  Well there was the sale for Lost Planet franchise few days ago that brought in a lot of new players and some veterans back, but the population for the game is practically dead.  Campaign Online is alive though, thats the good thing.  Multiplayer is dead, don't bother with it. The game is still using GFWL (Don't really have much of a problem with it personally, but it was a pain trying to get the game to launch thanks to it).			",222,9,2,15,11,1,37

												Great game with lots of unlockables, lots of replay value. Levels are vast and varied, no levels are the same. Once you get used to the controls, the gameplay is very fluid (especially with a controller).It can be played solo, or with friends. Servers tend to be very low, but there's still some playing if you're searching for people to play with. Playbase is increasing thanks to recent fall and holiday sales.The optimization is really well done, no game breaking bugs or crashes ever.Only drawback for most people is getting past GFWL. (Check the guides section) Definitely check this out for $5!			",303,52,3,24,13,3,12

												This is probably the most fun Lost Planet game in the series, but it's made for co-op. If you play alone, you won't get the FULL enjoyment that you would playing online with other people. Which is a shame because the community is next to dead on PC. I hear on Xbox it's still alive in kicking, though.The story in this game is also, of course, sparse. For a co-op arcadey action-filled TPS it's really not big on story, but it's more for atmosphere. The other thing about Lost Planet 2 is there isn't enough ice and snow. There also isn't enough Akrid, you fight more humans than Akrid throughout the whole game. But if these things don't bother you (and they shouldn't), this game is more than worth the 20 bucks.PROS+FUN AS♥♥♥♥♥♥ OKAY+GRAPPLING HOOKS (deep platforming mechanics, believe it or not)+High Replayability+MECHS ARE ALWAYS COOL AS♥♥♥♥♥♥br>CONS-No DLC from the Console Release-No Boss Rush mode which was with DLC-GFWL doesn't have cross platform play so multiplayer population is 0 outside of Co-op-No Monster Hunter outfit as far as i know-Still uses GFWL and not SteamworksBut those are honestly not bad enough to detract from the whole experience. Heck, if you want to play VS mode there's always System Link/LAN tunnelling.BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME OKAY			",130,4,1,8,2,1,4

												WRITING FOR THE ONLINE USERS;i really, really enjoy this game. including the first LP.the story line is a bit confusing, however it was really enjoyable, and i would recommend it to most people!after figuring out the controls, i decided to take a try at online play.i couldn't find a single player too play CO-OP with. i thought it was my internet at first, but after looking into it, online isn't a big thing when it comes to LP2. kind of depressing, but i love it still!maybe if you are looking for a CO-OP player, we can play! just let me know!

												Aw man this game came so close to being really cool and fun, but it really trips up on some of the more intricate gameplay details. The controls are really weird, but servicable. Player movement is slow, but feels responsive. What really trips me up is how this game doesn't play to its' own strengths. The most fun things in this game are fighting monsters, and piloting mechs. But you really rarely get to do either of those in this game, and in some cases when you do, there are usually different elements that get in the way or change the gameplay temporarily. For instance, after a long campaign of shooting up other soldiers, you have to fight this giant monster along side a train, but you fight it by loading and firing a giant gun. Its tedious. I wanna jump and run around the monster and fight on its back and junk! Its just not very creative or fun doing the same process of loading the canon, charging the bullet, and waiting for an opening on the monsters weak point (especially without co op partners). There's also this really interesting tool called the anchor, which is basically a grappling hook, that's really fun in theory but not polished enough to be very useful. You can anchor and mount on some enemies (monsters, mechs) and stick grenades to them or shoot them point blank. Its super cool! But there's not enough of it! This game came so close to beeing a cooler/different monster hunter, but blunders because of its focus on human enemies.			",155,16,0,21,3,0,5

												This game is amazing, I would fully recommend for anyone that loves big boss battles and third person shooters.  This does require Game For Windows Live (GFWL) which requires a bit of time to get to work if you're running windows 8.  If you're using Windows 10, do not purchase this game.  I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and can't play this game anymore.  I've looked at dozens of guides to get GFWL to work, but no success.			",147,22,4,10,12,1,6

												GFWL may not be supported, but the game still has online functionalities.Summary: One of the best co-op games out there. Even playing with complete strangers is a fun experience. Suffers noticably in single player though. Plus GFWL makes the game unplayable for some.+Levels consisting of Episodes, broken into chapters, which in turn are broken into missions (in which weapons carry over from one to another) lends itself extremely well to co-op play and play sessions of varying length.+Satisfying weapon feedback+Large variety of vehicles that all handle differently. Many of which have 'secret' moves+Huge variety of environments; making each mission feel different from the last.+Large variety of abilities and weapons adds replay value and variety in play-styles.+Eight key-bound emotes, along with a huge pool of usable ones (some being more communicative, others being silly) can make characters feel alive if used liberally+Gunplay is not twitchy, making the game more accessible to those not as good at aiming. Positioning and cover is important in combat as well.+Giant monster fights. A must for kaiju fans.~Hammy, B-movie story and characters~Movement system along with non-standard keybind locations (I highly reccomend you don't change the Grenade/Shoot binds) can take some getting used-to~World does not feel ""built for the player"", but rather ""built for the character"". Many environments feel claustrophobic due to the distant third-person camera. Eyesight is also important as enemies are not immediately distingiushable from the environment in some levels. But this also means that levels feel 'natural' despite their linearity.-RNG-based unlock system (although not as bad as you might think, because it works from a limited pool; once you get all the boring stuff like name-tags out the way, you can get weapons and abilities en-masse because they're all thats left)-Weak single-player experience.-Games For Windows Live, which gives many people trouble (I didn't have any, but there's many reports of it)			",184,42,5,23,5,2,21

												You NEED this game. It's finally on sale? Now it's time for anyone who hasn't already bought it to get it. This is a great coop game. The story is complete, utter, garbage, but let's be honest here... You're not playing for the story, you're playing so you can beat the game and unlock the ability to dress up as a girl with 3 of your buddies and kill giant monsters. Yes, you have to deal with GfWL, but it's so worth it to put up with GfWL just to enjoy this one single game.There are QTEs sprinkled throughout the game, and failure can mean a hillarious death for yourself while your friends laugh about the mine collapsing on you. Everything is VERY Japanese and VERY over-the-top. I've played this with a buddies who have accidently activated the self-destruct sequence on their vehicles several times over as if they've forgotten it every time.The game looks fantastic, running off of Capcom's proprietary in-house engine MT Framework, the same engine they've been updating release after release. The akrid you fight in this game get so huge, it almost looks like you're playing Monster Hunter half the time. I mean the controls are so terrible that you might as well be playing Monster Hunter. The maps in the campaign have multiple exits which can lead to different spawn locations and areas in the follwoing maps where you can find weapons or vehicles that can give you an edge against an upcoming boss fight. The story makes absolutely no sense for the majority of the game because each episode tells a different faction's story until it all comes together in the final episode where everything finally makes sense (sort of), but before you tackle the final mission, you get to play as the Space Mexicans in easily the best and/or most frustrating missions. Those missions will be frustrating at first due to controls but you will get used to it after multiple playthroughs. Yes, this game is worth multiple playthroughs because you are buying this game to play with your friends and shoot giant monsters together. Do NOT buy this game if you intend to play with the AI only. As mentioned before, some levels are going to be frustrating and that frustration is multiplied by how many terrible AI partners you have to deal with. This game, at version 1.0 needed a patch so that AI deaths didn't count against your own death count, they are that bad. If you are stubborn enough to deal with the AI, or you've played through the game enough, you'll get used to it.Fantastic game. I bought it on 360 and PC. Shame the PC version doesn't get Marcus Fenix and Dom from Gears of War. Seeing Dom do the Here Kitty Kitty emote was worth the price of entry.			",590,171,25,91,55,5,71

												By far my favourite Xbox 360 title to date, right after Halo: Reach!Beautiful visuals, stunning enviroments and impressive boss fights, everything you'd expect from a game about giant machines powered by even bigger monster's blood. Take the fight to NEVEC, the Neo Venus Corporation, whose responisble for the rapid climate change on EDN III. They're planning to strip the world of its natual wildlife, the Akrid, and leave a dead world in their wake as they move on. Join the Snow Pirates, the Carpetbaggers, the Vagabundo's, the Ex-Nevec Rebels, and the Renegades as the fight for the only world you've known draws to its epic conlusion, only in Lost Planet 2!

												Great game with lots of unlockables, lots of replay value. Levels are vast and varied, no levels are the same. Once you get used to the controls, the gameplay is very fluid (especially with a controller).It can be played solo, or with friends. Servers tend to be very low, but there's still some playing if you're searching for people to play with. Playbase is increasing thanks to recent fall and holiday sales.The optimization is really well done, no game breaking bugs or crashes ever.Only drawback for most people is getting past GFWL. (Check the guides section) Definitely check this out for $5!			",303,52,3,24,13,3,12

												This game is actually fantastic. The poor rating is hugely misleading and I'm unaware as to why. It's a solid 3rd person shooter. To be fair, if you're looking for any kind of game with depth, it's a Capcom game. Then again, if you're looking for a game with depth, why are you looking at a Capcom game? Voice acting is actually solid for a such a foreign game, and the plot line is interesting enough. The visuals are gloriously fantastic and not too demanding. Overall, great game, if you're considering, it's for the right reasons. Buy it, don't expect a Saving Private Ryan esque plot, and get ready for a fun pure shooter.			",151,8,3,15,13,0,48

												DISCLAIMER:Do not buy this game if you are expecting a strong narrative, or story heavy campaign, or active multiplayer.However DO buy this game if you are looking for a great co-op game, with above average gameplay and variety in environments.Lost Planet 2 is a direct sequel to Lost Planet in that it takes place in the same planet, but does not follow the Wayne storyline.The game shows the effects of all the events which occurred in the previous Lost Planet, and takes its own spin on it, which introduces all the variety of environments in the game. The lush forests, infinite deserts, rocky shores and meteor filled locations in the game give the different story campaigns an identity. Different campaigns and locations bring a bit of fun with physics, namely some underwater and in outer space where your movement is altered due to lower gravity.Lost Planet 2 plays great on my PC, I run with an AMD 8350 processor with an HD 7950 GPU. I get constant 60 frames per second, which would be higer with Vsync disabled.Despite GFWL going down, the game does feature LAN connectivity for co-op and multiplayer, which can be emulated over the internet with programs like Evolve, so there is no reason to not go through the campaign after GFWL servers go down.

												Sequel to Lost Planet: Extreme Conditions. This one is more jungle, urban and half/half snowy lavaish world.Scrapping the earlier kind of SinglePlayer, brings in a more CO-OP centered kind of game. A lot different compared to the first, story is less out there and not as easy to get. All in all, a really good game, Mechs are still there, easier to control and use than in the first, a lot cooler than the first!Would recommend.			",193,16,4,34,7,0,19

												This game is a ton of fun! Don't let my small amount of hours on here sway you, I have over 500 hours on the Xbox 360. It's too bad this game is basically dead due to crybabies complaining about GFWL and how ""it's stupid"" or whatever. The co-op experience in this game is a unique thing. Some other games that allow co-op story (off the top of my head I can recall Halo, Dark Souls, Rainbow Six, Dead Rising) can be a fun playthrough, but the players most of the time have to make it fun. Almost as if forcing enjoyment out of it. With Lost Planet, that's a whole different story (no pun intended). The game itself is fast paced, exciting, and not too engaging so that it doesn't lose its arcadey feel to it. I mean seriously, what is not to love about this game? It's got mechs, giant monsters, over the top guns, character customization, and even using said custom character in the story (after beating it) so you know which character was actually yours in the cutscenes.To anyone who actually hasn't played this masterpiece, I seriously recommend it. There is a little something for everyone in this game. And you won't be disappointed!			",151,13,5,14,7,0,6

												Do you like throwing giant suns at a giant sand whale while riding a gigantic cannon with shells larger than you? Well then, this game is for you!While this might not have all of the polish you might expect of a good game nowadays, and it might control somewhat awkwardly in general, it's still a lot of fun. There's a surprising amount of diversity in the game, letting you have all sorts of different weapons ranging from energy blob guns to a gun that transforms into a heavy hitting sword, to a drill cannon, to a completely oversized chain gun that you can also mount on your choice of mechs strewn throughout levels. There are also plenty of things to unlock and customize, and tons of silly emotes to collect and be ridiculous with. You unlock weapons through a slot machine that you get credits for by playing missions and such. So, while I hear it's not the best rated game, it's still a hell of a lot of fun. Play it with friends.			",166,15,5,13,9,1,18

												Having played the first Lost Planet I was keen to see what improvments were made. Stop! This game uses GamesForWindowsLive. Another dumb♥♥♥♥♥piece of useless bloatware that you must install and sign up for just to play this.  This game has no carry over characters from LP1 & even less of a coherent story. No quirky or lovable characters - just bland unsympathetic ones - the ""protagonist/s"" are not particularly likable, nor do you care what happens to them. New modes and character customization are added this time around- and it needs more of them, otherwise same again. All game progress and customization is handled by GFWL so forget trying to back-up your savegame. Also to that point, the checkpoint system only saves progress if you can finish the chapter.  Dev gets some credit for including a training mode for multiplayer. Replay value: Good .....if you enjoy punishment.  Score:6/10			",39,4,1,0,7,0,1

Intnese in your face action with large numbers of eneies on screen. Huge explosions, awesom graphics (if your rig can handles it) Great slection of weapons with satisfyinh feel to them.

There are guides on the community page dedicated to helping those who experience difficulties, including setting up the game to start with (takes ~20mins).			",216,21,1,5,2,0,15

												Aside from the Windows Live (Xbox live actually) requirement, which is easy to get around once you search for it on google it's a pretty nice game, and definitely worth its price. It's also nice that there's still people out there playing it, or you could join up with friends in a 4 player 6 episode campaign of fighting Akrid and Snow Pirates (and Nevec).Could wait for a sale, but only if you prefer a discount.Only issue I have with it is that changing your selected model to the Femme Fatale doesn't change the voice in the cutscenes. So you'll have the standard voice in both single and multiplayer. Which is male. Just a small detail, nothing special.			",33,4,1,6,1,0,3
