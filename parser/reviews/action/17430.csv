												Where do I start with this...Need for Speed Undercover has been bashed, beaten & overall just despised by the entire Need for Speed community, often described as ""one of the absolute worst Need for Speed games ever made"". But, judging you see that giant blue thumbs up, you obviously can tell that I don't think that way.Now, those of you who really hate long reviews (because there's gonna be quite a lengthy one ahead), here's a short pros-n'-cons review to not waste your time:Pros:+Can run on a toaster+Great soundtrack+Huge car selection+Easy-to-follow story+Simple controls that are even very playable on a keyboard+Visuals are passable+Gameplay is rather funCons:-Story is inconsistent and highly forgettable-Visual glitches regarding the sky & the sun (sun flies from one part of the screen to the other while the sky spins in a nauseating fashion)-Horrible racer & cop AI-No ""Perfect Start"" (a prominent feature in Most Wanted, Carbon & World)-Steam Overlay (unfortunately) does not work with Undercover, due to EA not patching out the old, outdated Steam Overlay DLLs in the game's filesDo I recommend?If you just want a racing game where you could really care less for story & want one that can run on your toaster computer, then yes, NFS Undercover should fill that niche for you quite nicely & I recommend the game for the price it's asking.Now then, short review done. Let's get on with the long review!The Story & The Characters:I'm not gonna bother with a brief synopsis of the story, since that's what the store page basically tells you. But what I will give will be my thoughts on the story. So. I think the story in Undercover is garbage. It's very sloppily put together. Some characters come & go without a proper explanation, some characters are given NO INTRODUCTION and just sort of...appear, other characters for some reason or another just swap roles mid-story, eh, you get the point. I get that it's to be expected that a racing game will have a terrible story, but back when this game was announced & being promoted like the next best thing, it tried to take itself seriously, with all the trailers & promotional videos. So, yes, the story is trash, introduces characters & gets rid of characters periodically & tries to take itself way too seriously, which is why I don't like it & find it very forgettable. It shouldn't take you more than 10 hours to beat the entire story, I, for one, beat the single player campaign in around 8 hours & now am doing my second runthrough on the Steam version of this game, just for the sake of adding in more gameplay hours.The Visuals & Audio:Before I move on to the meat of the review, being the gameplay, I wanna briefly go over the game's visuals. They look...passable. Now, I've had the pleasure of experiencing this game both in 1080p Ultra Settings & 360p Very Low Settings, and generally - I am impressed with the framerate. The game (for the most part) is very consistent with the framerate on newer hardware & back when my good PC was still alive & played this game for the 8 hours it took to complete the single player campaign, the framerate was crazy-stable at 60 FPS, with sometimes dropping below when there were too many cops at once, which is understandable. As for the visuals themselves, everything in the game world, including the road you drive on & the water beyond the shores looks ""alright"" at best. Yes, Black Box has done MUCH better in terms of visuals in Carbon & even Most Wanted, but I don't think the game looks ugly by any means, but certainly doesn't live up to the 2008 year it came out on. And the audio? The car sounds are remarkably pleasant to listen to, giving off the feeling that the car you drive FEELS like an actual car and not a freaking go-kart. The soundtrack is picked rather well & there are a handful of songs I don't like, sure, I like most of the soundtrack.The Gameplay:And now, we move on to the meat of the review - the gameplay. Need for Speed Undercover's gameplay tries to emulate the critically-acclaimed gameplay of Most Wanted & Carbon while trying to introduce enough new things to stand on its own. First of all - the controls are great. Every car feels very responsive & turning even with the slowest of muscle cars while using a keyboard, not a controller or wheel, felt super reliable & the car showed no signs of delayed turns or any kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some racing games usually have, which is great, as great control is what makes the game great. There are, however, a few things I really don't like about the gameplay. Gone from Most Wanted & Carbon are perfect starts, which require to get your speedometer stick on a certain part of the actual speedometer when it changes color to give your car a bit of a necessary boost when you start, unless you want to drag on for about 30 seconds, trying to catch up to your opponents. Thankfully though, Undercover's AI is built around the lack of perfect start, so it's not like they'll speed up instantly, no, they'll generally start out at pretty much the same pace as you do. NFS Undercover has a multitude of game modes, with a few brand new game modes, never-before-seen in any previous Need for Speed game, or even any sub-sequent games - Jobs & Highway Battles. Briefly about the other game modes - they're standard fare what you'd find in other Need for Speed games - you got Circuit, Sprint, Checkpoint, Outrun (making a return from Underground 2) & Police Events. About those ""exclusive"" game modes, as it were. First - Jobs. Jobs are essentially your character stealing a car & then driving said car to a drop-off point, meanwhile cops are after your♥♥♥♥♥and your goal is to escape the cops & get to the drop off point. This game mode doesn't have a time limit of any sorts, so you can breathe in relief, however - some jobs do have damage meters, which are rather easy to deplete. Highway Battles are sort of glorified high-speed canyon events from Need for Speed Carbon, just with♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of traffic & only 1 stage. The goal in Highway Battle is to get ahead of your opponent & lead by 300 m (or 1000 ft if you're using the Imperial system) whilist trying to not wreck your car with the insane amounts of traffic around you. These 2 exclusive game modes are generally executed very well, with the opponent AI sometimes being crafty enough to try and block your path by purposefully pushing traffic cars into you & they take advantage of every opportunity to overtake you and make your day horrible, should you ♥♥♥♥ up midway in the race. Making a return from Need for Speed ProStreet is domination, but this time - instead of completing an entire area to ""dominate"", dominations are handed out if you can manage to beat the developer time for each race in the game, not counting Jobs. Early game, beating the developer ""domination"" time is quite easy, but later down the road - it gets more & more difficult. For Customization - if you've played ProStreet & seen that game's insanely expansive customization system, then Undercover will bring nothing new and you can jump straight in. But for the new guys? I'll throw it out there right now - customizing your car (other than its performance) does nothing and won't give you any benefits like in ProStreet. They're just there if you want your car to look nicer, but be warned - if you will ever decide to play online (which will happen only if you have someone who plays this game after 7 years), your vinyls that you apply to your car will not be shown. Why? Who the hell knows, but they disabled it. I haven't spent much time in the customization menu myself, so I really can't comment on anything here.Final Verdict & Score:Due to the Steam Review Character limit, the rest of this review is in screenshot format.[puu.sh] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.Recently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.Granted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.But, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).Overall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this review I will give you detailed information about the version differences between the Steam and Origin versions of Need for Speed™ Undercover.- First of all, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover isn't patched and doesn't have the so called ""Challenge Series"" (Origin version does include those!).- Secondly, the Steam version doesn't have lag spikes caused by additional DRM (SecuRom) because this DRM isn't present in the Steam version, but unfortunately it is present in the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover. To get rid of the annoying lag spikes, you have to apply a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0.1.18).- Moreover, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover doesn't support the ""Steam Community Overlay""… unless you add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (I know... funny). On the other hand, to be able to use the ""Steam Community Overlay"" while playing the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover, you also have to add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (note that ""Origin In-Game"" must be disabled so that the ""Steam Community Overlay"" would work when adding Need for Speed™ Undercover Origin version as a ""Non-Steam game"").Additional Notes: When adding the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover as a ""Non-Steam game"", you also have to use a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0) to get pass the error upon launching the game after you have added it as a ""Non-Steam game"".P.S.: Long story short, even though I own the game on both digital platforms (Steam and Origin), I still had to use ""custom"" game fixes to be able to enjoy ~ The Way It was Meant to be Played™ ~ this actually beautiful game!

												Great game! Graphics are amazing for the time it was made, and cars are much easier to get than NFS Carbon. I beat the game in less than 30 hours, and it was great every step of the way. The cutscenes are terrific, gameplay is amazing, everything is perfect. The car customization is one of the best I have ever seen! Would recommend. 10/10 Rating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Think of this game as the younger, try-hard brother of NFS: Most Wanted (2005).It's like MW, but this time...- Cops don't go airborne when you hit a roadblock- It has oversteer and understeer. And everywhere-steer.- The heat system no longer makes sense- Crashing into traffic still counts as a ""near miss"" (lol)- You can't get cars out of impound- It's got bad music- Physics are somewhat buggy when you do manage to get airborne- Multiplayer servers are completely shut down... however...+ Feels like it's directed by Michael Bay + Cool graphics!+ Visible damage+ Well-paced story+ Not just racing; attempt to ""take down"" (bust) racer criminals+ Extensive list of ""modern"" cars (more or less)+ Minimal menu-stuffing-aroundCool game you can knock off in a short amount of time. Doesn't quite retain the feel of the edgy Most Wanted vibe, but it has its replay value. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the obvious issues with the game, such as sun glaring into tunnels through the walls and into your eyes, the skyboxes randomly spinning around you, and heavy police SUVs easily outrunning a Veyron, it is a fun game.It's fun, but a bit too easy at times. Almost depressingly easy. So easy, you'd want to keep a lower-leveled car around just to give yourself a challenge.No, seriously. Except for one time some dude in a Dodge Viper challenged me to a 1-on-1 race, I still outran him in a 1969 Camaro. Sure, it took me 20+ tries, but I did it.And finally, children: Don't be afraid to alt+F4 the game if you're about to get arrested and you know you wouldn't be able to afford the impound retrieval costs. It's easier to spend a minute loading the game back up than it is getting enough money to get another car.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally enjoyed all that Need for Speed hasto offer over the many years, but this one is one of my all time loves next to of course the Most Wanted-NfS. You are a cop undercover and must be bad to get trusted and so on, but you dont do no boring bad guy stalking stuff, all you really have to do is simply race and run from cops, the game's campain will indeed follow you on its own. Only single downside i didnt like was that there was no acheivments, other then that its near perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most underrated series of nfs.It has lot of cutscenes, and nice storyline to follow on.Only two problem makes this game underrated than it has to be. First problem is the ridiculous difficulty on some races such as I need to beat SLR Mclaren with EVO. But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car.The biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car.But overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE.See what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars. No more storyline, unique tune ups, and thrills which really suck.간만에 해보는데 뽀샤시한 그래픽, 스토리라인이 좋음 최고의 혹평을 받았던 게임인데 거기서 알수 있듯 굉장한 개적화와 썩은 물리엔진을 보여준다썩은 물리엔진이 혈압을 오르게하지만 기본적으로 뽀샤시한 느낌과 오픈월드가 좋아서  할만은 하다.

												This game might be underrated, but it's one of the best NFS games I've ever played in my opinion. My only complaint is that I can't use a controller, like I can with the other NFS games on Steam.

The story mode is just what you need it to be,crazy chases, wrecks or just good old racing with long tracks spanning miles on end.

Posted: December 16, 2013
												I bought this game for around 5 bucks and after finishing it I'm not completely, but very disappointed so I give this game a thumb down. Main reason for this: This game has NO replayability and you probably won't even bother to finish it. Reasons see below.First of all: The races and missions are always depending on luck, I guess. Some races / missions are ridiculously easy, some are nearly unbeatable. Sometimes you flee from the police and you're completing the mission in under a minute and the next day you're failing at a similar mission even after ten tries. Especially the high way battles (where you have to stay ahead for x seconds or lead at least for x meters) are unfair beyond belief. Sometimes I thought a race against light itself would be easier.Mission vary from 'Sprint', 'Curcuits', 'Getaways', 'Cop takeouts', 'Causing costs to state' (boring as hell, since you only gain XP, and no money at all) and some missions, where you always have to get away or take out some other drivers.The ""Speed braker"" adds a great deal of fun to it. Which brings me to the fact that, when you hit the wall, you will ALWAYS end up being either stuck exactly when not more than 90° to the wall or completely reserved when you try to accelerate / manouver your way out. After so many hours and races it happened constantly, so I'm sure the makers thought: ""Well, the game is already unfair hard, what else can we do to frustrate a gamer? How about your car gets stuck or completely reserved after hitting a wall in a tiny bend?""And of course, like in every single racing game: ALL other racers are in one place. Meaning when you're at 1st place and you make just a tiny mistake ALL other racers will overtake you and you're last. And believe me, the other racers in the later races are getting REALLY hard and unfair, like hitting your tail and stuff. And guess what? You always have to be 1st, or you won't get any reward. Why didn't they thought of a 2nd or 3rd place, with at least a part of the money to show some appreciation of the time I spent on that race?I also missed an ""Test drive car"" - option before purchasing a car. Wasting a fortune for the Bugatti Veyron (which accelerates like a rocket and steeres harder than a tank with a house on top of it) is kinda disappointing. Oh and don't expect ANY reward for finishing the game, like all cars, bling bling money, a special car, gimmick, anything else etc - you're not getting anything, except closing credits.The tuning system is easy to use and minimalistic, except where you can buy a paint job. Worst. Interface. Ever, if you use a controller. I even had to use keyboard plus controller to do a paint job. Well done, makers, really. Are you satisfied with all the drugs you take?The game gets harder and harder, but not in a challenging, but an ultra-unfair way which will drive you (no pun intended) effin insane. I played half of the game with the first Muscle Car I got via a Pink Slip, until I could afford an Audi Quattro TT. This went good for a while. After I bought the Zonda from Tier 1 I had absolutely NO chance in a race, because I hadn't enough money to buy also both Power and Handling - ""Ultimate"" packs for my car, which all of the other cars obviously had. Frustrating, because I had to go back to my already maxed out Audi and finish a dozen races under my current league until I could afford the upgrades.I also tried to cheat because I nearly smashed my controller through my LCD into the wall. Cheats are absolutely, f-word ridiculous. There is a cheat for 10.000 credits. Nice, eh, typing it in a thousand times and go shopping big time, eh? Nope. It's, like all cheats, a disposable cheat, meaning you only can use it ONCE. Like the game itself. Disposable. So in a game where cars cost about 300.000 credits and not to mention tuning and upgrade packages where you could buy a whole city, 10.000 credits as a disposable cheat ain't just quite cutting the deal. Where they drunk when they made those game plus cheats? No, they were obviously thinking about letting another good franchise going down the drain big time.Oh, and by the way. How can you tell you're playing NFS? After you've reached your maximum speed of ~350km/h, you're gonna be overtaken. By a flying police jeep of two-and-a-half tons. And all other enemies. Speed's just a number, after all, eh?So the longtime-fun is found somewhere else, this game has absolutely no value left after a few races or about maybe ten hours. I now own the Zonda with all upgrades and the races got too hard. Just a single minor mistake or getting hit by another driver (who drive like they're in effin Carmageddon) and you can restart all over. I mean, I'm not a pro gamer, either I'm bad at it, I just want a racing game to be fun, race now and then a few circuits, have fun. And not be frustrated more and more AFTER I have the best equipment in the game and finished it already.Further you get stuck later in the game. I finished the game. Now I own the Paganini Zonda, a Lamborghini Gallardo, an Audi Quattro TT, a Porsche GT2 and a few pink slips from other cars (which can't be sold, just be removed. Sense, please?). The latter missions will earn you 25.000 to 35.000 credits and you will spend it all on cars, upgrades, paint jobs and aftermarket stuff (like spoilers etc). But then, after maybe four, five fully upgraded cars there's no races left (only old ones, which will earn you peanuts of 2.000 credits each or so), but there are still so many cars and upgrades left to try and buy. So when all the missions and races are won, you're gonna be stuck with your five good, maxed out cars. And you will have to start a new game to drive all the other cars. Where are the good old times, when finishing a racing game unlocked the complete car list? I'm not willing to start five new games just to see, drive and have all cars in the game. Here are also some other thoughts:Menues: The menu is very well sorted, tidied up and everything is easy to use, even with a controller. Great! That's how you do it. Bravo.Intros: Couldn't care less about these annoying things and they are not skipable. Cutscenes are skipable, after you've played the mission once.Graphics: Graphics are not important in a game. NFS:U is acceptable, there are games with better and worse graphics. For me (I own an older pc) they were just fine and, like said, of no importance.Story: I couldn't care less about a story in a racing game. I mean, what's the big deal? Car, this is player, player, this is your car. Take the controller, hit the buttons, wipe the floor with your enemies and have fun. Early in the game I muted the volume of ""Voice"" in the menu to 0, because in one mission I had to chase someone and every two seconds a voice said ""Catch on"" or ""Go faster!"", like this wasn't the thing I was doing. Good thing after muting: All cut scenes were muted. So I didn't know what the story was all about but from what I saw the story was more boring, mediocre, filled with not B- but C- and D-movie actors.Overall: For a small price like five to ten bucks it's a great, action packed game to play now and then which will serve a few hours of fun until you experience the things I mentioned in my review.

												Standard NFS game. If you like this series before, you will like this as well. The stroy is a bit predictable, but it's OK. The game area is pretty big and varied, with a lot of life. I loved the county highway pursuits. Perfect casual racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a NFS game. It's still in the classic vein of games, like the 2005 MW and Carbon and such.The story, as always, is pretty garbage.The cars, as always, look nice.The cutscenes have sexy cars and bangable women, as always.The graphics are shiny, but ugly when you look at it close up, as always.The performance is decent to good in most cases, as always.The controls are responsive and driving feels good, as always.The customization is extensive for the visual aspects and utter linearly progressing dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ as always.The only real new feature is the gradual performance increase you get when completing events. Things like +2% to engines or +20% zone income. Slight things, but they make you feel like you're progressing.It's the standard NFS experience, you know what you're getting into.It's worth it to everyone during a sale. Without one, I'd only suggest this to the most hardcore of NFS fans.Overall, it's a solid 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very underrated NFS game.  Obviously, it's quite aged, but it is still fun and runs fine on modern hardware, Windows 10, and a Xbox One controller.  The story is cliche, but it's a decent excuse for the racing.  I found the drag race events in traffic completely awesome, and the copper ones are fun.  There's a boatload of rides that are still sexy and fun to upgrade 9 years later.  The driver skill system gives you a little incentive to do all the events too.  On the negative side, the Steam overlay doesn't work, the non-car graphics were subpar even for 2008, and the AI isn't great.  If you're an arcade racer fan, this is still a lot of fun and a worthy addition to your collection.  It may not be Most Wanted, Burnout, or Underground, but it's still a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a bit old, but it is still fun to play. Good simple graphics, not really a high graphic game, but it still alright. This game does not demand a high system requirement to run. In this Need for Speed game you play as an undercover cop, trying to bust an illegal shipment. Feel what it is like to go undercover. You take on mission after mission, such as races, highway battles, and cop takedowns. Using the cash you have aquired through events you can buy new cars and upgrade them. This game does have online multiplayer, that is if you can find someone online or if you have a friend who can play with you online. Would recommend this game to others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Today,I am going to write a review about one of the most underrated games ever, about  NFS Undercover.	 Story +++	Need for Speed Undercover story is inspired or based at film ""The Transporter"" (original in french - Le Transporteur). However it sounds weird, it is really similar to the film. It fits very well and it gives game ""the right action"". Gameplay -	Step by step.  Driving model is one of the worst in the entire NFS history, but it is easy to learn it. Also there are more cars then in previous NFS games, more newer and faster cars (f.e. - McLaren, Bugatti and Pagani Zonda). Map is really big - there are 3 towns - Capital City, Western Town (or Town of Desert) and Suburb (or sth like that). About the city traffic... well the cars are like meteors - appears in middle of nowhere.  Graphics -	Graphics are really okay for the year 2008, however the car crash model is worse then in Need for Speed Most Wanted (2005). It feels more paper, the police cars cant get dmg that is seenable. Car design is pretty good, but not as good as in Most Wanted. And the biggest problem? The EA company absolutely doesnt give a f*ck about the dead parts. Like sometimes you can run through cars, objects or even spikes and it doesnt do anything.  Other +	+ working multiplayer+ cheap game (at♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)+ worth play again&again- low community (not many people) THE VERDICT	Need for Speed Undercover is great game with lovely story, but with lot of graphics/gameplay problems. Its still with working multiplayer and it is really easy to get it cheap, so definitely I recommend this game.  67%	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your ""handler"", Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your ""boss"" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city. While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game. All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and ""The Run"" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It has plot and this is what I like in NFS games.Also it has sensitive control if compare with latest NFS games.One thing you should know - you should follow story and complete story tasks first.If you will finish all available tasks and after that will follow the story you will have to repeat races and tasks you have finished again.

												There's a good bit of variety and a fair story to go along withe driving, even if it is a bit short.

												----DONT BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTI ONLY----i will be using nfs most wanted 2005 and nfs carbon as reference to review undercover (a lot) and thanks to my friend i played it again and this time i finished it .-so first of all if you already played nfs mw 2005 or carbon you'll understand how this game work very fast , the plot is not the best in the world but kinda entertaining , you play as undercover cop trying to take down car thieves and smugglers ,plot twist here and there ( real actors just like in MW 2005 and carbon) you can get 15h if you play only the main compagne.-big well detailed city to play and explore but it feels so lifeless , you just drive with no purpose except the races .-graphicly is much better then MW and carbon cause they didnt port this one from the ps2 version like they did with carbon (8 years and still looking good ) and dont try the hd texture pack on the steam version it wont work-voice acting is really good just like in the previous nfs games , perfect sound effect , but shity soundtracks ( the worst soundtrack in a nfs game yet )-gameplay is smouth and 2 new type race, Highway Battle (my fav) and stealing cars .but sadly no steam fetures like steam chat in game and screenshot .-the multiplayer was dead 5 years ago (EA shut down the servers since 2011) so if you want to buy this game just for the multi dont do it )i recommend this game to gamers that want some nostalgia cause it feels just like MW2005 but with updates7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish there was a ""Maybe"" option when it comes to recommending games, because it would be very useful right now.Short Version:If you've played Most Wanted (the 2005 one, not the utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥remake) like me; you'll probably not enjoy this game that much.If you haven't played MW; You'll most likely enjoy the game.More In-Depth:Story: Honestly, not really gonna care about story, since this a NFS game. Nobody has really cared about the story in racing games. So let's just skip to the most important part.Gameplay: Basically, this where the comparisons to MW come from. The controls are nice to drive, even with a keyboard, but compared to MW, it feels wonky almost. Especially the Speedbreaker, in MW, SB is very smooth when used and glides in and out. In UC though, it feels like the whole game just stops instantly with no flow. One thing this game DOES have over MW is the drifting. Drifting feels very fluid and nice to pull off. When it comes to speed, you feel fast, but, of course, compared to MW, it feels sluggish.UI: Ok, this is the first complaint with the game that isn't because of MW. The UI with a keyboard is just an♥♥♥♥♥to use. It feels very awkward and frustrating to try and flick through the menus.Cars: Another(and probably the last) thing UC has over MW is the cars. UC comes with an assload of cars with this kind of racing game. Ranging from muscle cars to exotics to tuners, this game has almost it all.Again I'll say it once and I'll say it again, If you've played MW, stay away, if not, go ahead, it's only $10.

												OK, here we go!First of all - STORY. Well, it is an excuse for racing. I am not going to go into details of it but in a nuttshell it is just as this-cutscene: ""Hey you! This and that happened, you have to race in order to bla bla!"" Like all the other games of this type you can not expect it to have some great story. What I am impressed by is the live action cutscenes. Maggie Q and the bunch are actually making an effort here. Don't get me wrong it is not like movie level acting but it is not like those in Most Wanted (the original one) where the acting was so bad that I cringed while watching. The Carbon actors did a good job on that game but here they took it to another level. And, c'mon, who doesn't like to see some of Maggie Q's boobs and legs (bit of Maggie Q bias here). OK, moving on! Gameplay! Oh, man! I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Here is where I got dissapointed big time. But I am getting ahead of myself. First of all- car list, one word-AWESOME! You get American, European and Japanese cars stacked in these cathegories and each contains the best of the chategory. The list is big, I wont get into all the cars. You can look them up on-line. They handle OK but I can not shake the feeling that the cars have no mass to them. It feels like I'm driving an RC car. The movements are cartoonish and sometimes I get the fieeling that I'm playing Mario Cart. There is none of that speed feeling that I used to get in Underground 2 or in Most wanted. NPC cars are a whole other story, they are able of quantum leap, turning 90° while going 250 kph and the worst driver in the race suddenly becomes awesome and just wizzes by you when you are just about to win. Police chases play a role in the game but not all that much. These bring their own set of surprises like Police SUVs that take on and subdue a Bugatti Veyron doing 350+ kph on a highway like it was nothing. Sometimes I got the feeling that I was playing a demolition derby rather than racing with them raming me like crazy. The one thing that made me angry the most were bugs. And there are a lot of them in the sence that it is a marketed product that somebody made money off. Invisible walls that my car ran into, jumping off in the air in the middle of the road from some kind of an invisible ramp and the grand daddy of them all-on the last mission my car fell through the texture and fell into nothingnes. This is where i went crazy. This game is a product like any other that was marketed as a functioning one. It chrashed on me a couple of times  (I have no idea why) but when my carr did the falling down into oblivion that was it for me. I would understand that if the copy of a game was....well... obtained as a leaked product. But I payed money for it and I expect it to work properly. In the end it feels like it is a rush job. I really want to meet the guy/gal who signed off the product as a good one so I can have some words with them about false advertizing. On the plus side the game runs on a toaster so you don't have to worry about your computer being too old and weak. You should always check the system requierments before purchasing but if you bought your machine in the last 5-8 years you should be good. The last but not hte least-car customizing engine is great and specially for the visual part. Performance has the standard kind of bussiness but they really made an effort in order to give you some really good options for making your ride stand out. The world looks good. It feels like your are racing in a big city but I could not help but feel that it is a huge construction site. So many construction cranes!!!! One other thing I noticed (in the start of the game, later is lost track) that you are racing a couple of same racers, wich makes sense. In the previos games I had the feeling that the town I was racing in had like half a milion residents and every school kid and nursing home grandpa, mom and dad, dog, cat were racing. Soundtrack- As a huge music fan (bigger than gaming) I must say that the track list is good and I discovered ome good bands while playing the game. Dear reader! I am not a serious gamer. So this review should not influence your decision of buying the product. By all means take a look at other reviews - there are some good ones by more expirienced gamers. My conclusion: Do I recommend the game......well....I have no idea. As I'm writing this sentence I am trying to figure out if I'll give it a thumbs up or down. There are good features of the game but I feel like they are outweight by the bad ones. If you are someone who is a casual gamer like me you might enjoy the game. But if you are a serious gamer with developed taste in games then I would not recommend it. Personally....I'll keep it installed for some more of the time so i can customize rides. :-D I think I'm giving it a thumbs down. Sorry EA!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I replayed this after some years passed, and as an avid NFS-Fan of the older titles, I wrote this review.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» The open world, while boring looking, has many alternative paths and offroad-streets.» Good choice of cars (although I wish there were more older japanese vehicles).» Great modification (visual upgrades are on the same level as NFS:Pro Street).» Gameplay is very similar to the likes of NFS:Most Wanted and NFS:Carbon.Bad:» Horrible driving physics: Cars feel washy and oversteer at the same time, it's just weird.» Crashing into cops isn't as exciting as in Carbon/Most Wanted.» The in-game camera feels off (it sways weirdly).» Open world looks boring and uninspired.» Generic cutscenes.» Braindead Cop-AI.Misc:Settings:The game comes with a lot of settings. World details, car details and so on can be changed. However, the game does not support high resolutions such as 4K. The game has an immense amount of bloom, which can be turned off, but the game just looks ugly without it. I would also recommend turning on Vsync, as menus with sliders can glitch out on fast systems.Performance:Pretty good FPS on a modern system. Slight stutters.Summary:If some of the issues didn't exist (especially the driving-physics problem), it could've been a great game. I can only hope for some mod to fix this game in the future. But until then, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, even if you happen to get it for free.I returned my copy.Hey EA you money-bag, wanna make some easy dollar? How about putting up the older NFS titles for sale? I'd buy 'em. kthxbye ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Need For Speed Undercover. Intended to be a true successor to Most Wanted (The 2005 version...not Burnout Paradise 2), this game has received its fair share of hate and throughout all of these years, i never understood why to be perfectly honest. After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way. But again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?Well. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.Anywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad♥♥♥♥♥ The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.This might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.Now for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the ""Master Races"" which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your♥♥♥♥♥like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.In the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.

												This got    quite a lot of bad press, but  for me it was one of my favorite Need for Speed titles   because of it's open wold like  feel.  It was  quite similar to the first Test Drive unlimited, tohugh with slightly better graphics in that you could wander aroun the   large area covering  several smalll towns  and  pick up missions as and when you felt like it.  It's well worth picking up  when Steam have one of their sales.  you'll probably get it  for  a few pounds.  It doesn't have race tracks, basically  this is a road racer unlike the   next two titles in the seris.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun, definitely. You can follow the (admittedly somewhat cheesy) storyline or just drive for fun. The cars handle well, you have to adapt to each one's unique characteristics, and there's a real satisfaction in getting away from a large pack chasing you across the large region.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In 6 easy steps I can show you what the steering and cornering is like in this game 1: Get very drunk. This will account for the extreme motion blur within NFS Undercover2: Find or construct a table fit fit for a banquet 3: Get 1kg of cheese - the sliced pieces. Lay these out on the table leaving no spaces4: Get 1L of Mountain Dew and pour this all over your beloved cheese5: Now jump up onto the table6: Start surfing across the table (whilst dabbing furiously if you generally use manual controls - this represents gearbox in game) Enjoy !

Posted: February 24, 2015
												This game is... more enjoyable than NFS:MW 2012, which I spent like $60 when it came out because of the MW name, and I hate it so much.Undercover is a game that gives you a feeling that they rushed too hard during development, so it lacks testing, refinement, and thoughts. It carries quite a few promises, but is very disappointing.Pros:1. Fast-paced action easily makes one EXCITED!2. A good collection of cars.3. A nice world to roam about.4. Cut-scenes are quite well made.5. Chances are that you buy this game when it's on sale, very cheap.Cons:1. Physics is ridiculous, when crash happens, all cars seem to have infinite mass. Mario Kart has better physics and makes more sense. NFS is not famous for physics accuracy, but this game is way too off-scale.2. If you drive manual, you will easily feel that the cars' torque-rev relationship is pretty ridiculous.3. Brake is so ridiculously powerful, and the car has ridiculous amount of grip.4. They hired Maggie Q and others to make nice movies, so it seems that they focused on SP. However AI is ridiculous. Anything controlled by AI just makes no sense.5. AI racers seem to be ""given"" speed and accleration. Sometimes I can have 200 feet in the lead and I am faster round the last corner, but the second car just acclerates ridiculously and robs my first place. It feels that those cars do not have actual drivers in them.6. Roaming traffic cars are quite amazing, not only AI racers ram you like crazy, those roaming traffic cars also ram into you for no reason at all.7. There's almost no balance between cars and missions. You can win by miles using Lotus Elise against some really slow Volkswagen, and at some other locatons you will face Audi R8, Gallardo, and many other cars that are way faster. BTW Lotus Elise is extremely overpowered.8. I can't believe how bad the cops are. They seem to give up chasing you as long as you are 100 inches ahead of them. Sometimes it can be extremely hard to complete missions like cost-to-state challenge, because the cops do not chase you at all, even you are at heat level 5.9. You can easily use the TAB key to fast travel to just jump right to the next race, so although there's a huge amazing open world, chances are that you don't even roam about at all.10. Graphics are okay for a game this old, and it uses similar color scheme as the original NFS:MW. However it looks a lot less attractive than NFS:MW for some reason.11. Road surface is modeled quite badly. Different road surface (asphalt, grass, dirt, etc) feels quite similar, and the only difference seems to be the smoothness.12. Its compatibility with controllers has lots of problems. If I have my keyboard, XBOX360 controller, and my Logitech G27 all connected at the same time, the car will keep steering to the right, and the menu cursor keeps going down.13. The cars' performace has little to do with their real-life version.Conclusion:If this game is on sale, and if you want some excitment road racing, and if you are not good at braking in racing games, pick this up. It can make you blood boil (Rush-time High Way Battle is the best mode in this game IMO), and it does not require too much skill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was actually pretty fun, despite how everyone says it isn't as good, it is still a great game to play, racing in it just feels pretty fun. My Carrera GT looks pretty awesome as well. The soundtrack was pretty good as well, just great racing game music, you know. I just wish there was more races because I dominated all of them, so the game is kinda short. The story is kinda boring, but I just ignored it and raced more. And the map is pretty big, takes you quite a while to explore all of it. The only thing that annoyed me is that the police can impound your car, I had to buy another Carrera GT because of that. So just don't get arrested and you should be good. lol. It is pretty easy to race once you've gotten a fully upgraded tier one car. Also the tier system is reversed compared to carbon, 1 is fastest and 4 is slowest, so don't get confused. So basically, its fun to race in, easy after you get a tier 1 car fully upgraded, avoid getting arrested as you only have 3 strikes, and the map is pretty big. Cool, if you buy it, maybe you can message me, we can race sometime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The NFS Undercover, in my opinion, is one of the darkest parts of NFS series. It isn't popular for multiple reasons, but that doesn't mean that this game doesn't have any strong sides.Advantages:+Good story - you are playing a cop working undercover. Your mission - find out who is responsible for stealing the cars from the port. Your tactic - infiltrating. You are not good or bad, you can't get help, you are on your own.+Variety of cars - 80 of them, separated in 4 classes+Customisation - make your car look cool by using lots of kits (5 actually), rims, spoilers, exhaust, paint types and decals+Atmosphere - the game has an atmosphere of Most wanted+Big, bright and nice world+Tracklist - 55 great tracks?Graphics - it is...O.K.Disadvantages:-Gameplay & Physics - cars feel very heavy, they have an INSANE grip and brake power. If you expect this game to be realistic, you will be very disappointed. It's not even arcade, it's something worse. And that's the main reason why people hate this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game! Good storyline, good sound good game.Despite when it crashes (Windows 7 + dual screen)The graphics can be set kinda high, but the graphics mod is better. The mod includes Higher detail reflections, hd tires smoke,  hd landcsaping and road. The cars alltogether are amazing! Wide selection of cars, colour wise not to sure about that the red looks like pink! but all the other colours are fine! Races are realy good the fact that the traffic is still there when you are racing is very realistic, cop simulation is kinda dodgy though they say the wrong things all the time, like 'suspect is driving a pink car' acually red!

												Honestly... when I first played this game, I had a great time. Usually I don't enjoy playings games without friends, but this one kept me busy for hours on end. The racing controls, even for a keyboard, are amazing. Most racing games on a PC with keyboard and mouse are frustrating, but this one is satisfying. It's not some Triple A game, and it shouldn't be compared with those sorts of games. It does what it does very well. A lot of people say the story is bad, but the story really isn't all that important in this game. It's about racing, and I feel like the story is just there to give you a reason to be racing. I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for time to kill. It's no masterpiece, but it can be a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												dull &boring but enjoyable car racing game. predictable plot, not a whole lot that's original, races are very easy 2win on the 1st try. cops don't do much other than bang on your car and yell at you, and after a while they sort of fade away on their own. the game lets you instantly jump to the closest race, which i think provides a good incentive to make it through race after race.

Posted: May 12, 2016
												I purchased this game with the expectation it would be similar to need for speed most wanted - Buy a car, Buy upgrade parts, Evade the police, win races, progress the story - that is pretty much what I got.The reviews here on steam complain about how the car handles & the motion blur effect. The easist way to solve the car handling problem is to use a controller - some computer games are better suited to a controller while others are better suited to the standard keyboard & mouse. A controller makes it easer to adapt to the way the cars handle.As for the motion blur - I got used to it fairly quickly. According to google the game was released on November 18, 2008 - which makes it approximately 6 years old as I type this - and If I not mistaken motion blur was a 'feature' of older games used to make thinks look faster. This is speaking from prior experience, from recent memory I have beaten both need for speed most wanted & need for speed carbon (@#$% the final race in carbon) and they had a similar effect when using nitros.The biggest issue I had with the graphics - I was playing with everything as high as it would go, with the exception of using 1920x1080 due to my screen - and found the lense flair / sun glare to be near blinding. Honestly, more of an annoyance thean anything.I did also find the music tracks to be somewhat repeative, though I was to lazy to figure out how to turn it off. Something in the options menu I would expect.I didn't bother with multiplayer, I think the servers were taken down a while ago and I have no idea if this has any other types of multiplayer avalible.On the subject of the games difficulty - I found the artificial intelligence of the racers to be reasonable, difficult to beat if you are driving an underpowered car and / or didn't understand that you need to turn corners and avoid traffic to win. Yhe police artificial intelligence works well enough, through its nowhere near as effective as what was in need for speed most wanted, and they seemed to be able to keep up with me and even pass me despite driving waht appears to be lower tier cars - I'm guessing thats to give a fighting chane against a human player.TL;DRValue: DecentGraphics: DecentAudio: DecentMultiplayer: Maybe DeadDifficulty: Easy to Medium			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like no other need for speed it changes the gameplay, style and, somtimes even pace. Here are some pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great Gameplay.-Good Graphics that have aged pretty good.-A nice car selection.-A fair storyline.Cons:-AI doesnt feel like it is trying in most races or pursuits but some missions can be very challenging.-The Story feels very short (but is an ok story overall).-a lot of races feel recylced.-There is not to much replayabilty in this game .Other Thoughts-The games soundtrack is ok but not quite as good as some other need for speed games.-There is a fair amount of cusomization in this game with the inclusion of AutoSculpt from Need For Speed Carbon however there is not neon or any trunk audio and fine (Mostly unimportant) customization like in Underground and Underground 2.-There is not a strong modding comunitiy like there is for games like high stakes so dont expect to many (If any) overhauls for this game however there is always a some car addons out there.This game has alot of personality to it, however may that be from the random (and sometimes comical) Police radio chatter or even just some cheesy cutscenes or music choices which add some real charecter to the game. In conclusion I think this game is about a 9/10 there is definitely ways this game could have been better but overall its a solid game and for the price you can't really go wrong. If you are on the fence about it I would recomend waiting for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im going to start off by saying yes it is an old need for speed game but it's graphics are good even stannding up today and it makes me keep playing the game but lets get to the gameplayThe gameplay can be slow at times but the game makes up for it through all the type off things/races you can do. You could go from going to escaping the cops to a highway battle to making your car better and it goes on and on. The cars are even cool to look at even when not fully customized the graphics on high makes everything better.The graphics are amazing. I know the last good new graphic was advanced warfare on the ps4 but graphics cant make up for gameplay but the graphics here are good even to me. Say you played advanced warfare then played this game on all high and you would say wow because it stands out for a racing game which is amazing but if your thinking to buy this for $5.00 do it. It's worth it in the long run			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it may not be one of the more memorable NFS games, Undercover has a strange charm of its own. Making use of it's free roam feature, Undercover allows players to race, evade cops and set lap times on various points on the map. The various amounts of events may seem entertaining at first but loses it's appeal quickly. The races are dull and it becomes very easy to have a significant lead over the other racers. The color palette is obsolutely atrocious. Everything is painted in a dull brown which makes every corner and straight seem the same. There is a story component but it's easily forgettable unless you're a fan of Maggie Q. My advice would be to avoid this game and look elsewhere for a memorable NFS experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game - can't be said as NFS Most Wanted's successor (The arcadey drivign is still there but unfortunately the physics is more realistic now), but it is very close. The visuals are amazing and the graphics have transitioned from being really cartoony to realistic and slick. There is miles and miles of road for you to race (or explore) on. Really nice, but could have been better. A definite buy though if on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the price of the game, $9.99 as of 1/12/2014 it is a fun driving game, not heavy in the modding of the cars or adjustments, it is just a fun Need For Speed racing/out running the cops game. The graphics are pretty good for the age of the game and the car graphics are really nice. The car selection is enjoyable and the boards give you plenty to do...as I said before for what it cost its worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great racing game! Does the need for speed series justice. Great vehicles and graphics are nice. Great selections of vehlicles and customizations. The storyline is pretty good but can be pretty boring at times kinda a storyline you would expect out of a need for speed game very similar to others. I would give it a 7/10 rating a good racing game for the racing game lovers out there a must buy for them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool to be able to go back and play this game, i remember playing it on my PS2 with one of my mates, the pc version is a bit buggy, but im sure the PS2 version had the same problems. Honestly can't remember since i was around 9 when i played it on the ps2, but whatever, doesn't matter. If you haven't played this game before i probably wouldn't recommend it to you since it's made in 2008 and isn't really living up to what games should be nowadays. But if you originally played this game when it came out, then i would definently recommend you it for the nostalgia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, an enjoyable game.Not a true NFS game, though.But an enjoyable one.Almost all races are unbelievably easy - I completed the game about 23 hours in. One race I was dragged sideways, giving the leader a 15 second lead and 40% left on the course, and I still caught up. The storyline is probably acceptable, although those cutscenes did have an air of that slightly high-end porn that you occasionally find when you dig deep enough. Fair amount of cars, with a decent range of classic American muscles, although the way to the Mazda MX7 and Lotus Elise. As a rule of thumb when buying cars, get ones with good handling. T4/3; Lotus Elise T2: Lamborghini Gallardo T1: Anything but the Veyron, which goes like the clappers and handles like a dead pig with no legs and a massive erection.Would not recommend buying at full price, but if it's on sale, and you're looking for a little bit of casual racing, get it.

												Let's get one thing straight first controllers do work you need to be using a Playstation controller. I'm using a F310 Logitech.I also don't understand the people who say this game looks terrible. When the game first starts up it will be at a very low resolution but in the game options it can go up to 1920 x 1080. If anything this game is too shiny. Overall I would say it's an okay NFS game just a little too easy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first Need For Speed game i have ever played other then the first one that came out and i have beaten this one all the way through to the end. I really enjoyed it, there were some parts of the game were it got frustrating because sometimes you would be so far ahead that you know noone is going to pass you and then the AI might just put in there after burners or something and get really close to you as you about to finish a race. The story was interesting and got you thinking all the way to the end. The running from the cops was alot of fun and challenging because you have to think of different ways to drive to try and loose them. I found my self playing it for hours on end to level up my rank in game and to get more money so i can get better cars. Some times the gameplay felt repetitive, like you were going down the same roads as before over and over but alot of times they mixed the route up. If you love running from the cops in highway and rural areas then get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your ""handler"", Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your ""boss"" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!)  to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city. While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game. All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and ""The Run"" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been looking for a game even relatively like Carbon for ages. I'm not sure how I missed this, but I love it. And I want more. I want so much more.Just... God, it's good. It's that perfect line between being arcade-styled racing, but not being so over-the-top arcadey that it forsakes all physics. Driving may not be realistic - as in, your tires have such insane grip that you won't spin out and crash after ripping on the handbrake for a turn - but god DAMN it's fun.On top of that, the customization. Good LORD! The customization! Just... I can't describe how well it's done. Controls in the customization menu are a wee bit wonky, but, managable. Other than that, though, just, holy crap. At least half my game time is spent editing visuals, upgrading and tweaking cars, and I love it. Every second of it. Of course, there's also the option to not customize your car if that ain't your thing, but for those of you who love vinyls and paint jobs and all that jazz? You. Will. Be. Pleased.It's fast, it's satisfying, it's got a feeling of personalization, it's almost everything I've wanted in a racing game.Almost.Where it lacks is two things. And both of them are the placement of difficulty.Once a mission is done, you get a hefty chunk of change. Do it again? 10% of that change, at most. This is severely depressing if you manage to lose a car to the police by bad luck. Car gets impounded with less than $3000 or so in the bank? Kiss it goodbye. Customizations and all. This means that you'll likely be grinding a lot if you get unlucky and lose your favorite car at a horrble moment, or if you want to get all the cars. (Well... You can use cheat codes, but, nyeh.)And, then there's the missions themselves. The only times I've lost is to cars that are a tier above mine - and those times were all just barely losses - or when I made, like, 5-10 mistakes in a race. I've made it a personal challenge to not use speedbreaker - which is basically bullet time for better turning - and it's still easy. Every race is more a time trial than a race, really, that's how far ahead of the pack I normally am. But god damn, it's a fun time trial, and it's only marginally less satisfying to play because of it.Final verdict? Unless you're a diehard racing simulator type person, buy this. Buy it now. And then wonder why the hell there aren't more games like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not bother with steam version. I do not recommend this game on steam due to technical reasons.This appears to be the case for all EA racing games.First of all, the racing wheel I have does not work in the game.Secondly, when I enter menu of any type, the down arrow key locks and I cannot control the menu, what to select.Tuning your cars is a pain in the a$$ - to take the slider from 0 to 100 or left to right is a nightmare.The game itself, as a part of NFS series is decent - that is not the issue.Its just the aforementioned technical difficulties.

												A lot of fun to play SP on, but i'm a bit disappointed they took out the freedrive feature. There's a bug that lets you leave the track and freeroam for about 30 minutes, so we usually do that.A fun SP game to pick up, but the MP kinda sucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You should buy it if it is on sale. not full price. I liked the story line. I played this game on PS3. It was my first NFS Game on my PS3. and grafics arent bad. When i played it on my PS3, i was kist 8-10 so i didnt understand a thing. Lol. Alot of good and old cars like Dodge Charger R/T(1970) and SRT-8 and Dodge Challenger. Nissan skyline, BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini and much more. You can aslo customize your cars wich is my favorite! You can also customize your cars, which is my favorite! Good Sountracks too. It also was my first PS3 Game and i got the PS3 Early when it came out, still have the PS3 and the Stearing Wheel i used. Good times. 8/10 for being an old game and i played it at PS3 arround when it came out. had alot of fun in free roam :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game sure has it's problems: The graphics aren't that good, the game performs absolutely horribly (less than 30fps on a GTX950?) and the difficulty level of the races seems to be very random. But aside from that - and the absolute grind to get anything done, it's still a fairly OK game and you will surely enjoy it if you love arcade racing and fast cars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is not complete controller support, the pc controls do not allow for fine control of your cars, and the game was locked into a disgusting looking 4x3 aspect ratio. NO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC. It's a perfectly good game on console; but I implore you, DO NOT try to play this game on pc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game it looks like the computer is driving the car instead of me, i just have to stay on gas pedal from start to finish, and sometimes turn my wheel a bit when some corner is in front of me. In some races with less corners it's also possible to stay on the top speed limiter all the time. Accelerating in corvette z06 from 0-375 kph in less than 5 seconds is not impossible.

												It's Alright game. very easy. old school 3d graphics. Doesnt really support Controller so steam needs to fix that. Don't like that i cant save and exit int he begining but all in all the Challange is there. Deffiently do plan on playing more later down the road. played this game when it first came out when i was a kid. was pro at it still a pro now but little hard to play it with a keyboard but i will get use to it. i recomed it for people who like the need for speed games and wants to bring back memories, but for people who never played this or any of the need for speed games i don't recomend this game for you guys.

												Do not bother with steam version. I do not recommend this game on steam due to technical reasons.This appears to be the case for all EA racing games.First of all, the racing wheel I have does not work in the game.Secondly, when I enter menu of any type, the down arrow key locks and I cannot control the menu, what to select.Tuning your cars is a pain in the a$$ - to take the slider from 0 to 100 or left to right is a nightmare.The game itself, as a part of NFS series is decent - that is not the issue.Its just the aforementioned technical difficulties.

												EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops.ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover, but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to start with; this game is a lot of fun, like hella fun, totally worth $10. This game has no story, there's no point even pretending that it has any substance, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't plot development outside of the UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENCES and the characters are laughable. It only serves as plot-points to give you free cars. The car selection is broad and the cars feel unique for the most part. Upgrading in tiers is rewarding enough and you can feel how much potentials cars have when you first unlock/buy them.The races are just regular races, be fast, hit the apex, win. The AI can be a little funny sometimes with it's speeds, but the game will sometimes straight up cheat speed to make you feel the pressure to win. I remember the lack of pressure to win in NFS:UG1&2 where you can easily lead the last races by over a 10 second margin. So that's nice. The only real issue with this game is the police AI. Helicopters can see you in tunnels, and out of line of sight and the GTR cops have x-ray vision and always know where you are which creates a mini-game of finding the pursuit breakers and cooldown spots. However this is ""gameplay feature"" is really frustrating sometimes. Multiplayer aspect of this game is nonexistent.Conclusion:This game is really fun as just a brain-dead racer with some free roam, nothing else to it. Going in with any expectations above that and you've played into EA's hand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game as I had played it when I had a PS2 console and fully completed that version. However I would really appreciate it if this game had full controller support. As there isn't an option to set keys or certain functions are still on a few keys on my computer's keyboard. I can accelerate, brake, change view, access events, and steer in the game. But as for handbrake, nitrous and speedbreaker. Those functions aren't seemed to be on my Xbox 360 controller.Please fix the controller functions to full controller support. I recommended this game because as I said before. I had completed it on the PS2 console. And everything on that version really was playable and enjoyable. But as for this version, I'm neutral.

												EA's Need for Speed franchise has been in an odd position the last couple years. While the franchise often worked to mix up the formula from year to year a decent bit, the release of EA's own Burnout Paradise posed a bit of a conundrum for the publisher. With Burnout switching to an open world setting, it meant that it competed directly with Need for Speed in that space. Last year's Need for Speed ProStreet was a diversion for the series from recent years, going to track-based racing, plenty of tuning options and focusing entirely on the events than exploring the city or running from the cops.ProStreet didn't turn out too well, so Black Box went back to the drawing board and returned to an open world setting with this year's Need for Speed Undercover, but that wasn't the only design change. Undercover also seems to be directed right at the casual market, both in terms of presentation and its extremely relaxed learning curve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me get the elephant out of the room first, this game is what I would consider a ""REBOOT."" When a franchise is stale, it tries to relive the successes of yester-year  (EX. Most Wanted (2005)) and sometimes it works, unfortunately for Undercover, the sales at launch say it was too late. Carbon had at least a 7 million unit sales DECREASE! Then ProStreet lost another 4 million unit sales at launch! Before you click away, this is NOT the same as bad, just for Undercover, it was a day late and a dollar short.Gameplay: The game tries to mesh ProStreet's engine, with Most Wanted's narrative format. This was an... INTERESTING result. We got control that was MILES better than ProStreet's, but still wasn't as great as Most Wanted (2005)'s.  There are new modes such as highway battles and outruns. These do add some variety, but don't really feel, (to me), warranted. The car selection is the best of the series. We got your typical street cars like your RX-8's and Camaro's, but then you got LFA's and Pagani's, holy ****,. that is awesome!Graphics:This is to me, the game's key strength. The shaders look real, and the textures look superb. The car modeling and damage are so fun to see your hood fly right off your car and fly away to no man's land. Music:Eww, I know most people bash on this, but to me this seems like a sign of how the times can change over the course of 4-8 years. Where'd did the good jams go?Verdict:Yes, this game has some issues, plenty. But most are not game breaking and this game gets too much hate despite no one knowing how tight this game's development was. EA Black Box/EA Canada was split in 2007. one team made ProStreet, the other made Undercover. Knowing what they accomplsihed with only half the team makes me want to give this game 4.5 stars, but I can't. It tries to be Most Wanted 2.0, but fails in terms of gameplay design and music choices. I can only give this a 5/10, which is not a bad score, in fact, five is a middle ground. It's the most subjective score I can give it.Subscribe to me on YouTube for reviews and gaming content galore: https://www.youtube.com/user/HippoRenoPlaysMCThanks for reading!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most bosses are difficult or the player doesnt have a fast vehicle like a lamborghini gallardo4. The Map desnt load faster when racing.5.

												I've played a lot of NFS games, but this one was by far my least favorite. The car controlled better when I used the keyboard than when I used my Afterglow Xbox controller and I felt like I had stepped back to the nintendo 64. I loved the N64 and would never say it was a bad system but this game was released in 2008 and honestly could have looked/worked a lot better. I personally think that we are better than simply pushing tab to go to the next race (the races are rediculously easy to win, there's no challenge at all). For now I can't recomend this game for what it should be. Maybe I missed something. I'm going to go back and play some more at a later time. but unless the game becomes more interesting I can't recomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Be aware, this is a version without patches - with many bugs (e.g. Autosculpt is not working proprely), but without annoying catch-up system. So it's up to you - if you want patches and more difficult game, buy Undercover on Origin, if you want easy game with some bugs, buy it here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was fun on my old computer and I recently got a new one with a GTX 760Ti and an i7 Intel Quadcore Processor, It should be no problem running this game but for some reason it is. I crashes randomly! But besides the crashes It's a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a lot of NFS games, but this one was by far my least favorite. The car controlled better when I used the keyboard than when I used my Afterglow Xbox controller and I felt like I had stepped back to the nintendo 64. I loved the N64 and would never say it was a bad system but this game was released in 2008 and honestly could have looked/worked a lot better. I personally think that we are better than simply pushing tab to go to the next race (the races are rediculously easy to win, there's no challenge at all). For now I can't recomend this game for what it should be. Maybe I missed something. I'm going to go back and play some more at a later time. but unless the game becomes more interesting I can't recomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game in which immature 30year old ""gangsters"" and boobs stare at you.it was to expect that aesthetically undercover could not cope with NFS Most Wanted(original/2005) but the fact that beeing released 3 years later it feels technicaly worse too surprised me indeed.maximum resolution: 1920x1200particles: nonexistentimprovements on the cops: none (roadblocks are even worse now compared to MW[2005].)flair: palm bay feels like a random generic city. there are barely any tracks with a nice vista.Try to get NFS Most Wanted[2005], if you want a great street racing game.

												Cons:30FPS lockMax resolution 4:3 1024x768, 16:9 1280x720 (720p)Low textures (like very bad and dull textures, even NFSU2 look better than this), those screenshot are lies.Over-glare effect to cover dull world in high setting, and no I cannot turn that shining light of sun without turn it off whole effect entirely.EA Nation login, which is non exist todaycausing No Multiplayer.it doesn't scale very well with new hardware.Pros:Cut-scene is great, I like Maggie QSound/Music overall shine over the gameplay.Other Thoughts:I just want to replay my old NFS games, but I'm not sure which titled, so I end up with this one.I don't feel so bad about it, because 78% discount.I feel like this cut-scene cost more than developing budget.I'm still curious which NFS title that I want to replay, it's probably Hot Pursuit, I should get that one instead of this. just forget this and move on.EDIT: it's NFS CARBON, I should get that instead, but I can't find it anywhere.

												Need for Speed Undercover! Where should I start with this?Let's see: First off the graphics are horrible. I set everything to the highest settings and yet the game looks like crap. Even Nfsu and nfsu2 has way better graphics than this game and they came out way before. Even Nfs carbon graphics are better than this game.Second the gameplay is nothing similar to other nfs games. You can have the fastest car in the game and the slowest car can catch up to you like its a piece of cake. I'd like to see that in real life. Have a Nissan Skyline GTR r34 fully tuned race against a 240sx fully tuned and see who wins.If you're the person who does't care about graphics and gameplays then this is for you.

												Even with the settings maxed, this game looks and feels lifeless. The story is complete fluff and the cutscenes add no real value and come across as the worst softcore porn film ever.If you're looking for customization options on par with Underground, OG Most Wanted or even Hot Pursuit Reboot, you won't find it here. Skill points are devied randomly, with bonuses given during certain events that you cannot allocate points towards.The A.I. is non-adjustable and some of the easiest I've encountered in a game yet. Police stop chasing you heavily after a minute or so. The other racers are a joke as well. 30 second split times? Gimme a break...I might revisit this game later down the line, but so far, I'm not terribly impressed. At least it's playable, compared to The Shift series and The Run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I miss these circuit within a city type racing games, like the old Burnout titles.The problem here is that the game keeps crashing on story missions because of the crappy 10 second cutscenes with Maggie Q.Seriously, the acting is so bad it'd be better to remove the cutscenes all together.The driving is great, but the way you earn and unlock cars though the storymode isn't. And some of the story missions force you to use a POS car to evade the police, when you can't even outrun them in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself isn't bad. The graphics on everything are nice and the freeroam is great because of the miami/LA-esque scenery. The story, while it does get a bit monotonous and requires you to grind for levels to advance, still offers you a challenge. The cops are relatively competent and will give you a run for your money on later levels. Cars handle well, feels great to drive around at 200 km/h, and has plenty of variety. Even with the lacking customization options; you can still personalize your car to a very good degree.Why won't I recommend this? It's using an incredibly frustrating version of rubberband AI for racers. It is not noticable during the first few hours of the game since the AI's still tame, but as you progress higher and higher, you'll soon see how the AI has an unfair advantage over you.For starters, unless you're racing against lower-tier enemies, regardless of how far you leave the competition behind, they -will somehow catch up to you- (Example? I left my opponents with a 10-15 second advantage for the entirety of the race, but when I was at the 80%ish completion mark, they somehow managed to catch up and close the gap to 3 seconds and got to 2 seconds by 90%. That's not possible in any way and mind you, I didn't crash or slow down either.). They won't nessesarily beat you by default, you can still win, but it still pretty much makes your whatever careful driving you do redundant. Additionally, the AI has this amazing ability to clear chicanes, even those full of traffic, without noticibly slowing down like it's none of his business.Additionally, the AI -really- hates you. They aren't programmed as racers competing against eachother, they're programmed as a pack of wolves who will do everything to make sure you lose. They will gang up on you, rough you up, and attempt to spin you out at the cost of their progress on every turn and the director will sometimes spawn traffic at the most inconvenient of times just to throw you off.All in all, unless you really love to get angry, I'd recommend you pass this.

												This is a tough game to review. I wish there was an ""okay"" button, something inbetween the good and bad. Unfortunately, I have to give this game a thumbs down. ~~~PROS~~~For $5, it wasn't the worst deal I've made... I spent $20 on Goat Sim and only played it for a couple hours.The car customization is great, the police AI has VASTLY improved since Most Wanted, there are lots of races and events, and a decent selection of cars. The soundtrack isn't too bad, either.In terms of visuals, this game looks pretty impressive. I have a GT 640 and can max it out in 1080p, which came as a surprise to me.The audio FX are amazing, though I don't think the cars sound quite as ""mean"" as they did in MW.~~~CONS~~~I came from Need For Speed: Most Wanted with high hopes, and what I got out of this game was... uh... troubling, at best. The career in this game doesn't even compare to Most Wanted, and I mean that in a bad way. In Most Wanted, I spent hours replaying the career several different times, with different cars, I grew up with that game. Undercover, however... I kind of had to drag myself through the story. It was mediocre, at best. On top of that, the career mode seems to only have two difficulties; impossible, and ridiculously easy. One second, you win a race with the next opponent trailing 20+ seconds behind. The next, you get ripped a new one and end up in 8th place. It's really odd...The multiplayer is a joke. Good luck finding a server. Also, your graphic schemes don't show up in multiplayer.Menu navigation is NOT optimized for a mouse. In fact, I would unplug your mouse before you even play the game. All it could really do is get in the way.~~~~~~~~~~~Overall, I'd give this game a 4/10. If you want multiplayer, buy a different NFS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spend your money on a better racing game. I had to go into my registry and look for the key to unlock the game on Origin because the Steam version really suffers. I finished the game on Origin, that's why my time played isn't accurate.I don't understand the positive reviews mentioning a good plot. All you get are heavily compressed videos of Maggie Q having to say some dumb things and muscular men looking all angry at the camera.The driving is quite bad. If you're not able to take a corner you have to release the gas for one second so the car turns like a charm even while driving at 200+ km/h. It's just not fun and there is barely any challenge in the game.It's a consoleport and it feels like one. The graphics look way better in the screenshots and there are lot's of framedrops, especially when taking sharp turns. There is way too much bloom and if you turn it off the game looks worse thatn NFS Hot pursuit 2 (the old one). There is a nice smoke effect however when driving through sand or braking.

Can't get it anymore or, if you can, it's Origin-exclusive.Other than that, the plot's decent, car roster's small but great, and you'll get a challenge out of some the races. The Master Events in particular. Still don't recommend it due to the missing Challenge Series, which gives more than what multiple playthroughs could ever hope to. Therefore, the 2-3 Bonus cars you get from it to use in Career Mode are (probably) forever out of grasp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a shoddy PC port, supporting only a handful of resolutions up to 1080p (I have a native 1360x768 and have to step down to 720p to get a decent image). That I can live with, but then I reached a required mission (one that pushes the story forward), and it crashes on load 100% of the time for that one mission. So I have to walk away from the game on PC :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even with the settings maxed, this game looks and feels lifeless. The story is complete fluff and the cutscenes add no real value and come across as the worst softcore porn film ever.If you're looking for customization options on par with Underground, OG Most Wanted or even Hot Pursuit Reboot, you won't find it here. Skill points are devied randomly, with bonuses given during certain events that you cannot allocate points towards.The A.I. is non-adjustable and some of the easiest I've encountered in a game yet. Police stop chasing you heavily after a minute or so. The other racers are a joke as well. 30 second split times? Gimme a break...I might revisit this game later down the line, but so far, I'm not terribly impressed. At least it's playable, compared to The Shift series and The Run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahem... Need for Speed, a reputable racing game genre that everyone should be familiar with, especially after Underground appeared on the roadmap. So why do I ask, is this abomination under the NFS banner? This is a pure stinker of a game that will have you screaming in rage at either three things:1. Akward controls - Get ready to smash your controller that the game doesn't support natively.2. Rubberbanding A.I - What is this? The god damn 90's? Please, I don't need to be reminded that one mistake costs me that 10 minute race I was close to WINNING.3. Graphics - If someone pooped on your eyes, then smeared the tears of slaves into it, that's what you get, I'm sorry, Most Wanted had the best graphics and even that wasn't awesome for todays standard.Avoid, get Most Wanted or Hot Persuit or something, avoid like the god damn plague.

												Need for speed undercover:Great example of the NFS franchise. Unfortunately is let down severely by basic port/platform issue. No ability to access the steam interface – this includes not be able to take screenshots & access the hub or message etc. (thanks Origin/EA/Steam). Also I am bugged by some issue where the car steers to the right constantly. I unplugged my controller & keyboard, tried another and rebooted as much as any man could in half an hour to no success. If anyone knows a remedy to the issues above, please share and I will update this review. If not this game gets a stinking 0/10 for me for being a good, yet unplayable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you remember the old classic NFS and like them, then, it may be worth, although I would recommend to buy it when it's on sale. If you expect this game to be better than the old one, then you are wrong. The story is terrible and you don't even have to finish the game to know what will happen. Car upgrade is worthless, challenger will be as good as the car you drive. And on top of that, driving is the same with all the cars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the worst, if not the worst, NFS games I've ever played. It has no sense of speed, the cars looks like crap, the city is totally empty and the interface is just poor. I'm normally all for open world/cities, but in this game there is just no point. And just because of this game I have no expectations whatsoever for NFS The Run (but that's mainly because it will created by the same developer). Let Criterion Games handle the next action packed NFS games please, they know what to do. Back to hell with you, Undercover ![Rating: 59/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do yourself a favor and avoid it.WORSE: it installs PunkBuster and does NOT remove it when you uninstall the game.The thing stays active and even attempts to connect to the internet, with no record in the Programs&Features panel.

												I've been playing this a bit, and I have to admit, I'm very disapointed, the traillers for this game made it look really good, but really, the game isn't that good. This is not the Need For Speed I know. I'm not impressed at where the story line goes or the fact that it just dumps you into the middle of a map, with no real objective. The graphics arn't much of an improvment from Most Wanted, and to tell you the truth, I think Most Wanted has beter graphics than this game does. We are talking 3 years difference, and not much improvment, plus the camera movement is annoying. That's really all I have to say about this game. Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit looks a lot better than this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Utterly broken.Neither my Steam controller nor my Xbox One controller would work with this game. Strangely, they both work in NFS Carbon and NFS Most Wanted.... Older games in the series by the same dev??Graphics are terrible and also buggy. Car effects on Off, they look fine but you don't get lights on police cars. Car effects on, regardless of setting (low/med/hi) everything has a reflection on it that is on 90% of the time but disappears, reappears and flickers with no rhyme or reason.Bad UI, bad controls, Steam overlay doesn't work in normal mode nor Big Picture (meaning you can't adjust your steam controller to work as a keyboard, seemingly the only way around the broken gamepad support). Just avoid this and go get Underground 2 or Most Wanted and get a 1080p patch for them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												     Before I start this review, I will say that I am actually very fond of the Need For Speed games, atleast most of them, with Most Wanted 2005 being my absolute favorite. This game, however, does not come close.     I have played this game on Xbox360, PS2, and Pc now. The Xbox360 version was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. That one gets a 7/10. The Ps2 version was decent, but lacked a lot of the story and had very few cars. 6/10. This one, however, was ported HORRIBLY. It feels like it ported straight from the XBOX360(With much worse graphics) with about 5 minutes of tweeking. AND THE CONTROLS ARE SOME OF THE WORSE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I tried to use this with the controller and keyboard and both were tedious. The controller only is able to function with half of the game and the keyboard is utterly the most confusing set-up i have ever seen. I mean seriously? Delete was my nitrous button! I couldnt even customize my cars and had to get away with whatever they happened to give me.     The game crashes ALL THE TIME. for the hour and a half I was playing it crashed 4 times, twice while I was racing, and twice during a cutscene. I have a top-knotch rig, so it is definitley the game's fault here.     That and some other problems like blinding sun blare, jerky movement of the car, limited multiplayer, the only problem I couldn't find was what most people shun this game for: Rubber-banding AI. The only redeeming thing about this game is play-time(7-8 hours, which is fine), the customization(If you can find it) and the car list which was actually fairly large for an arcade racer.     My final rating is a solid 3/10. its a bad game port and I certainly don't recommend it. C'mon EA, you know better than this...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the worst of the series. I'm not sure what the coders were thinkling, but here are my complaints in tl;dr form.1) Your car doesn't matter, the AI will always scale to you.2) Your driving doesn't matter, the AI will always find a way to match you.3) Your skill doesn't matter when the AI can match you.4) Random physics breaks.When you're doing 185 in a Porsche with nitro and a racer from 10sec behind you passes you with breaklights... It gets annoying. Cars randomly spin out, AI traffic decides to take you out, everything is mismatched and unbalanced. This game is tedious and annoying to say the leas t, not much in the way of redeeming unless you justy casually drive around the map (which is mostlyt limited to highway travel anyways). Don't waste your cash, don't get it full price. If you really want it I would just wait for a humble bundle./end rant.Otherwise, love the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible controls, boring races, boring open world, and cheap ai. Only buy it if its a couple dollars. I owned this game on 360 as well but thought I'd give it another go because maybe the higher framerate and resolution could make it better. It didn't. The best NFS game to me was NFS Hot Pursuit 2 on PS2. Just get PCSX2 and HP2 on PS2, I'm sure you'll have more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Graphics are amazing by the time of it's release, The menu it's just so horrible I reallly got to hate pressing the ESC key.The visuals for this one are so limited and not really that cool looking.Music is a subjective matter but I gotta say I really didn't enjoy most of it.The AI is just so bad, not really that ""Intelligent"".Hitbox problems.Know that when you lightly touch a wall you can get hit and crash as if you were facing it.

												This is the last good need for speed game , has good customization ( not like in Underground that was the best custom ) , of large numbers of cars *48* , is using the EAGL engine ( oh men how much I have loved this engine i grew up with him from hot Pursuit 2 ) if you mod with Limited Edition graphic mod it look even more spectacular , the car sound are greate.Now the Bad things : the game has a bug which consists in the sun follows you even through buildings , the soundtrack is bad in my  opinion , sometimes the care physx are weird and the car flay like a rocket , really BAD STORYLINE ( even CARBON had a better story) , was rushed by EA and could not be finished properly.If you compare the old series NFS is a average car race , but compatible with the latest parts who have lost the feeling of NFS is a greate game.  If you get past the technical problems you can enjoy the game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are numerous other racing games on the market for a little more money.  The game is much like any other Need for Speed title and the cutscenes become extremely tedious after the first playthrough.  Support for more recent versions of OS is also failing as the game tends to crash often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its by far the best iteration to play and still not saying much.I'm a huge fan of the early series but rather dissapointed in these later releases starting with anything after the first Most Wanted Black version. Have yet to play the Shift series with is supposed to be more simulation like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend playing NFS Most Wanted or NFS Hot Persuit instead of this one if you are a ""Imma go back and finish my old games"" type of gamer. While the most important thing in a NFS game is the driving, which this game does well, the environment and stoy both fall flat. If you've played Most Wanted and Hot Persuit then you know what I mean.1 hour into the game and I already lost interest in playing it. You can play through this game once but that's pretty much it.

												Bought it as a bundle for cheap so i'm not complaining much, however this game is poorly coded to the point where you may aswell buy a different game.Being an old game, it may not be badly coded but it isnt well compatable.Also being an old game, at £9.99 it's worth it if you have Windows XP / Vista I guess.But here's what happened:- First time I launched it, it went to 640x480 and crashed my pc with a black screen.- Second time, changed resolution to 1920x1080 and it crashed.- Third time, it launched it 1920x1080 and played for an hour or so finishing alot of missions and obtaining different cars along the way for it to suddenly crash as I merely evade the police.Pros:- Nice cars.- Good gameplay.- Is not half bad if you get it on a console.- Enjoyable to play when it did play.Cons:- Ugly enviroment.- Poor brakes.- Easy AI.- Cars too slow.- Use of KM/H.- Annoying real life based cut scenes.- Stupid police chatter.- Unrealistic police chases.- Unrealistic police cars.- Use of blocking corners with arrows.- Glitches with autosculpt. (Make a custom bumper for it to erase itself.)- Unrealistic traffic.- Weird gravity.- Any form of air requires a slow-mo replay apparently.- Buildings out of proportion.- No ingame brightness/gamma options, makes you change your tv.- Screenshots need an origin account? (wtf)- Steam overlay doesn't work %90 of the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are no words in any language to describe how terrible this game is. From the controls to the graphics, everything in this game is just BAD. This Game is IMPOSSIBLE.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you are really a die-hard-fan of Need for Speed serise. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The worst game I have ever bought on Steam, EA hates livestreamers or at least that is my opinion based on their games never being able to go windowed so streamers and adjust things without killing the game. YOU CAN'T SKIP THE CUT SCENES...AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE LIVE VIDEO CUT SCENES? Lastly, playing on a controller is a joke unless you map it out in a script, default control for acceleration is X button? Why not use R trigger like everyone else? I will never buy another EA game outside of consoles ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a decent game, took me 10 hours to complete. I would say that it's one of the worst NFS games though. The driving is really neat, but the police chases are boring compared to Most Wanted. You start of with a good car, then it falls of after a while. Then you get a new car, which is very powerful, but then that falls of as well. You constantly have to upgrade your car, or the AI will crush you.The storyline is flat, no real surprises, and the ending was expected. I had a good time, but I would probably not reccomend it to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This won't even run on my Windows 7 x64 machine.i7 4790k, 16gb of ram, SSD's, Rx 480 8gb.I understand this is an old game and I used to love it on my core 2 duo - with Windows 7 mind you... but it does not run.I managed to run it from an administrator command prompt but it bombs while loading the saved-game even if I made a new one.  I am out of ideas.  Tried the newer game - a remake of Hot pursuit, used to love that from almost 20 years ago, and gosh I must say this company shouldn't be allowed to make games anymore.Sorry, but AI scaling to the player just shuts off all the fun.  I threw out Flatout series for that, and after this experience and the one with the new Hot Pursuit, I am pretty done with EA.  You can take your scripted AI-that-always-keeps-up and your broken games and keep them to yourself!  This coming from someone who absolutely, positively LOVED the first 4 of the series starting with The Need For Speed back in MS-DOS in 95~96.I really don't like being pestered to LOG IN to EVERYTHING.  I am disabled, I can't remember passwords, and in America, you can't leave your passwords written down if your a PC user or the identity thieving police informants will steal it.EA, you are everything that is wrong with PC gaming.

There is no way to skip the freakin cutscenes. damn EA, will you ever learn?The police are way too annoying...Graphics are ok, this is an old game.Controls, well I am using a steering wheel, but the pedals won't work ...The cars are nice, and they have a good physics feel...

												+ is good- Is bad= Both?This game is generally an okay racing game.It is on the lower spectrum of the NFS series (But they are all really good games)I'll go through some good and bad. I may be a little knit picky about some of these but they just really get to me and maybe a good amount of you.But there is 1 major flaw that makes this game horrible and fills me with anger every time I see it. And it is quite common+The racing is fun when you have compeition. You want to win. +The cars have pretty good handeling. The are nice to drive.=The story you will understand and will sometimes pick up, but most won't really care and will just get into the racing.=The map is large and sometimes is okay to roam around in, but you don't get a feeling of exploration and wanting to travel the map like other NFS games made me feel. No sense of adventure-You are fined WAY too much. You lose money for many things. It gets annoying.-The soundtrack in my opinion is GOD AWFUL. It only fits to 2 music genres, Country and Hard Rock. If you don't like these genres sometimes it is hard to play hearing it in the background and the music is very unfitting at times. When I am in a tight position with a rival car racing close to the finish, the music plays a soft country tune. I don't like either genres so it feels bad to hear. Annoying.-You LOSER MONEY for SPEEDING. This game is Need For Speed. You are ment to go fast. I know it is against the ""laws"" in the game but you get fined for going fast and having fun. Speed is one of the soul points of the game. You get fined during races for speeding, too. I get so angry whenever I see that red light flash of SPEEDING -250. Other than thisd major flaw it is an overall decent racing game. Although I do not reccomend the game it is fun to try out and I suggest you buy it on sale. I got it for $2, so I won't be so harsh on it. But if you want a decent racer, play this if it is on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is GARBAGE.  Launching it drags you through several minutes of unskippable intro videos before putting you in control of a vehicle, all before giving you any opportunity whatsoever to adjust screen resolution, volume, etc.  In my case, the game crashed repeatedly at the end of the first sequence.  Restarting it multiple times and having to sit through the same garbage intro every time was painful.   Once you're finally able to adjust the game's settings, you'll no doubt find that it doesn't support the most common video resolutions, there is no way to adjust the wonky control scheme, and regardless of how you setup your controls you still get keyboard prompts for everything (press _tab_ to enter a race!).  The game is a hot mess and it's no wonder that Black Box is defunct.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NFS Undercover is maybe the most casual, plain and simple game of all serial. To call it arcade... well, I remember arcades of 80's, so it is definitely not an arcade! It is very sub-arcade, in the terms of controls and the whole gameplay.Yet I'm not so determined to absolutely NOT recommending that game. You see, that depends from where you are looking at the whole NFS bunch of games. If you are one with NFS Underground, you maybe found Undercover less colourful, but acceptable. Same goes with the fans preferring NFS Underground 2 the most. Now, the biggest group of fans, I know, love the Most Wanted. For them, Undercover will be quite bleak in terms of contest. The police there dumb and slooow, the contenders, for the most time, also not showing you any challenge.Undercover has its own nice features, sure.First, the soundtrack. It's the best from the whole serial, I still have more than dozen tracks from there in my playlist.Second, the cars. There are quite a bunch of roaring road monsters for every taste, with the only downside that you should invest some time in the game to get to the sweetest ones.Third, Maggie Q. I'm not a fan of her, yet she certainly make the atmosphere a little less boring.Still, it is not enough for me. You see, my favourite NFS is Porshe Unleashed, so I can certainly tell you from my biased point of view, that all driving in the Undercover is boring as Mr.Obama speeches. The physics of driving is under every level of comparison. Maybe it is similar to the driving in the Watch Dogs, but hardly better. I've played Undercover on the PSP platform, but even there I was not really engaged in the races. They were not attractive even on that tiny piece of hardware, and PSP is not rich with the racing games at all!So, the only good thing I believe you can get from buying Undercover now is the little fraction of the same drive that gathered NFS so many fans with Underground and Most Wanted titles. So far you can't buy any of those great games on Steam, maybe you'll get desperate enough and go with the Undercover.My mark is 5.8/10. If you try to look a little harder, you'll find so many better racing games on Steam, than that. Yeah, they won't be calling Need For Speed, so what?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Need for Speed: Undercover retains all bad qualities of previous NFS titles while abolishing everything that made NFS titles worth playing. The ♥♥♥♥ing awful cut-scenes are there, the hilariously ridiculous cars are all accounted for, and the god awful storyline is present as well. What’s missing is everything else, customization is severely lacking and unique/accurate car controls are missing. You can drive a Lamborghini and hit top speed with nitro, but a ♥♥♥♥ing Mercedes will still pass you. That’s how ridiculous the logic is in this game. This issue isn’t much of a problem early game, but in the endgame you will most certainly lose every race because every A.I. has hacks that can beat your top speed with any car. This game is a “Most Wanted” wannabe and is an insult to the NFS series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that attempted to be Most Wanted, but failed in nearly every regard.It apes MW with an uncanny level of dedication, but somehow misses the fun-factor of MW.Autosculpt is fun as always, the selection of cars is wonderful, graphics are decent, and music is fairly good.The engine runs inexplicably heavy on hardware far above the recommended and always feels janky and imprecise.Get it on a steep sale if you're itching for something that feels close to MW.

												I purchased NFS Undercover last week, and until there is a patch it is unplayable. When the opening screen starts, there are small words at the top for Menu and Options, but I am unable to click on them! I have a wonderful Logitech G27 Steering wheel, but the game refuses to recognize it since I am blocked from access to the Options screen for setting it up! I am sure that once it is patched it will be very fun to play, but as of December 1, 2013 I find it to be dead in the water!Groan!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chase or Be Chased.You never thought it would turn out like this—an all-out chase where you're the hunted. And the hunter. Now you must get behind the wheel and risk everything to infiltrate a ruthless international crime syndicate and take them down. The man you're after is a maniac behind the wheel, and he's driving like his life depends on escape, which maybe it does. He's the one with all the answers you need, you will track him down. Needless to say, that fleet of police cruisers in your rearview mirror won't make things any easier. It will take all of your experience—and every ounce of skill—to outrun the law, take down the enemy, and unlock the truth that puts an end to this chase once and for all.- Go Deep Undercover - Race into an action-packed story of pursuit and betrayal. Take on jobs and compete in races to prove yourself as you infiltrate and take down an international crime syndicate.- Highway Battle - Fight off the cops and others as you take down your prey in high-speed, high stake multi-car chases. New and vastly improved AI mechanics mean more aggressive and intelligent cops focused on taking you out fast and by any means necessary.- Own the Open World - Tear across the massive highway system and discover the open world of the Gulf Coast Tri-Cities area, with three unique cities connected by an extensive highway system.- Heroic Driving Engine - An all-new game engine lets you pull off amazing moves for the ultimate driving edge.

												all the people complaining about performance...it is well optimized and it runs about 54-60 and i have a dual core intel celeron 1.60 Ghz. so its most likely something wrong with their computers or laptops. and i dont get frame drops at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic. Exactly what I'd expect from Need for Speed. The speed, the cop chase, the car modification, the plot, graphic, engine sounds, everything, just simply satisfying. Just keep in mind that this game is not meant to simulate real racing, so you don't find it strange when your car is absolutely indestructible.One problem I'm having is that, since I'm not a native speaker of English, I can't really understand the story because they speak too unclearly and THERE'S NO SUBTITLE. Add that and this game will become perfect.+ the need for speed+ cops are dumb (yeah it's good)+ car modification+ open world+ story+ Maggie Q- no subtitle- races at the same level vary too much in difficulty9 out of 10, marvelous.

												I have played various Need for Speed games over the years and they have all had at their core a very solid enjoyable racing experience and this is no exception. You have the racing element, the police chases, the destruction, the performance tuning and of course taking some of the most beautifully designed sports cars on the road and trying to make them look as ridiculous as possible. The story is no great work of literature but it strings the races together nicely. One thing which stands out about this game is the highway duels. Street racing games generally have very light traffic to make racing possible but this has some one on one races through heavier motorway traffic that are really fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rathr fun game. Not very realistic, because you can only ""die"" in some missions. Crash right into a moving car at 200 km/h? No problem. Do it 5 more times? Nope, still no problem, except the front may be a litle ugly. The world is big, the missions are fun, the grafics are suprisingly good for a game og its age. just a fun game. Story is possibly not too good (not copleted is myself), but what did you expect? The cars look nice and are controlled nice (I think. Haven't played many other racing games). So go buy it if you like a big world and running from the police.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
