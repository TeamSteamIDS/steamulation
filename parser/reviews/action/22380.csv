Fallout: New Vegas, is it for you?If you are considering picking this game up, but not sure if you'll like it, here are some things I liked and disliked.What I liked:Character Customization:The amount of character customization is really up there. Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).Mod Support:The modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!Open World:Depending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot! Weaponry: Fallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.Hardcore Mode:Want something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a ""Hardcore"" mode you!Multiple Playthroughs:There's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!What I disliked:Crashing:Fallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.Navmesh:Despite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)PC abilities:This game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.  All-in-all:Fallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion. Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game. ",72,9,2,8,21,0,5

												The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter. When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.  If you are interested in modding the PC version of this game, and you should be, then check out my tutorials on how to do exactly that:

												One of my all-time favourite games, I really enjoyed it and I spent many, many hours playing this. The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3). This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!), a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city, nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Road, because of its story and revelations).

												I think this review is going to be much like my Arkham City review; I would say the majority of user's on Steam will have already purchased Fallout: New Vegas, and most will have probably even finished it.  So this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who don't have it, or just haven't played it. Fallout New Vegas was released in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the areas of Nevada and California. You play as a Courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the New Vegas strip across the Mojava Desert. During the delivery, you are captured and shot dead (or so they think). After being recovered by a friendly robot, you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land.This was my first ever experience with a Fallout game; I had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there, and of course I am on the internet, and so it's always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so I knew what I was getting into,  a huge deep time sink. Game play is focused around the use of your V.A.T.S for guns, as well melee weapons. V.A.T.S pauses the game so to speak, and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body. You have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode, so once you aim, you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set. You can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode.  As you wander around the desert, you will find plenty of items, weapons, food, drink, books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another.  Obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find, alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time. This can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor. As you progress through the game and get a higher reputation, you unlock safe houses, where you can store your items in fridges, cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling.One thing I was surprised about in Fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as I had initially imagined. I created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations, and this cut down the amount of fighting I had to do by quite a bit I think. It was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as I have not come across many that have; like wise, you can go guns blazing at all times if you want; although I would hate to see how your story ends out. Within Fallout New Vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game, right until the last moments in the game. Along the way you will pick up side quests, these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed. There are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while. Some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable I have ever played, helping ghouls escape on their great journey, liberating a power plant were among my favorites, but there are just so many to do, and I would highly recommend that people don't just rush through the main quest in New Vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content. While the graphics in New Vegas don't look like the graphics we have today in game; they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play. I played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through; I was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state, it looks nice. You can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find. The game has varying levels of difficulty, you can play it on hardcore mode, or just on the regular easy, normal and hard modes. I played on normal mode so I could see the missions, story and explore the world without being too focused on min/maxing my character to be optimum at all times - although once I got the option to have Boone as my companion (a sniper), the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time, sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead.As you can see from the amount of time I have put into New Vegas, this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see, and probably in our life times. You will never be bored; there is always something different to do, whether it be crafting potions, or just playing a little Black-Jack at the casinos - there is never a dull moment. I 100% recommend Fallout New Vegas to anybody. Even if you aren't a fan of RPG games. New Vegas will probably change your mind; this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and I cannot believe I had not played it until now. If you haven't got New Vegas, get it, it's on sale quite regularly and if you do have New Vegas but haven't played it; please don't wait a second longer, boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game. Easily one of the games of our generation.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.New to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.Whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.So it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough. What is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.Fallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.

A few community made patches help with crashing and other obvious bugs in the game.(Pay attention to what is contained in the mods....I didn't realize one had a script that unlocked all achievements at once. I fail.)Overall, I give this game a 9/10 even in it's buggy state.			",1610,830,38,337,221,11,262

												The very first Fallout game I've played. I've been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes , thinking of something to write, but thanks to writer's block, I'm going to make this short and sweet:- It'll run well on pretty much any computer that's not 10 years old- It's fun and funny- If you like shooters or RPGs, I'd recommend this- If you like Skyrim, I'd suggest thisIf you do buy it, I just suggest one thing: Use the manual save, and only the manual save. If you're comfortable using the quicksave, go ahead- don't try and load off a quicksave though, only use it when in game. Don't use the autosave function, it's pretty unreliable.But it doesn't matter; everything comes down to this:I shot someone in the hand with a hunting rifle. He blew up. 10/10			",38,6,0,8,7,0,4

												I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey♥♥♥♥♥Fallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time. I played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.The Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit. The combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, I use a mod to keep that part off.This is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it. Buy At Full Price  ",405,97,7,66,41,4,42

I just found my new favorite thing to do in Fallout. I literally just downed all of the drugs, alcohol, and food in my inventory, and then i went around bashing people over the head with a hammer (the one that's made of a block of concrete). I took absolutely no damage and killed nearly everyone with one hit (I had also taken Nighteye, so it was extremely hard to see what i was doing, and i stumbled around viciously attacking walls many of the times).  Luckily for me, i happened to be in Fiend territory, and repeatedly ran into their camps. Needless to say, their camps were filled with drug stashes, allowing the fun to last indefinitely..... or so i'd thought.  My drug-fueled rampage ended when the withdrawal kicked in (for every drug), causing me to commit suicide by dumping all of my landmines in a large pile directly beside me, and then lighting it on fire. Mass murdered and then killed myself afterwards 10/10 ",420,74,1,25,17,6,17

												Gameplay is amazing. Writing is incredible. Immersion is insane. The amount of choices YOU can make for yourself is unmatched (looking at you, Elder Scrolls). Kept alive and fresh by an *excellent* modding community. Get it. Also, the DLC storylines intertwine. They don't interact much, but it's all cohesive.Get it.Cons? Bugs. Unfinished content, woes of a rushed game. For example, Caesar's Legion (one of the three main factions) lacks as much ingame depth as the NCR (much ingame depth). Another example being Freeside's (outskirts of New Vegas) condition - cut content, seperated zones (there is a mod series called Freeside Open dedicated to restoring this).Update: Still has the best DLC of any game I've played recently, and on the whole I still recommend this over Fallout 3 and 4.

												To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a ""Fallout"" game. If you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games. As someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?Before I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, ""Coke or Pepsi?""While both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.Quests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.Even when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.Speaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level—and scaling later—which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.I personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.It's All A Matter of ContextIf you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed. Quests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.Fallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children. In contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.As seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain). What can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.The reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse. ""I've Got Heartaches by the Number""I would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect. While I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.The narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)The rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.For example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game. On the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest. If Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.With all these gripes being said... the day I stop counting that's the day my world will end. ",327,84,2,55,9,2,27

												-=-Hello! If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Fallout New Vegas Review.-=-If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, you might be familiar of the famous RPG/Adventure game developers, Bethesda. They do an AMAZING job at creating medieval and sci-fi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago. I think Fallout New Vegas is a great game, but the graphics and presentation are ugly. Its really not even an upgrade over Fallout 3, I would call it more of a downgrade. Bugs are small in amount, landscapes are varied, the open world populated, and many, many towns and cities to visit, including your very own Vegas. Okay, off of the specs: You start out in a small town with a gun, and you can get meat cleavers, baseball bats, plasma rifles, sniper rifles, a concrete club, etc. There are lots of choices on weapons.You have so many choices of armor, too. You will never get bored of character customization.Some horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat. The worst I've experienced was walking through a rundown factory, killing weird creatures and invisible giants.GORE. Yes, I said gore with all caps. You can dismember people! Even when they're laying on the ground, dead, you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads, yes heads, off of the corpses.Crippling aspects. Pretty neat, although weird in some ways. I shot a centaur with an incinerator (Flamethrower) and I crippled his tongue.Mutant creatures. Giant flies, scourpions, and geckos, etc, alongside and against eachother. (I was walking to a town called Prim, and a fly got mauled by a young gecko.)The exploration in this game is incredible. You can go through Vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire, repaying debts, etc. You can head to several different other towns, drink out of toilets to regain health, take down large bandit empires, and kill large geckos with pool cues.If you like the Elder Scrolls, this game is fun and enjoyable. 9/10 great game, accidentally deleted my level 12 character and I hate myself for that. (Spent 9/10 hours working on him. I had a sword and medium armor. freaked me out, I guess I can restart.)Anyways, thanks for reading my review, please rate if it helped, also comment on what you'd like to see in any other review, open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed. :)			",201,16,2,28,17,0,13

Developers from Fallout 2 involved in the creation? Yes.Elements of the cancelled Van Buren (Black Isle's Fallout 3) finally brought to life? Yes.A mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences? Yes, yes, yes.For all intents and purposes, Fallout: New Vegas is the true Fallout 3 and the best sequel to Fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series.Unfortunately Obsidian was stuck working with Bethesda's sub-par game engine and base mechanics, but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up Fallout 2. If you're a long time fan of the Fallout series, playing this will mostly make you forget about Bethesda's attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over (problematic automatic weapons, for a big example.)Also worth noting is that Obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project. The fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me.Lead developer JE Sawyer's mod (though I consider it a much-needed patch) is highly recommended for the best possible experience.Description/update notes for JE Sawyer's mod for a good idea of what it does: http://fallout.gamepedia.com/JSawyer ",441,162,11,109,22,6,43

												Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic open world R.P.G. developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game takes place in the year 2281 near a retro-futuristic version of Las Vegas following the Great War between the United States and China that occurred some two hundred years prior. For a grand total of two hours on Octorber 23, 2077 the earth was scorched in nuclear fire forever changing life on this planet as we once knew it. Presently, you're a courier tasked with delivering a package to New Vegas until you're suddenly intercepted by a gang led by a mysterious man who then shoots you in the head and leaves you for dead in a shallow grave AFTER relieving you of said package. Shortly thereafter, you're luckily found by a kindly robot named Victor who then takes you to a nearby settlement called Goodsprings where a doctor saves what's left of your life. After some much needed R & R the doctor, who was a former vault dweller, gives you a vault suit, a PipBoy 3000 and a weapon for protection and you begin your fantastic quest to find the man that shot you and retrieve that package...""They Went That-A-Way!"". Along the journey you will encounter your fair share of hostile raiders, strange situations, terrifying irradiated creatures and a plethora of interesting people to interact with. I have to say that this game is just stuffed with so much content and sidequests that you will find it very difficult to stay the course and concentrate on completing the main story without veering off the beaten path from time to time....to time and time again. Wandering around the Nevada wasteland, as dangerous as it may sound, is just such a joy to do in this superb open-world title.The gameplay is definitely one of the shining jewels in this titles heavy crown. The combat in Fallout: New Vegas is a blend of a first and third person shooter for the most part. How you tackle combat in Fallout: New Vegas is completely up to you and the style of play that you enjoy the most. Your character could be guns blazing and shoot up everything in sight, you could also opt for the stealth playthrough and take down your enemies with sniper rifles and close quarter sneak attacks or be a melee fighter and go hands or blade to body with your enemies. The combat can be quite fun and very challenging depending on what mode or method you choose to play. Also let us not forget one of the staples of the Fallout series, the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S. which is always something great to see in action. V.A.T.S. is an active pause combat system implemented in the game that allows the player to select specific body parts to target during combat. Gameplay-wise, finding things to do and creatures or people to fight in the Nevada wasteland will not be a problem...just pick a direction and start walking.  Fallout: New Vegas operates off the same game engine as Fallout 3 did so other than running slightly better than it's predecessor both titles have a very similiar look to them. Graphically, I really enjoyed this title when it first came out but as the years have passed it really began to show it's age and lack of visual fidelity in it's base form especially when compared to alot of today's games. However, with the fantastic community of superb modders available like with all Bethesda's outstanding open-world games, this is no longer a problem. With just a handful of graphical modifications your version of New Vegas will look absolutely beautiful in all it's High Definition glory. With that said, this is the type of open world game that you just want to spend hours walking or running around and exploring because it is gorgeous. Every settlement, every cave or ruin that you investigate all have a unique look to them. You definitely won't see any recycled environments in this game thank you very much Dragon Age II! The music is great and really captures the post apocalyptic and somewhat western theme of the title whether you're in a battle, exploring or in some type of dialogue with a denizen of the Nevada wasteland. Last but not least, the sound quality is also top notch and really immerses you within the gameplay.If you're a fan of the Fallout series or just an open-world roleplaying game enthusiast then this is a title that your library cannot do without. This game is truly one of the best in the genre and definitely one of the greatest of all the Fallout titles available. There is an ample amount of very good DLC to play as well as a grueling hardcore mode for the immersion fans. Fallout: New Vegas is filled with lore from the previous Fallout titles which is a very nice addition for true superfans of the series. Also, what with the massive modding community available for Fallout: New Vegas, the replayability of this game is tremendous. This is a title that you can enjoy for months if not years to come much like I have so you will definitely get your moneys worth out of this purchase. Fallout: New Vegas is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I had so many plans, I was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending, but you know what they did instead of let me do that?

Finding out that there was no free-roam really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, regardless the game is very fun, but hey at least it doesn't give you a worse ending than Skyrim's.

												I am the Courier.After I accepted a package to deliver, I found myself on my knees outside a village looking at a shallow grave. A man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head, telling me I had entered a game I had to lose. Like so many others, my story would have ended in blood.Except I didn't. My lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up. Sadly, my name and life was gone. All I knew was the face of the man, and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of Goodsprings. I don't know who I was, but I know who I am now. I am the woman who will have her revenge. As I stepped outside, I saw the good people of Goodsprings being ravaged by bandits. I took up my  9mm pistol, and told the leader to meet us. We would give him their prisoner. As they stepped out confidently, I shot them all in the head. The blood stained the sand red, but the bandits left Goodsprings alone. Taking some food and water, and as much ammo as I could carry, I took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep.I eventually came to the town of Primm; here I met the NCR. A large group of foreigners who told me what I could and couldn't do. Wanted to help, but didn't do anything. Unbound by their rules, I picked a rifle out from their bed and, at night, rescued the locals. I supported the new Sheriff in Primm's independence. The NCR was only willing to watch; cowards, the lot of them.I later came across more of them; content to sit, drink and complain, I learned of the situation of the Mojave desert and began to fix the problems; they thanked me, paid me, took the credit, and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere. They had built a great statue, but did no great deeds.I then moved along the path, following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip, until I came across a town on fire. Outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps; I killed them all and took their caps for myself. Strange. Stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt; a town of the dead. Legionaires of Caesar came to me, and asked me to carry on their message. All shall be equal before Caesar. I remembered these words.When I came to Novac, I found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the NCR. As I saved them, I taught them to stand alone. I met the NCR at the power station; obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert, I sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people. I winked at my fellow co-conspirators of the Fellowship of the Apocalypse, and continued on my way.At a trading post in the middle of nowhere, I met Veronica. Beautiful, if eccentric, she was as alone as I was in this desert. She told me of the threats the Mojave faced; her own Brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the NCR. We travelled together, learning of the plights of the people in the Mojave.As we moved along, we came across the poor gathered outside new Vegas. The Fellowship of the Apocalypse agreed with my thoughts, that those in power cared little for the Mojave beyond resources and manpower. We killed the local drug dealers, killed the troublemakers, wiped out the Kings for creating a civil war, and once peace reigned, continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion.As I looked upon the wealth of New Vegas, I saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside. I found my man in his suit, ""Benny"". Surrounded by guards, he warned me off. I hadn't come this far to fail, however, and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room. Alone, I took my pleasure from him, and with his shaving knife, cut his throat in his sleep. That was the first night I slept well, although I needed a shower upon my awakening.I discovered his secret; a robot that could change the whole game to my rules. Not a brutal conquerer like Caesar, not the haughty expansionists of the NCR, nor the greedy self-interest of House; no, Yes Man provided a new way. Our own way. My travels taught me that only in true Chaos could the strong rise and lead the Mojave for itself; not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich. That was what I told myself as I walked through the rivers of blood.The White Hands family was first, high airs and low appetites, I smiled as I cut my way through them, executing them with the same gun Benny tried to execute me with. Then the Omertas, typical schemers; they screamed as I murdered them in their beds.Instead, I put the power into the hands of the people; the Boomers, remants of those before, I brought their dreams to life. I gave the Brotherhood back to those who would see it's power restored, partly for my philosophy, partly because Veronica had been my partner through everything and I would see her dreams come true as well.I then found the Sierra Madre, a dead land with untold riches. Finding it ruled by the mad, I killed the King of the Dead for my partner's sanity and the safety of the Mojave, and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison. Alone and silent.I found Mt. Big, the hope for the future from the past. Dusty, unused relics, I crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot. Our future would be our own; the past had already failed us, as my past had failed me.To the north, I found Zion; a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires, and despite the bleating of pacifists, I forged these people into a strong ally for the Mojave; they, like we, shall be independent.Finally, I took control of New Vegas; as the NCR and the Legion of Caesar fought, we executed our coup. A grand army of independence, from the many I had helped, came to free our land from the bear and the eagle. We drove off the Legion; and when the NCR came for their blood prize, I had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death.The Mojave is free, and shall stay free. Even after I leave.

												Hands down the best game I've ever played. I love it more than I love my family. ""Three crippled limbs, haven't slept in four days, no ammo left and hunted by the Legion. But atleast my spurs go Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.﻿"" It's a perfect RPG with a perfect amount of everything you want. Unlike Fallout 4, you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue, and the ability to make up your own story. I usually end up using revolvers and repeaters, since I'm pretty much obsessed with cowboys. The amount of really good side quests is incredible. Some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of Fallout 4. Although, in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in Fallout 4. What about the DLC's? The DLC's, well, they are as amazing as you'd expect from Obsidian. Honest Hearts my favorite, since I love the landscape of Utah and the story of the Burned Man. Old World Blues however, made me laugh as much as I have never laughed at a game before.Lonesome Road and Dead Money? They are gold aswell (literally). The soundtrack is the best. Ever. I've been listening to the music from day 1 since I got the game, and I know the lyrics to most, if not all the songs. It's quite surprising how you won't get tired of them. Also, Mr. New Vegas. It's impossible not to love him. <3How about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute?Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, any day, any time. The conflict between the NCR and Ceasar's Legion is far more interesting and immersive than the BoS vs Institute thing. I'm a bit of an NCR patriot myself, heheh.  Never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive. ""Crashes by the number,Glitches by the score,Everyday you love me less,Each day I love you more."" Let's talk about mods. Oh, lovely mods. If you're getting a Fallout because of the mods, this is the one for you. You can (and should) customize your game entirely using them. I'm running 100+ mods now and it's not even that much. The problem is getting the game to work with all of them though, it can be pretty frustrating.New Vegas is nostalgically depressing but it's surprisingly a great feeling.﻿So, should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed Fallout game or spend 20 bucks on one of the best games ever made? The choice is up to you. I'd get this game though.Edit #1Please, vote for this game to win the ""Test of Time"" award. Obsidian deserves it.			",105,5,1,11,8,1,5

												Where do I even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game.Let's just start with some history: Fallout New Vegas is the Fallout 3 that should have been. At least, most of the elements that make their appearance in New Vegas were actually of the original Fallout 3, which was canceled when it was almost finished by Bethesda so they could make their own 3, which wasn't as amazing as it could be in several factors, and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors, to say the least. Fallout New Vegas is pretty much more of a Fallout 3 than the actual Bethesda Fallout 3 was, so calling it Fallout 3.5 isn't doing it any justice whatsoever.Plus, Fallout 3 runs quite badly on the PC partly due to GFWL and apparently is even more crash-happy, so there is that.On to the actual game, it is incredebly enormous in size. I bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least. If you just take your time and explore like me, expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run. The game world feels huge, with way more than enough places to discover. Also, it has a gigantic list of quests, so yeah, this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks. Evenmoreso with the Ultimate Edition, which covers every piece of Expansion Pack/ DLC with it, which ups the game length very reasonably, and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile. Not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the Mojave Wasteland, but they all bring enough new in-stuff to the table which is also useable outside the Expansion Pack arenas. Have I mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons?Seriously, I cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use. True, it is partially due to the Expansion Packs bringing a part of it to the table, but even without it is bigger than Fallout 3, and with the expansion packs, it absolutely makes Fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two. The only thing Fallout 3 has weaponwise what New Vegas doesn't is the Rock-It Launcher, but that is about the only thing.Even if it isn't graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine, GameBryo, which really should be replaced next-gen and is still a bit glitchy, it is still really acceptable, and hey, graphics aren't the most important things in a game.Story's pretty great too. It all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like Bugsy Siegel, if he wasn't shot in the face (yet) and wasn't living in a post-apocaliptic Nevada/ Las Vegas,  you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit, where ever he might even be, to have a very stern talk with him. What's more, is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the Mojave and New Vegas, and it is all your choice who's gonna come out on top, by what means necessary... Or you just decide to take it all for yourself. Voice Acting is pretty well too mostly. Just don't expect the nameless NPC's to say something amazing.Darn, hear me rambling about this game, and I've probably haven't even covered a small part of it! In short, this is a quality game, the Ultimate Edition is where you should go for, and it is really dirt cheap during event sales (like 5 bucks in the Summer Sale) , and you really should pick it up, for a game of this calibre it is practically theft.

												One of the best games I've ever played.My experience of the game in a nutshell: - Speech is OP - Trying to be a good guy is really hard when it gets near to the end of the game - Punching is also OP when you happen to have a robotic hand. If not, don't even think about it - VATS doesn't differentiate friend from enemy so if you're using it quickly it IS possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether they've been killing each other at all - There is a comedian next to one of the doors on the Strip. His line about not being able to get to sleep WILL help you pick up girls in real life - 'Side' quests can be ridiculously long-winded, but worth it - Everything you eat is irradiated, so I survived on hardcore drugs alone. Don't try this at home kids10/10 Would spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a sniper rifle again.			",35,4,0,4,1,2,2

												I decided to take down my negative review and try to stabilize the game and write a positive review something that this game deserves!Pros:- Replayability Value- Multiple ways to solve quests- Ammo Crafting and Ammo Types- RPG elements - Interesting Factions- Lore- Roleplay-ability- Awesome Radio Songs- Achievements aren't disabled if you use mods- Fun mini-games that are very rewarding- Cheap- No Settlements and Preston Garvey- Mods for everything! And I mean EVERYTHING! Combat, Power Armor, Faction Armor, Throwing Weapons! You can have everything that Fallout 4 did good in Fallout New Vegas!- Great DLCsCons:- Locked at 2GB RAM (You can increase it up to 4 with a mod)(That's the only con I can think of)As a new player in the Fallout universe and Fallout 4 being my first I can assure you that this game is propably the best in the series (I haven't played the classics so i exclude them)! Hell I even unlocked all achievements! The mod community is one of the best I've seen so far alongside the Skyrim mod community!10/10 Best Fallout (excluding the classics)!			",71,1,1,19,4,0,1

												I feel like if there ever actually was a situation similar to Fallout in the real world, there would be this cult of Fallout players desperately trying to live out the real apocalypse like it was Fallout, trying to convince people that bottle caps were totally a legitimate form of currency, trying to carry as much pointless crud as possible, wondering why everyone was calling them insane.I would join this cult.

												One of the greatest RPG games of all time (In my Opinion)Lots of people say Fallout 3 is better, I admit it is hard to decide between the two. Positives	 Fallout 3 had a better atmosphere compared to Fallout New Vegas, it actually felt less of a Wasteland in New Vegas, less of a gritty and depressing feeling and more of a Cowboy, Western feel.The Story in Fallout New Vegas is utterly Amazing. It can go many ways depending on who you side with later on in the game which brings me to another point, later on in the game you have much more choice and freedom on which path to take, which allies you want aiding you, who you don't want to work with... etc.The Game starts off very slow paced, a bit like any RPG and is most likely the part where most people are going to turn it off at, but once you get going it becomes addicting, the Characters are detailed and some of the guys you encounter you will either like or hate.Fallout 3 had 20 Levels (NO DLC) and 30 Levels (WITH DLC) so if you thought that was too little, you will be glad to know that Fallout NV has 30 Levels (NO DLC) and 50 Levels (WITH DLC).Many people argue that Fallout 3 had a bigger map, this may be true I'm not sure but I feel that FONV has more unique locations to visit. I also found the DLC in FONV much more interesting than FO3. It wasn't a case of... ""I just want to finish this damn DLC so I can get the items"". Last thing is, there are Factions which weren't in the previous game which is pretty damn cool. Once again opening a path for your character on who to side with. (Legion FTW ^^)You can at least create attachments for your guns in this game, unlike Fallout 3Tons of mods which spices the gameplay up A LOT Negatives	 The only downside to this game is that it of course uses the same engine as FO3 so it may feel a bit outdated, along with the graphics (Not like they matter, sadly they do for some people).One thing that annoys me the most about this game is the fact you cannot work alone later on in the game, you must have the aid of someone else if you choose to... SPOILERS >>>  Take over Vegas	 Once you hit max level, it gets really boring. All you can really do is do the side quests and explore. Conclusion Great game, definitely buy it. Worth way more than the price it is. 9/10			",263,31,5,17,14,1,16

												Now this..... this is a Fallout game.Don't get me wrong, I 'liked' Fallout 4....But I LOVE New Vegas.While actual gunplay and animation is mediocre, the characters, world and story is what keeps this game as one of the best of the last generation, and one of the best in the Fallout series. Bethesda should've taken notes from Obsidian, but the newest installment just doesn't live up to its name, compared to Fallout: New Vegas.You're not a concerned parentYou're not a middle aged white protagonistAnd you're not looking for an oversized maggot character model that we're supposed to call a childYOU, good sir/madam, are a FORMER courier from Primm, a settlement in the Mojave Wasteland, left for dead by some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high roller wannabe. You wake up in a tumbleweed settlement named Goodsprings, and go out to claim your revenge, and shape yourself to be WHO YOU WANT TO BE and the world AS YOU SEE FIT. While you may be the best in some aspects, this game will assure you that you are NOT a god on earth, or a wasteland deity, but just a guy or girl that is just good at what he/she does in order to survive and leave an imprint on post-apocalyptic America.There is no 4 choice dialogue crap, there is no binary form of morality in terms of how you play and impact the world, nor are there any quests that are just there for grinding.Your story is A STORY, and it is up to you to make the best of your time in the Mojave Wasteland from the beginning, to the end.Ladies and gentlemen, in the end, this game brings to you an excellent story, RPG mechanics, characters, a breathing world, plenty of diversity, and so much more that if you choose this over FO4, I can assure you that you are not missing on anything, but rather are making the smartest decision. This games needs you. And when you boot it up, it will not bound some of your choice with Bethesda's chains, but greet you with open arms, and welcome you into New Vegas in hopes that you will, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it you will, enjoy your stay.

												Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation. It takes the fundamentals of the classic Fallout games and puts them into the Fallout 3 engine, giving fans of the original games a true successor. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, New Vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original Fallout series, and whose strengths are writing and solid role-playing mechanics, and it shows. The writing throughout New Vegas is phenomenal, and no matter what type of character you want to play, the game was made with you in mind. You constantly feel rewarded for your choices. Hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game, having to get food, water, and sleep. For a real challenge, check out the mod Josh Sawyer (lead designer) made for the game. It takes hardcore mode to a whole new level.I also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for New Vegas, since it has the best DLC suite I've ever experienced. Each of them is brilliantly crafted, expanding the story of New Vegas in interesting ways. Furthermore, the DLC is foreshadowed throughout the main game, and the DLC can cause changes in the main game as well. If you only get the DLC for one game, make it this one.I can't recommend this game enough.			",316,101,4,51,15,1,39

												If you haven't played this game yet on PC than what are you doing?With improved gameplay and dialogue desicions that make it vastly superior to fallout 3 but also the exploration didn't feel as tedious or boring due to enough variety in the locations to make each area unique and feel part of the mojave wasteland.Even though two out of the four main dlcs are actually quite solid (honest hearts and old world blues) the modding community has helped to make this games lifespan survive longer than what Obsidian ever could do. With new weapons (some inspired by other games), texture packs, quest lines and new areas to explore it means that their is much more to do in the land of the mojave.Fallout 3 was my childhood RPG but New Vegas is my personal preference of a Role Playing game where your character is actually the main focus on how the world changes around you.Would recommend a solid 9.5/10			",233,17,8,22,11,0,28

												If you like Adventure RPGs like i do, you're going to love this gamePros:-I'll start with the most creative way to start a game.-Unique Characters that you won't see in any other game (Specially if you get the DLCs).-Different kinds of weapons:Wanna kill a bandit with an antenna, go for it!Do you wish yo slash bugs with a fire convered sword, hack em all!Want do duel people in a Western Cowboy style? V.A.T.S with that.Wanna blow up an entire factory filled with super mutants, blow em up!Wanna unload an entire clip killing an entire town, be my guest.Want to exterminate an entire army of Robo-Scorpions with a Mini-nuke, as long as you don't kill yourself, DO IT IS FUN!But take care of your weapons, the get dammaged over time.-Expansive World to explore (I haven't found all the locations yet).-Thousands of Quests to do (Believe me, i have more that 50 hours and i still haven't finished the main quest because of the secondary quests, plus the DLC ones).-Amazing Soundtrack-The quantity of mods is astonishing (From super inmersive mods that would kill you faster than a Dark Souls playthough to Kinky mods for kinky people ;) ).Big 8 Hours long DLCs (Each) with challenges for those that call themselves ""OP"".Cons:-Limited Character Customization (Nothing a good mod can't fix though).-Level cap to 30, but you can add 5 more level per DLC you get, untill you get a total of 50 (Like i said before: nothin' a good mod can't fix).Fallout: New Vegas is a game that is really worth buying, is fun, gives you an adventure feeling you might be looking for, or just a game to kill Monsters, Super Mutants, Humans, Animals, etc.If you are looking for any of this things, Fallout: New Vegas is a game made just for you. 9.5/10			",80,10,3,10,4,0,5

												Fallout New Vegas is a game that comes around only once in a decade. Maybe two decades. It's just one of those games where you either love it and think that it's the best game that has ever been made to represent the fallout universe, or you hate it because you are a sad person who hates fun (or just doesn't enjoy these kinds of games which I can understand. To each their own.) I've put in over 300+ hours on steam officially and probably another 200+ hours offline. The modding community for this game is....well its like nothing I have ever seen before. There is a mod for almost everything. I took great pleasure in modding this game to the point where it nearly crashed many times and yet I still played on. If you like a game where the choices you make actually matter, where the people you meet are interesting and have a story to tell, and if you just love getting to take pot shots at drugged up junkies with explosive anti-tank rounds, this game is for you. ∞/10. Would come back as the Courier to kill Benny again.  ",263,26,0,28,17,0,42

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and Intellegint speach options the dryer mercilless expense of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that have scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4. What seemed like a simple 10/10 has taken a turn for the worst. IGN representitive 1: You got the review you wanted, so pay up.Todd Howard: You're crying about a review pally.IGN representitive 2: Guess who's community is wakin' up over here?Todd Howard: Time to cash in.IGN representitive 1: Will you get it over with?Todd Howard: Maybe EA kills franchises without looking the community in the face, but I ain't EA. You made your last honest review kid. Sorry you got twisted up in this buisness. From where your review stands, it must seem like an 7/10 run of bad luck. Truth is... The Franchise was rigged from the start.Parallax Concept PresentsASteam Community ReviewFallout: New Franchise			",141,6,0,10,9,0,7

												Allow me to ask you a simple question:Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas?I know, I know. This is something we think every day... but I want you to REALLY think about it. Which game is better? Fallout 3 or New Vegas? Back when New Vegas was released, many critics said it was the equivalent of an expansion pack to Fallout 3 and passed it off as just more of the same without being anything special. Yet now many people argue that New Vegas isn't just the better game... that it might be the best game in the Fallout series.Of course, I'm not one to throw stones in this debate. I've only played Fallout 3 and New Vegas so I can only give opinions on this much smaller debate. God, I'm making this sound more important than it actually is.So, I've never been a big fan of Fallout 3. I enjoyed the time I played it when it came out and then I played the GOTY edition on my second playthrough, and I've considered buying it a third time but I'm always reminded about the stuff in Fallout 3 I didn't like, further emphasized by an interesting video called ""Fallout 3 Is Garbage, and Here's Why"". If you're not easily provoked, I recommend this video. It really reveals the chinks in Fallout 3's design.Obsidian is a very underrated gaming company in my opinion. They've made a couple of my favorite games. And what they did with New Vegas was similar to what they did earlier with Knights of the Old Republic: they took an old idea that was good and tweaked it a bit to make it so much better, added better writing, and shoved in a ton of bugs and glitches. Hey, I didn't say they were perfect. I said they were underrated.So New Vegas is made very similarly to Fallout 3 but small tweaks by Obsidian have made this a wholly different experience. Firstly, the story is a massive improvement. Fallout 3 failed to connect with me because it felt far more like I was following in the footsteps of my Liam Neeson dad without feeling like I was creating my own journey. Sure there were some clever ideas and fun setpieces here and there but the story as a whole was kind of flat. And that's mainly because the writing handled the conflict from the Enclave (and also between good and evil) in a traditional black-and-white view of morality.Fallout: New Vegas is a story of choice. The city of New Vegas is ruled independently by a silent overseer named Mr. House but from the East rises a new foe, Caesar's Legion. Their Roman dictatorships guides them to conquering New Vegas in the name of order. They aren't malicious moustache-twirlers. They have clear motivations and justifiable reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. Along with them is the New California Republic, sticking stubbornly to Old World democratic ways. As a decicive battle begins to rise, you must choose the best possible fate for New Vegas- keep it under Mr. House, vote for the NCR's control, conquer it with Caesar, or... find your own unique path. There is no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" which makes the decisions feel more personal rather than me sticking to a traditional good and evil mentality like the bullsh** karma system in Fallout 3. Of course, on top of that the side quests handle this similar morality as you are given difficult decisions on what is the best to do. Do you choose to destroy or build? Each comes with a cost and a repercussion when chosen, and it's very believable. Of course, not only did the story keep me playing for 70 house (F***... that's depressing) but also the gameplay is very addicitng. You customize your own character as the Courier and embark your quest, as is expected with most RPGs, but the leveling system is so easy to manipulate in order to beef up your character to their best possible stats and all the hidden locations, secret weapons, and amazing side quests kept me hopping from one objective to the next.The world of New Vegas is also much more aesthetically pleasing than Fallout 3's grimy green and dirty brown Washington D.C. New Vegas has bright blue skies and massive golden deserts lying beneath it. During both day and night, the Mojave is constantly a dynamic and enjoyable place to explore and there's enough variety to the world to keep you wanting to explore the whole area... while... on... foot.If you plan on buying the Ultimate Edition, you'll also be getting several DLC packs, including the 4 added story packs. I'll give a mini-review each of them.Dead Money: Fun trip going back to having little supplies and learning to survive. It's a bit on the hard side though, especially at a random middle point in the game and some obnoxious speakers scattered around the map. But the story is pretty decent and the Sierra Madre looks amazing.Honest Hearts: Much cooler in concept than execution. The world of Zion looks amazing, especially with the added weather effects, but the story is clearly another conflict of two different ideas on how to confront a problem and you choose the option without feeling very invested because the story really loses steam when you realize that it's 80% fetch quests.Old World Blues: It's pretty enjoyable. The intro is too cringe-y and long of a start until you actually starts playing the game... until you get over the first hour difficulty hump where you try to find the right weapons that actually affect your enemies. But the world is kooky, fun to explore, and the ending was oddly unexpected but still believable. That and the new weapons are very useful.Lonesome Road: Definitely my favorite. It adds some much-needed backstory to the Courier (which I think is more of a fault in the main game for not having that) but the Divide is incredible. It's a hard play-through (especially when considered to the Hoover Dam battle) but the ending is satisfying to watch unfold. If you don't get any of the DLC packs, at least get this one.Of course, there are some problems too. The game crashed on me more often than my dad's jalopy and there were a couple bugs and awkward conversations with something blocking the other character's face. That and the voice-acting isn't the best. A lot of actors play their roles very same-y and don't variate their voices enough so that most everyone sounds the same.Despite this, I think Fallout: New Vegas improved massively on the initial formula set up by Fallout 3 by adding in more mature moral dilemmas, a more-interesting world, and some fantastic ideas for quests. Sure there are some problems, but this is a game I played in my past that has gotten better with age for sure. I'm giving Fallout: New Vegas a 9/10.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												It's been a few years since I've played this game, but still it comes up in conversation for what it did right, and how it left it's mark on meFor me, good writing is the truly vital part of any game that hangs the world, and by extension- the gameplay, off of a strong narrative. So many games are written like a book that's then interpreted into a game, there's rarely any crossover, and if there is any, it's usually contrived. Fallout 3 springs to mind.New Vegas isn't like thatFor example, one faction, caesar's legion, was a thorn in my side for many hours. I read what they did, I heard from people how they did it, I saw for myself the effects they had. Eventually through the story they offended me enough that I got my gun, went to their camp, and killed every last one, caesar included. Right after, I tracked down a person they famously tortured and mutilated close to death years earlier -totally on my own volition mind- and the very first thing you can tell him is that Caesar is dead. He has outlived his closest enemy.I was a courier for my own delivery. The fact I could do that tells me an awful lot about the writing of this game. They understood the Courier. They understood me, the player.From there it only got better, mostly in the DLC stories. One taught me that sometimes it's best to just let go. Another taught me to respect my role as a courier, to think about the results of my actions and to see things from another perspective.I realized in horrifyingly clear terms, that by giving in to my anger and desperation by killing the people I hated, I was no better than the people who dropped the bombs that ended the world. This wasn't forced or even directly addressed, this was something I actually did, and I changed as a result. I now understood why the burned man wasn't happier that I had killed caesar. This same righteous hatred put him in bandages years earlier.Having some of the biggest plot points be informed by what type of game this is, how the player might play it, that has the largest impact. That is what makes this game special. There are ideas, not just dialogue and conversations with X or Y result. The writer's must have actually played the game.By the end, I was faced with the final big decision, to decide the fate of the mojave.I considered my effect on history, what all sides wanted and why, what the people and their stories on my journey had taught me; what ulysses had told me. And finally, next to the hoover dam, I made the best possible decision for everyone.I let go. I stopped playing.And I never went back.			",136,23,5,10,14,1,14

Heartaches by the numbers, troubles bythe score- everyday you love me less,each day I love you more~-Day 1 without Miss NovocaineShe's left me. After five years of beinga couple with her since entering highschool, my girlfriend has left me.I am horribly depressed, but I beginmy ritual of logging into Steam in themorning. The Fallout Franchise Saleis in full swing, and New Vegas temptsme so. I consider buying the game.I believe I am going through somethingakin to withdrawal symptoms. I miss hertouch, her laugh, her smile. My handsgrasp air, as I swear I can still smellMs. Novocaine's scent about my bed.I break down, crying. Ms. Novocaineleft me on the first day of the holidays,the time before college. My plans withher up in smoke, I blubber and buy theUltimate Edition of New Vegas.Fallout: New Vegas downloads fastenough. I begin the game with a bulletthrough my head, buried alive and leftfor dead. The game opens up its storyneatly and cleanly, telling me I was justan everyman hired to do a job whichwent horribly downhill. The world is now mine to explore, whatwith me having cheated death and theoptions to pursue multiple paths haveopened for me. With trusty six-shooterin hand, I leave the dusty backwatertown I recovered from my beating inand venture into the bleak world onthe frontier.-Day 15 without Miss NovocaineI have become a veritable recluse. In thetime that has passed, the feelings for Ms.Novocaine have not dulled, but my heart aches even more for her. How can this be?She's started seeing a lanky, fashionableart student. Then a new, stereotypicalbiker bad-boy. I hear she's begun sleepingabout. My heart breaks a little more witheach shred of news I overhear.In New Vegas, my vengeance is tenfold.I brandish and alternate between a lever-action cowboy shooter and a revolverwhich would make Ocelot approve.I undertake multiple quests, but stickto the main quest to restore the fortunesof my employer, the mysterious Mr. Houseand his casino the Lucky 38. I encounterboth the NCR (New California Republic)and the savage Caesar's Legion, led bythe terminally dying Emperor Caesar.-Day 30 without Miss NovocaineI've completed a good chunk of the mainstoryline by playing two sides between theNCR and Mr House's outlying Casino forces.Perhaps on my next playthrough, I shall bea cruel sadist and throw in with the Legion.No matter, the DLC of the game shall keepme company on these cold nights alone.I instantly regret playing Dead Money first,as I soon discover that compared to the others which are of incredible quality, it isDead Money that is the most exceptional.After a few tears sting my eyes at the endof Dead Money, I dive into Honest Hearts,and meet the enigmatic Burned Man at histable of seemingly endless M1911s. His mission clear and his soul reborn, theBurned Man extends his hand out to me so that I may join in his crusade against the savage White Legs tribe, allies of Caesar's Legion.-Day 45 without Miss NovocaineI've done it. I've returned to the main storyand fought the final battle at Hoover Damagainst the new leader of Caesar's Legion,the towering and brutal Legate Lanius.Armed with all that I can carry and drapedin an NCR Ranger's trenchcoat and Chinese Stealth Helmet, I finish the leader of theLegion on behalf of Master House with mynow-signature Revolver.I still have two more DLCs to complete, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road,where the latter serves as an epilogueto my character's original story from themain game. I stifle a yawn and take a long hard look at myself in the reflection of my monitor as I put my computer to 'sleep' mode.Time I got some sleep myself.-Day 65 without Miss NovocaineFinished Lonesome Road last night, andhere I am stifling more yawns in the lineto apply at College on this hot Mondaymorning. A good epilogue after all thathappened in Fallout, but I did wish thatthe main villain, 'Ulysses' would havejust shut up rather than droned on as hedid in Lonesome Road.My mind wanders to Ms. Novocaine as Itry to remember any shred or scrap I canof her. It frustrates me to no end that Ican barely remember, especially after allthe time we've spent together. Did NewVegas really help get over my flightyex-girlfriend? Surely not...Lost in my thoughts of Ms. Novocaineand considering replaying Fallout: NewVegas from a different perspective, I failto see the pale perfection of a girl, dressedin gothic petticoat and corset and daubedin black, blue and silver, knocking intoher and throwing her application papersabout.Dumbstruck, I apologize profusely, buta stare which could stop a clock tickingfrom her hazel eyes meet mine. She blowsa stray blue lock of hair away from hereyes and pays no attention to me.""I'm- I'm so sorry- I was just thinkingabout my application, and Fallout, and-""She perks up at the mention of Fallout,while kneeling down to retrieve herpapers. ""...the Fallout sale? I thought itended already?"" I tell her about howI've been playing it since the sale, andhow well it's been, as both a game anda journey of self-reflection.""What course you apply for?"" She tersely says. It sounds more of a demand. I gulpa bit, intimidated by this beautiful girlwho seems dangerous and skilled. I tellher I applied for Arts and Psychology.The girl has a deadpan look now, beforeshe breathes out in boredom. ""Huh. Itseems we're going to be classmates, loser."" She's collected her papers,but I manage to grab hold of her bookthat she dropped in the commotion.""Let me carry your things. It's the leastI can do."" I tell her, as I feel a fierce heatwell up behind my cheeks. ""Please. Letthis loser make up for his clumsiness,Miss...?"" She scowls, before handingme all of her papers and strutting off.""Come on, Fallout Boy. I don't have allday."" She beckons, her voice laced withirritation. She almost looks beautiful, asbeautiful as Ms. Novocaine was, if notmore so. ""Walk me home while carryingall my things.

												Honestly, having played Fallout 3, Fallout NV with all the DLCs and recently Fallout 4..NV really stands out as the game that captures the spirit of the Fallout universe the best.It can be a tough game to get into if you're not used to what Fallout is about.In short, you can do anything you want in no real particular order, the NV universe is big and diverse, and allows for plenty of hours of amazing gaming. You'll have some emotional moments (especially in the DLC..), some WTFmoments, and you'll have loads of laughs.For me, this is a must have for every gamer. Just buy it :)			",80,18,1,15,10,0,9

												I, along with an unfortunately large number of people, was not too fond of New Vegas when it was released. My original review was littered with complaints about bugs, issues, uneven difficulty, and so on. However, with Fallout 4 on the horizon, I think I'm going to miss Obsidian. They have (or had) an understanding of what I appreciate most about the series, and it took me almost five years to realize it. Don't know what you got till it's gone? When it comes to the post-apocalyptic wasteland; once you've seen one bombed-out building filled with skeletons, you've seen them all. I got my fill of ""destroyed-beauty"" in Fallout 3. I expect something a little more intriguing. New Vegas creates a more thoughtful world. The characters are interesting, the stories are imaginative, and there's always that superb twist of dark humor. It ain't pretty though, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Speaking from a strict game-design perspective, the Mojave is amazing. There's a linear structure, which works well for first-timers. In subsequent play-throughs you'll know where to go, how to get around those freakin' cazadores, and create your own path. If you focus entirely on the main quest-line, the average play-through is roughly 5-10 hours. Naturally, once you factor in all of the additional content (side-quests, DLC, mods, etc) that time balloons into absurdity. I think it's perfect. I also really appreciate that this game doesn't employ level-scaling. But the Mojave is not only a desert, it's also a desert that suffered through a nuclear war. Even New Vegas itself is just a few casinos and some lights. If you didn't notice the details, you'd think it was the blandest place imaginable.The details are where New Vegas absolutely shines. Each ""dungeon"" has a story to tell, some (like Vault 11) are among the best the genre has conceived. It helps to pay attention to posters, and even subtleties like what somebody was holding before they died, or how some everyday objects are arranged. This is what I appreciate the most from Fallout's jump to 3D. Though I have a soft spot for reading a paragraph of text when I right-click on a broken vent, sometimes I just want to be able to see that it is in fact a broken vent and move on. Not only are there multiple endings, there are also several methods for getting to them. Every quest has numerous solutions, and if you can't be bothered, then just crack skulls until you're allowed to progress. The faction system is also quite interesting (especially now that it works), and it's nice to have actual consequences. Bethesda's obsession with essential NPCs drives me insane. Diplomacy is also extremely effective. Not only can you talk people out of fighting, but you can talk people into fighting for you. In a couple play-throughs, I sat back while my allies did all of heavy-lifting, even for the climatic Hoover Dam battle. On the flipside, there isn't any ""benefit"" to playing a stupid character. This is the unfortunate side-effect of higher production values. Everyone has to be voice-acted, and there's no time to record hundreds of lines to satisfy low-intelligence play-throughs. Playing an idiot in Fallout 2 was so much fun. The combat mechanics are...well they're still rather poor. This is something that I've grown to accept with this game. We can't expect all games to be at the level of FEAR 1 when it comes to shooting, but FO3/NV are content with barely passable. After all these years though, I guess I've just grown tired of pointing it out. I never paid much attention to combat in the 2D Fallout games. It might be considered strategic, but for me it's only entertaining when I knock a chunk out of somebody with a sledgehammer, critically hit someone with an advanced karate move that kills them instantly, or shoot their eyes out with limited edition red ryder BB gun. Basically, when I get into a fight in Fallout, I only care about the results. I punch someone, someone turns into dog food, and that's good enough.Since this is a review of a Bethesda game on the PC, I might as well talk about mods. With Skyrim, I got almost all of my enjoyment through modding. With New Vegas? It isn't really necessary. There are a handful of mods that I think are essential: New Vegas Stutter Remover*, Mission Mojave, and Project Nevada. Once you grab those, you're pretty much set. Now I'm not saying that's all you'll ever want in terms of mods, but it's more than sufficient for playing and enjoying the base-game. The only other notable mods I have installed are A World of Pain and Daughters of A.R.E.S. AWOP adds hundreds of dungeons, which can be fun to shoot through. I have ARES installed because the courier is actually a cool-looking robot with anime-colored hair. This is totally immersive and most certainly canon. Also when playing New Vegas, instead of listening to ""Starrrrrrrrs of the midnight rangers"" for the billionth time, I listen to non-stop Eurobeat.In short: I have a new-found appreciation for this awesome game. *Mission Mojave might make this mod unnecessary, I'm not sure.

												This is by far my favorite Fallout game. (Just after Fallout 2)The intro is short and to the point.. No info who your dad is, or your mom, or your childhood friends, or just about everything that could ruin your character building. Here you wake up after being shot in the damn face by someone who wants to take the package you were supposed to deliver. You then wake up with your personal mission to track down the man who did this♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you chose a female... well. just do that and choose the Black Widow perk.. You'll laugh. And while your trying to find that guy, you'll probably notice how much nicer the world looks now, not as boring anymore either. Side quests are a lot fun, except some usual ""Go to Point A, now go to Point B, now go to Point A again"" quests.. they are a little annoying as they offer no real sense of accomplishment other than some XP rewards and maybe a small amount of caps. (But you can kind of expect those in a RPG game.) Resources can also be quite rare in this game, like Stimpacks and drugs. (If you've played Fallout 4 you'll probably know how common they are in that game) This offers a nice feeling of being out of supplies constantly.. which is always appreciated, as finding items now feels a lot better, and it also helps the roleplaying and the overall immersion.. and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game immersive. The music helps greatly! and the overall atmosphere in a lot of places just makes you sad.. seeing corpses and briefcases and their items they had on them before the bombs.. The atmosphere is amazing here. And the leveling is rewarding. And all the perks seems very useful which makes it hard to choose. Oh and also.. The sense of progression is once again just fantastic. When you first start.. almost every enemy is scary.. Deathclaws are horrifying, Casadors are poisonous a-holes and you just need to stay away from those.. Then at level 20 you can take on the Casadors with just a rifle shot or two. Then at level 30 you'll just go up close to the Deathclaws with a Hunting Shotgun and blow off their faces.. One major problem I have.. is the Invisible Walls.. They're some of the most annoying things I've ever ""seen"" in an open world rpg.. They really want you to take specific paths to quests and other areas.. you're not allowed to find shortcuts by jumping on rocks or anything else that would seem logical to climb.. which just pisses me off when I should easily be able to pass over a little rock but there's an invisible wall in the way.. and sometimes they'll literally get you stuck inside them for some weird reason. Also some quests are bugged to hell and back. Which was never fixed, so I'd suggest installing some mods for that. Here's a list of what is good yo! Weapons, A lot of the quests, Progression, Perks, Dialogues, Enemies, Weapon Modifications. Fantastic!			",225,39,0,21,17,0,33

												Somewhere between convincing a young boy to hand over the trigger for an orbital death laser, and running into a trio of elderly women howling for my blood after I reprogrammed a sexbot to work for the local bar, I found myself thinking, ""This might be one of the best RPGs I've ever played.""More than any other game in recent memory, Fallout: New Vegas is an RPG that encourages - and rewards - you for exploring strange or out-there possibilities. Whether you want to be the savior of the Mojave Wasteland or the Devil Incarnate when it comes to the way you deal with the world and its residents, this game actively relishes in allowing you to mold the experience in any way, shape or form you choose.As a courier who is double-crossed and shot in the head, the game immediately sets itself apart from previous Fallout titles (which all had you start in a Vault and bring you slowly into the outside world) by having you wake up in a small town and immediately get caught up in a (sometimes-overwhelming) amount of oddball characters, sidequests and machinations from various factions within the Mojave. When you set out, you'll quickly find yourself making enemies, running across all sorts of strange locations and getting lost in a mountain of sidequests that will quickly have you glued to your computer saying ""just one more mission"".The most interesting aspect of the game is the care that's taken to giving the player unique, memorable experiences. Whether it's strolling into a new town as the sound of Marty Robbins' ""Big Iron"" plays on your Pip-Boy radio, the oddball encounters given by the Wild Wasteland perk, the unmarked quests peppered throughout the wasteland or the fact that you can literally run around killing everything and everyone (up to and including the heads of major factions), the game has an unbeatable sense of world-building and freedom. You can quite literally massacre everyone and still achieve an ending that's on par (or arguably better) than one of the faction endings.Much care has also been given to the wide assortment of companions you can recruit throughout the game, who all provide incredible benefits during combat. They all have their own quirks and unique conversations, strong companion quests, insight into the various factions and amusing chatter during combat and encounters. Likewise, it shows how much care Obsidian Entertainment put into the game when you see some of the minor NPCs, who have surprisingly-intricate conversations and mini-questlines.New Vegas also has some of the most interesting and, I would argue, iconic encounters and quest designs in the entire series. Whether it's the surreal ""social experiment"" in Vault 22 (and arguably, the rest of the Vaults in the Mojave), menial tasks like the picture-taking sidequest at the south end of the Vegas Strip, or just being able to sell your companion to a group of high-society cannibals for no other reason than ""for the evulz"", the game does an incredible job of keeping things fresh and varied throughout a playthrough.The most interesting thing is that you can play the game a number of different ways and get a different experience every time. The first time I beat the game, I was doing a completionist ""goody-two-shoes"" run where I saved everyone I could and was incredibly thorough. When I went back for a second run, I played as a female melee expert who ran around stealth-killing everyone with sneak attacks, but couldn't shoot guns to save her life. The flexibility and care given to making both character builds have unique advantages is the main part of why New Vegas continues to have such replay value.Of course, there's also the modding community, which has given the game unparalleled longevity, both through restored content (like the New Vegas Uncut series on Nexusmods) or major gameplay overhauls like Project Nevada. Even if it wasn't on sale, the game is still incredible value thanks to the amount of content both in the game and contributed by the community.I highly recommend New Vegas for anyone getting into the genre. It's one of my favorite Western RPGs, and an experience that keeps rewarding me time and time again.			",1970,825,79,262,266,29,338

												GAME CRASHING AFTER INTRO CINEMATIC? SOLUTION HERE:Hey everybody! This is a great game (played it on console before) but I was having issues with it crashing after the initial cinematic on my PC. This issue stems from some game files not being able to recognize newer video cards. Essentially, you have to add a file to the game folder and it should run.STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMUpon initial launch of the game, a pop-up window should appear stating what graphics level the game suggests after detecting your graphics card. If this does not happen, you're in the right place.STEP 2: DOWNLOAD WINRARWinRAR is a free application that allows you to open RAR and ZIP files. You need this because the file you'll have to add is a RAR file. You can download WinRAR from this link: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm Make sure to download the proper one for your PC. STEP 3: DOWNLOAD RAR FILEThis is the ""unopened"" file you're going to add to the game folder. Download the ""d3d9dll"" file here: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34778/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fnewvegas%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D34778&pUp=1The ""main"" file worked perfectly for me. You can click on the description tab for the author's comments if you'd like.STEP 4: OPEN THE DLL FILE WITH WINRARAttempting to open the DLL file should open it in WinRAR immediately. Click on the file in the WinRAR interface, then click ""Extract To"" in the toolbar.STEP 5: PUT THE FILE IN THE FALLOUT NV FOLDERThe ""Extract To"" option should open up a new window asking where you want to put the DLL file. Navigate to the Fallout NV folder (C:\(Hard Drive) -> Program Files (x86) -> Steam -> steamapps -> common -> Fallout New Vegas).STEP 6: ENJOY FALLOUT NVThat should do it. Please note that this solution worked for me as of 10/23/16. Download files and applications at your own risk. I am not responsible for any viruses/damage these sites may cause. This solution worked for me without any issues, but that is just my personal experience. I believe that I had to do a similar fix last year for Fallout 3, so if you're having issues with that, the solution should be similar. Good luck!			",51,2,0,7,4,0,4

												Many people leave the game running to clock ridiculous numbers of hours and say something stupid, like, ""it's okay"".I didn't. I've clocked each and every one of these hours with actual gameplay (or modding and testing), and it is far far more than merely ""okay"".  If you've been living under a rock and you still haven't gotten around to playing this yet, you're missing out. I can't even count the number of characters I've played through to varying stages of completion -- probably in the forties by now. With Tale of Two Wastelands porting over all of the Fallout 3 GOTY content (if you own that one too), the hours I've clocked and the numbers of characters I've played have tripled.Sure, it's buggy. The graphics were outdated when they came out, let alone for 2016. The 50's schtick wore thin enough in Fallout 3 and they tried lampshade-hanging on it in this one, but all they wound up doing is showing how stupid it is to run around with a lampshade on. Some questionable design decisions, sometimes linear plot, invisible walls, vast tracts of empty. Dialogue that sometimes vastly misses your actual motivations (where's my ""Because I don't like being used!"" option when playing the Wild Card?).But this game is ten times the roleplaying game that Fallout 4 even dreams of being, and twice the game that Fallout 4 actually is.

												New Vegas is a proper Fallout game. The lore's there and the story is rich and diverse, with many different endings, albeit missing a proper post-game feature like Fallout 3 did.Obsidian, ever the company that is rushed into releasing their products, also unfortunately did not have enough time to properly playtest this game, and thus, expect a lot of bugs, some of them quite annoying. Game's a bit crashy as well. Thankfully, we're blessed with mod support, and they fix many of the issues present.Gameplay's slightly better but never look at this game as a proper FPS, because the engine was never adequate for it. Do expect hundreds of hours, because although it is set in a desert, you'd be surprised at the amount of locations it has.The DLC can be a bit hit and miss. Gun Runners Arsenal adds a few fun weapons but nothing mandatory. Dead Money had great plot, but terrible gameplay. Old World Blues was pretty funny, but had a few bugs and at times I thought they were trying too hard. Lonesome Road was linear but pretty tight, with great pacing and story. Honest Hearts was probably the weakest, because Zion and its denizens didn't really interest me, except for one character. Not saying who it is, but if you've played it you'll know who I'm talking about. New Vegas is an RPG through and through. The characters are original and engaging, especially the possible companions you can have, their personality trump anything Fallout 3's companions could offer. The choices you make impact the game and nothing is ever black and white in this world. I recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat. Games like these are few and far between.

One of the best games I've ever played: Fallout: New VegasPros: Great Factions Great Weapons Great Characters/Voice acting Hard to choose an ending (Means the game is good) Smooth gameplay Excellent DLCs Great creatures/enemies Amazing quests Great Modding CommunityCons:  No major changes in graphics from Fallout 3 When you complete the last of either quest you choose as your ending, you can't play from there you have to restart at the Hoover Dam or whatever save you choose to restart from (I brought this up due to Fallout 3 having this included)Overall the game was fantastic! I know I said I love the graphics in the pros, but hey I had to include atleast one con. And they could've improved the gaphics by just a bit, but I understand its an open world game and those usually dont have the best graphics due to lag and other various problems. I would rate the game 10/10. But my main reason for the rating 10 is because you can choose sides with different factions unlike Fallout 3. Plus in Fallout 4 you're most likely gonna choose to side with the protagonists of the game. In Fallout: New Vegas, however, its hard to choose what faction you wanna side with. ",112,3,0,7,2,0,2

Just, this game is just full of it. Story is pretty decent as all the side quests are very enjoyable. I only have a few hours into this game seeing as I already finished it on the PS3.This game is really addictive and got me finishing it plenty of times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always heard that people liked Fallout 3 better than New Vegas. To me, it should be the other way around. New Vegas is better that Fallout 3 in countless ways.-The story is much more complex than Fallout 3's story. In Fallout 3, it was as simple as Brotherhood=Good Guys and Enclave=Bad Guys. New vegas has a nonlinear, choose-your-own-path storyline: Help Caesar's Legion conquer New Vegas, give the NCR control over New Vegas and the Hoover Dam, or fight for an independent New Vegas. There are also numerous smaller factions that you can join or fight. There is a massive amount of player involvement in the world, and your actions in one faction may affect your reputation with another. Not only does this make the game's story more interesting, it also gives the game immense replay value.-Did the Capitol Wasteland in Fallout 3 feel empty? I know that it takes place in the aftermath of a global nuclear war, but the world of Fallout 3 felt barren and boring. In New Vegas, there are plenty of locations to explore and loot around the Mojave Wasteland.-The weapon variety in Fallout 3 pales in comparison to New Vegas. Fallout 3 had about 50 different types of weapons, whereas New Vegas has over twice as many.-Fallout: New Vegas actually allows the player to look down the sights of the gun they are holding, rather than the zooming-in effect that Fallout 3 had. If you liked 3's method of aiming better, then don't worry; you can toggle ironsights.-In Fallout 3, you could only repair weapons up to a certain point, and that point was determined by the repair skill. In New Vegas, Weapons can be repaired to 100% no matter the repair skill. The repair skill instead determines how efficient  you are at repairing a gun (For example, a person with a repair level of 80 would need less materials to repair a weapon than a person who had a repair level of 30.)-Fallout 3 has almost no color whatsoever. Most of the time, the screen is filled with a dull gray. Even when looking at what should be a gorgeous sunrise, the world is bathed in gray. New Vegas has much more color compared to Fallout 3, which is admittedly not very difficult to accomplish. Granted, it's nowhere near as colorful and vivid as Fallout 4, but at least the player doesn't have to stare at the world through a monotonous gray filter all the time.-I will concede that the DLCs in Fallout 3 are interesting. However, New Vegas' DLCs tell much better stories. In addition to their own individual stories, the DLCs in New Vegas all tell the story of another courier, ""Ulysses"". In each DLC, the player finds out more and more of Ulysses' story and learns more and more about who he is until the confrontation in the ""Lonesome Road"" DLC (to be honest, Ulysses' story is much better the second time through, when you can catch all the  minor details).-In New Vegas, unwanted ammunition can be broken down and crafted into different ammuntion, allowing the player to destroy ammo for a weapon that is rarely used in order to create ammo for a weapon that the player uses frequently.-The option of hardcore mode in New Vegas presents an added challenge if the game seems too simple or easy. The player muust manage their hydration, food, and sleep. If they neglect any of these for too long, they suffer negative effects and ultimately die.-Nearly all of these points add to the replay value of the New Vegas, which is something that Fallout 3  did not do very well. In New Vegas, you can side with different factions, use different weapons, explore different areas, complete different quests, learn different things, etc.Overall, New Vegas feels like more thought went into its production, despite only being in development for a year and a half.

												Fallout New Vegas is one of my most favorite games ever.  It's just as amazing as Fallout 3, but the game is a bit on the lighter side astmosphere wise. Instead of taking place on the east coast like Fallout 3, This takes place on the west coast and gives the game that more cowboy southern feel to it. I also find the story to be a tad more enjoyable just because it's so different and refreshing from Fallout 3. I'm normally not a fan of shooter games, but Fallout is amazing! I suggest you give this game a try, I'm sure it will be one of your favorites in no time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout: New Vegas is probably a great example of what a fallout game should be like. I love the location in Las Vegas area and the mojave desert and the storyline is ok pretty good. If just coming from Fallout 3, you may find the game slightly different from the previous game. Make sure to check out the great dlc's made for this game. Recommended if you like the newer Fallout game series. The storyline is really my favorite.			",141,67,0,101,29,0,11

												TL;DR below.The good:- Meaningful and plentiful choices. The quests and stories (especially the main one) actually made me stop and ponder for a while what I wanted to do.- So many things to talk about with so many characters.- The role-playing system.- The environments are pretty nice- The DLCs are amazing and worth playing.- Many interesting and engaging characters.- You get to be the mailman who delivers DEATH.- The lack of level scaling.- An ending which didn't infuriate me (unlike Fallout 3 and to some extent Fallout 4).- You can get a house with various appliances that talk to you. Including a seedy machine that seeds soil using seeds.- Moddable.- Perks. Perks. PERKS.- Companions and their provided perks. ED-E is the best.- The physics are hilarious at times.- Many things to do.- The world and all the interesting stories you can find.Note that almost all the problems listed below apply to Fallout 3 as well! Strange, eh?Biggest issue in the game:The karma-system is really bad. I really wish they had opted for scrapping the general karma system and instead only had faction reputation. You may encounter the Brotherhood of Steel (BoS) while exploring the wasteland. If you find their bunker (through sheer coincidence even), they will demand that you surrender and will put an explosive collar on you to put you on trial. If you resist: they turn hostile and will try to kill you, killing them in responce will incur negative karma. I find it strange that the creators of the game create a situation where they (as a some sort of objective arbitrator of right and wrong) say defending yourself against this action is wrong. Additionally, say you murder the entire BoS-chapter (that's what their groups are called), be it through another faction demanding you do so and you abiding, or because you decide to: you may incur some severe karma loss for this action. However, you can ""repent"". How do you ""repent""? By killing more people that are deemed ""evil"" by the game's creators such as fiends (humanoid, always hostile) and feral ghouls (monsters). What. Murdering 12-13 BoS members and letting the rest die in an atomic explosion in the bunker incurs karma penalties that can be undone by killing 7 members of the fiends. Additionally, this makes it really hard to play a evil character by the game's definition of ""evil character"" as you may have to fight enemies that give you positive karma for killing them! This game would've been better off without this system (just like the Mass Effect series!).Other major problems:- Crashes. Lots of them. May be caused by me modding the game, however, I didn't run too many mods - I had 10, 3 of them graphical, 7 of them minor gameplay changes/other. Wasn't too much of a problem as the game autosaves all the time.- While the dialogue system is extensive and great, I really wish there were some more options to speak out against authorities in the respective factions when you're on their side to influence them a bit more.- Glitches all over the place - including some rare ones that makes your game get stuck.Minor problems:- The AI can be kind of bad sometimes. Things like these happen occasionally:

 Other problems include characters not following you through doors if you're supposed to go somewhere with them (always let them go through first), companions running in front of you during gunfights (Lily is very prone to this - somewhat annoying as she goes invisible if you're sneaking), and enemies have strange reactions to stealth attacks - such as not responding to the fact that someone next to them transformed into a red mist and associated bits of flesh and bones on the floor.- Graphics are somewhat dated.- While Fallout 4 is accused of being a ""superhero simulator"" (fair accusation), you can sort of get the same thing going in this game quite easily as well. Certain combos when creating a character gives you a truly godlike character compared to the alternatives - one of the keys is to go with 8 endurance (and get a 9th point through Lonesome Road). Early-game: you can take a lot of hits, late-game: you get +1 to all SPECIAL-stats, passive regen and additional damage threshold - but you need 8 END (or waste perk points through investing in intensive training) to do this. Slightly better balance could've been achieved if the number of implants you could get wasn't determined by your END.- You can't hotkey turbo or implant GRX (both give a slow-motion effect) without a mod (and sometimes during combat you can't bring your Pip-boy up!).- I want the hear the stealth suit's voice, but I don't want it to apply med-x or stimpacks automatically (got a med-x addiction because of this!). The only solution was to install a mod that disables the voice completely.- Some design-related issues (this holds true for at least non-hardcore mode): stimpacks are disproportionally better than everything else healing-wise - they heal insantly, and they do not weigh anything at all. Food weighs, does not heal instantly, and may also give you some rads.- Rads are mostly a redundant as a mechanic except for one place in Lonesome Road that is optional and for characters with some perks that may choose to incur radiation poisoning on purpose.- The crafting system is meh.- The physics may do strange things like this:


Physics!

 (all of this is frozen!)- Some invisible walls here and there.- Some items labeled as things you can only steal (an action which incurs very minor karma loss) when they belong to an opposing faction.One final very minor problem:


Poorly placed outpost

 This outpost is one of the worst things I've seen.If like.. three enemies with some grenades (and maybe a grenade launcher) attacked this place from the position I'm standing in everyone would be wiped out in seconds.More screenshots can be found here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/TZer0/screenshots/?appid=22380TL;DR/Conclusion:Flawed in some ways, but worth the playthrough as it is a lot of fun.

												A work of art reflects and depicts the culture where it is created. This is what Fallout: New Vegas achieves on its best way.Politics are defined here like anywhere else in a videogame.Democrats are represented by the New California Republic -NCR-while Republicans are epitomized by the Legion.Technocracy and dictatorship are Mr House,and Anarchism is the fourth path you can choose to finish the game.Some spoilers here: None of them are perfect. NCR are corrupt and pay no attention to anything but their interests;and Legion are slavers and gynophobic, although true to their word as their ending shows up.Despite the fact that Mr House is one of the best hopes for humanity (you can see the message if you get rid of him), his regime is totalitarian and despotic.No Gods, No Masters ending is also imperfect. Hard to say which one is canon, honestly.End of spoilersAll the relations you establish with every faction, and there is a lot, affects its gameplay and endings, so this game becomes in my opinion the most complex and rewarding I have ever found, and I remember seeing the first arcade Pacman when I was a kid.The quality of the main quest is reinforced by the impressive amount of sidequests. This game is not only about the campaign, you get swallowed by the Wasteland through the sidequests. Even your companions have hidden quests, all of them flawlessly written. You might need to check the wikias, or buy the game's guide (totally worth it, for me at least), to activate them. There are hundreds of hours ahead of pure delightment, and you will have that feeling you get when you read a really good book:""I don't want it to end""New Vegas inherits the spirit of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, in an act of enrichment beyond Fallout 3, even though a good game, not as excellent as this one. Even the humour is pretty as unique and subtle as in the two previous games, (just watch a Legionnaire picking his nose and we'll talk). Or the name of one of its Commanders: Vulpes Inculta (Ignorant Fox in Latin). Just play Old World Blues if you want to have some hillarious laughs. I still smile remembering those conversations, oh God! Suffice to say, if you ever played Fallout 1 & 2, I assure you you'll get shocked when you find some characters in the Wasteland. There is a LOT of references to the previous games. Just like the Wild Wasteland perk, you get it or you just don't even notice. That is, after all, what being cultivated means.And yes, I'd love to see those games remade with nowaydays engines. Sorry, purists.Whereas Fallout 3 was focused on resources -water, more precisely-, New Vegas is a struggle of energy resources and you can notice how everything is twisted around that. Not only this is very clever, but also it is the most mature post-apocalyptic simulator you can find to this date.Mojave Wasteland isn't as huge as other sandboxes, but it is worked to the detail, full of spirit and so plenty of diversity or marvels you can walk those sands for a thousand hours. I can guarantee that.Even though the campaign is close to perfect, New Vegas DLCs, all of them, create a storyline arch which multiplies the game's quality immensely. From Dead Money through Big Empty to the Lonesome Road, there stands a parallel storyline mesmerizing and superbly written. By the way, Lonesome Road which was unfairly critizised for being ""linear"" (aren't all paths linear after all? o.O) contains some of the best this game has to offer.Edit: for those owning Ultimate Edition, think that you should really play the DLCs in order:    Dead Money    Honest Hearts    Old World Blues    Lonesome Road.Voice acting:Simply the best there is. Let's talk about Caesar and get to the point.Every time I found this character I was amazed how charismatic and strong he was.No doubt a superb actor was behind those flawless performance.That actor is John Doman[www.imdb.com]When I was watching The Wire (the best TV series of all time) I was literally shocked when I heard the Commissioner William A. Rawls reprimmending his police officers.That acting strength wasn't similar to New Vegas' Caesar, it WAS Caesar himself!And he was.Same goes for many others. Boone, Veronica, Doc Mitchell... Ulysess.Edit: THE MUSIC:It goes without saying this is some of the best soundtracks ever made. I just want to talk about something else to reinforce how mature, cultivated, and serious, this game is.Driving and listening to this soundtrack I found something amazing: the TITLE of a song.'Jacobstown Ladder'. Inon Zur left an impressive cultural mark even at the level of giving title to the songs. It is a reference to Jacob's Ladder, a Biblical figure whose purpose was to rescue the lost souls and take them to Heaven. If you have ever been in Jacobstown you can see the pun (paronomasia it is also called) and how it is related to the game. I bow in respect to you. Me quito el sombrero. 'Dam Nation' is the song for the Second Battle for Hoover damn. There goes another paronomasia with big balls.Con dos cojones. And there is more: the MODS.(Yes, that thing some economical powers of gaming industry wanted to charge you for).I have not only found gamefixes which work fantastically, but also some writers out there that I do consider cannon of the Fallout universe. I am looking at you, Someguy. Your ""New Vegas Bounties"" are part of this game. Congratulations.Edit: WOW just WOW New Vegas Bounties III. Marko enters the Pantheon of best villains ever made (Kerrigan, Arthas, GLaDOS, make some space because you have a new neighbor)And the story, Someguy, you really got me there, you monster.100 out of 10. To my eyes you are part of Fallout Universe by right.Check ""Paint Your Weapon"", please. ;)There are other fantastic attempts, like for instance ""Dust"", the most extreme survival simulator, although having certain flaws in my personal opinion.Other mods I recommend:    Leather Backpack    Veronica Can Wear Vera's Outfit    Russell    Burning Campfire    HZ Novac Campfire    New Vegas Stutter Remover    The Someguy Series    Enhanced Blood Textures    Tales From The Burning Sands <--     YUP Base Game and all DLCsWhat else can I say?One more thing: what this game means to me. I deleted my previous recommendation, which was one of the most higlhy rated I have, but deep inside I knew I was being unfair to my favourite game.In a few days Fallout 4 will come out.I know it will change many things, and you can bet your moustache Bethesda is going to put a lot of efford to make it a breaking point.I am not saying I am not going to love it.I am just saying it has the most difficult task if it wants to conquer my heart.I left my heart at The Mojave.

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and intelligent speech options the dryer mercilless expanse of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that had scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4. What seemed like a simple 10/10 has taken a turn for the worst. IGN representitive 1: You got the review you wanted, so pay up.Todd Howard: You're crying about a review pally.IGN representitive 2: Guess who's community is wakin' up over here?Todd Howard: Time to cash in.IGN representitive 1: Will you get it over with?Todd Howard: Maybe EA kills franchises without looking the community in the face, but I ain't EA. You made your last honest review kid. Sorry you got twisted up in this buisness. From where your review stands, it must seem like an 7/10 run of bad luck. Truth is... The Franchise was rigged from the start.ASteam Community ReviewFallout: New Franchise			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I need to update this review, how people gave it 79% user approval is astonishing, this review was rather silly and inconsistent.The Fallout Series tripped my trigger during my middle school years, however I was really rude to this game before playing it, and I slumped it with some awful generalization while I was young. Personally this game was one of those most fantastic games I have ever played. It is full of what Obsidian wanted and they deliver a much more fine tuned game compared to what Bethesda released a few years before this. The reason I like this game a lot more than 3 is the fact there is more involvement, lots of things to do, and it is overall an improvement on what Fallout 3 had to offer. Having true iron sights, more customization, a more fluent battling mechanic. Sure the shooting mechanics are often bullcrap, but really they are not so bad as the point it hinders my enjoyment of the game. There is tons of lore, and quite a few interesting questlines. The game feels more massive than what it really is. Exploring is a lot more fun on this game, because there is not a overwhelming feeling of emptiness that you get when you play Fallout 3, and this game offers an overall great experience to those that liked the early Fallout games, but hated the turn based combat mechanism. Yes, this game still isnt the most RPG of the Fallout series, but it is definitely better at being an RPG than the Bethesda games. The companions on this game are much more interesting and they have more involvement with the story, as the end potrays. Your character feels like he has much more involvement in this game. Even if three of the endings might seem similar, they each feel different. What this game does wrong is the fact that unlike Fallout 3, you cannot continue after the game ends, but personally that is not something I argue about, becuase there is mods that allow you to do so, and thats really that. Do not get me wrong, games like Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are both good in their own intricate ways, but Fallout New Vegas seems to combine everything I wanted in a Fallout game.What will turn you away from the PC release of this game, is the constant crashing, and the annoying bugs that sometimes come about in this version of the game. Installing mods is quite effective, but even with tons of crash fixes I still crash every now and then, and it angers me to the core. The PC version is not very stable compared to, lets say, the Xbox 360 version, but I still very much enjoy playing it. So, if you want a game with decent combat, fluent story, and an immersive experience, I can easily recommend this game to you. If you want lots of mods and a dedicated playerbase, this game is for you. However if you get angry with games that crash a lot and are full of tons of bugs, you might not want this game, yet I will still heavily recommend you at least try it. To me those bugs and crashes are worth it.			",61,3,2,13,13,1,4

												Let me start this off with one statement:Fallout: New Vegas is one of the greatest games I have ever played.(Mass Effect 2 holds that title for me.)I will most likely add onto this after more playthroughs. I've still yet to play Dead Money (got the endings from the wiki).I'm also currently replaying Fallout 3. The base game has been finished, and I'm currently trying to explore the entirety of the Capital Wasteland and do the DLCs before I go back over the review.Like my other reviews, this will be kept simple, with pros+cons, and a small explanation of the game.Disclaimer: I played Fallout 3 through a CD ROM.Another: While I have 100+ hours on the game, today was the first time I actually did the Battle for Hoover Dam.Fallout: New Vegas is a spin-off in the Fallout franchise, a series of post-apocalyptic RPGs. Using the same engine as Fallout 3, New Vegas was developed by Obsidian, the same company who made games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas takes place in a location not hit by the Great War as much as DC was. The Mojave, which was already a wasteland. Also unlike 3, you don't start out as a Vault Dweller.You start off as The Courier who was sent to deliver the mysterious ""The Platinum Chip."" (Yes, THE is actually part of its name.) You're intercepted by the Tops chairmen, Benny and two Great Khans, who then shoot you in the head. You're rescued (slowly) by a strange, friendly Securitron named Victor, and sent to Doc Mitchell in Goodsprings, who saves your life. After creating your character, you set out to the Mojave to hunt down Benny, only to be caught up in a full blown war.There are of course spoilers ahead.Pros:+ A strong lore like the other Fallout games.+ Great companions that all have their own story. They all give opinions to the Courier and make comments about the world around them, even a PROBE, who got an ENTIRE DLC involved around him! Except Boone. ""MY WIFE IS DEAD""+ Characters in quests have better writing and memorability than the ones in 3, The only characters I can remember in 3 are James and Three Dog.+ MUCH MORE PLAYER FREEDOM. Fallout 3 had barely any freedom. You HAD to go here, HAD to find your dad, and HAD to side with the Brotherhood of Steel. In NV, you have many more options, including multiple game endings, where you have four choices. NCR, Legion, House, or Independent. Six if you count Dead Money (dying in the vault or siding with Elijah).+ Less invisible walls than 3. Still a lot, but they don't block off any paths or anything. Only simple hills and mountains. I'm going to get a lot of backlash for that, but this is from experience.+ A great radio and soundtrack. + Graphics are quite decent.+ Animations are OK. It's best if you get a mod to improve them.+ A large modding community. Not as large as Skyrim's, but still quite large.+ Better optimized than 3.+ Well designed armors, weapons, and enemies.+ Well written storyline. While not as story-rich as Skyrim, it connects with characters more.+ The move from Damage Resistance to Damage Threshold was a smart one. Now you won't be shredded by a simple assault rifle while wearing Power Armor.Cons:- MULTIPLE bugs and crashes that need to be fixed with mods, and said mods require the DLC. I'm looking at you, Unofficial Patch.- Gunplay is... bad.- Sometimes you can halt the progress of the entire game by doing a quest wrong.- Locations tend to be very bland. In 3 many of the locations were quite unique, like Rivet City.- Feels boring at times. In Fallout 3, you had actual random encounters, even if they were just Super Mutants every 200 feet.- Game ends completely at Hoover Dam. Unlike Fallout 3, there is no DLC to fix this, but there are mods.- Battle for Hoover Dam felt small, BUT it could be because I nuked the entirety of Arizona. I'll change this con when I STOP the nukes in my next playthrough.- While there are less than 3, invisible walls. Some of them, while most are in hills and mountains, are in places they shouldn't be, like ridges in places you can go.- Not enough redheads. Forgot about that one.Final Verdict: 9/10 AMAZINGOnce again, I will add onto this as time goes. Please comment on any pro/con you disagree with.			",146,11,0,20,9,1,10

'War. War never changes!‘[… but mods can change everything.]________________________________________________________________________________These words are the prelude to the ‚Fallout‘ series, a world on the brink of destruction. During the great war in 2077 all the nations launched their nuclear weapons and civilization was nearly annihilated. Some people have been seeking shelter inside the vaults, others died by the explosions, the contamination and the fallout. Nowadays ruins are most of the time the only witnesses of former glorious cities and nations. Mutations have spread, the curse of radiaton still haunts the wastelands and brutal raiders and gangs wage war against poor survivors and former armies. And then there's you, a simple courier who has been hired to transport a mysterious package. You had the feeling that something wasn't right there. But you still took the job. And in the end...... you’ve been shot in the head. Twice. Then your pursuers robbed and burried you. But somehow you’re still alive, rescued by a mysterious robot and a doctor. Of course you not only want your package back but you also demand some answers. And so you start your adventure through the wasteland of Nevada, following the trails of your former pursuers. And this will lead you right into the heart of the Strip, where the former glory of Vegas is being rebuilt.________________________________________________________________________________Typcially for the ‚Fallout‘ series you are able to explore a huge open world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland where hundreds of abandoned buildings, ruins, caves and so on wait for a curageous adventurer. You will find countless weapons, armors and items, fight against raiders, bandits, animals and mutated beings like ghouls or death claws. With every lock you open, every enemy you defeat, you’ll get stronger, forming your own character. You may evolve into the intelligent mastermind, focussing on energy weapons and science or into the evil cannibal with a love for rusty chainsaws – the choice is up to you. And meanwhile you can follow the storyline of the main quest or you lose yourself in the huge wasteland, the sidequests, the crafting or the fighting. Or you'll just go to the casinos and try to hit the jackpot. The amount of content is huge, so many persons to talk to, so many places to visit, so much stuff to blow up.And all these positive points make up for some of the games disadvantages: Even with different fixes and stuff the stability isn’t perfect, the translation of some items, dialogues and stuff is (at least in the german version) ‚interesting‘ (maybe ‚creative‘ would be the better term) and some stuff like e.g. loading errors can annoy the crap out of you……but you will still continue playing. At least I did it. Because I really love the style and atmosphere, the soundtrack, the exploring, the development of my own character and all the other stuff. And due to the great 'Nexus' modding community you can make the game look absolutely stunning and beautiful, you can add even more content and make it an apocalyptic masterpiece. But even without the mods you won't regret the time you spend in New Vegas.________________________________________________________________________________So all in all there’s only one more thing to say: Gather your stimpaks and the ammo, load your energy rifle and ride into the sunset… *Vault-Boy approves*			",191,55,3,34,11,0,21

												I've spent weeks playing this game (almost litterally), this is by far my favorite game ever made.If you've never played it before take a good 20 hours in vanilla to get a feel of the atmosphere and visuals then go rampent with mods and you'll have a almost current gen first person fallout game with true a dialog system fallout is suppose to have. You're not playing a story, you are the story.My favorite roleplay in this game would probably be to go a steath small arms/sniper rifle route with wild wasteland turned on for maximum enjoyment. DLC is a must so get the Game of the Year edition.			",709,186,15,101,66,8,107

												This game, THIS game... where can I begin?Let's start with this: buy it... got it? OKGameplay:Although you might argue that the shooting and gameplay in general is the same as fallout 3 (which you should also buy) it does improve over its predesecor like with the all new ironsight, a real one for once.Crafting is generaly the same etc. etc.Quests:This is where the game really shines, its story and quest will leave you wanting always more and that's a good thing. The characters are way more interesting then in fallout 3, in this game you will want to think twice before killing someone who isn't an enemy and you will always think : was that a good idea? Also the quests are not fetch quest well some of them but not a lot.Factions:In this you will come across the many factions of the harsh Nevada desert which wil include mad bombers, underground thechnology freaks,the new army of some sorts,a legion of slavers and Mr. House(I can't tell anything about him)Story:YOU are a simple courier... or are you? So, after you ty to deliver a package you get shot in the head... but you live and now you're on a wonderful magical quest to find the sonofab***h who shot you... but that's where our story begin, find out by yourself.Community: You being part of the pc master race CAN and WILL put mods on your game. What are mods you ask well they are content created by users like you yes you and with time and patience you can make some too. But seriously go to the mod nexus, it is amazing what people can do with this game.DLCs:As I see it, the dlcs( downloadable content) are part of the experience, don't buy the game without them you will miss out on an extrordinary adventure.Dead Money: The first and best dlc released for New Vegas, I recommend starting it at low level, you might not get the best ending but it's way better that way also play it in the dark, it will be quite an experience.Honest Heart:The weak link at least in my opinion, it does have a good story but all in all it was laking something, I don't know what.Old World Blues: If you are patient you will enjoy the dialog but if you normaly skip it all you will find this dlc laking, it still as some memorable moments though.The lonesome Road: Arguably one of the best story in video game history, this dlc makes you uncover your origin, do this as your final challenge before the end of the game if you want to enjoy it.And finallyThe Verdict:As I said before buy itright now, you will not regret it, it doesn't cost much and it will take you more than a few dozens of hours to say: I'm finally done with this.I give this game 9.8/10, my favorite video game in the history of gaming.

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. Of course your on the same engine, so some of the same problems exist. Really though the best way to describe it is it makes the fallout 3 world seem boring.Score: 9/10			",89,19,2,27,11,5,24

												You know the drill - war, war never changes. The ultimate edition is quite a package and after playing endings for the three major factions (ncr, house, yes man) out of four I feel really full of waging war. I gotta go back to experience the ultimate bad guy route as the Roman psycho sometime later after I have survived the hangover from having drunk hundreds of Sunset Sarsaparillas. Its a really good RPG with extremely well written dialogue and abundance of choices up to you. The vanilla game really has it all on its own, the DLCs are just a bonus - like spin-offs of the main world of Mojave Wasteland. I dont really have anything bad to say about it, except for some annoying bugs like enemies getting stuck inside the terrain and the player occasionally falling through world etc. Gotta lock that FPS to 60 as well to avoid severe bugs with physics. You can even make the game look decent(ish) by todays standards by exploiting the offerings of nexusmods.com and ENB.So the DLC; -Loved Dead Money, great story building around the theme of Greed with intriguing gameplay elements; it deliberately makes you approach the game from different angle than you were accustomed in the base game. -Honest hearts was a bit of a letdown, kinda uninspired area with basic gameplay and run of the mill storyline, it answers some minor questions and rumours heard in the base game though.-Old World Blues was amazing, definitely the best dialogue offerings in the whole game and such a fun story with ludicrous weapons and gadgets to be obtained. I didnt want it to end =D-I'm bit on the fence with Lonesome Road, it has its moments as a ""final boss"" of sorts and discovering the rest of the Courier's tale but it falls kinda short with its boring map design, endless +4 radstorms and fighting sections full of Deathclaws and Ghoul grunts with deathclaw-like health. It gets a bit old to get ambushed by an instakilling monster while crossing a minefield the hundreth time. And that freaking storm always comes out at such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you will find yourself thinking if that crap is scripted or is your luck just running completely out.Overall the ultimate edition is a very good game with not too many annoyances, well played Obsidian Entertainment!

Posted: July 8, 2016
												I bought this game in 2014 on PC, and I haven't played it recently enough but it has always been in the back of my mind. I played it on the PS3 at release aswally and when I bought it on PC, I replayed it with some graphics mods and improvements on the game.Fallout: New Vegas is the underrated 3D Fallout game by all people who seem to be unable to see what makes a great Fallout game. It's superior to Fallout 3 and 4 in every way except the gunplay and the graphics, which is technically surpassed by Fallout 4, but I feel like Fallout 4 seems like plastic, but I digress and I'll move from this incoherent rant into the main meat of this review. Story and Dialogue Fallout: New Vegas is written by those who originally worked on Fallout 1 and 2 and their work and faith to the old lore is absolutely phenomenal, I have been engrossed into the world of New Vegas and the whole Mojave desert just through the dialogue and how the whole map, locations and all the politics behind every event, would, as Todd Howard would say, ""it just works"". The whole conflict between the NCR and the Legion is written in a way where you cannot technically define Evil as all choices are quite morally gray, all choices have a proper pros and cons list and it seems like they're all equal shades of gray, but at the same time, they seem black from the other perspective.Characters do speak in a realistic manner, but as I say this, I'm sure that there are characters that don't really speak naturally (dialogue wise) but I just cannot seem to think of any at the time, except Ullyses, he seems too pretentious to seem like a real person. Mechanics The mechanics of the game are quite an improvement over Fallout 3, the quest system from Fallout 3, where the choices and quest start could be different or change the course of the quest but it's quite llinear and less liberal with all the different choices, and in New Vegas, they overhual it and give you more methods to complete a quest depending on how your character is built and how you want to play. The shooting has been improved with the addition of Iron-Sights. The stats have been improved with slight more impact onto the game and the quests, adding alternative routes into quests.They've readded the traits from Fallout and Fallout 2, which force your character to gain extra skills but also penalizes you in some other way. And the perks have been turned into an affair that only comes each 2 XP Levels, This is to prevent you becoming some sort of past-mortal god at Level 20, and the repair system has been revamped and improved and works in a much simpler and handier way than in Fallout 3.I do recommend Hardcore Mode for returning Fallout 3 fans as it does add a slight minigame that makes food and water quite neccesary and adds a bit more difficulty.  Graphics and Map Design The Map is designed in a way where it is easy to find something interesting within a radius of something else, making it like a Mountain that you climb in a way, you progress, you can fast travel back to safety if you're outside, then return from the last spot you were at and keep progressing. Fast Travelling does cheapen the game quite a bit and make it less interesting but at the same time it does make running back for supplies or even restocking or upgrading much simpler.The Mojave Desert has roads on it, and when I first played the game, I had never noticed that the roads in the game would actually work if you drove on it and it made me realise how much thought the developers put into the map and the playable region of the game. The developers put less effort into the third and fourth DLCs, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road when it comes to how the map is planned out and how it would work in real life, but who plays an RPG for realism? It's all an afterthought. Soundtrack and Original Score From classic 40s-50s American music from the likes of Dean Martin and other artists (to be honest I don't know names, I just listen) to ambient noise to give personality to an otherwise dark, quiet, pest-infested cave, the soundtrack does hit it's hits of how to perfectly fit in the silence of the Mojave and the slow trekking through the map.It's amazing to listen to and the songs have stuck with me throughout my daily life, still stuck in the back of my head, still jingling and jangling.Then again, music tastes are subjective, but in my opinion, I do feel like it did fit the game quite well.

												So far yet so great, this is the best fallout game for me even this game came out 6 years ago. Why did I say this? let's have a look to the Cons and Prons that I've made based from my reviews.Pros:-A strong LONG story that'll make you surprised even from the beginning until the end.-Faction system-A lot of major and minor improvements that made the game not to run like a rotten potato that will ruin another fallout game.-Great Difficulty that lives up to its name and that is the ""Hardcore Mode""-Massive, varied, open wasted world just for you to explore and to encounter interesting characters and quests-New combat system, faction system, and more features to the settings-Keeps the atmosphere and structure that made it's immediate predecessor-Weapon Mods that let you have fun and experiment with your guns.-Great DLCs that isn't made for a cash-grab tactics-Powerful enemies in different parts of the world.Cons:-No more Metro Tunnels like you can see from the past game Fallout 3-No significant innovations or improvements in graphics, design, or play mechanics-Lots of Bugs and Glitches that you can encounter while playing this game-Dirty rigged AI-Lets you go up to Level 30, you only can pick few perks like 15 perks only (Not Including the 2 perks at the beginning.)If you asked me if YOU should get this game, I would say it why not? This is the best fallout game made by bethesda and obsidian. Too sad for Fallout 4 which obsidian wasn't part of the development which is why Fallout 4 was the suckiest Fallout Game.

												Obsidian is an amazing company, with a solid background in RPGs and storytelling. Fallout New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game, with Fallout 2 following closely, and is an amazing RPG with great lore building and lore stacking.Obsidian also knows what the ♥♥♥♥ an RPG actually is, unlike bethesda, and makes great advancements over Fallout 3 and over Fallout 4 as well. The reintroduction of traits, which was short lived as Fallout 4 lost all of its RPG elements, was a great feature to FNV, taking traits from the orginal Fallout games and adding new ones; even going as far as to add even more in the Old World Blues DLC. The perk system is similar to Fallout 2, a perk ever other level rather than one every level; the perks also do what Bethesda perks don't, which is actually behave like perks. By this I mean that the perks in FNV are game changing, perks should make the game play differently rather than just doing more damage or more EX per task. Jury Rigging and Mad Bomber are my favorite perks from FNV, adding new ways to supply yourself with weapons and changing up how the repair system works. There are perks that do add more EX per task like I mentioned, but its signifigance is small compared to how many there are to change combat, crafting, survival and speech options.LORE, I absolutely LOVE lore. I can't get enough lore out of things I'm into, the Brotherhood of Steel lore especially, I'm a huge BoS fan. Obsidian does this amazing thing, whereas others *cough *cough* bethesda, don't. Surprise! They actually know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about when they write lore. They actually give a damn if the lore can be supported and if it will conflict with other lore. They build onto previous lore and write new lore where its needed. Jacobstown is a HUGE reference to Fallout 1 and 2. The name of Jacobstown itself is a big reference, the super mutants who mention the masters army is a big reference, nightkin is a reference which I thought had been lost in the newer games. Obsidian knows what they're doing with lore much better than the company which prides inself on it's ""storytelling"".So, Obsidian is a great company who deserves ever dollar they get from you buying this game. They make AMAZING RPGs, they write GREAT lore, and overall they're just good at what they do, and isnt that what it should all be about in the end? Making a great game requires a great company to make it.P.S. The head honcho of Obsidian is one of the lead directors of Fallout 2, so classic Fallout fans, you can trust him. You also should try out KOTOR 2, or Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2, another great Obsidian game.			",151,16,0,22,25,2,26

												Fallout New Vegas has proved to be a high-level title regarding the PC version, that very little moves away in qualitative counterparties on consoles. Basically the game still has a well-balanced interplay between Dynamics typically from role-playing and first-person shooting, with a collection of narrative lines that are incoceranno and will find their point of Union in the decisions of the player himself. The endless Mohave desert awaits players and make them share personal experience and subjective, long-lived and never boring. There are unfortunately some problems in terms of graphics and code cleaning, resulting in sudden drops in frame rate and a random bug; as well as on consoles, though, it's very little flaws that affect the value of a product to be considered calmly among the must buy for all fans of the series and role-playing games in General.

												Fallout : New Vegas is, in my opinion, a rather good game nailed down by numerous bugs/glitches, so having any reasonable conversation with someone about it turns quickly into a glitch-swapping fest.So, let's do some good old fashioned Pros/Cons way of reviewing video games.PROS-A large, expansive world.-More guns/ironsights instead of that inching forward from FO3-Unique factions, and every single one of them you will hate.-The line ""What's a Chicago?""-The Bloody Mess perk-Funny physics toss-ups-Modding community active in all departments.And now for the bad.CONS-The game dies silently behind loading screens.-The game dies if you use explosives too much.-The game dies if you use the console too much.-Running into cars stacked atop each other can get you stuck, forcing you to use the console.-Achievements-Many weapons from FO1 and FO2 have been removed.-The Gamebryo engine is one of the worst engines I've ever played on, but dayum, is it flexible.

												What can I say about Fallout New Vegas other than that it's essentially a 4 year old game that I still play more often than most recent triple A titles. I'm not the sort of person who plays just one game based on nostalgia. The primary reason for my love for this game is that. like many others in Bethesda's RPG line up, it's pretty much fully customizable with mods. There are mods still being made to this day, and you can make changes to virtually everything in the game world. Modding includes adding custom weapons, clothing, lighting, enemies, creatures, weather effects, custom companions, missions, expanded game areas, sound effects, voice effects, interface, homes, and even to linking fallout 3 to New Vegas (given that you own both games), and that's not even scratching the surface. If you have any experience with modding, or a willingness to learn, I HIGHLY recommend this game.			",201,11,1,7,6,1,16

												For starters, since you're probably playing on PC, I STRONGLY recommend you spend some time looking at various mods that people have made for this game (and are completely free). While the vanilla game experience is still good, playing with even simple mods that fix bugs makes the experience so many times more enjoyable, and allows you to tweak the game to your preference.This game is very enjoyable and easy for me to lose myself in. I can spend hours just wandering the Nevada wasteland exploring new locations or cutting down enemies. A number of the non-playable characters have interesting, and even sometimes thought-provoking, dialogues that makes doing quests something you actually want to do (besides getting a reward of some sorts).Of course, this game has its downsides. For starters, the game engine is junk. The game clearly shows its age, so if you're not using mods to make the game look good, don't expect it to look amazing. You can go in any direction you want past the opening sequence of the game, and while I consider this a good thing, those of you who prefer linear games will probably dislike this. The game very strongly suggests the direction you should go in (by following along the main questline), but more experienced players will probably greatly deviate from this.If you've never played a Fallout game, what are you waiting for? (Well, I can understand if you're waiting for the next $5 sale, I did that too.) For those of you already familiar with Fallout / The Elder Scrolls, you'll probably enjoy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout: New Vegas is probably the only post-2 Fallout game that I would consider to be a legitimately good Fallout game instead of just alright (Fallout 4) or worse (Fallout 3). It feels more like a sequel to the original games than any of Bethesda's work, and frankly there are so many improvements from the gameplay to the writing and story that I'm too lazy to go into an in-depth review of all of it, so you can either take my word for it or just go read my Fallout 3 review and imagine if there was a game like that except good instead. It makes the shooting feel slightly less like it was taken from an amateur's Oblivion mod, it balances out the perks and makes it generally tougher to become a god, the companions actually make you want to travel with them instead of leaving them all in a slumber party at your house, and the main storyline actually makes sense this time. It's just overall a really great RPG, and a great Fallout game.The DLCs are a little different than most Bethesda DLCs in that they all have an overarching storyline going on in the background leading up to the final part. The first DLC, Dead Money, will probably either be your favorite or your least favorite depending on whether you like being challenged or you're a big whiny baby. It's probably my favorite part of the game as a whole, and the characters and general atmosphere of it are pretty great, especially if you turn on Hardcore mode for it (which I don't really recommend doing outside of Dead Money, because it's not really that challenging in the main game; it's more like a minor inconvenience that occasionally pokes you and tells you to sip some water). Honest Hearts is the next one, but you can basically skip it as far as I'm concerned. You get some cool .45 pistols and tommy guns that you'll never find enough ammo for in the main game, and you get to see Joshua Graham (also known as the Hanged Man from Van Buren) for about 5 minutes or so because the main questline of the DLC is like one hour long and there's not really anything else to do in it. It also has barely anything to do with the overarching story. Old World Blues is the next, and it's most peoples' favorites. It has a lot of fun areas to explore that actually have things in them, and the overall presentation is pretty funny and entertaining, which might be a welcome change of pace because of the dreary nature of the rest of the DLCs. Lonesome Road is the final DLC, and while peoples' opinions on it tend to vary (the Lonesome Road True Faction Allegiance mod is pretty much mandatory in my opinion, because otherwise you'll spend the whole time getting yelled at for being an NCR dog because you waved good morning to one of them on your way there), it's a pretty solid conclusion that solves the mystery of who that guy in the collector's edition playing card set was.If I had to complain, it'd be that Lover's Lab's selection of sexual mods for New Vegas is pretty terrible, and you're a lot better off with the Elder Scrolls games if you're into that. It can also be a little slow at the start on additional playthroughs, because even though each area presents multiple ways to handle it you will likely see the same few areas in the beginning because of how the map is designed to send you in one of two paths to New Vegas (the long way that takes you through several areas on your way to New Vegas that you're supposed to take, or the big manly man way through a chasm full of deathclaws). Overall, buy New Vegas.			",574,245,9,46,42,6,55

												This game is love. Fallout: New Vegas really tells a brilliant story and although you feel at parts like nothing more than a pew pewing machine, other times there are decisions that affect you as a person, and your emotions, be extreme laughter, or sorrow for the smallest of characters. Without a doubt my favorite DLC is Old World Blues, I highly encourage you to buy this along with the game, if not the entire DLC. OWB had me laughing and giggling with each witty remark, and Obsidian do a fantastic job in both this and its other DLC opposite, Dead Money, a horror type DLC which does a good job of making each step you take a worrying and questionable one due to the enemies AI staying stealth and silent untill the last second. Good job Obsidian, I'm sure the replay value for taking sides will keep me going for quite some time!Edit: The music in this game has become a bliss for me, the music having music from the actual time the game is set in gives a stable feel of authenticity to the game and to its creators. Each time ""Big Iron"" plays from my Pip-Boy I can't help either go along silently in my head, or even start singing it out loud with broken but well meant notes :)Another thing I have to say is something I feel a bit sad about. When I began the game, I had no clue what I was doing and thus, did not like the game at all. I had a friend's strong reccomendation that all would get better and thanks to his reassurance, I've had great fun. So this little note is just to say that you may not fall in love with this game at first, but perseverance makes the game feel like a gift rather than the chore like feel I had at the beginning.

												This is the easily one of the very best story-driven games that exist with decent gameplay and presentation.You probably already know all the pros but I'll skip to the cons outside of poor optimization/engine.-Low effort on Legion path, lots of things unfinished (thanks Bethesda 1 year time limit)-Mojave outpost is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ not nearly as important feeling as everyone hypes it out to be-There's like 5 voice actors in the entire game and 2-3 lines that repeat for all the soldiers/NPCs you can't interact with BUT luckily you can fix all of these with mods and more, and the DLC for this game is also fantastic (especially for the mods)Some recommended mods (new game is probably necessary and some of these may clash without Nexus Mod Manager)Also this is not the mod load order, important and you probably need all DLC for this to work (get it anyway it's great)-New Vegas Redesigned III-Project Nevada (Core, Rebalance, Cyberware)-NMCS texture pack (prioritize in first couple mods, use small texture pack if your computer is weak)-Nevada Skies-New Vegas Bounties I, II, III (get all)-More Traits/Perks-Weapon Mods Expanded-Interior Lighting Overhaul-Populated Casinos-Mojave Outpost Redesigned-Fallout Character Overhaul-A World Without Pain-Anti stutter/lag-New Vegas Anti Crash-Some desert eagle mod (trust me here)-New Vegas Killer-Weapons of the new millennia -Vurts WFO-Bad mother fu.cka + all other NPC additions -Improved companion sandbox-Someguy Series master (required for some mods)-Better loading screens (is the name of the mod)-Freeside open-Immserive Karma-Enchanced blood-Wasteland Flora overhaul-Wave Radio-New vegas strip connected-EVE (weapon particle retextures + overhauls especially for laser weapons)Optional (as if the rest weren't):-Unlimited Companions (I just wanted Boone and Cass at same time with the Doctor guy)-Perk every level (I liked an easier game GG EZ)-Run lucky 38 (great but takes time to figure out)-Level cap 100 (self explanatory)If you haven't played the game yet I highly encourage you to get the game with all DLC's, and to definitely get it on a sale (like 100%). If you're not brain dead I also encourage you to install all of these mods before playing the game once as it makes the experience much better. Also even if you have finished the game on vanilla but want to play the game again you should definitely get at least some of the mods listed above.			",48,2,0,5,4,0,1

												Fallout: New Vegas is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played.I'm not going to pretend i'm not a fanboy as I write this, because I am. I have always been deeply in love with the Fallout series since the first game and I am happy to say it's one series that seems to have only gotten better.I'll start by saying I own this game both on Console and on PC and i've completed the game on both. Though, with Fallout 'completed the game' is a very loose term, I use it to mean finished the main story mission line.Fallout is one of those games that allows you to play how you want, and punishes you accordingly. If you want to be 'evil' then you can, but don't expect to find allies amongst those who want to protect, and if you want to be 'good' then the same applies, but don't expect the Legion to want to help you.My favourite thing about this game is the freedom to play it at your own pace. There is the main story mission which you can follow and most likely complete the game in a few hours, but there are also hundreds of sidequests, areas to explore, people to help and companions to find. My Steam shows that i've played 79 hours and i'm nowhere close to having completed every side quest or exploring every location and in those 79 hours I don't think I've ever felt bored. The morality in this game is another standout feature that I loved. Many games have a good/bad element to it, but I felt in Fallout: New Vegas your actions and choices really do have an impact. I find that there are so many games now that give you choices but they never really affect your gameplay. Fallout: New Vegas isn't one of those. Maybe like me you'll start to question if what seemed to be 100% right at the start, really is the right thing. Fallout does have it flaws though, like most Bethesda games, and they don't intend to fix them. You will most likely find quests glitching out here and there and the game crashing as and when it feels like it. Saving often can massively help, and keeping a Fallout Wiki open in the background to check if the quest you're on has any known glitches is something i'd recommend. There's also the massive issue of killing someone (by mistake or purposely for whatever reason) and finding out 20 hours in they were part of a quest and that quest is either failed, or you have to select an ending you wouldn't have wanted. The frustration of losing an hours worth of gameplay because I forgot to save it has been the reason many times that i've stopped playing, but I always pick it up and play again sooner or later.You can't really go wrong with an open-world rpg survival style game with leveling, perks, companions and over 50 hours gameplay. The game is worth every penny and more in my opinion, and even if you don't have the £14.99 to spend now, when it goes on offer grab it. You won't regret it.			",2342,939,82,273,346,27,418

												Fallout New Vegas is the best way to shame Fallout 3!As a big Fallout fan, first time I felt I was in Fallout world since the first games was New Vegas.A lucky courier finds himself/herself patched up by a good samaritan and a bullet to avenge.New Vegas introduces us to Mojave, a land where we see the ""future"" of the wasteland.NCR grows to be a large government. But are their goodwill limited to self-benevolence?A newly risen power is the Caesar's Legion. What seperates them from mere slavers?What's the position of the players such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave in Mojave?And who is Mr House?You're going to find the answers to these questions in this ACTUAL post-apocalyptic game (as opposed to the reskinned fantasy game F3).Ups:Believable charactersGood dialogueVastly improved gameplay (comp to f3)Dusty atmosphereModdable (google for compilations)Downs:Carries the unfixable downs of the f3 engineThis is definitely a must-play for any fallout fans and strongly suggested for any RPG players. For shooter lovers, it still offers a variety of weapons and enemies and a deeper game play then f3.			",189,47,0,28,24,2,38

												Fallout New Vegas is hands down my favorite RPG of all time.After playing Fallout 3 I didn't think another Fallout title could out do it, then came Fallout New Vegas which was made by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda. New Vegas did everything right in my opinion. First off FNV was made with the same engine as FO3 so it looks exactly the same. As far as I know they didn't upgrade any visual details. New Vegas runs okay, I like to use RivaTuner to cap my FPS at 60. This ensures there aren't any insane FPS jumps and I've found that higher frame rates cause micro stutters. There probably are mods to remedy this but I've never bothered. All in all FNV may look really dated in some people's eyes but I still love how it looks.The RPG element of New Vegas is so deep, you can play it for hundreds of hours and each time your experience will be vastly different. There are a wide variety of perks, if you have a play style in mind, I can gaurentee there's at least one perk for it. My favorite part of this game is developing a character and making it my own. The gameplay in Fallout has always been great in my opinion, it was made even better with the addition of aiming down sights. In FO3 it was basically essential to use VATS but in this game I never use VATS, I don't invest in any VATS related perks, and I love never having to use it. With that being said I think they improved VATS and made it way more balanced.The story in New Vegas is my favorite out of the series. It's a classice revenge story with a great twist. The best part about the story is that it allows you to role play any character you desire and it will all make sense. So if you want to be an evil raider or a good NCR ranger, it all would make sense around the story. There are a ton of factions in the game and I love the variety they bring. It's also awesome how your actions can effect your faction relationships. Also the setting is great, I've always been fascinated with the west coast in the Fallout universe so it's cool to see in this iteration.The DLC in FNV is some of my favorite in the series. It brings much appreciated scenery changes and even the worst DLC for FNV is still really fun in my opinion.So, as a final point, to say I recommend Fallout New Vegas is a bit of an understatement. This game seriously influenced the types of game I enjoy playing and I will always be able to come back and enjoy a fresh playthrough.			",35,3,1,13,6,1,1

												Coming from Fallout 3 with the positives and negatives that resided there, I was wary of New Vegas. I came in expecting to be bias against it, and instead came out with one of my favorite games of all time. New Vegas offers a unique experience with nods to prior entries in the series, and adds affecting quests and intriguing choices. Its strengths, however, come in the form of its DLC. The main plot of Vegas is interesting, and allows you a large amount of ways to go about the end. But what stands out is the story behind the Sierre Madre (Dead Money), finding out who Randall Clark is (Honest Hearts), learning what's really going on in the Big MT (Old World Blues), and figuring out a part of your past and what you left behind in the Divide (Lonesome Road). Obsidian tells stories that stay with you, and nothing does it better than New Vegas.			",40,52,0,28,13,0,1

												Fallout NV is one of my favorite games. It has a great atmosphere,quests,and locations. The modding for the game is top. I reccomend this for anyone that liked Fallout 3(and all who dont need dragons or orcs and elves in a rpg xD)The Fallout series takes place after a nuclear war and the U.S. is desecrated, a shell of its former glory. Humanity emerges from the tragedy as selfish and power-hungry as ever. Despite the bombardment of numerous nukes, the city of Vegas managed to survive the war mostly untouched. In the aftermath, a group of people formed touting the values of the old governmental system and called themselves the New California Republic, or NCR. Thanks to the Hoover Dam, the NCR and citizens of New Vegas have access to clean water and power, something most areas lack. At odds with the NCR is the Legion, a dictatorship lead by a man who renamed himself Caesar. Based on the Roman methodology of conquering other civilizations, the Legion absorbs nearby tribes and enslaves a portion of their population. The NCR and Caesar's Legion butt heads over control of the area, and tensions are high. Deception, cannibalism, space travel and drug use are all themes, really crazy sometimes :)backstep-crit-boooom      :-O			",179,15,4,11,6,0,9

SUMMARYObsidian's Fallout: New Vegas is the last good Fallout game. It features everything good out of Fallout 3, features superior writing, and a generally better feel.REVIEWFallout: New Vegas. Otherwise known as ""Fallout 3 that should have been"".Imagine Fallout 3 but with more meat. A lot more meat. I mean a mega-ton more meat. That's New Vegas. Basically, New Vegas features better writing, better plot, more story, better pacing, more interesting side quests, more weapons, more interesting perks, the re-introduction of traits, interesting factions, and interesting locations.New Vegas manages to revive the feel of the classic Fallout games by including fun, interesting characters, grimy locales, and choice with consequences. In the first few moments of the game, you are given a number of choices that can influence how the rest of the introduction will play out. For example, the starting town of Goodsprings is facing a problem with a gang known locally as the Powder Gangers - merciless thugs that use a lot of dynamite. You essentially have four choices: help Goodsprings, help the Powder Gangers, help no one, or kill everyone. But it's not so straight forwards, as there are subtle ways to complete the quest without following the most obvious - being to complete all the objectives. I'll leave the rest for you to find!The visuals are improved only slightly from the previous installment, but they get the job done and can be easily improved using an ENB filter. The basic gameplay mechanics are the same, but there are some improvements here and there. The game shines with its writing, proving that Fallout isn't about the guns and loot as much as the story and characters.New Vegas is known for its large modding community, and it has more files on Nexus Mods than Fallout 3. They range from small tweaks,  as in the popular ""New Vegas Anti Crash,"" or as expansive as Project Nevada - which changes the fundamental gameplay of New Vegas, adds new weapons and armors that are well balanced, adds neat visual effects, overhauls the stealth mechanic, and more. If you are a returning player of New Vegas and haven't played in a while but are still looking for an interesting and immersive experience, I recommend these following mods:- Project Nevada- Enhanced Camera Mod: makes third person animations visable in first person (check the ini!)- Nevada Skies: adds new weather affects, like rain and sandstorms. Works well with Interior Lighting Overhaul which changes the mood of all rooms in New Vegas to be more realistic.- All of Vegas Uncut, especially Freeside Open and the Strip Open.- Enemy AI - Tactics - NPC Healing: just generally makes the AI better and more interesting, plus optional AI healing.- EVE: New effects for explosives and energy weapons- MTUI and oHUD: MTUI is just a more PC friendly hud set up, with small fonts, more room in menus, etc. oHUD is a suite that includes imersive HUD options, (HUD disappears after a moment) adjustable HUD options, and extra HUD options (hardcore needs, clock, etc.)- WMX: Adds a bunch of new, balanced weapon mods.- Classic Dialogue Options: Doesn't tell you when you have a skill check in dialogue. For immersion, etc.- Enhanced Blood Textures: Generally better and meatier looking blood.- Pipboy 2500 mod: it's not a big, ugly Pipboy, neither a gay readius- Flashlight NVSE: adds a host of different flashlights, for when Nevada Skies nights are scaring you away- Fallout 4 Quickloot: The only good thing to come out of Fallout 4.CONCLUSIONWhere Fallout 4 failed miserablely to capture the intangible essence of Fallout, the folks over at Obsidian managed to craft a fantastic Fallout game that is worthy of being placed alongside the classics.

												Never would one imagine that one would find so much to do in such a grand role-playing world. If I were to define New Vegas in a brief sentence, that would be my definitive statement. The extent to which this game has changed me whenever I replay it is incalculable. So much so that it is a difficult task to enumerate its many virtues. I will try to stick to vital values. Firstly, this is a game that adapts itself to several gameplay tastes. Whether one wishes to play it casually, attentive to storytelling elements and lore progression, or whether one would rather feel the potential for post-apocalyptic survival that it presents, New Vegas is there to provide it. Explore the numerous side-quests or discover how influential and emblematic each of the four main-quest personalities of the game (Yes-Man, Caesar, Mr. House, General Oliver and his entourage) can be. There is never a shortage of in-game mythos prone to in-depth unearthing by the player should they be interested enough. On the other hand, the game is so self-sufficient and self-explanatory as to not demand any background knowledge should the player choose to ignore Falloutian lore. And all that wholeness executed in perplexing 18 months by the careful minds at Obsidian.New Vegas steps into the chaotic territories of mechanic bugginess from the infamous Gamebryo/Havok combination, but manages to keep major nuisances at bay. I have never experienced a single game-breaking bug or glitch, only the minor and even amusing stuff. And although the mechanics was already dated when it was released (late 2010), New Vegas feels like a fresh journey with its simple but timely additions - among them I can bring up the Companion Wheel, shooting downrange, and the addition of a hotkey to switch between ammo types; not to mention the precise crafting system and the hardcore gameplay option.Characters are as close to perfection as you can get with an RPG. Brilliant voice-acting, immense sense of uniqueness in each of the relevant characters, and an actually solid story given to each and every one of the player's companions. This is the good old Fallout 2 companion system that we are discussing here, only improved. A set of quests intertwined with the main conflicts shall give the player valuable support for the entirety of the game's mythos, as almost every companion has a history with the Mojave to be scrutinised. The emotions enticed by such quests can vary greatly, and only serve to reiterate Obsidian's sharpness in delivering an authentic, almost flawless rendering of branching storyline in an electronic RPG. And these are just side-quests. I am not even going to discuss the merits of the game's intricate main storyline, as I leave it up to anybody thinking of buying this title and playing it for their first time.Willing to abandon your real-world anxieties for valuable moments of embedding yourself with an immersive post-apocalyptic experience? Investigate or intimidate, persuade or kill, hide or bring mayhem about, survive or secure your niche, craft or buy from merchants. New Vegas gives you all said options to prosper and unveil its stories. The Mojave awaits, and it will reveal a thousand mysteries as long as one is willing to travel extensively across its horrifying deserts. Those points and several others are some of the reasons why this is one of the most impressive videogaming enterprises I have ever witnessed.			",219,35,14,36,22,1,38

FALLOUT NEW VEGAS PUTS AAA TITLES TO SHAME!Incredible game for ludicrously low price.If you are going to mod new vegas after playing for a while, I strongly recommend the following mods from Nexus CommunityProject NevadaMakes the game even more interesting than it already is. You can have optional FPS Shooter elements with Project nevada. Dynamic Crosshair, Bullet-time, Peripheral vision etc, fully customizable you can enable or disable them at any time. Also to mention Cybernetic implants which give the player extra perks.True leaning, by XilandoEssential if you are going to Install Project Nevada, or Stealth. A very simple mod which allows you to peek from corners. Thats about it.NMC Texture PackThe game is a little old, but NMCTP revitilazes the game giving more realistic and detailed textures. Will consume extra space on your HD but worth it definetely.Bottle that WaterIt's odd that Obsidian devs missed such feature, by default you don't have the possibility to refill water from lakes, pumps or fountains. But thanks to the modding community now you can.The mods I recommend going on and on, there are definetely more essential mods but I wrote the most important.Look from my personall mods installed here:http://i.imgur.com/Xixo1zb.pngI Bought Fallout New Vegas on Autumn Sale 2014, Invested many hours playing even after finishing the game I feel like playing it all over again. I upgraded it to Ultimate Edition on winter sale 2014, to get all the DLC's to increase the playability of the game. It's basically enormous game, and the time you  can spend on it. Let's also mention the ridicilous modding potential, if it happens to beat the game with all 4 ""factions"" and finishing the DLC, you can either turn the game into a complete sandbox, give it some bounty hunting mode or user-created quests.

												New Vegas is a faithful sequel to Fallout 2: New Reno. Much like its predecessor, the game features a desert, gangsters, casinos, guns, surprisingly good role-playing. The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland � a pretty much lifeless, HUGE and twice as many locations as F03.  It's a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse.New Vegas does have a few technical issues. Overall, the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional RPG where you explore the main quest, which, depending on your choices, will send you to a variety of locations. New Vegas is a huge game. I can probably write another 6 pages examining New Vegas's various aspects but i'd rather play more. This game is only improved upon with the INSANELY TALENTED modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones Obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour, weapons, the re-texture's and mods that increase the difficulty of the Mojave. Without a doubt a MUST OWN! even without mods and any DLC its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money.			",36,2,0,5,1,0,0

												More than just a Fallout ""3.5"", Fallout New Vegas is definitely an unique game for me. The atmosphere, the weapons, the lore, the NPCs... all of this make it my favourite game.Instead of having the focus on your character's story like in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas puts mostly the focus on the background of those places : the war between the NCR and the Legion. This background is so well-introduced and so well-placed, when I met Mr. House for the first time I felt like it was a movie (a true icone of the game). Thanks to this, you feel like a part of the Mojave and not just playing an RPG game.About the gameplay, the new crafting seems a bit too complicated and unworthy to be really used, but the addons on weapons are really nice to get. Also the survival mode makes the game a great experience. Like in FO3, the locations are well detailled, and even if they don't have a reason to be visited through some quests, you'll end up doing it just to find the funny easter eggs.Finally about the RPG part, you'll really feel like your actions have influence on the world and also how the world will react to you. You have a karma with each faction, and each one will change your own story in the Mojave. ",62,6,5,11,21,2,19

												Took me a while to get into but once i did, i loved it.It's better then Fallout 3, why ? Because it lets you do whatever you please, you can kill everything if you feel like it, even important characters related to the main plot of the game can die and the world will react to it properly with many dialogs with NPCs changing to what you did and some quests might not even be open to you anymore due to what you did.Quests in New Vegas tend to have alot of multiple choices,solutions and endings, not just one neutral ending,one evil ending and one good ending , instead there's a fine line of varying shades of grey which will often make you think about what you're about to do instead of doing the usual video game trope of ""Well, i wanna be a good guy/a**hole so I'll pick text that's in blue/red"".This is why people tend to recommend Obsidian's New Vegas over Bethesda's Fallout 3, New Vegas has far more intreasting things to do in it with an insane amount of choices and outcomes which make replaying it a second and even a 3rd time still a somewhat refreshing experience without resorting to installing community made quests via the Nexus mod site.However, the problem New Vegas still has to this date is the engine it's powered by.Even when it came out back in 2010, the engine it had was considered a fairly limiting and old engine, it can only use 2GB of RAM on a system which is just one of the many reasons why  this game loves to crash so much.It also comes with an annoying micro-stutter bug that's caused by the fact than the engine was for some reason coded for 64 Hz at 64 FPS for some strange reason and since pretty much no one in this world has a TV/Monitor that's 64Hzs, it ends up causing weird micro-stutters in the game.Thankfully the community created various mods which fixed these issues, there's a popular mod which removes the micro-stutters so you can enjoy a a nice smooth 60 (or 120/144 ) FPS experience without any stutters and there's a community made launcher which enables New Vegas to properly use at least 4GB of RAM and not just 2, which is a must if you plan to mod New Vegas with graphical mods that increase texture sizes alot or maybe add alot more models and other things in the world to be loaded by.Overall, it's an amazing game that's sadly sometimes hampered with technical issues it has due to the engine it uses.

												Fallout New Vegas is an excellent game. Generally speaking, I do not really play any games over 50 hours unless I really enjoy the game, and with 80 hours, I completed my first playthough of Fallout New Vegas, including the DLC. So in terms of time that you can get out of this game, Fallout New Vegas is worth every cent.The game itself is fun and the questing system is enjoyable just like Fallout 3, which I have previously played. Many quests have multiple ways to finish it and there are tons of branches that open up from that. Additionally, Fallout New Vegas features factions which is an interesting a good addition from Fallout 3. Not to put an major spoilers in, but I ended up compeltely destroying a ceratin faction that just did not seem like a good bunch of people >:) But you can really destroy the balance with the factions with certain actions and sometimes they lead to unintended consequences. There is so much to do in New Vegas and so much to explore. The skill line, perks, and skill requirements for things are all just as good as Fallout 3, except that leveling up is a little too fast and easy in Fallout New Vegas in my opinion. The visuals and audio are good as well as with almost all Bethesda games so there really isn't too much that is bad with Fallout New Vegas.The DLC for Fallout New Vegas are generally fun. The only DLC that I didn't really like was Dead Money because it was so dark and creepy for most of the time, even though I was overpowered by the time I went in. Dead Money just didn't give me a good feel playing it. Old World Blues and Lonesome Road were by far the best two DLC compared to the other New Vegas and Fallout 3 DLC as well. I personally liked Old World Blues the best, but Lonesome Road is closely behind.Although I generally have no problems with Fallout New Vegas, there are actually a couple of game breaking problems. When I mean game breaking, I mean actually game breaking. There are certain parts of the game that completely glitch the game and freeze it, prevent it from continuing, or crash it. I installed a couple of mods (that did not change the gameplay at all since I like Vanilla) to fix the bugs and crashes such as the unnofficial patch. The mods integrate very smoothly with Nexus Mod Manager so it is very easy to ""fix"" the game for the most part.TLRD: With the glitches and bugs aside, Fallout New Vegas is an incredible game that is a ton of fun.Rating: 9.2/10Recommend Price: Full Price (it's worth every cent!)

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The reason ... the freedom. Sure you could say it’s for the graphics (not), or the amazing story line, or even the gameplay. No, the freedom the game offers you is amazing. You start of a guy/or gal, woken up from a shot to the head that should have killed you. Although some information was given about the person you choose to play as, I would have liked to seen more from the game. From the start you are given various options as to how you want yourself to be represented. As a hero, or an anarchist. Aside from the freedom you also get lovable characters and their factions, the decisions you make, and locations you venture off to that you   WILL remember. Graphic wise, the game isn't strong. The animations aren’t either. But you know what who cares, oh you do? MODS!!! The modding community of this game is huge, however it has  gotten smaller but sure as hell isn’t dead. The community is still alive and still pumping those sweet, juicy, hot mods you want. The mods include many things like : texture packs, weapons, or weapon mods; quest, npc's, and a whole lot more. Don’t like the mods the community has to offer? Make your own! The game does have a creation kit,yes it is confusing, but with a little practice you’ll be making mods better than a lot of the stuff on the sites. Sure the game isn’t perfect but you can make as good or as horrible as you like depending on what you do in the game or what you do to the actual game.			",77,4,1,5,1,0,0

												Day One: Got shot in the face by a dude in a business suit. Woke up in a doctor's house, nicked all his stuff and ran. Got into a bit of a tiff with some locals, but I remained level-headed and gunned them all down brutally.Day Two: Travelled to a town with a giant dinosaur statue, which needed help with some ghouls in the nearby ruins. Went to ruins, sniped down ghouls, stole their loot. At that point, I was attacked by an invisible demon, I panicked and shot grenades everywhere like a spaz. Repaired a rocket ship, loaded it with some more ghouls, shot it into the sun.Day Three: Made it to New Vegas. Got shot at by some Elvis impersonators, removed their skulls in revenge. Bribed my way into the casinos, at which point my game crashed.Go figure.			",192,48,0,15,17,0,22

												I usually don't do lengthy reviews, but, hey, it's Fallout.Pros:- Great story- Hundreds of quests- Can run smoothly on probably any computer- A lot of choices- Mods- DLC- Dozens of different play styles- Easy and challenging- Dozens of weapons and locations that I haven't even been to yet.- S.P.E.C.I.A.LCons:- Can be buggy- Crashes- Sometimes frustrating- After playing it multiple times, Goodsprings is repetitiveSome things you might care about:Question: I like (genre) games, and not western games like New VegasResponse: Chances are, Fallout: New Vegas has some of that genre. It's not horror, but sometimes creepy. Also, if you don't like western games, it doesn't really matter because New Vegas has it all.Question: Do I have to side with the good side?Response: No, and there really isn't one ""good side"". You can side with the NCR, Legion, Mr. House, or Yes Man.Question: How should I approach this game?Response: In my opinion, approach it how you'd like, at least in the first play through.Conclusion:Should you get this game?Absolutely. $10 for a game this great is a steal. I have 125+ hours so far on this game and I haven't played every quest yet. Words cannot express of how good a game this is.			",30,3,1,3,0,0,0

Note: I've spent hundreds of hours on this game excluding its DLC on the console versions. There are so many good things that can be said about this game, from gameplay to side quests to how the S.P.E.C.I.A.L and skills work, but I can only say one thing that makes me prefer this game so much over Fallout 3. I would have to say it is the constant references to Fallout 1 and 2, by exploring the wastes, talking to people, and even gathering items from those times, you can really see how Obsidian pays tribute to the games they helped create whilst under the name Black Isles. From the tales of a screaming Sargeant stationed at Navarro, to tales about The Master, and finally to the Chosen One blowing up an oil rig; it's obvious the wastelanders will never forget about the amazing tales of the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One. Neither will Bethesda, Obsidian, and most importantly, us, the players.You will never get bored of this game, it's a masterpiece just like the games before it. 10/10			",99,10,1,13,4,1,4

												If you are a fan of RPG's this one should definately be in your library. The atmosphere is both horrific and beautiful. It immerses you into the post apocolyptic world that is Fallout. The story is excellent, the music is perfectly suited for the terrifying wasteland, the combat is great fun. Overall an excellent game that is highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War, war never changes.The GameFallout New Vegas is another Fallout series, which focuses on open world experience, with combat and RPG. Fallout New Vegas, like its predecessors, inherits lot of its series strong points, the most important thing is that your choice matters. The game is set upon the ruins of Nevada after the Great War, which includes the ""city"" of Las Vegas and its surroundings, such as Primm, Goodsprings, and Freeside. Like in RPG games, you can interact with a ton of characters, you could speak, trade, or get mission from them. The combat in the game is similar to FPS, which means just point your gun and shoot, but also added with a special mechanic that allow you to stop time for a while and fire more accurately.The Good of the GameOpen World. No borders.Since the beginning of the game, you can go whenever you wanted. You heard from the NPCs that the Quarry Junction is filled with deadly deadclaws, which are high-level encounters. You still want to go there? No problem. Do you want to skip early mission and head straight into New Vegas? No problem. You wanted to use that beautiful gun? No problems, there are no level requirement, just some stats requirement (for example : You need a high skill in Guns before you can use a Marksman Rifle).You can interact with many people.Every people have their own schedule, so you won't find a single person at the same location every time. At night they usually goes asleep at their own home. Some may visit other people, some may visit casinos, but no one will just stand and waiting for you to talk to them. You can kill people, enslave people (mods required), pickpocket them, puts grenade in their pants, etc. Some of them have interesting personalities, in fact most of the personalities you would find in Fallout New Vegas are on the colorful side, instead of the ""Regular Joe"" personalities. Like what a character in the game said : ""If someone is too clean, you can bet he/she has hidden a terrible secret.""Great DLCsFallout New Vegas does not have DLCs that only add 1-2 weapons, but they add DLCs that gives a new area to play, even some DLCs have different way to play. At Honest Hearts DLC, you are living with the tribes near Grand Canyon, thus you must rely on traditional medicine instead of your regular stimpak. At Dead Money, you are forced to be more resourceful and careful. And so on and so on.Better companion system that the previous game.Interactions with companions is now done using companion wheel, so you can order them around without the trouble of going to their dialog choices one by one. On the other hand, you companions also have a lot of interesting backstories attached to them. Faction systemThere are lots of faction vying for power in New Vegas. If you kill faction A members, expect them to came to you and try to kill you. If you help faction B members, expect them to give you something or help you.Weapon moddingA new feature in FNV, that allows weapons to be added with mods, such as scopes, silencers, cooling system, etc. A small but great addition to the game.Interesting worldThe world is interesting. The game is interesting. The world is interesting. The story, mission, backstories, they are all interesting. Interesting means that they evoke a sense of ""need to see the end"" of the story, so you don't get bored. The details of this game is also big, there are lots of terminals and logs scattered around places that gives rich backstory to the game.Mod supportEnough said. With mod support, there are lots of changes in the game. There are mods that makes the game more realistic, whether in the gameplay, lighting, or the weather. Some mods add weapons, armors, and other stuff to the game. Some even add areas outside the game world for more gaming hours. Mods are what Fallout New Vegas are still played today.The Bad of the GameBugsLike your regular Bethesda game, there are some bugs. Some doors fail to open, some achievements fail to register, some quests do not work, but mostly it is a minor issue. Being a PC master race, usually a simple console commands will fix the bug too. Bear in mind that the game is very stable, but using mods may creates instability, though it adds lots of fun.Companion missionWhile companion mission are great backstories and great stories themselves, to trigger them it is fairly difficult. Without guides, sometime we can only walk in the dark. Even more, some companions ""trigger"" will only trigger once (for example : when meeting a person for the first time) thus by just playing you could miss your companion mission and it have detrimental effect in the ending.VerdictA definite buy this game. Don't buy Fallout 4 yet, but buy this one and Fallout 3. Both are great games. ",410,96,25,72,120,2,141

												So instead of reviewing the game I'll tell you about a near perma-death-loop experience I had as an example of what kind of crazy stuff can happen in this game, and then you can decide if a game that allows you to experience crazy stuff like this is the kind of game you're interested in.-So I get a quest to go into this old abandoned vault to figure out why the towns water is radiated. They tracked the radiation to the vault but since there's tons of undead in it nobody wants to go in.-I get my rad suit on for protection, I got stimpacks, some fresh water, some rad-away, some rad-X and so on.-I head in and find out that there's a small cave I have to get through first.-Then I enter the vault.-I find my 1st vault dweller (undead) pretty easy, dead in a few shots of my 9mm machine gun.-I take some Rad-X to prevent rad poisoning.-And then I find my 1st vault dweller guard.-He's much stronger than the 1st, and he gets a lot of good hits on me.-I drink some water, and eat some food, it restores my health, but I still needed to use the one super stimpack I had, so now that's gone.-I have 10 water, 2 food, 4 stimpacks, and 1 doctors bag at this point.-So then I go deeper and deeper in the vault, navigating the maze, all the while my rad points are increasing steadily.-I get rad poisoning, I use some rad-away. This happened multiple times until the last time when I ran out of both anti-radiation meds.-By now I've explored most of the vault going from terminal to terminal to open door after door.-By now I have 5 water, no food, 1 stimpack, and a doctors bag.-I find the vault overseer who is the most radiated of the undead and the strongest, he's protected by 2 machine gun turrets.-Before fighting him I take out all the nearby undead to avoid them interrupting the fight and catching me off guard.-My supplies are: 3 water, no food, no doctors bag-I proceed to the overseer's door. My health is VERY low, so I use all 3 of my survival magazines to increase my water's effectivness of healing me, I then proceed to use all the water I have left in order to have the most health possible.-My health is now at 85% and I have no healing supplies.-I open the door, and the turrets start firing. I sneak in a grenade which takes them out.-My companion (A robot named ED-E) charges in and gets some good hits on the overseer, he now has half health, and I still have 85%.-He charges and I have no choice but to back away as quickly as possible while shooting a plasma rifle at him.-He gets plenty of hits on me lowering me to 5% health.-Then I get rad poisoning. And have no way of stopping it.-So now my brain FINALLY says ""GET THE CRAP OUT!""-So I begin to make my way out and actually run into another vault guard, I use a stealth boy in order to avoid detection, and have ED-E take him out.-After this happens my health is down to 4%. (Rad poisoning)-I proceed to try and find the fastest route out, but since it's a maze down there I end up just wandering aimlessly.-Eventually I find the exit to the vault.-My health is at 1%.-And then I hear a vault dweller directly behind me.-ED-E takes him out and by some INSANE luck, I level up.-Now leveling up does not restore health in Fallout. It just lets you increase your stats. So I'm not too excited.-But then it turns out it was an even number I leveled up to, which means I get a new perk.-One of the perks that I can unlock at level 12 (Which is what I leveled up to) is one that allows me to increase my max health by 50 more points.-And so I use it, make it out of the cave, fast travel to a doctor, and fix the rest.10/10 would panic insanely again.

												There are lots of people who say that Fallout 3 is better than Fallout: New Vegas because Fallout 3 has better dialogue, or more interesting characters, or makes you care more about the world than New Vegas does. Those people are lying.Let's start with the obvious one: The world. In Fallout 3, you basically have a choice of being a good guy or being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, but no matter what, you are railroaded into following the main quest line, which is to grow up in the vault, leave to chase after your father, join up with the Brotherhood of Steel, and fulfill your parents' dream of a wasteland filled with life. The only difference between a ""good"" and ""evil"" main quest completion is which of two options you pick at the very end, either putting a modified FEV strain into the water supply to kill off ""unfit humans,"" becoming a eugenicist in the process, or not doing that. That's it. A ""Do you want to be evil? Y/N"" dialogue box at the very end of the main quest is NOT GOOD DESIGN. Even worse, picking one choice or the other doesn't actually change anything after you complete the main quest. In New Vegas, by contrast, you have four different ways to finish the main quest line, and you're locked into picking one when you're still a few quests away from the climactic ending. Once you've firmly sided with one faction, the others  will shun you, and even attack you if you're particularly mean to them. The fate of the Mojave wasteland is real and dynamic, and you get to shape it to your will far more than you can the Capitol wasteland.And that's not even mentioning the fact that it takes a solid ten minutes in Vault 101 before you're let out into the world, while you only need about sixty seconds of listening to Michael Hogan before you can start roaming in New Vegas. The tutorial in NV is more organic than F3, and completely optional.What about the mechanics? Well, F:NV has everything F3 does, PLUS a fully-flushed crafting system (Fallout 3 let you make 10 marginally useful items from blueprints; New Vegas has dozens, maybe hundreds, of craftable items) that includes campfire remedies, reconstruction and recalibration of bullets, improvised ammo, natural poisons, and lots more; the ability to AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS (I didn't remember how much I valued that until I picked up Fallout 3 again); a higher level cap and more - and more specialized - perks (lots of Fallout 3's were just ""Add 5 points to this attribute and 5 to that one!"" Boring.); the need to choose two handicaps at the start of the game to make each playthrough pose its own challenges; faction disguises; a hardcore mode; decreased effectiveness of V.A.T.S. to make the choice of whether to use it or not meaningful (in Fallout 3 you could just spam Jet with Grim Reaper and mow down tons of foes without thinking; NV makes you play more tactically); and lots of other things I've mostly forgot about. From a mechanics perspective, then, Fallout: New Vegas does beat Fallout 3.What about characterization? Lots of people have said that they just didn't care about the characters in Fallout: New Vegas the way they did the characters in Fallout 3. I can only conclude they didn't get exposed to any video game characters before playing Fallout 3, because New Vegas' characters are definitely more flushed out. Companions are the best example of this: In Fallout 3, your companions have the personality of two lines in a speech bubble stapled to a cardboard cutout with a crayon smiley-face drawn on. There are no real differences between the companions: They simply run around, shoot whatever weapon you give them, and have a few generic lines of dialogue. In New Vegas, however, each character starts out holding a part of their personality back from you - you know, like people in real life. They have personal motivations, and will leave you if you do something they don't like (for example, retired NCR ranger Boone will leave if you start hurting NCR people, Cass will leave if you have very low Karma, etc.). If you do things they like while they're travelling with you (for example, if you have Chuck Bartow- I mean, Arcade Gannon in your party when you direct HELIOS One's power to Freeside and Westside), you will eventually trigger more dialogue options where they tell you more about their past - because they trust you - and, depending on how you respond, you can trigger a quest that has them confront their past, the choices they've made, and what their future holds. You, as their friend, have some influence based on your dialogue options, and that impacts the way these characters will act in the future. This is the epitome of characterization in video games. That is about as close to ""how people work"" that we're going to get in an open-world post-apocalyptic RPG, and I love it. I'm not going to bother getting into nitpicky things like weapons, armor, buff items, etc. It's a sequel, so of course there's an improvement in the variety of items. That's to be expected.In short, the worst Fallout: New Vegas can be accused of is ""not improving on Fallout 3 enough."" Fallout 3 is better from a ""Narrative storytelling"" perspective - the narrator, of course, being Liam Neeson - but Fallout: New Vegas is a game where *you* choose who you are - which is the crux of an RPG, a Fallout game in particular. I recommend you get both this and Fallout 3, but if you *have* to pick just one, New Vegas is the better option. -Heit			",82,19,0,23,18,0,36

												You were fooled. Tricked. Betrayed by the man. But you wake up from the grave with a mighty lust for revenge and nothing is going to stop you.Thats how i felt when I first started playing New Vegas. I think it has one of the most amazing beginnings of any game, because you just feel that you have the get back at the man who shoots you in the opening cutscene. A lot of people have spoken in a negative way about how the game isn't open from the start, and while I partly agree with that, I don't think it matters that much becuse starting your journey towards the strip is just so engaging.Like any other game from the fallout franshice the experience is what you make of it. If you just use the first gun you find, only follow the main storyline and don't talk to people and explore, you're probably not going to get that much out of the game, althoug it is certenly playabe that way.To get the most out of this game, you have to immerse yourself in your character that you can basically make your own in most ways; from what faction you are going to side with, handling delicate situuations peacfully with you charm or going in guns blazing killing everything is sight, how you are going to look and act during dialouges.The game is however full of bugs (and not just the giant insects trying to kill you). Some of it can be excused due to it being such a large world with so much to do, but it can be annoying at times when the game freezes, some character interactions being buggy and objects glitching out.But most bugs can be fixed throug unofficial patches since fallout probably has one of the largest modding comunities. This also means you can add endless amounts of content to game already filled to the brim with it.Fallout: New Vegas is a great addition to the already fantastic fallout series, fixing alot of the problems people had with Fallout 3, like like the iron sight. It aslo contains probably my favourite storyline in the series so far, with gambling, gangs and a big battle.8/10Feel free to check out my other reviews.			",423,123,9,42,53,7,62

												What do you get when you cross the Post-Apocalypse with the Old West? A bullet to the head.You play the role of a Courier who was ambushed, ""killed"", and brought back from the brink of death. Now you can hunt down the man who shot you and left you for dead! Or not. Take over the Mojave Desert! Or not. You can do pretty much what you like, even if that means shooting everyone while giggling like a madman/madwoman. (Giggling not included.)The DLC is recommended as well.			",83,16,0,12,5,0,3

Posted: April 17, 2016
												After the huge dissapointment that ruined the fallout franchise and decided that Fallout should be a fantasy first person action game with an ilusion of choice codnamed 'Fallou 3' we actually get a Fallout game. Ladies an gentlemen, welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.Now I'll be comparing this masterpiece to both FO3 and FO4:New Vegas is set much closer to the original Fallout games, on the west coast, where super mutants don't exist everywhere for shooting things reasons, there are no colapsed buildings to force you to go around or use console comadns( that annoyed me so much the only way I was traveling the DC ruins was using tcl).There are no enemies named 'raider', the 'raiders' are part of different gangs. There are FACTIONS, something thatwas missing in FO3, and they don't shoot at you for gameplay reasons. In case you haven't figured it out I'm talking about the Enclave, who even if you side with them still try to kill you just so you have something to shoot at that shoots back at you. Speaking of the Enclave WTF are they doing on the east coast in DC? I tought they blew upp at the oil rig back in FO2. You can still find remnants of the Enclave scattered across the Mojave, and they are well aware thet the Enclave blew up at the oil rig, one of them can be your companion. Companoins who won't hate you because you want to make money. Oh, and inn this game you aren't a concerned middle-aged white parent, or a 19 years-old daddy's boy, no, you are a... mailman. The Mailman. Who has more than 4 answers to a question. In FO4 you had 4 options: 1) Yes(I'll help you)2)A question that lead to the other options3) Sarcastic( make a bad joke that will make the player feel embarased they chise it and help him)4) I don't care about you but my character and quest  marker does so I'll help you anyway kind of option that will make your companion hate youIn New Vegas you can talk your way out of most situations with a SKILL check, and not having to quicksave before you choose something in case you have 10+ Charisma but you still fail. Also this CHR checks are not color coded for people with low INT(see what I did there) who can't read numbers. Also in FO4 INT no longer affects your speech, because they could't record so many lines. Take this for example:Fallout 4When you meet Kellogg, no matter what you say( all options indicating that you are a middle-aged concerned white parent) your options are:I'll kill youI'll make you sufferI'll make you payA bad joke about killing him again in hell or something like thatYou can't convince him to leave, either by a speech check or by having low INT, You can't side with him, BUT you can shoot him, because this what FO4 is all about: shooting things and being a middle-agedg concerned white parentIn FNVWhen you talk to the Legate you can tell him to f*ck off, you can convince him to fight you 1v1 with a karma check(karma no longer being in FO4)ORWhen you meet with Benny you can just kill him, have sex with and kill him in his sleep, let him escape and tell him to let you live etc.Also New Vegas includes dark humor, not bad and embarasing jokes that only a middle-aged concerned white parent would say. In FNV you have no family, no friends, it's just you, the Mailman. And that makes you feel like an adult making your own choices that affect the game.The 4 main factions are: Mr House, The NCR, the Legion and Yes Man's independent New Vegas. When you finish a faction's quest you don't get the same end mission( yeah,you have to face Lanius, but under different circumstaces) like you do in FO4. Also, some may disagree, but its better if the game doesn't allow to play after the main quest because if you sided with let's say the NCR, you've probably done all of their quests before the second battle for Hoover Dam. If you would still be ablle to play, there'd be no legion, no Mr House so it's better if the game ends with the main quest. Also this game includes gambliing, just like FO3 and FO4, but unlike FO3 and FO4 it's gambling with chips and money and all that, not your skills and dialog options. There are also plenty of smaller factions such as the Great Khans, The BoS, who can either help or work against in the second battle for Hoover Dam.Take this for example: Colonel Moore from the NCRasks you to(spoilers) deal with the BoS. You can initiate the self destruct sequence, just kill them of sign a truce between the NCR and the BoS. Each of these options will give you a diffferent end slide, and the Courier can decide if the choice was either good or bad. You can play as a saint or thedevil's right hans if you want, you don't have to be the Wasteland's hero. FO4 wants you play as a good guy, but it doesn't really let you help people. In FNV you can really help people if you want to, like helping people in Freeside kick their habbits, not making you build houses like a minecraft ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 'settlers'  who are never happy. There are plenty of houses in Boston, you don't need more.			",54,7,0,9,3,0,3

												Well, where to start? Hmm, ok, the main story of New Vegas: VERRRRY well written! An almost perfect balance of difficulty, questlining, exploration and cast of colourful characters. An awesome 4 different endings for the final Hoover Dam battle, deciding the ultimate fate of the Mojave forever. Plenty of side and faction quests to keep you occupied for an easy 100+ for completionists. The factions are very cool, with some very interesting backstories, e.g. how the NCR are the re-construction of the democratic world, or how the Legion are basing themselves on the success of Pre-War Rome. Definitely adds to the throwback of the Pre-War era.Ok onto the DLC's:Lonesome Road: Ok Lonesome Road has got to be my favourite DLC by far. The amazing and yet emotional story of the true destruction of human nature, The Divide. The hellish nightmare you'd think most of the Fallout world would truly be. With plenty of secret US Govt. bases and awesome prototype laser weapons including Red Rocket. A heartwarming and cold-blooded ending with the tale encrypted into ED-E, and an epic finale showdown in an OPERATIONAL Nuclear Missile Silo, with the option to change all Faction relations in the Mojave with the option to Nuke NCR or Legion... or BOTH! 10/10 would replay many times!Old World Blues: This was an interesting DLC. Travelling to an old Pre-War Area51-esque science base called Big MT, having your Spine, Brain and Heart removed for robot parts, and then quest to overthrow the facility and track down your old brain in a very epic confrontation. Definitely will recommend this DLC to anyone. 10/10Dead Money: Ok, so Dead Money. This DLC has a unique and interesting storyline, of a super luxurious casino opened on the day of the Great War bombings in 2077. Having never opened, and left sealed in a cloud of toxic dust, it has been haunted by the ghosts and holograms left to rot. I liked the story of the Greatest Heist of the Century. Howecer, the downside to this DLC is the unbelievable difficulty. It took me as a Lvl50 character, 9 hours and about 12 deaths later to beat it. Its a good DLC, but needs to be nerfed in Difficulty ALOT! 6/10Honest Hearts: Honest Hearts was the kind of DLC made specifically for the more strategic and cartegoraphical advanced player. Not an easy terrain to navigate in the Utah badlands, but a very cool Native American-esque story with many tribes scared of Pre-War structures, living the old native way, under threat for warmonger tribe White Legs. And a heartwarming story to decide the fate to Fight or Run to save the Sorrows and Dead Horses. And a very confronting meet with The Burned Man himself.... 9/10			",141,40,6,27,31,1,16

												Best Fallout title to datemassive amounts of content worthwhile exploration, faction affinity and looting as well as immersive side stories after having played fallout 4 I realized one of the things I loved the most about this game was the dialogue options and skill system. You can become a professional and your dialogue reflects it, if you've got high medical skill you'll have unique conversations with doctors, got guns? talk to gunsmiths and so onthey also included the classic fallout intelligence dialogue feature in that if youre intelligence is really high you speak clearly and concisely and if it is really low you basically just talk like a super mutantcan't reccomend this game highly enough			",32,0,0,10,1,0,7

												I never appreciated this game enough when it first game out, still riding the high of Fallout 3.  That really wasn't fair, I wasn't as familiar with the previous games and I was playing them all on console at the time.  Years later, after writing this game off, I came back to it here on steam and by then I was deep in the PC modding community, which only enriched this rediscovery.  Even without mods, I can say that Fallout: New Vegas is a GREAT GAME!  In improves on the gunplay of Fallout 3, adds a gigantic arsenal of new weaponry to enjoy and brings back a lot of the cooky humor from the previous games, as well as a few homages to classic characters, storylines and items.  It's not the bleak, incredibly atmospheric experience of Fallout 3, that game still gets all those points right on the money, but if you want fun gameplay, to not take things so seriously and play your way, this game has it all!  It's before the sytem was streamlined in Fallout 4 and improves on all the favorite features of Fallout 3, making it probably the best Fallout game to date, in my humble opinion.If you get onto The Nexus and start throwing mods at this thing, prepare for a of the best gaming experiences you can have today!  There's still people putting work into this game right now just a browse will help you increase performance, fix various bugs and glitches, overhaul the graphics with HD texture packs, lighting and weather effects and even give yourself an alternative, roleplay focused start that can give you an entirely new loadout and starting location based on the decisions you make at the start!Great game, fun game, please buy and play it NOW!

												A huge world to explore, lots of quests and decisions, tons of items and great replay value are reason enough to pick up this fine roleplaying game. Very few changes appeared since Fallout 3 but a strong storyline and partial improvements make New Vegas great to play. Take it as an alternative to Fallout 3 and you won't be disappointed. Overall Fallout 3's story was better, but New Vegas's story is interesting as well (if you can stomach character-with-amnesia stories), and has a better combat system. Personally, this is one of my most favorite games - RPG at its finest!

												Considered by most people as the best fallout. This game is a great game with tons to do. Your choices matter in this game. If you decided to team with any faction it could drastically affect the game. You can be evil or a saint. This game is a great fallout game and a great game in general. This game worth every penny and sometimes it even goes on sales so you could get this amazing wasteland to explore and reform for just 5$! Great game haven't gotten the DLC yet but I hear it is great so I will get it as soon as possible.			",181,25,2,20,35,5,8

												More and more, I return to New Vegas as the absolute paragon of how a game can resist the ""Show it all in one playthrough"" mentality, taking your actions and choices and moulding them into a meaningfully different, unique-to-you conclusion that describes how your time in the Mojave Wasteland affected not only the fate of characters you met, but entire factions and regions of America in the years following the game's conclusion.Obsidian provide a masterclass in storytelling, engaging and memorable quests, meaningful choices and fantastic post-apocalyptic survival gameplay. Fallout has always been about the world that was burned away as much as it is about the world that rose from its ashes, and Obsidian never forgets this. Dark humour abounds, twinged with a kind of sadness, but also with profound musings on what it is to be human, what it means to lose your history and culture, and how we might replace these things among the ruins of the civilisation of yesteryear.A fantastic job is done of resisting painting the franchise's various factions as simply ""goodies and baddies"", giving you the freedom to decide the fate of the Mojave without feeling like you have been pidgeon-holed down clear-cut, simplified endings. The game refrains from judging the player's morality in a refreshing way, staying true to a core tenet of Fallout: morality is a flexible thing that can mean many things in the Wasteland.I cannot stress enough that this is a game totally unafraid to bar you from embarking on certain quests as a result of your actions, and I must insist that if you play it, you fully embrace it. It's not about seeing it all, it's about the tailored story unique to your character that came about by reacting intelligently to how you played, and letting the chips fall where they may. In my most recent playthrough I played as an Enclave fanatic, and this roleplaying decision governed all of my choices - what weaponry and armour I wore, how I interacted with others, the factions I chose to support and attack. It couldn't have been a more different playthrough than my first, where I decided to be chummy with the New California Republic. It is hard to describe the satisfaction to be had when a game reacts so capably to your decision-making. Few games have done it as well as here.Companions are memorable and have side-quests which open up their characterisation and make you feel attached. Locations are iconic, ranging from the debauched New Vegas Strip to the sun-baked settlements that surround it.The DLC is, frankly, unmissable, chronicling an excellent story thread which is interwoven in each piece of DLC despite them at first glance appearing to be thematically unrelated. It's important to play them in order of release for the full effect.Fallout 3 was an amazing RPG, but New Vegas reminded me why exactly I had loved Fallout so much in the first place. Closer to Fallout 1 and 2 in tone and RPG design, New Vegas leaves huge boots to fill for Bethesda's Fallout 4. New Vegas honestly remains one of the best games of its generation.

												I know the Fallout series from the promotions of fallout 4 when it was announced. It is a great game. As a fan of FPS games, I can't deny the fun of fallout 4. Until I bought and play Fallout: New Vegas (FO:NV), I start to realise what an RPG should be like. It would not be exaggerated to say that this game is the best among Fallout 3, NV and 4.The GoodsBeing a real RPGIn the game, when you talk to someone else, there are usually at least 3 dialogue options to be chosen. DIfferent dialogue can lead to different ending of that mission or even brings good/bad impression to the ppl in that area. In contrast, the dialogue options in fallout 4 is limited to 4 only. In some situation, different dialogue options will lead to the same consequences. Fallout 4 has been focusing on FPS too much and forgotten the RPG part. FO:NV has shows what a good RPG should be like --- the player can immerse in playing as the protagonist.Attention to detailAs mentioned before, what the player has done can affect the reputation of him/her in a town/settlement. For example, if the player has completed a lot of side quests assigned by the residents in the settlement, residents there will be more polite to the player and may even offer discount to the player when he/she purchase stuffs there. If a player wears a certain cloths in a certain place. NPC may recognise him/her as a companion/enemy and stops shooting/start shooting the player. These attention to detail warn players to be cautious when making a decision in the game and immerse into the game. Similar to fallout 3, player can choose a skills when level up and unlock unique dialogue options in certain circumstances. This makes the conversation goes smoother or deeper. Player can also explore the history of some special characters or some places by talking to the residents there. Those details in the game makes the game a lot more immersive than the fallout 4.Fabulous storylineI don't want to spoil the story too much... The game offers a wide variety of options for player to choose so that the story is driven by the options made by the player. (A little tip: Upgrade Speech first as it will be beneficial when the story progresses)The BadsPoor optimization to newer Operating SystemIt happens with fallout 3 too. Bethesda Softworks simply doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game running on newer operating system. To even start the game properly, player needs to search for fixes on the community forum. I run the game with the fixes found on the Internet and the game will still crash periodically. Such a great game is sort of ""abandoned"" by the developer. In contrast, I can still run Half Life 1 on my WIndows 10 PC smoothly without needing to fix the game by myself. I don't think it is that hard to make the game run on newer OS smoothly. Bethesda Softworks, please fix this.Minor flawsThe abbreviation of certain ammo does not have any full name with it and sometimes may cause some confusion to the player. It may be a good idea to display the full form of the abbreviation when player select the items. Also, some bugs are presented in this game. I get stucked behind the wall and can't get out sometimes. It is really frustrating.Overall ImpressionThis is a fabulous game if you can patch the game yourself and tolerate the bugs on that game. I really hope the developer can publish an update to the game so that player can run the game flawlessly on newer OS. This would really make this an undeniable masterpiece.			",194,24,14,22,30,3,14

												I remember waiting anxiously for Fallout: 3 to finally arrive. I had played and loved Fallout and Fallout 2. I had waited for  years, and could barely contain my excitement for a modern Fallout title to be released. I have no shame admitting that I enjoyed playing the game immensely. However, I always felt that it just had the Fallout name slapped onto a post-apocalyptic RPG, with a few Fallout-esque elements thrown in to loosely tie it to the previous titles. While the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the DC ruins was incredible, It didn't follow in the intellectual footsteps of the previous games in the Fallout lineage, nor did it maintain the same feel. When Fallout: New Vegas arrived, I was completely blown away. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The setting in the American Southwest maintained the atmosphere of the original titles.  The faction system allowed for alliances to be forged within the Mojave Wasteland, but like the real world, denied you the possibility of making everyone happy. While I believe there was a mistake in maintaining the clunky Karma system of FO:3, I felt your choices within the game were more morally grey, more reflective of the world wherein there are actions and consequences rather than an arbitrary definition of good and evil. The major NPCs have excellent dialog and some of the most compelling back stories in gaming. The base game is good in and of itself, but the DLC add dimensions that are unparalleled in any of the previous Fallout games and the modding community has produced many excellent add-ons which enhance the gameplay and appearance far beyond the vanilla offering. I have devoted more hours to this game than any rational adult should. It is by far my favorite game of all time.			",21,5,0,10,2,0,1

												The game is based in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The player takes control of the character known as the Courier.Fallout New Vegas is a well polished game and an exeptional RPG.+Huge open world+Variety of enemies and creatures in the wasteland+Very good voice acting+Moddable Guns and changeable ammo+New guns and armour (the power armour is still in the game)+Entertaining radio music to keep you jingle jangle jingle+Good story,will take you time to complete+Many DLC's add's hours of gameplay+Mods, it makes the game even a better masterpiece+Skills are blanced out and are well though after+Pipboy is back+Damage on enemies are beter than fallout 3, but skills are a heavy influence of this factor+Gameplay is smooth and easy+Audio is Nice and clearWhat i dont like:- The Deathclaw creature romes the wasteland and is extremely powerful. if you dont hace the right weapons or gear, you wil DIE.(+)Game has a yellowish orange tint, but i think its for the desert wasteland feel.But its not noticed by everyone and i downloaded a mod to take it away, i will not make this a minus because its my opinion.-The vegas strip, well i expected more but hey, a nuke exploded so i cant judge.This game does not have anymore flaws, its a perfect RPG from obsidian and puplisher Bethesda.I really liked Fallout 3 and this is just and better version with new content,story and map,a big aprovement over Fallout 3(a very good game on its own).

												Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. Thankfully Fallout: New Vegas was developed under Obsidian Entertainment, a smaller company known mainly for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. The project leader was Joshua Sawyer, the same person in charge of the original Fallout 3 that was cancelled after financial troubles with the developer’s parent company. Fallout: New Vegas serves as a “return to form” for the Fallout series, bring it back to its roots in exploring the ethics of a post-apocalyptic world, not exploring the world itself.Returning to Western USA, New Vegas is set in the Mojave Wasteland, directly adapted from the real world Mojave desert. Being a western the art direction of the game has changed from Fallout 3 but it should look familiar. The horrible green tint has been replaced by a much more subtle (yet still a bit annoying) orange tint, Buildings a much more suited to the environment (with much more varied interiors) and a good portion of the game world is actual desert. Despite being set on a desert, the sheer amount of content in New Vegas is densely packed in a logically designed world that is easy to navigate without a map, thanks to cleverly located landmarks. Gone are the days of trying to distinguish between this pile and rubble and that pile of rubble. The Mojave also features a number of areas that are very dangerous to lower level players, while level scaling does exist, it only ensures that enemies aren’t just cannon fodder at later levels.Moving from Fallout 3 to New Vegas won’t feel too different gameplay wise. While the two are very similar, New Vegas is improved in every way. Iron sights have been added to make first person shooting a viable tactic, VATS has been reworked to be less unfair for enemies, Guns skill no longer increases bullet damage, etc. Character creation has had a few smaller changes but the ways your point allocation works in the world has been greatly improved. Perks are only gained once per two levels making you still human by level 30. Traits make a welcome comeback from Fallout and Fallout 2 where you can choose a nice little perk but at the cost of something else. Fallout: New Vegas allows great flexibility in what kind of character you want to play as, and all character build are perfectly viable. Want to be a gunslinger who kills and instils fear in all who oppose him? Go Ahead. Want to be a pacifist? Using your words to solve issues? Sure, New Vegas allows you to. Being able to shape the game, rather than just play it, is what makes Fallout: New Vegas stand out among modern RPGs. It’s surprising how not many Role Playing Games actually let you Role Play. While at launch the game was buggy beyond being playable, the game has been shaped by developers post launch to be the most stable Gamebryo game in existence, not a hard title to achieve but a good one nonetheless.You play as “The Courier” and while delivering a small package to the New Vegas Strip, you are ambushed and end up in a shallow grave. Miraculously you survive the encounter and begin your quest to retrieve the mysterious package. A common misconception with Act I of the story is that it's just a western tale of revenge. The reality is that the story is about the package you were meant to deliver and using it to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland and its inhabitants.The two main factions, the New California Republic and Caesar’s Legion are battling for control of Hoover dam and the conflict between the two is apparent throughout the whole game, and by the time you finish Act I you should be near a decision on who you want to side with, or if you want to side with one of them at all. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a simple tale of White Knights vs Evil Moustache twirling cartoon characters and many of the game’s decisions are morally ambiguous as opposed to black and white choices. Because the game predominantly features factions with unique motives, it makes sense to reintroduce the Faction Reputation System, as opposed to relying on a heavily flawed Karma System. Players can complete quests in a variety of different ways, and in favour of different people. Whether it be through distribution of electricity, or destroying the NCRs monorail; the variety of ways to play the game makes it unrivalled in terms of replayability.Interacting with the seemingly infinite number of NPCs is a joy. Dialogue is excellently written and everyone has lots to say. The Skill checks the feature are well varied in the skills they use and expertly written to be believable. “Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past” sounds like a credible thing someone trained in Medicine would say. While the number of voice actors is only a small improvement over Fallout 3, the quality of the voice acting is a massive improvement, characters personalities are greatly enhanced by the brilliant voice work done. Facial animation still leaves a lot to be desired but it’s still an improvement. Because Obsidian Entertainment consists of many ex-Black Isle employees, including the series creator Tim Cain, New Vegas is very faithful to the canon established by the first two games. The game also plays a lot like a first person version of the old-school RPGs. A lot of NPC interaction is involved making the game more about interacting with the world than exploring it.Fallout: New Vegas does well to capture the atmosphere of Fallout, a world rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust. Adding to this is the soundtrack, which is largely comprised of the atmospheric music from the first two games. While it’s disappointing that very little new score was composed for New Vegas, it’s still infinitely better than the action movie soundtrack of Fallout 3. Radio stations make a return and play music appropriate for the retro future setting. Though this time with radio hosts that actually make sense in the world of Fallout.If you enjoy RPG experiences with deep lore, plenty of replayability then Fallout: New Vegas is for you. If you just want a simple minded shoot and loot then it may not be for you, but I still highly recommend it. It does a fantastic job of bringing Fallout back to being… Fallout.			",100,7,3,5,4,2,9

												Amazing game. Of the 55 hours of playing it I spent maybe 20 hours on actual story missions. The rest was spent doing sidequests, some more sidequests and finally some more sidequests. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Seriously, if you get easily distracted then this is the game for you. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing addictive. I played it for 13 hours the day I bought it. When you start you can't stop. The story is amazing, the characters are great and the gameplay is good.That said, I didn't think the game was that immersive. The game is full of bugs, NPC's act like robots with loose wires. They're always running into walls, getting stuck in animations et cetera. Oh, and above all, CRASHES. At the start is wasn't that bad. I had maybe 2 crashes in the first 13 hours I played it. But especially near the end the game was crashing like crazy. Every time I booted up the game I crossed my fingers, because there's a chance the game will crash so hard you will need to reboot our PC. At one point I lost more than 5 hours of progress because the game flipped a coin and decided 3 of my save files didn't exist anymore. This is what made me take a break from the game for about 15 months. If you get past that however, the game really shines, especially the story. The premise is amazing and the way the different factions interact with eachother is really well done. You really get a sense that you're in the middle of a living, breathing community. This is probably the reason this game is so addictive. That and the fact that the missions are extremely varied. One moment you're a bouncer for a lasergun store, and the next moment you're helping radiation zombies develope a space program. The dialogue is really well done as well, with loads of funny lines and loads of interesting choices to make. During the entire game I listened to Radio New Vegas, which is an awesome station although several 50's country songs are now forever etched into my soul.To conclude: An amazingly solid game, even though it does has some technical issues. Definitely recommended.9/10			",183,23,7,17,23,2,8

												Sunset Sasparilla > Nuka Cola.Now for the serious part.They've done it again. They've made a game that's just enough balance between simple and complex to make it really easy to sink hours into.With the degradation of Fallout into ""Skyrim with guns"", thanks to Bethesda (who DIDN'T work on this game), I thought it was time to revisit some of OBSIDIAN Entertainment's work.Boy, was I glad I did; I actually stopped playing Skyrim to play this instead, and it's so much better.Favorite DLC: Old World Blues			",152,30,1,19,15,1,14

												While some say its really buggy I didn't have that problem, since there are several readily available mods (posted in a sticky on the steam forums) that fix most of this game's problems. I played the previous 3 fallout games and enjoyed all of them, but this is my favorite so far.Its an enjoyable Open World quest based RPG game that let's you do *almost* anything. And then you find out that the Legion are slavers that crucify people for fun and you realize that you only have one choice. Which is killing every living thing in the wasteland to prevent the Legion from having the pleasure, of course.			",113,10,1,18,38,0,71

												Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition is a good RPG with an interesting setting and a lot of content. That said it also has a lot of quest related bugs that make it seem to be not very thoroughly tested. There are a lot of locations to explore and factions to discover. You can choose your way of playing the game after you develop some skills pretty freely and it never loses that ""choose your way"" feeling. The DLC that tie in along the way are mixed. Dead Money and Lonesome Road feel like filler material while Honest Hearts let's you explore a totally different area and Old World Blues is just a must play. The main story isn't fully engaging, but it offers enough choices to be interesting for a couple of play-throughs.Sadly the game crashes a lot and feels a bit under-tested which takes away from the overall experience. Otherwise I'd fully recommend the trip to New Vegas!			",3264,1344,120,378,423,37,486

												This review. Like my Fallout 3 review will be long.For my Fallout 3 review go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/recommended/22300Fallout New Vegas still stands as one of the greatest games ever to be enjoyed not only as a Fallout fan but an RPG fan as a whole.The game brings together combined elements from Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout 3. While adding a few things of it's own here and there to make the game even more exciting. To top it off this game presents Hardcore mode, which basically turns Fallout New Vegas into an (almost) realstic game.Combat- Combat has seriously improved since Fallout 3. The combat in this game instead of a straight forward shooting up your enemies with VATS with a few grenades here and a rocket launcher here, and a lazer gun here and last aid of your companions or the other faction that is fighting your potential killer, you will have to rely mostly on 'special ammo' for example, if you are attacked by a deathclaw the only way to kill it or bring down it's 'defeneses' (the name will have a shield icon right next to it) is by using armor-piercing rounds. Music- The music of this game is both combination of western and Vegas style. You will need music mods to make that list grow even larger. But in the end it doesn't really matter because both music pieces presented in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are great either way.Quests- There is a barrage of quests, not only from the modding standpoint, but also DLC and the game overall. You will spend a lot more hours with these quests as the same amount of hours you do with Fallout 3, and the other Fallout titlesCompanions- Companions are no longer ""Lydia's with guns"" They are actually smarter and with the aid of the companion wheel it makes life SO MUCH easier when talking to your companion for him, her, or it to move back, go non-agressive, wait, trade equipment, and maintain distance. Bewarn, if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode, your companions will still be smarter, but they will end up dying and staying dead till you reload your save or you restart the game after you finish it. There are also companion centered quests, Which by the way some are fun, but others are just boring and tedious to do.World/ Exploration- Unlike Fallout 3, where it really shows the post apocalyptic side to the world. Fallout New Vegas really doesn't have the gritty atomosphere sadly, It is more of a homage to movies like Mad Max (1979) and the Book of Eli with Denzel Washington (2010). All desert, a few settlements here and there. Hostile areas here and there with random events. You only have the New Vegas area as the ""DC ruins"" of this game but unlike D.C ruins of this game, it is populated. Also the game map itself is huge.RPG- The RPG elements in this game are heavily seen, for example, ""Faction armor"" depending upon what faction armor you wear, the other side, and the neutral party might be offensive or hostile to what you wear. The choices you make in game, also shape how the faction looks at you. Leveling up is much different from previous games. It goes on an odd or even level of leveling up, so install mods to fix this little issue and make it more like Fallout 3's leveling up system. Lastly the perks within the game that you obtain either through challenges or leveling up really make a difference so choose wiselyDLC- The DLC within the game are extremely well done. If you want to put your skills to the test, play Dead Money. If you want to play a DLC that touchers your inner nerd, play Old World Blues. If you want something more faction oriented and exploration play Honest Hearts. And lastly if you want all three combinations (except the inner nerd part) But offer a much more bigger challenge, play Lonesome Road. There are also 'player add-ons' that gives you basically starting gear.Voice Acting- Fallout New Vegas not only has a huge celebrity cast, but also the voice acting for the different NPCs ranges differently so from settlement to settlement don't expect about every odd or even number of NPCs to sound the same.The Modding Community- The modding community has been ever helpful to make this game not only challenging, but more prettier and much more longer, also of course the usual mods (weapons, armor, companions, etc.). *MASSIVE Spoiler Alert* Because unlike in Fallout 3 where you can free roam after Broken Steel DLC, all DLC takes place BEFORE the final battle at Hoover Dam. So make sure you really take your time with this game, because there is no going back when the final quest begins.Conclusion: Like in my Fallout 3 review, Fallout New Vegas has things that Fallout 3 should've had, but again Fallout 3 had things that Fallout New Vegas should've had as well. But regardless of that, it is really an enjoyable game to play and this game is a definite recommendation			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												Fallout: New Vegas is the single best video game to ever be released, with no other game even coming close. The story is great, and for the time, so were the mechanics. You actually had real choice, unlike gay♥♥♥♥♥Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. There were real RPG elements, relation to the original games, and a western theme. In fact, New Vegas is so good that Bethesda refuses to recognize it because they know that Obsidian is better at making Fallout than them. Companions actually make sense in New Vegas. You have to do a quest in order to get them to like you, unlike Fallout 4 where you could pick 50 locks and then ♥♥♥♥ Piper. The endings were all different, unlike Fallout 4 where there are three reskins of the same ending, and then an Institute ending. Also, in New Vegas you can be ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. You can sell Arcade Gannon to Caesar, give Veronica to the White Gloves, you can burn Doc Mitchell to death, and take over the whole Mojave with Father Elijah. Speaking of Dead Money, it is the best DLC for a game to ever come out, only rivaled by Old World Blues. And if you don't like Dead Money or get a mod to make it easier, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. Speaking of mods, New Vegas has the best. Someguy2000's mods alone are better than anything the entire dumbass Bethesda team could come up with. In New Vegas, there is a sense of progression in the map as you go south and around to Vegas. It makes the game feel structured, increasingly challenging, and increasingly rewarding. Again, unlike Fallouts 3 and 4 where you can go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want right after leaving the Vault. The vaults in those games had basically the same ♥♥♥♥ing number too. God Bethesda is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can play New Vegas however you want. You can play the whole game like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and never kill anyone, a feature Bethesda promised for Fallout 4 but didn't deliver on. You can also play the whole game without dying or even healing at all. There are so many choices within each endgame faction that you have to replay each faction multiple times to try out all the possible endings (except for the NCR, they're too gay to play more than once). Oh and even the raiders have more character in New Vegas. They fall into gangs with history and lore. In Fallout 4, they are just raiders. Nothing else. Mindless fodder to shoot. The enemy placement throughout the Mojave is explained and just makes sense. Now I do rip on Fallout 3 and 4 a lot, they aren't bad games. In fact, they are pretty good. Just they are not RPG's. They are open world action games. All in all, Bethesda needs to liscence another Obsidian Fallout game if they want to save their cucked company.			",19,0,0,5,2,0,0

												 Fallout: New Vegas, is possibly one of the most successful video games published to the Steam Community. Not only becuase of its sense of real life war, conflict of nature, and real grasp of a post apocalyptic world, but also becuase it allows to feel yourself as you might in the real world. An example of such is how it allows you create your own character, with your own tastes in style, color, and even gender.  It also gives you the feeling of bonding with other NPC's as they as well have a design, much like one you would find in the real world itself. Another very popular and inspiring thing for this game, is its open world enviroment. You can do what you want, go where you want, take who's side you want, and say what you want. Along with a more then wide variety of armor, weaponry, and most anything else you can think of, to choose and select from. And if that isn't enough to satisfy your tastes, you also have the ability to install mods, to perk up the enviroment, change many differant aspects of the game, the people, places, and things you interact with, and even yourself. Though this is a spin-off from the Fallout games, 1 2 and 3, this world still allows you to imerge in a whole differant world that you would likely never find in any other game. And if you're the type who is up for a challenge, you can even use a feature, known as ""Hard Core Mode"", where hunger, thirst, sleep, and radiation, will be allowed to play roles in your gameplay experience. All in all, this game is a excellent piece of art made by the game industry, and I would highly recommend buying this game, if you are the type of gamer who like post apocalyptic, open worlds, as well as a throw-back to what seems to be as far back as the late 1950's, yet mixed with a futuristic element at the same time. I would with no doubt support this game, and encourage the Community to give it a shot. Game on, Fallout Universe!			",162,45,7,24,15,0,17

Posted: July 3, 2014
												Just thought I'd share an old preview of the game that I did when it was first showcased at PAX.  Fallout: New Vegas lived up to every anticipation, and is truly an excellent game worthy of the series.______________________________________________________________I just returned from my first PAX, where I managed to get a good look at the upcoming Fallout game: Fallout New Vegas.The Bethesda booth had demos on the X-Box, only allowed you to play for a (theoretically) 15-minute interval, using a demo savepoint, and had lines at least 45 minutes long -- all of which gives you a very limited look into the game. But fortunately, I discovered that the Nvidia booth had a Fallout 3 demo for the PC, often with no lines and a gameplay duration limited only by your conscience. As such, I was able to get in several hours of play in the new game.That said, I avoided most anything that would spoil the plot for me, as well as avoided major areas like The Strip. Instead, I focused on learning what I could about changes to gameplay, and I'm writing to share those with you.What I've learned:(If you've been looking forward to this game, some of these things you will probably already know from other reviews and spoilers.)Fallout New Vegas uses the same engine and basic gameplay as Fallout 3, but incorporates a lot of things from Fallout 1 & 2 that Fallout 3 dispensed of, and includes a lot of game tweaks previously only available in mods.Visually, the game is beautiful. The green haze is gone, giving us a bright blue sky and a lush desert landscape which is heavy on oranges and browns.Traits are back. Traits are special perks, available only at the beginning, which either modify the game a little or which give you a benefit at the cost of a drawback. You can pick two traits for your character. (One trait, Wild Wasteland, ""adds additional 'wacky' content and modifies existing content and special encounters"" that makes connections to the bizarre encounters you could have in the first Fallout games.)Skills have been mildly revamped. ""Small Guns"" and ""Big Guns"" are now just ""Guns"". Plus, they have added in the ""Survival"" skill. (More on it later.)A lot of the perks from the older games are apparently back. In addition, opposite-sex perks (like Black Widow) now have same-sex equivalents.Food items now give you health slowly over time rather than in a single lump sum. With sufficient Survival skill, you can activate any campfire you find and cook food (or otherwise combine foodstuffs) to create superior foodstuffs. For example, you can cook gecko meat to create a gecko steak which is much healthier.Similar to the ""recipes"" for food, you have the ability to modify or break down your weapons with a sufficient level of Repair skill -- you can even break down scrap metal into lead. You can add silencers, scopes, etc to certain weapons if you have the parts, the Repair skill, and a workstation.In addition, apparently you can repair items up to 100% regardless of the level of your Repair skill -- higher levels just makes it easier, requiring less items.And, having mentioned gecko meat... yes, geckos are back! In addition to a wider variety of monsters, New Vegas offers more variety within those monsters, including smaller ""young"" versions of the adult critters.As well as basic good-evil karma, you also garner reputation with each settlement and group. On a similar note, stealing from any group (even an evil one) will get you negative karma. This leads to scenarios like the one I encountered below:I sneak up on a camp of Powder Gangers (a gang formed of escaped convicts -- they be evil) and take them out (gaining positive karma for killing the bad guys but negative reputation with the Powder Gangers). I loot their bodies (gaining nothing... except loot, of course). Then I loot their campsite (gaining negative karma for stealing from the Powder Ganger faction).As a fun addition, if you are wearing the outfit of a particular faction, you are disguised as a member of that faction. The initial reactions of people you run into will be based on that disguise. (So, as it turns out, running around in Powder Ganger armor wasn't such a smart idea.)Weapons (at least some of them) have special critical hits. For example, fighting with boxing gloves allowed me to knock an enemy critter out cold.So, overall, I'm even more excited for Fallout: New Vegas than I was before PAX. It looks like this game is going to be excellent!			",70,19,1,20,1,0,4

												This game is honestly the best modern Fallout title to this day. It fixes almost everything that Bethesda flopped with in the original (DT is better than DR, the locales are pretty believable, dialogue checks are guaranteed with proper skills), and it just feels like what Fallout should have been with the transition. There's no level scaling, so there are some locations that are probably a bit too difficult until you reach a certain level, and it doesn't feel like an empty land to explore. There's vegetation and people trying to go about and make the world seem as if it's trying to repair itself 200+ years after The Great War rather than the DREARY POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND THAT STILL SOMEHOW HAD FOOD IN GROCERY STORES. Good character writing, quirky but not too far out there, and factions are well done. Karma system still sucks but is essentially irrelevant.Also, unlike FO3, there are actually 200+ endings in New Vegas. Just play this buggy mess instead of Fallout 3/4, because Bethesda needs to know that they suck at Fallout, and it's a shame that we might not see Obsidian take another jab at it. Remember to consent with Fisto.			",124,6,1,18,3,1,19

												Ok, now that I'm waiting for Fallout 4 to come out, I guess I'm going to go back and visit the Mojave for a while.  The counter above the block where I'm writing this says I've played for 490.9 hours.  I might be willing to concede that such a thing is not necessarily healthy.Nevertheless:  if you consider yourself a gamer, and you haven't played this, you need to snap it up and find out what you've missed.  Some may wail about crashes:  cry me a river.  Save periodically.Yes, you may find some graphical oddities from time to time...but if you want richer stories, or more authentic post-apocalyptic atmosphere, you're probably going to have to wait until the real thing happens.  On the plus side, your wait might not be that long...so there's that.There are an endless supply of mods out there as well, so even after you've played through, you can still revisit and find new things.  Don't like the color of the post-atomic sky?  There's a mod for that.  Want real firearm textures? They got 'em.  Want to own your own casino?  You can fix up the one in Primm.If'n you don't, folks will be saying that 'Clint Eastwood' is the biggest yella-belly in the...whoops...wrong review.What are you still reading this for?  Step to!  And tell Victor I said ""Howdy!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great rpg with a steady pace throughout the game. If you want a new generation fallout game that better represents the originals then this is the game, it follows a greater focus on character development and how you interact with the world; appreciating the fact that not everyone cares about pure run and gunning (you can still do that but there is a high chance of death involved). It may be a sudden change from the atmosphere of Fallout 3 now that they have somewhat of a more civilised stable society and its rather reminiscent of the wild west styled games but that only serves to continue the atmospheric development. If you can embrace actual adventure and actually role play then you are in for a treat of post apocalyptic wild west vibe. All I can say is give it a shot and don't try to compare it to Fallout 3.

												A game of limitless choices, possibilities, and complexity; something an RPG wants to be at its core. Fallout New Vegas is truly an 'epic' experiance, with a whole world of choices and options at the players fingertips, all of which is explorable and playable space. Want to be a space cowboy firing lazors and lever action rifles, sure. Want to be a swat trooper who bashes peoples knees in with a katana, you can easily do that. The game just has a lot of things to do.These choices, compound into its ultimate game strength; the sheer amount of content there is. The game has a massive world, with easily 110+ quests, and probably even more unmarked quests. As well, the vast arsenal of weapons, the variety, and the balencing the game has in regards to these are phenoninal. Any playstyle is viable in this game, and it is an experiance where everyone can flourish. The game is perfecly paced as well, meaning that at no point are you this indestructable God of death, you are fragile, you are not the best, you are mortal. The game teaches you that very well, that you are human, nothing more. You live in this shattered world, dealing with your own human nature; whether it be the mortality, the drugs, sex, disease, or just plain stupidity. But despite the games humanity, it falls into one major trap. That is, the game encourages metagaming at its finest. For instance, to get the best stuff/ending/quests, you need to know how/when to do things. This can be argued in the whole nature of the complex choice system as well, but because of the no turn back attitude of the game, it highly encourages veterans to play the game rather synthetically, rather than let it all flow together as it may. Yes, this does mean replayability, but its not as fun as a purely organic gaming experiance.Despite the main criticisms of the game, and other factors I chose not to mention (for length restraints), the game is not bad. On the contrary, its quite good, very good. Why is it good? Because it emplifies its core concept excellently: Humanity, and what it means to be human. That focus in what its about, makes it a must own.			",503,155,10,69,81,7,87

Such as the BoS girl you get at the trading camp, She can't CQC fight at all when her special is that.-Quick save quick save quick save! your game crashs A ton so remeber to quick save, and Quick save files don't get corrupted make you quick save from every 5-15 Minutes!Any who this game is just amazing!

												This game has the potential to be so much more. Anyone who has ever visited Nexusmods and seen the library of content created as an addition to New Vegas, can attest to the potential of this game. Bethesda, off the heels of success with Fallout 3, in my opinion rushed New Vegas and released it before it was stable. Non-modded, Vanilla versions of New Vegas with and without DLC, are prone to random crashing. Now, even with that most annoying of pet peeves for all gamers, New Vegas is another post-apocalyptic, immersive sandbox, Taking place in the Mojave wasteland, and with the DLC content, surrounding areas. Instead of playing the intrepid vault dweller, you are a courier for the Mojave Express, who is gunned down. You must uncover the reason behind your attempted murder, find your stolen package, and unravel the mysteries within. The Brotherhood of Steel makes a brief appearance, but does not play the central role of law and order, the way they did in Fallout 3. Now we are introduced to the government and military of The New California Republic, as well as the despotic and sadistic masses known as Caesar's Legion. Fallout New Vegas is a game that must be played with all available DLC, for the full experience. Despite all the flaws, there are hotfixes, such as official game patches and player created Mods, to combat game crashing. If you enjoyed Fallout 3, you will love New Vegas.

												Yet another phenomenal addition to the Fallout IP. Fallout: New Vegas touches on many of the original concepts and mechanics of its predecessor but also improved on them. The amount of content in New Vegas and its ability to immerse you into its lore is astounding. How you shape yourself in New Vegas is virtually limitless, almost every choice to be made has several alternate paths that affect your experience greatly. Leveling in New Vegas feels more rewarding and desired than most games, sculpting your skills and traits are perfectly done here. In combat your options are huge, ranging anything from fists to laser rifles to mini-nukes. With the addition of Steam Workshop, your options and the amount of content really do become limitless.Fallout: New Vegas truly peers on top amongst the greatest in the genra. If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're new here but love immersive open-world RPG's and have an interested for post-apocalyptic scenarios, you're in for quite a ride. 94/100			",521,151,26,75,80,8,100

												I was writing a huge review, but I'll summarize it with one of the game's own quotes. While tacky, it perfectly describes my initial approach to the game, and modern videogaming as a whole.""There is an expression in the Wasteland: 'old world blues.' It refers to those so obsessed with the past that they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is."" New Vegas is as close as you're gonna get to a contemporary update on the 17 year old fallout 2. And would you know it, they even had the decency to update and modernize the crashes, bugs, and glitches, so the new audience wouldn't miss out on such a crucial element of fallout gameplay.A masterful blend of old, new, and yesterday's news, that even in 2015 sees mods, fan content, and updates. More importantly, it's got heart, and while the base game shows some obvious signs of being rushed, the huge DLCs and fan patches take care of that.Above all, the game prioritizes player agency, and not the cute 'kill the guy, spare the guy' kind that's thrown around as a buzzword.Highly recommended.

												This rather divisive entry to the Fallout franchise is, for all real intents and purposes, the true Fallout 3.  If you can get past the general derp of the Gamebryo engine, you'll find one of the most beautifully realized gaming worlds of all time - all fleshed out with a myriad of well written and interesting characters.Only real downsides are the general glitchiness of Gamebryo breaking immersion, and the rather easy/weak combat.

												Despite what Hideo Kojima would tell you, war never changes.Fallout New Vegas returns the Fallout series to it's west coast roots, sort of. While little of the action actually takes place in The New California Republic, the state DOES play a heavy role in the title. The player embarks on a quest of mythical proportions starting as a simple courier caught up as a pawn in the affiars of dicatators, emperors, and corrupt senators, and offers satisfaction to any who step into the wastes, in several ways. One can endavor make the post apocalyptic, post divergent hell (as opposed to pre-apocalyptic, pre-divergent hell, or even conteporary hell) a slightly better place through feats of heroism. Alternatively one can take out their aggression at the powers that be by establishing new orders under nefarious leaders of varying degrees of nefariousaritynessnessism (sp?). Or one can simply say ""screw the rules, I have ______"" where ______ is ""money"" or ""all manner of fictional designer drugs and booze"" or ""a collection of exotic guns that would raise Heston from his grave"" or ""300,000 piles of scrap metal, duct tape, a radioactive toy rocket, and some bubble gum!"" The morality system is still in place, and the game can be heavy handed with this, though in addition to ""break stuff steal things, versus fix stuff, save idiots"" are a series of factional based fame meters. Remember how back in high school, you accidentally peed your pants in the cafeteria? Well instead of immediately gaining the same amount of infamy among all the cliques, the art kids, and tweakers thought it was kinda cool, in an ironic way. Same thing goes in FO:NV. Blowing the facial bones out of a random scumbag with a kids BB gun, maxed skills, and the ""Bloody Mess"" perk may toque off half the factions, but it may just earn your a little bit of positive feedback from other groups - maybe that guy pooped in their Sugar Bombs. Added to this iteration of Fallout is also increased crafting as a mechanic. One can skill up abilities in making medical and food aid items, which come in handy if one plays the real game (hardcore mode) and not just ""Cousin Timmy's, I'm Too Frail to do Even Live Hard in a Simulated Reality Weekend Adventure"" (regular mode). Hardcore mode requires the player to consume food and water, as well as sleep regularly or risk stat debuffs or even death. And healing items take longer too work, along with stat buff items risking negative side effects like addiction, far more frequently than in Cousin Timmy's experience. All said, FO:NV is what Fallout Fans were hoping for from FO3, Fallout franchise based setting, more guns, more items, huge map, hours of gameplay and sidequests, but still with all the bugs one can expect from Bugthesda, though you shouldn't complain - If you're reading this, you're in the PC mustard race, and therefore console is always a tilde away, and through tilde, all problems can be solved. Some may not enjoy single player only, but this is the apocalypse. All your friends are dead. JK, you never had any friends, that's what the charming classical radio tracks are for.. All in all, one of my personal favorite.Final score: 875/1000 RadsProtip: Generally speaking, honest heats will tell you the DLC was lackluster, however, while it was a lonesome road to get to this point, for the current going price, I'd say all are worth the dead money. I'd have something clever to say about Old World Blues, too, but out of all the DLC it was the only one worth the initial cost, as it was clever enough on it's own, and is this reviewer's personal pick.

												I really can not recommend this game enough. Easily one of the best RPG's ever made thus far. I may get some hate for this, but in my opinion, Fallout New Vegas has out done Fallout 3 in nearly every regard. The story is pretty great. It can be slow at times, but when you make decisions, they feel like they actually matter. The setting is something many people used to praise Fallout 3 for, including myself, and it is no doubt one of the best game settings ever, but after several play throughs of New Vegas, I feel the Mojave has that extra bit of charm that the DC wasteland didnt have. Some disliked the Mojaves bright skie's and bright City for a post apocalyptic game, but for me it just felt very right. The writing for some of the Side Quests in this game, is truly phenominal, and I hope Obsidian gets another shot at a Fallout game once Fallout 4 is out. Overall Fallout New vegas, and the Fallout franchise as a whole is a master piece, with rich and interesting Lore, great characters, excellent gameplay, and HOURS of replayability. Expect 100+ hours per playthrough, and even then you'll still have not done everything. My playtime on steam for this is only about 128 hours as of 2/14/16, but when I used to play this on console, id say my time on it is around 600+.**EDIT: Having now played Fallout 4 and its overly simplified rpg elements, i've come to appreciate this game even more than when i originally wrote this. Here is a summed up list of the Pro's and Con's of Fallout: New VegasPRO's-Amazing and vast, variety of weapons.-Interesting and Fun characters.-Extensive character customization.-Great leveling system with awesome Perks.-Excellent setting.-Good story, and great variety of story paths and Choice's.-V.A.T.S-The Pip Boy 3 thousand, Enough said.-DLC's add a good amount of content for your character to take back to the Mojave. The way the DLC story lines tie in with the main games narrative is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent, making this games DLC some of the best i've ever played.-Very well optimized for the PC. Runs better on my fairly average computer than it did on my Xbox 360.CON'S-Occasional crashes, not as big a deal as people make it out to be. You should be fine unless your trying to run this on an Etch A Sketch or a Potato.-Sometime's a glitch will interfere with a quest or you might get stuck in a ledge. This is also Very occasional and not a real problem at all.If you dont already own Fallout New Vegas, why are you still reading this, go buy it. NOW!.10/10, Would herd Wind Brahmin Again.

												I recently played a game titled, Fallout: New Vegas, it was developed by Obsidian Studios, which many of the company’s members happen to be former members of Interplay Productions’ Black Isle Studios, the ones who brought you Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. The game was published by Bethesda Softworks, the Makers of Fallout 3, as well as one of my other favorite game series, The Elder Scrolls.The game takes place in The Mojave Wasteland, which is the Post Apocalyptic version of the areas of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The game follows a The Courier who has a package delivery go wrong, as you find out at the very start of the game. This is one of the few games that I recommend watching the intro all the way through on, as the intro is very well done, in fact I enjoyed watching it my first playthrough, and then after I had played the game through several times, after which I noticed many different things that you would only notice after having played the game in depth. The game is played in 1st/3rd person perspective, and the player interacts with the world and with items using a GUI called a Pipboy 3000, which can be upgraded to the Pimpboy 3 Billion (Which is a gold plated version of the Pipboy 3000.) after completing a certain quest. The game has a nicely done crafting system for creating items for the player to use/sell. You can make items from a few different hotspots, those would be, a fireplace or hot plate, a workbench as well as a repair bench. This game unlike so many of its kind, actually has a nonlinear questline, which basically means you can chose who you would like to side with, as well as how you want to handle a situation in most cases. The games main factions that you can side with during the main questline are Caesar’s Legion, Mr. House, the New California Republic (NCR), and for an independent New Vegas, you can side with a overly friendly and forthcoming robot named Yes Man. Caesar’s Legion is led by no other than Caesar, aka Edward Sallow, Caesar co-founded his legion with a man known as Joshua Graham, whos name is not to be spoken within The Legion without punishment. Mr. House or Robert House, founder of RobCo Industries, is a man who spent the latter years of his Pre-War life, planning for how to keep himself alive indefinitely, and protect the Vegas Strip from nuclear attacks.The New California Republic is a fairly large democratic federation that is the absolute enemy of Caesar’s Legion.The music choices in Fallout: New Vegas are fantastic, it perfectly fits in with the early 1900’s feel of the game and while a few may disagree the music itself is very good, with selections of the greats of the 1940s and 1950s with genres including classical and jazz. I feel like this revived a great period of time for music, so that new generations could enjoy it for themselves. This game is amazing and I would recommend it as a must play for gamers everywhere.

												This game is a game that if described as ""Skyrim with guns"" could not justifiy it. this game is a masterpiece, with well-executed combat, a huge and expansive lore, great creature diveristy, and always feels challenging no amtter what. the levelling system is well made, and well created - a great and smart way to do things in the Mojave. everything in this game feels right, and the DLC? oh my god, there are few things that fit this game so well as the DLC. its 16 quid in total. but it's all worth it.  the world is open, and not ONE character is unkillable. this is truly a free game, the definition of a sandbox in some ways. it is my second favorite RPG, my first favorite gun game and easily my number one least suspected like of all gamingtry it, you'll love itCOMPLETIONISTS NOTE: this game isnt hard to complete, and at no point will you feel like the game is unfair (except Deathclaws...)

												This game is one word, ""amazing"". I purchased it on Xbox on release day then on PC in summer 2013. This game gives you so many choices to choose from, you pretty much have four storylines to go with. There are tons of quests in the game that are actually really fun to complete, I liked them a lot more than in Fallout 3. The storyline is amazing, something I felt lacked in Fallout 3, New Vegas really makes you feel like you have a goal to accomplish. The combat system is highly improved from Fallout 3. The only thing I criticize the game about is the empty spaces, there are a lot of them but then again it is a desert after all. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into the Fallout series. I give the game a 9/10.			",408,116,12,44,20,5,31

												The current game in the Fallout Franchise, New Vegas awaits, to entertain, to corrupt, or just to provide you with those home comforts, like that 12gauge you just never get tired of pumpin'. Gun firing a bit crap? Go upgrade it at the Gun shop by trading all that crap you found lying around, for that shiny new recoil compensator for your 5.56mm Marksman Carbine!! This game is an excellent RPG/shooter hybrid. I personally love the V.A.T.S combat system, allowing you to momentarily step out of real time to select those body parts that you think will look better being severed from that body, you don't know why, but you just wanna see the guy's head explode ha ha ha! Hrm...who's that over there, hey! It's a companion, make friends, get them to carry all your stuff, on first name terms already? Great, Why not give them a gun and some ammo too and you can double team those mutated Wasteland horrors like they were the best days of your life! (well they were for me mmkay..)  Choose wisely on the course of action to take when encountering strangers, or just  generally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the army. Not sure about that creepy looking character you met in that strange bunker? Hrm...do his bidding? Or betray him, up to you! Run off with the loot or give it to the homeless people for street cred, the reputation is yours for the making as everyone you interact with has the potential to aid you, or slow you down (cos you spent waaay too much time zooming in on her ti-♥♥♥♥♥♥.) After over 200 hours of playing this game, I'm lightyears away from getting bored of this Titan, I aint never growing up !!! 8/10. There's room for improvment..but that's what sequels are for, fool! Load up and get your kit, it's gonna be a long walk and your gonna need to get your game on out in the Wasteland..some of the critters out there just get real mad if you shoot them! Good luck!

												Fallout: New Vegas is the next entry to the critically acclaimed Fallout series. Taking place 3 years after Fallout 3, you find yourself tied up, and being shot in the head by Chandler Bing. New Vegas was made and produced by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda, unlike Fallout 3 which was produced and published by only Bethesda. Fallout: New Vegas has some improved gameplay elements from Fallout 3, like the ability to aim down sights, a new reputation system, and a better companion menu. The story is well written, with a lot of star power voicing the characters, and a story that has 3 or 4 branching endings. Like the game that came before it, it is also an open world game.PROS+ Improved Gameplay elements from Fallout 3+ Open world, with many more quests than the previous entry+ More weapons and enemies+ Great voice acting+ Returns to Fallout's dark sense of humour that Fallout 3 more or less lacked+ Includes a ""Wild Wasteland"" perk that adds tons of easter eggs, and is in my opinion, the only perk worth getting at the start+ Large map with many interesting cities+ Big city near the top of the map, New Vegas, that includes casinos, and hotels. New Vegas also has a ghetto north of the city, that has more than a few quests to enjoy+ A new reputation system that effects how factions (and their enemies/allies) will treat you+ Great radio soundtrack+ Amazingly written, interconnected DLC storylines+ Amazing DLC environmentsCONS- Sparse towns make the map seem too big at times, and can be a pain to walk around- Very little change in landscape- Radio soundtrack can be very repetitive- Companions can be hard to locate, and are sometimes overlooked. - Main quest is very short, and can take only about 4 hours to complete- Armor can be hard to find and acquire without the Courier's Stash DLC- A few bugs and problems here and there.Overall, a great game with a story that (in my opinion) is better that the one of Fallout 3. Buy the Ultimate Edition when it's on sale.9.5/10			",176,16,1,11,16,1,3

												Frankly, I'm astounded by how good New Vegas is. It brought back the true Fallout feel, especially the clever and witty humor. On top of that, it completely overhauled everything that Fallout 3 had, producing mechanics that actually work rather well, a world that gives you incentive to explore and reward for doing it, a great deal of solid difficulty, much improved combat, and a TON more role-playing ability. The only problems are that the story is somewhat weak and it has a MASSIVE amount of technical issues. Still, this is what Fallout 3 should have been.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												The best Fallout game, period. It has a great storyline that makes you consider your actions and question them afterwards, factions that behave realistically and have fleshed-out backgrounds, great gunplay with tons of unique weapons and it's perfectly challenging-- you die just enough so that progress feels like a real victory but not enough to make the game frustrating. On top of this, every single DLC is top quality and the game has an amazing, active modding community. I beat the game twice already and I keep coming back years later. Fallout New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal Rating: Not a bad game - I expected moreClassic Rating: ★★★☆☆New Vegas doesn't add too much to what we saw in Fallout 3, in my opinion: there are companions, enhanced crafting (which is pretty useless anyway), maybe more weapons and mods but it's the same old game - I can't tell one true change in game play or UI.Main story falls short in comparison to FO3: NV it's mostly made of side quests - some of which very interesting, I have to admit - but all the Courier's story starts and ends in a flutter (not going to spoil).● I loved FO3 dark setting, I liked New Vegas.● I loved FO3 story, I liked New Vegas.● I had some crashes in FO3, I had many more in New Vegas.● I don't remember any particular bug in FO3, I found a lot in New Vegas - from mid game to end I had to open the wiki almost every time I played.● I had to fast travel very often in NV because of silly quest while I spent more time actually playing in FO3.● Factions implementation is not good in New Vegas, in my opinion: if you don't pay attention to what armor you wear, your playthrough can get f****d up.As you can see, there's a lot of things I didn't like, BUT I cannot say New Vegas is a bad game; I can just tell to whoever is still doubtful about choosing Fallout 3 or New Vegas, go with the former, you won't be disappointed.

												I used to think no game could come close to how good Fallout 3 was but all my friends would say to me ""You bought Fallout: New Vegas collector's edition on launch day! Why haven't you played it yet?! It's so much better than Fallout 3"" and how right they are.Fallout: New Vegas is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game / Survival Horror game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and is set in a post-apocalyptic western United States, an area largely untouched by the events of the great nuclear war of 2077. You are a Courier, delivering messages around the wasteland and have been assigned to deliver a package containing something very special. Unfortunately, you are captured, package stolen, and left for dead in the wasteland. What happens next will eventually determine the fate of the thousands inhabiting the Mojave desert for years to come.The huge open-world of Fallout: New Vegas is well constructed and very atmospheric. I found however, that it feels slightly less interesting than Fallout 3. In Fallout 3 you would worry all the time about what is around the next corner. In New Vegas, the landscape, at first, looks fairly flat and uninteresting. Is this a fault of the game or is it to be praised for being authentic to the area in which it is set? I have friends that have visited Las Vegas and they tell me ""Yes, the area around Las Vegas is pretty much how it looks in the game"".Which ever way you look at it, you'll get lost in the atmosphere in no time. The ambience and music gives the game a great western vibe as well at the nicely crafted musical score (which also includes tracks from Fallout 1 and 2 for added nostalgia)The world is also not immediately open to the player. Going North is pure suicide early on in the game so the player is encouraged to explore the south before venturing north. By closing off certain areas to the player early on, I found that it really helps to emphasize just how much of a dangerous place the Mojave wasteland really is and it increased my wanting to explore those areas later once I got some better gear.The plot in Fallout: New Vegas however is a lot more open and is better written than Fallout 3. Right up until the very end of the game, you have total freedom to choose your own path in the world. The story also doesn't take itself as seriously as Fallout 3 does; the characters you meet, situations you are put in and overall tone of the game is lighter, funnier and doesn't centre around one specific key character. You have a world, an event is happening in that world, get going and help shape what happens!The game mechanics are deep, very very deep. There are almost System Shock 2 levels of complexity in this game; It keeps pretty much all of Fallout 3's FPS/RPG elements and statistical goodness everyone has come to expect from a Fallout game but also re-introduces mechanics from Fallout 1 and 2 back into the mix. Damage Threshold and Damage Resistance are back and really well implemented into the combat. I learnt pretty quickly that it is futile to chip away at a creature's thick hide or somebody's metal armour with a 9mm pistol, you're going to need the right gun for the right situation which means thinking on your feet. Guns can also degrade in quality over time and depending on what ammo you use which means keeping your gear in top condition is very important.The game also allows you to create your own food and ammunition. Different types of ammo will require different components you can get from either de-constructing existing ammo or finding them in the Mojave and will affect different opponents in different ways; Use 12 Gauge, Slug rounds to pierce through Armour or use 12 Gauge, Dragon's Breath rounds to set squishy things on fire!The game introduces an optional 'Hardcore mode' which, amongst other things, requires you to eat, drink and sleep in order to stay alive. Ammunition has weight to it and getting health from Stimpaks occurs over time. It will drastically change the way you think about approaching situations and provide you with a more survival horror type experience.Not only all this but your actions will affect people's opinions of you. Do good things and people in that region, town or faction will like you and will come to your aid in times of need. Do bad things and expect to be hated, shot at and have general abuse hurled at you.I've only scratched the surface of what the game can do here but now it's time to talk about the Downloadable Content that the game contains. There are four packs and they all differ widely in settings and theme but they all tie together cleverly to create one big story to play through:Dead Money DLC - Holy crap this is one atmospheric ride! You are sent to uncover the secrets of the Sierra Madre and I can't say much more as anything else would be a spoiler. This is probably the creepiest DLC out of the four, It's bursting with places to explore and things to find. Anyone who finds that a lot of Fallout: New Vegas feels quite empty and void of small detail in a lot of places will have nothing to complain about here. Great characters and very nicely paced with amazing atmosphere.Honest Hearts DLC - You are hired to travel with the Happy Trails caravan to Utah's Zion National Park. This is the first of the DLCs to give the player an open world to explore. The world is, once again, very nicely crafted with real attention to detail but unfortunately it suffers from being quite boring story-wise. It's nice to meet characters that aren't your average wasteland survivors though but sadly, most are largely forgettable and the story can go out with either a small pop or a whimper depending on what you want to do.Old World Blues DLC - This is probably the funniest and most bizarre DLC made for New Vegas. It was even nominated for a 'Best DLC' award! This is a real turn around from Honest Hearts; hilarious from start to finish, incredibly well written story and characters, a new huge open area to explore, perfect pacing and the DLC will prove a real challenge for players of all skills. Absolutely worth playing and taking your time with.Lonesome Road DLC - The final DLC and it is something quite special. This is really worth playing if, like me, you disliked the game giving you a character that was both a blank slate and had some kind of past that was a complete mystery. This will definitely fill in some of those blanks and make the Courier more interesting. It's a return to a linear world like Operation Anchorage but it is so full of more interesting places to see and things to do. You will find yourself backtracking to either find all the hidden secrets or opening up new areas but a lot of the time, it's worth doing. There are cool set-pieces (which is a must for this kind of DLC) and what happens to you (and/or others) at the end is amazingly good. A great end to an impressive series of DLC.With all of the praise I've given the game, it has its faults. Bugs mainly. There are a few hanging around and whilst they aren't game-breaking, they can range from floating objects to random crashing to desktop. Another issue depends on your point of view, the game falls into the same trap Fallout 3 fell into by letting the player level up too much and becoming too powerful making most of the RPG elements like speech-checks largely pointless. An RPG isn't an RPG any more when you're good at everything!I'm already planning my next play through of Fallout: New Vegas and after playing it, it makes Fallout 3 a very hard game to go back to. Fallout: New Vegas is just an all-round better game, despite it's small flaws and if you enjoyed Fallout 3, I urge you get your hands on this as soon as possible! Hundreds of hours of enjoyment guaranteed!Recommended Mods:JSawyer and Mission Mojave. Use these to make your game a better RPG and fix over 27,000 in-game bugs.			",407,120,6,53,17,2,32

												This is gonna be one of my first reviews, so it may not be perfect :)Fallout : New vegas is usually overlooked because it's not made by Bethesda but for me it's the best fallout game :)It has more RPG elements than 3 and 4 where there are tons of playstyles to go by. If you like a western post apoctalyptic setting then this is the best you're propably gonna get. The world is what you would expect from a western post-apoctalyptic world, deserty , old and destroyed towns and irradiated places but also some unique places like red rock canyon, new vegas and faction strongholds.There are a few places you can discover that really don't offer anything besides 4 tin cans and an empty nuka bottle which leaves the world a bit empy. Combat has gotten better from fallout 3 like adding ironsights in to the game. It definetely isin't a typical shooter game like the others, and definetely not as good as Fallout 4 but it's still unique and fun. Factions really offer you many choices. Do you wanna go bad and enslave the entire mojave, go with Ceasar's Legion.Wanna have order and a more civilised mojave? Go with New California Republic.Wanna bring back New Vegas to it's former glory? Side with Mr. House the so called mayor of New Vegas.Or if you wanna rule the Wasteland all by yourself then there is Yes Man .NCR and Ceasar's Legion also have unique clothing and weapons, the other's don't really have any unique equipment.If your near finishing the game then you should check out the DLC, in my opinion NV has better DLC than 3 and 4. Before I finish you must try out NV's  mods, they add a ton of stuff like bugfixes, better textures that make the game stunning, make it more realistic with better combat and better guns or add a ton of new quests and unique companions like Willow, she's the best companion I have ever seen in a video game lol.

Posted: March 24, 2016
												I bought the GOTY version of Fallout: New Vegas during the last Christmas sale and it was the first foray into the Fallout world for me. I had played none of the previous games and was not willing to fork out the money to buy Fallout 4, a game that was released just prior to the sale and thus was still at full price. I wanted to see why people like the Fallout universe so much and since New Vegas was the most recent entry into the franchise after Fallout 4 and was quite cheap, I decided to buy it. Needless to say, I have no regrets. New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easy to substantiate that claim.  To get started on the good points of the game, New Vegas is a very rich, albeit not in a monetary sense. The characters, story, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. The quests were really well-done and I didn't feel bored while completing the main and side quests, although the side quests were the ones that really stood out. Most of the game's content comes from side quests and it was really rare for any of those quests to feel mundane or lacklustre in any way. I constantly looked out for quest givers so I could complete the side quests they provided, and it felt fulfilling to complete them. Almost every location in the Mojave has a quest or more tied to it and it was great exploring the Mojave while doing the task that has been set before you. NPCs are numerous and you're sure to have memorable interactions with many a character in the Mojave, whether it ranges from doing stuff for them or popping a cherry in their forehead. Moreover, the choices you make will have an immediate and sometimes far-reaching impact on the world around you. Although you do get to decide the fate of the entire Mojave Wasteland during the main questline, your actions in side quests also affect the individual communities and organizations operating within the world, which also extends to having an impact on the main questline. The role-playing element is certainly very present in this game, and coupled with the amout of freedom presented to the player, it does make for an awesome experience. You have plenty of freedom to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. The game doesn't rush you or push you to do or complete quests; you can take your own sweet time by exploring and doing whatever you fancy in the Mojave. If you so wish, you can be a homicidal maniac and murder everyone in sight (and risk breaking quests in the process), or you can be the stereotypical western hero-type that engages in more benevolent activities. Your actions carry weight and it feels really good to know that you're shaping the Mojave in one way or another. In addition, New Vegas has a great modding community. Although the modding scene has slowed down over the years, there's so much good content available on the Nexus for download. I have 130+ mods installed and it has really enriched my experience of playing New Vegas. New weapons, gameplay overhauls, minor tweaks, new world spaces, more quests, etc can all be added if you manage your mods properly. You can even make the aged New Vegas look more aesthetic through the use of hi-res texture mods and lighting mods like ENBs although you have to be prepared to suffer performance losses, the magnitude of which depends on the power of your rig.However, as it is with any other game out there, New Vegas does suffer from some flaws, some of which are pretty blatant. The devs had a very short development cycle for this game and some of the cracks really show. For instance, this game is pretty buggy and it runs on a very dated engine, the same one that Fallout 3 used waayyyy back in 2007. Compared to other games released around its time, New Vegas looks and plays quite badly. Animations are rather clunky and combat is not as smooth as I would like it to be, being pretty awkward and not quite responsive (Graphics and animation mods can somewhat mitigate this problem). Most of the time, I just found myself using VATS instead of aiming down sights due to hit detection issues and not wanting to deal with the whole unresponsiveness of gunplay. (VATS is awesome by the way) Crashes can occur quite frequently although downloading some mods can patch that issue. Also, locations are rather disappointing. New Vegas, which is supposed to be a bright, bustling hub in the center of the Mojave feels really empty and small, being made up of several main buildings. Casinos are dark and lifeless, and towns are quite small and lifeless. Yes, some mods can add onto those locations, but there is only so much a mod can alter. However, I must say that this doesn't detract much from the exploration and roaming experience.   To conclude, New Vegas is a fantastic game and I'm sure if Obsidian Entertainment were granted a longer time to develop this game, it would have turned out to be a greater masterpiece. Much work has been put into this game and we can see it in the role-playing, story, and character elements, and I see myself putting many more hours into this game. Overall, 9/10.

												Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian Entertainment's take on the Fallout franchise using Fallout 3's engine, character building system, and assets, but the similarities of the two games pretty much end there. Saying Fallout 3 is ""bad"" just because I happen to like New Vegas more would be too harsh. It's still a great game in its own right, and let's admit it, New Vegas wouldn't even be greenlit if Fallout 3 weren't a commercial success, but in my opinion New Vegas surpasses it in almost every aspect. Here is why:Crafting in New Vegas is more extensive and rewarding than carrying some scraps to a workbench and making goofy makeshift weapons which belong in Road Runner cartoons. Instead, you can craft potent consumables and powerful ammunition, and more possibilities become available as you improve your skills and learn perks. The quests and dialogues branch out with observable consequences to your decisions (for the most part) instead of pseudo ""choices"" which always lead to the same result. And last but not least, hardcore mode lets you immerse yourself in a desperate post apocalyptic world where every bullet and every drop of clean water is worth its weight in gold, instead of always packing absurdly high amounts of ammo and consumables. It forces you to manage your resources and basic needs at all times. If you want to add another layer of difficulty on top of hardcore mode, I suggest checking out project leader and lead designer Josh Sawyer's namesake mod[fallout.gamepedia.com], which he made in his free time for personal use, and then decided to release it as a free download.Oh, and you're a professional courier in this game. So doing a fetch quest, which makes you feel jerked around in most games, is for once in character. So chop chop, work those legs!			",206,25,1,25,6,0,1

												I bought the GOTY version of Fallout: New Vegas during the last Christmas sale and it was the first foray into the Fallout world for me. I had played none of the previous games and was not willing to fork out the money to buy Fallout 4, a game that was released just prior to the sale and thus was still at full price. I wanted to see why people like the Fallout universe so much and since New Vegas was the most recent entry into the franchise after Fallout 4 and was quite cheap, I decided to buy it. Needless to say, I have no regrets. New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easy to substantiate that claim.  To get started on the good points of the game, New Vegas is a very rich, albeit not in a monetary sense. The characters, story, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. The quests were really well-done and I didn't feel bored while completing the main and side quests, although the side quests were the ones that really stood out. Most of the game's content comes from side quests and it was really rare for any of those quests to feel mundane or lacklustre in any way. I constantly looked out for quest givers so I could complete the side quests they provided, and it felt fulfilling to complete them. Almost every location in the Mojave has a quest or more tied to it and it was great exploring the Mojave while doing the task that has been set before you. NPCs are numerous and you're sure to have memorable interactions with many a character in the Mojave, whether it ranges from doing stuff for them or popping a cherry in their forehead. Moreover, the choices you make will have an immediate and sometimes far-reaching impact on the world around you. Although you do get to decide the fate of the entire Mojave Wasteland during the main questline, your actions in side quests also affect the individual communities and organizations operating within the world, which also extends to having an impact on the main questline. The role-playing element is certainly very present in this game, and coupled with the amout of freedom presented to the player, it does make for an awesome experience. You have plenty of freedom to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. The game doesn't rush you or push you to do or complete quests; you can take your own sweet time by exploring and doing whatever you fancy in the Mojave. If you so wish, you can be a homicidal maniac and murder everyone in sight (and risk breaking quests in the process), or you can be the stereotypical western hero-type that engages in more benevolent activities. Your actions carry weight and it feels really good to know that you're shaping the Mojave in one way or another. In addition, New Vegas has a great modding community. Although the modding scene has slowed down over the years, there's so much good content available on the Nexus for download. I have 130+ mods installed and it has really enriched my experience of playing New Vegas. New weapons, gameplay overhauls, minor tweaks, new world spaces, more quests, etc can all be added if you manage your mods properly. You can even make the aged New Vegas look more aesthetic through the use of hi-res texture mods and lighting mods like ENBs although you have to be prepared to suffer performance losses, the magnitude of which depends on the power of your rig.However, as it is with any other game out there, New Vegas does suffer from some flaws, some of which are pretty blatant. The devs had a very short development cycle for this game and some of the cracks really show. For instance, this game is pretty buggy and it runs on a very dated engine, the same one that Fallout 3 used waayyyy back in 2007. Compared to other games released around its time, New Vegas looks and plays quite badly. Animations are rather clunky and combat is not as smooth as I would like it to be, being pretty awkward and not quite responsive (Graphics and animation mods can somewhat mitigate this problem). Most of the time, I just found myself using VATS instead of aiming down sights due to hit detection issues and not wanting to deal with the whole unresponsiveness of gunplay. (VATS is awesome by the way) Crashes can occur quite frequently although downloading some mods can patch that issue. Also, locations are rather disappointing. New Vegas, which is supposed to be a bright, bustling hub in the center of the Mojave feels really empty and small, being made up of several main buildings. Casinos are dark and lifeless, and towns are quite small and lifeless. Yes, some mods can add onto those locations, but there is only so much a mod can alter. However, I must say that this doesn't detract much from the exploration and roaming experience.   To conclude, New Vegas is a fantastic game and I'm sure if Obsidian Entertainment were granted a longer time to develop this game, it would have turned out to be a greater masterpiece. Much work has been put into this game and we can see it in the role-playing, story, and character elements, and I see myself putting many more hours into this game. Overall, 9/10.

												I cannot express how much I recommend this game. It has hndreds of hours of gameplay excluding DLC that will fly past without you even knowing it! When you get into the modding scheme the game gets to a point that you will have so much content that you will end up having at least 200+ hours added on to your experience. The community is great, mods are made frequently and kept up to date.Highly Recommend,10/10			",73,3,3,10,3,0,1

												Fallout: New Vegas is an awesome game. Add in the 4 major DLCs and 2 minor DLCS, and it is arguably one of the best RPG's of recent years.

												This review was requested by a bunch of my friends!Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian's attempt at recreating the Fallout games after Bethesda's attempt at Fallout 3 (And I thought they failed at that attempt) but this time, I think Obsidian was successful.The visuals are mediocre at the most, but there are a few times in-game where the graphics look great. The faces for the NPCs and even yourself seem awful. Plus, the big con above the mediocre visuals is that the atmosphere, where Fallout was dark, scary like the previous entries (Yes, even 3) seemed to bright. The enemies didn't seem terrifying thanks and I couldn't fully enjoy a real Fallout experience. The gameplay is smooth, and I enjoy using VATS (The more tactical approach to the gunplay) and people who don't like the full-out shooters that don't require thinking will enjoy it too. However, I can't put that as a con due to Fallout 3 having this too, so why should I? But like I said, the gameplay is smooth. The shooting is simple and the melee too, but the explosives and such can be a bit useless. However, the hardcore survival experience is highly enjoyable and makes up for the useless explosives. The gameplay does not disappoint.The story is pretty solid, and also if I'm not mistaken, Fallout: New Vegas actually holds the record for the most lines of dialogue in the game. Why am I saying that? It's a major pro for some and a major con for others. Because I enjoy strong storylines, it's a pro for me. If you like ""Get to the point"" NPCs, be wary that you won't find that in Fallout. Benny (The checkered suit guy) is a solid villain who legitimately tricks you at one point in the game and is able to smoothtalk you into nearly killing you. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I can think of only a few antagonists who successfully manipulated the character with ease, Benny among them. The con to the story though is the fact that the game ENDS, meaning you can't play anymore, after you do the main storyline. The story is great, just be wary of the fact that the game ENDS.The audio is very impressive. The voice actors have more personality than your average Call of Duty, Halo, and whatnot. Plus, I enjoyed the songs that played on the radios and just made me think of the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Fallout: New Vegas and GotG both have something in common: Despite the fact that it takes place in modern/future time, the primary soundtrack uses songs from the 50's-80's. It's good to see a game like Fallout (3 too) not use your average dubstep/epic orchestral music for a soundtrack. You will definitely enjoy the audio from this game. The sound effects, the voice actors, everything.I'm a one-and-done kind of guy for replayability, this game included. However, I've seen people get hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game. The replayability, much like its cousin (or brother, or sister) Elder Scrolls have high replayability. After you beat the game, you can create another character, and then another character, and another character! The replayability is some of the strongest in the whole series.In the end, Fallout: New Vegas is nowhere near my favorite RPG, but it's still an amazing experience. I didn't really enjoy the experience as others did, but if you get this game, you will probably side with them, so I recommend this game for any RPG fan.Graphics- 4.5/10Gameplay- 8/10Story- 8/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 9.5/10.:8.0/10:.+High replayability+Amazing hardcore mode+Outstanding performances by the voice actors+Clever antagonist-The game ENDS for real-Awful graphics-Explosives are useless-Bright atmosphere			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

												Whether or not you will like Fallout New Vegas will most likely depend on your personal preference. For example, it depends on whether you prefer the blade or guns. After playing Oblivion and Skyrim, I tried this game and was both pleased and turned off. The cool stuff:I got a mod that imported Star Wars droids into the game, and they are awesome.The costumes can make your character look awesome!There is a jetpack mod......http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37140/?The main city of New Vegas is pretty nice, and Freeside is fun to explore. The Liberty Loft is the house to get there.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41822/?In addition, it is easy to be a total bada** in the game, which is pretty fun.The guns are also diverse and fun, the gunplay is solid. There are also throwable weapons (which Skyrim should have).The soundtrack is good.The uncool:Oblivion and Skyrim spoiled me with beautiful worlds and exciting combat, so I expected a world ripe for exploration and screenshots. However, while it may be great for exploration, its sheer ugliness completely turned me off. On top of that, deadly monsters roam the bleak landscape and serve as bullet sponges, so I ended up being content staying in the City.The NPCs seem fake and are not interesting (if that makes sense).There are some annoying mechanics such as dehydration and radiation. It is fun sometimes and annoying as all heck other times. There are great ENBs, but the game looks bad without them. I now know that I much prefer Elder Scrolls over Fallout. Although Fallout has its perks, I will always rather invest my time in Oblivion and Skyrim's gorgeous worlds, spells, potions, sword combat, and quests. New Vegas' ugly and unrewarding world, unfortunately, dampened my excitement to do a serious playthrough.But: Do not let this deter you. Try it out for yourself and see if you like the elements this game has that other games do not. Plus, check out the Nexus Mods. There are some pretty cool ones there!			",53,10,0,6,8,0,3

												I have a good 250+ hours worth of play of Fallout:New Vegas, and I have to say that it is one of my favourite games, ever.Obsidian have always been great with RPGs, but as my first experience of the Fallout franchise, this remains to be one of my favourites.I have explored every possible element, looted every corpse, cabinet and dead Brahmin that I could find; there is SO much content, and with 3 DLCs, you have plenty to work with.Some of the voice acting gets a little...groovy within dialogue, corpses fly to the ceiling with V.A.Ts shots, rescuing followers from behind boulders becomes a frequent chore, and if I have to listen to one more run of Johnny Guitar, I may scream...but a solid 10/10 overall from me.In short; if you enjoyed Skyrim, give this a try. For a lover of stories, I would say this still holds a lot of weight despite the new game now launched (just don't expect the graphics to be on-par.)Guns rather than pew-pew magic.

												This is an amazing addition to the series, highly underrated. Has to be one of the best RPGs to date.I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition to enjoy the brilliant DLCs, the game is much more complete with them.Game-play is as amazing as ever, pretty much following the same game-play as Fallout 3 with a few improvements here and there. Strangely they decided to add an iron-sights mode when shooting, which would be fine, but seeing as this game doesn’t have the best graphics, it can sometimes feel like your aiming down a brick. This can be easily corrected by disabling it and going back to Fallout 3’s zoom, however. All the guns feel great, all with a specific purpose and good against certain enemies, there is a great deal more strategy to the gun-play than with Fallout 3, with many more available stats, weapon mods and weapons which are useful in particular situations. This game also introduces hard-core mode, where the game is set to the hardest difficulty (very hard) and forces you to eat, sleep and drink on a regular basis in order to survive. This mode tends to start extremely hard, with endless treks searching for water or supplies and provides a hefty challenge for experienced players, but once you’ve played this game to death, you’ll have enough supplies to not really have to worry about impending starvation any longer.I could go into much more detail on game-play but many of my points would also apply to Fallout 3, which if you haven’t played, I recommend doing so before getting this.As far as visuals and soundtrack go they are beyond exquisite, with a great mix of a western style Mojave theme and the classic 1950s twist that was evident in earlier games.The story is excellent, following your life after being shot in the head. The game has over 62,000 lines of dialogue, holding the Guinness World Record for the most dialogue ever produced for a video game. It also has has some of the best written characters I’ve ever seen in gaming, most of them appearing the DLCs. The actually story, well, that’s up to you. Do what you want; don’t do what you don’t want to do. This is the definition of strong story-telling in a truly free game world.Where the game has many of its problems is in mechanics. Perhaps it was rushed out, thanks to Bethesda only giving Obsidian 18 months to make the game. Very small aspects of the game do sometimes feel unfinished, or the remnants of an idea that was originally in the game are left lying around. There can also be a number of pesky bugs, most of which can be fixed by a few easily installed community mods.What truly should sell you on this game is the endless supply of amazing mods on the Nexus. These mods with the game and DLCs combined will give you endless hours of fun.			",181,27,15,20,6,1,26

												The Fallout series is one of the most acclaimed that has also a retro-futuristic touch that charms you when you see it for first time until you finish the game. New Vegas is no stranger to it's predecesors.The player visits the city of New Vegas and it's Mojave desert that are just ruined by the radioactivity and the different factions that are in war. You, most known as the Courier, were hired to deliver an unknown package from the Mojave to the New Vegas Strip but you were intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by an also unknown man who steals it.Afterwards, you are found and healed by a local doctor and then, your story begins. No complains on the writting department from me.Being an Open World Action Role playing game gave Bethesda give the gamers so many things to do in the map: from following the main story, or just not and complete side quests; or from being an explorer of the wasteland to wander just in populated places. This game gives you freedom to choose what do you want to do in it and how do you want to develop your     story and character (as you have speech,lockpicking and multiple skills to upgrade by playing). This game even lets you choose how you want to end it as you choose your side in the faction crisis (NCR,Caesar's Legion, Mr House... or none)shown through all of the story. This is what keeps the player so connected to the game: the freedom of playing as you want.The gameplay is  similar from Fallout 3: the Pipboy is back with all it's previous options modified a bit to fit in this game (radio included, lol), the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S for the specific aiming of a limb and the real time effects of it (brilliant), the karma and your reputation (good or bad, your choice), companions, weapons modding and the adding of the Gambling (cheating is included) are the most unique things of the series and of course, it's signature. Even the new players can blend in without any problem.Fallout: New Vegas is one hell of a game and will not steal minutes from your life because you will enjoy every second of it.You won't regret the experience.

												Ah, Fallout. My first true RPG, and one true love. Full disclosure, I prefer 3 to NV, but it's almost solely because of the radio personalities; Mr. New Vegas is just kind of...blah. Luckily, there's an all-music station, and the in-game sound track is pretty damn good, too.So, hey, the actual game. For starters, super-fun story. I've always been a sucker for games that have you caught between large warring factions. New Vegas has three of them. Not two. ♥♥♥♥en three. AND, you can say to hell with all of them and throw in with the faction of Me, Baby, taking the riches of New Vegas for yourself. But whatever choices you make, they're all apparent during the final battle, which somehow manages to put Liberty Prime's curb-stomping rampage to shame.The world is beautiful and makes me wish I had a better graphics card. The vaults in particular are very well-written. I still get a feeling of dread whenever I crawl through Vault 34, and Vault 22 is supremely fun with fire-based weapons. The world is solidified by the fact that, unlike in F3, there are a number of large, well-established settlements, with whom you can gain or lose reputation as you and your shooting sprees see fit. The terrain itself is varried, from sprawling dessert to rocky cavern to lush forest to snow-sprinkled mountain, all within about a day's run of each other.Mechanics are glitchy but good as always. Love the condensation of Small Guns and Big Guns into just Guns, and the addition of Survival. I actually wrote my own physical copy of The Wasteland Survival Guide with all crafting recipes in it, just so I could better manage my inventory and decide what crap I could sell safely. I can't mod weapons to save my life, but based on the public achievement stats, I think I'm the only one with this issue. Doesn't bug me much, as there are enough unique weapons in-game to make moding almost pointless. I am, however, a huge fan of the new ammo types; armor-piercing rounds making it so much easier to kill higher-level enemies, and coin shot gives you something to do with all that worthless Legion money you're going to collect.Buy this game, Ultimate Edition. Everyone talks up Lonesome Road, and while enjoyable (partly because it gives you access to the best companion in the game), it's one of the slowest points in the game - and filled with Deahclaws.

												During a quest line that initially seemed innocuous or too much to bother with but ultimately directs you towards an npc with a treasure trove of information on the massive world that you partcipate and you speak to and listen captively to this npc for what seems an eternity you realize what a tremondous achievement Fallout New Vegas is.  Briliant in it's construction and writing. Grand in it's scope.  Rich in exploration.  So big that 50 hours of playing time and your choosen build might not even yield the true gameplay or dialog gems of what has to be considered one of the best rpgs ever crafted.  Yes it's just a desert for the most part but this desert has the richest of gaming gold waiting to be mined.			",2426,1048,114,292,316,28,430

												9.5/10 - Perfect. Except the ending..Open world, Great gameplay and atmosphere. The gold standard for me. I would easily pay $30 for this game. A real must have. Choose your path and help either Mr. House, The Legion, NCR or local gangs to force unique outcomes.The only negative is that once completing the storyline you can't continue exploring and playing. So do everything before completing the storyline. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												i've never played a fallout game before and this is my first one the story is a bit hard to be understanded ( for me :p )  , but beating the main quest took me over 50 hours , yes , which means that the main quest is long , and so  does the rest of the quests the gameplay is 80% about surviving :   sleeping in time , avoiding eating bad food , using weapons correctly , and also  : surviving with your social profile , like avoiding crimes , having a good karma ....and speaking about social profiles...it also has a faction system which gives you many choises about which way you wanna follow , of course every faction has it own negative profiles and positive ones fallout new vegas is kinda buggy , but its because of those bugsthat we enjoy a part of the gameplay :Dand also , the game is enjoyable even without dlc's ,and it has modding community i would call the game alternativly : future wasteland surviving simulator 2011 :]this one takes 10/10 and deserves all the love :]			",576,101,17,61,31,5,60

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. It manages to capture Fallout I and II spirit far better than FO3. Bethesda should learn, not everything is about saving the world.A game for explorers and people who like good stories.Far better than FO3.			",280,41,1,32,22,2,44

												A few years ago, Bethesda said ""I'm going to make Fallout games"" everyone waited the new fallout game with curiosity anxiety and hope. some people liked it some people didn't, but whatever happened, everyone sat and played at least once. As far as novelty is concerned, it adds a beauty and new excitement to everything in life unless it is overstated. So while the old Fallout is a classic, this new version is becoming another classic in its own style and taste.First of all, the story of New Vegas is completely different from the story of the third game. At the outset, now the serade is classicized, ""I turned into a fish out of the Vault"" does not apply to this game. This is not an old Vault member, we are a wasteland person. It's a little more than we've been through.Fallout: New Vegas is almost four years from Fallout 3 in 2281, and 204 years after the Great Nuclear War in 2077. The story goes in Las Vegas, Nevada and Mojave Desert. Unlike other cities in the Fallout series, Vegas is not directly affected by nuclear attacks. The majority of buildings in the city are intact and the number of mutations among people is very small. This isolation is reflected in nature in a sense, clean water and food are more common than other places in the country. We can also compare the city of Vegas with the old Reno. Because it is one of the rare cities where the post-war world has electricity. It is also located near the famous Hoover Dam.If we come to the story; Our scenario character, written by John Gonzales, is a simple element for a courier company called Mojave Express. Something goes wrong during an ordinary deployment and we are attacked and shot by a group to bury a landscape. Fortunately, however, it is being rescued by a robot called Victor and we are opening it up at Doctor Mitchell's house. So our adventure begins.The main story is about finding out who shot us, why, but of course there are many other side missions as well. Like the Fallout 3's twin in terms of New Vegas technical structure. Physics engine, character designs, models, shaders, etc. They are all the same as the third game, so I do not have to talk much about it, but I have only one desire from Obsidian; Please, but please let me create characters that look like human beings no more. There are still a lot of choices in face design in the character creation phase, but unfortunately all the combinations of these options do not give you a proper look. Okay maybe this world is a world where you get dirt and nukes, but not everyone looks like a pug-eyed alien.Like I said, the game has the same technical features, but there are also a few minor bugs about graphics. I think we will be quite satisfied with the game in terms of visuals after these mistakes that will be corrected in short time. In fact, when talking about the ready-made character model and graphic mistakes, let's talk about one or two bad sides of the game before it hides its beauty so that when we finish our writing, we have a nice taste in our mouth.Apart from the two technical faults I mentioned above, there is nothing I can complain about the technical part of the game. Beside this, I experienced some sadness about the music and sounds of the game. Music or voices are not bad, just few. Especially with the 5-10 songs you hear on radio music, it's just a piece of music playing on the fence while you are walking around. I still have old jazz and blues pieces, and occasionally I have two rock 'n' rolls. Regarding the voicings, it is not very inadequate as it is not bad at all, considering the logic of the game, neither technically nor quantitatively. But human beings are not enough! The character, ambiance and other voices are quite nice. Sounds and mouth movements are in sync. The sound of the surroundings really makes you feel like you're walking around in a circle. But I can not say the same for artificial intelligence. In general, artificial intelligence acting logically, sometimes can do really stupid things. In some places, if you are an enemy, your supporters, nonsense objects or walls can be stuck in place. But that's all. Obviously I'm going to do a bit of a bad review on the game, and that's a problem, except perhaps a music patch - a problem that can not be solved with a simple patch.As a first innovation we can start with traits and advantages (perk). While there is no change in skills, the features and benefits have been renewed. Also, the game does not force you to choose your first features. It offers you a choice of ""Choose 2 features or never"". Another innovation is camp fire. You will find these in many places. In campfires, you can make medicines and meals with the plants you collect around.Another innovation is in the work tables. Now, besides the classic work table, there is also a working table for preparing your own ammunition or for creating ammunition for the weapons you use with the pieces you have obtained from this unarmed ammunition. Of course, for these two innovations, you have to have your talent as well as the material. The game map is much smaller than Fallout 3. But do not perceive it as having less work to do. On the contrary, the fact that the map is small makes the game more full and lively, and I think it was a good tactic. One of the nice innovations is that you can now use binoculars. Now we do not have a problem to see far enough to find a scoped rifle, so I've been looking a lot for binoculars in the third game.The bobble heads we gathered in the third game have been replaced by snow globes and star aisle covers. What you will notice directly when you first target your weapon is that the weapon is not fixed. Yes, there is a coherence in weapons now. So you will usually want to squat and shoot. VATS was one of the most favorite battle strategies, and it still gives you the opportunity to make special strikes in addition to weapons other than firearms, and it is cinematic during these strikes. You already learn all these innovations in the village of Goodspring at the beginning of the game. As I said at the beginning, this village is actually prepared as an exercise section and you can say that I can absolutely recommend it, you can play this exercise section. We can say that great innovation is the interaction and the effects that this interaction creates in our stories. First of all, I have to say that reputation now has a very big prefix. The Mojava desert is shared by many groups; The most important of which are NCR and Caesar's Legion. NCR (New California Republic) is an organization that started after the war and a group of law-makers united and formed militias, and then it is growing considerably. They have power, money, technology and most important power. They provide electricity to New Vegas with the Hoover Dam on their hands. Caesar's Legion is a slavery-focused rebel group. NCR is not as strong and organized as the NCR, but literally insane. Apart from these, many other small group games are out in the game. This is where the reputation you make at this point affects the reaction you give to the groups that you encounter by coming after you. In every town, there is a reputation according to your attitude there, and at this point the game leaves you in a complete void. You will be on the side of a group during the game, or you will not be able to decide whether you will choose your side. There is good and bad here with no exact meaning. The people you say are good and want you to do things that sometimes you do not even doubt yourself.Dialogs are solid. It gives you detailed information about your life and your life here. Depending on your SPECIAL abilities, you may encounter different dialogue methods. In addition, the people you talk to change their face expression according to the subject or current mood.Overall: 11/10 LEGENDARY			",35,5,0,5,3,0,4

												You don't need an approvement to know that FO:NV is a great game, worthy of your time. Sure, it's a bit broken with those glitches, you can't turn a blind eye. But its quests and story, its freedom of choices and an amazing soundtrack really makes the glitches look like something unimportant, something small. I personally enjoyed New Vegas a bit more than FO3, but I think that it depends on your personal choice and experience. Most DLCs give you at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is quite important in my standards and they follow up different stories, which are brand new for you. Game's been out for years, it's basically a no brainer to get it, doesn't matter if full price or on a promotion. Try it out, see if I'm right.			",240,78,6,29,31,4,35

												Incredible follow up to Fallout 3. Still perhaps the best way for Fallout fans to spend their time exploring the Fallout universe until the next installment hits, although every Fallout game is well done. I liked the atmosphere of the game more than that of numerous RPGs, even though it's Vegas (I've been there more times than I can count). I only wish they made the characters more authentic in general, but the DLC seems to make up for this weakness, at least to some extent. Therefore, between the two I would always recommend the Ultimate Edition, if you can afford it. Never the less you really can't wrong with this game.			",221,34,3,33,20,1,41

												Ya know after putting a lot of thought into I can honestly say Fallout 4 is a great shooter and builder game, of course others do it better but beside that it's good at its one thing.The down side is, this ancient title that was dug up from the tombs of Bethesda way back in the fantastic year 2012 still somehow managed to be a better game. Which is upsetting to me in a lot of ways, but this game is truly a fantastic RPG in almost every regard of the word. It's not a simple Yes simulator like Fallout 4 is. I feel connected to my character in this game, I feel like I can really play someone give them a backstory, a life and a reason to keep pushing through the mutant rampant lands that we call the Mohave. Is it perfect gameplay? No. But mods fix that. And moding is 100% free (as long as you aren’t playing on a toaster). The melee system is clunky no matter what, the gun play is fun and you can mod weapons, it's very limited yes. But it's not overwhelming and you don’t have to lug around the entirety of a hoarders belongings in order to make sure you can upgrade your pipe pistol from the start of the game to still be relevant. I love this game, I played it for hours back when I still had a functional PS3 and I'm probably going to play it for way more then what I have right now. Get this game, it's the best Wasteland survival RPG on the market. ",195,32,0,36,25,2,16

												Perhaps its greatest strength is the fact that everybody can play it differently. Rigidly follow the main storyline – or wander off and ignore it entirely. Try and be as moral as possible – or kill and rob the first merchant you come across. It's a tailor-made gaming experience where everything can be done at your own pace and in your own way – no wonder it resonates with so many people.Fallout: New Vegas, the latest addition to the FRANCHISE, exemplifies all these great qualities in the series' best outing to date.The action this time takes place on the US west coast – the setting for the first two Fallout games – a decision which has granted Obsidian much greater scope for variety in landscaping and colour than the washed-out Washington DC of Fallout 3.Being further away from the game's titular nuclear fallout, there's blue skies, singing birds and more signs of civilisation – a marked tonal shift from the unremittingly bleak scenery seen previously.Aside from the familiar burnt-out cities and trailer parks, the centrepiece of this new setting is the New Vegas strip – a wonderfully distorted and dark version of its real-life counterpart. Vomiting drunks, voluptuous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and a selection of fully playable CASINOS(better max out your Luck rating first) make it every bit as vivid and memorable as the decaying US capital of the last game.In terms of the story, there's next to no foreshadowing this time around – players are expected to be familiar with the Fallout universe – and the main narrative follows your attempts to unravel the events leading up to your near-death, which prefigures the game.Fallout: New VegasI've been asked a few times whether it's 'better' than Fallout 3's central plot and to be honest it's hard to say. It's a looser strand to follow, meaning side-questing fits in much more easily, though the blank nature of your character means it's hard to care too much about what happened to you – especially when there's so much fun to be found elsewhere.

												I typically prefer to play simulation and strategy sandbox games because I can get countless hours of replayability versus games with a storyline as eventually the story ends. Reviews and trailers for Fallout 4 caught my attention, but I wasn't quite ready to dish out the money for a genre I've only started to dabble in recently. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas caught my attention when it was discounted during this past Winter Sale, and I went with Fallout New Vegas because I was worried about Windows 10 and Fallout 3 not being optimized past Windows 7.  I am soon to be 30 hours in and there is someone with almost 4,000 hrs of gameplay out there, I do not regret my choice and it speaks to the opporunity to replay the game when I am done with my first playthrough.Fallout New Vegas welcomed me in without the need to play the previous Fallout games, the storyline is captivating and well-planned thus far. The quests help me to explore an almost open world, exposing me to various creatures and gangs. I am not an expert and no where close to ending the game, but I like the fact that I can choose to replay the game differently by altering my choice of SPECIALS, skills, and choices that in turn affect how the game continues. I have restarted a few times while learning which SPECIALS and skills work best with the character build I am interested in. I finally have a better understanding of the setup and I find that the game provides a challenge without completely sinking and frustrating me as a new player to the genre and franchise. I imagined originally that I wouldn't like it because I don't typicaly play first person shooters but the whole aspect of combining elements of an RPG that I am dabbling with as of late with FPS has suddenly made me more fierce with a gun and explosives. I LOVE that I can cause damage but on the side of good. Some day, maybe I will walk on the darkside to see what else Fallout New Vegas has to offer in terms of quests, but until then I am shooting ghouls, creepy crawlers, and gang members in favor of those in need.

												There are two main groups of the Fallout fanbase as of 2011: people who played all the Fallout games and the much larger amount of people who only really played Fallout 3. I'm part of the first group. Leaving aside the fact that said group is the most toxic fanbase on the Internet, suffice to say that I think Fallout 2 was a big improvement over the first (awful opening area aside).Fallout 3-gen fans tend to dislike New Vegas. But to people like me, Fallout: New Vegas is what I've been waiting for. It's designed by many of the people who made Fallout 2, specifically New Reno. The shortcomings I felt with Fallout 3--the lack of region/NPC-specific endings, the quest solutions not really having much of an effect on the game or world, the dialogue/writing of the NPCs, etc--have all been fixed here. The VATS targeting system is no longer invincible and targeting is redone to use FPS mechanics (where you aim = where you shoot). It'd be hard to go back to Fallout 3 from this, & I liked F3!

												Despite what some people might say, Fallout: NV is the better game compared to Fallout 3. It has the same basic ""Fallout 3-esque"" gameplay but it's much improved. They took many popular mods from FO3 and implemented them directly into the game and it's much better for it. I'd even go as far to say that ""hardcore mode"" is the way you should play Fallout: NV. It feels much better with that turned on...like a real wasteland and you're trying to survive in it.NV is exactly what Obsidian does best - They take a good IP and improve upon it in almost every way....especially the writing. Bethesda couldn't write a decent story to save their lives. Their writers are down-right horrible and every one of their games' story was a joke. They make nice lore, but they never write an interesting and involved story in a single game.The only thing FO3 has over NV is easy to see (literally). It's the visuals. FO3 takes place in a  ruined downtown DC area in the USA. Very iconic even to people who don't live in the US. The cowboy-esque visuals from NV are nice at times too, but nothing compares to a torn-up iconic environment most people have seen pictures of in real life.  It's the one real advantage that game has. Everything else though? Fallout: New Vegas actually does it better. Don't get me wrong, I liked Fallout 3 for what it was, but most everything was improved for New Vegas.Do yourself a favor and pick up NV today!			",132,10,5,10,9,1,7

												Fantastic RPG. Adds a bunch of new stuff that wasn't in Fallout 3. The companion wheel is great, and the weapon mods make your weapon pack more of a punch.The story is very well done, and all the stuff you could do in the Mojave could keep you busy for months. Then when you go through the DLC, you'll have even more stuff to do. I guess there's never a dull moment in this game!			",178,45,5,29,20,5,21

												Although I have only played Fallout 3, and Fallout 3: New Vegas, I have to say, this is one of my most favorite games. Not only are the mechanics of the game amazing, but there are so many different choices to make in the game. From customizing your character to your skillsets.I have to say my favorite is Science, Energy Weapons, and Explosives. Its always fun to set a crap load of mines and top it off with a grenade or stick of dynamite and see your enimies go ""Kabloosh!"" If your use to Skyrim or other games by Bethesda, you will love this action packed, mind tingling RPG!			",100,14,2,17,20,0,8

												Fallout New Vegas. The Fifth official installment in the brilliant Fallout series is wholly welcome.Carrying on faithfully the looks and feel of the much loved franchise it's a brilliant addition and definitely elicits a huge amount of enjoyment.The game depicts the adventures of 'the Courier', a man shot and left for dead in a grave yard in the town of Goodsprings. His quest was to deliver some sort of message... But it was stolen.  Venturing through the game you meet a wide variety of people and groups (including fan favorites such as the Brotherhood of Steel) and on your quest to recover the message you become involved in things much more important than you could ever have expected. The entirely new location allowed the Game Devs to include various new creatures and factions, allowing for interaction with strange new peoples.The visuals of the game are slightly different to it's predecessor Fallout 3, the altered, now orange-y colour scheme is a bit alien to the normal colour pallete however is not too disappointing. An issue with the landscape that I had, is the fact that it doesn't look enough like it's 'just' after an apocalypse. The environment seems a bit too lively, but in fact, it may have looked a bit too repetitive if it carried on looking like Fallout 3 (I'm excited to see how Fallout 4 will look with its rumored Nuclear Winter environment.)There are not many alterations to the gameplay as opposed to the last Fallout game - a style of gameplay which i have come to love with a passion. Fans of the series will be happy to return to using familiar mechanics such as V.A.T.S. which newcomers will quickly get used to.Basically, the game is pretty damn good! The new environment and story line, as well as glorious DLCs (like Old Time Blues) make it a must have in any gamer's collection.80/100			",58,5,0,3,3,0,3

												If god sent down any game, It wouldn't be this game but you are probably thinking ""Why is he being so negative on the first line of the review?"" If god sent down a game it would be something that isn't so unpolished but dont get me wrong, if Jesus could send down a game he would of sent this game.Fallout New Vegas is a game that is quite frankly buggy and semi-broken but this doesn't sway me away from the fact that it is ever expanding and the gameplay and exploration and even the atmosphere is almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, completed the game? that's no problem with fallout because of the vast array of mods up to download I'm actually half way through a mod called new vegas bounties II which adds 3-4 hours of gameplay with fully fledged dialogue and lip syncing.If I had to rate Fallout New Vegas out of 10 I would give it an 11, a masterpiece that is slightly inconvenienced by the occasional quest bug or game bug, I highly recommend this to anyone with a taste for a good open world game.

												Fallout New Vegas is a very nice video game. From the story to the gameplay, it has eaten the past 100 hours of my life and I'm  very pleased to waste my time. From the art style to the music to the characters, it all just fits in so well. You could say that it's no different from Fallout 3 but unlike Fallout 3, this is a much brighter and much more difficult and polished up experience with only a few flaws within the game. The DLC is fantastic, offering lots of new content and areas to explore. However, there is the problem that it's a Bethesda game. Why is that a problem? Because it's buggy. You have to be careful with the game. If you can get over the annoying save bug (where you can't load your save, requiring you to start the game from the start in order to be able to load your oldest save), to some quest breaking bugs that require you to cheat in the console (I had this occur for me once, but still). The other problem is that the battle with Caesar is very very badly executed. But, that doesn't stop the game itself from being good. If you're looking for a very fun and enjoyable experience, I highly recommend you try it out. And the game itself isn't that expensive with all it's DLC anyway.			",241,60,6,30,18,4,20

												Played 40 hours on my first playthrough, then lost the save file right before the fight at Hoover Dam.Now, one year later I finally build up the courage to start anew and begin an adventure that will help place Fallout: New Vegas as one of the most immersive, and addicting games I've ever played. The glitches give it that charm that lets you know not to take things too seriously, many laughs to be had. The game provides challenge as long as you play at least Normal and up.This game also gives you the option the literally play through the adventure, in many numorous ways whether it be what main story path you'll take (NCR, Caesar, House, You having an entire robot army)On top of that, you're free to decide how you will deal with every situation. You want to be a blood thirsty melee mad man? Maybe you'd prefer to deal with things in a more ""peaceful"" way, vanilla new vegas has been proven to be able to beat without killing a single creature or person (You can look up the YouTube playlist) Or like any regular person who likes the pick up Fallout, just wants to get 100 Guns and shoot any man creature or creepy ghoul proostitute, lockpick into everything (Which is nicely recommended) and all in all, have fun. The DLC is also all really well done and worth picking up. This game I recommend for everybody who has a brain420/10 changed my life.P.S. In H&H Tools Factory, read every single terminal, it's worth it.			",189,21,7,27,13,0,22

Posted: November 21, 2013
												TL;DR - Just by sheer length, you should be able to realize that I would recommend this game to everyone. This review is about WHY I recommend it so highly. I do not use the word ""awesome"" very often, but to say “New Vegas's writing and characters are awesome” is true. And I mean, they can create a feeling of awe in YOU. It is especially obvious in the companions that join YOU during YOUR game.SPOILER WARNINGS FOR FALLOUT 1, FALLOUT 2, FALLOUT 3, AND FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS ULTIMATE EDITION!It's easy to see why Boone is a great character. Or how much of a story you can actually give an eyebot. You should sympathize/empathize with Veronica, while being frustrated and understanding at the same time with what Christine had to do. Getting to choose which brain gets to be Rex's replacement, and finding him a mate in Roxie. Being able to help the Nightkin with a high enough science skill and Lily. Getting Dean and Dog/God to begin again. Helping Arcade and Raul choose their own future path in helping the wasteland. Aiding Follows-Chalk in deciding if exploring the ""civilized world"" is worth the time. Helping Waking Cloud with her family and uncovering the mysteries of her tribe's past.They are all interesting characters, because of their abilities to help you, and because they all have different stories. But Cass's story is different, even though it does not seem different. You find her drinking alone on the edge of New Vegas. Trapped between going home and trying to uncover the problems of her caravan business. You can help her several different ways. First you can convince her to go back home and not ""sellout"", or ""sellout"" in order to uncover what happened. And you help her choose how to deal with the assassinations, whether to take them to court and hurt them in their pocketbooks(the reason they did the assassinations in the first place) or deal in ""An eye for an eye"" justice, and kill them all. Regardless of your choice, she is never mad at you for helping. But you literally help decide what kind of person she will become. Now this might not seem very special. You are right, when only taken as the story from Fallout: New Vegas, her companion story lands somewhere in the middle to upper range.But Fallout: New Vegas is not the start of the series. And Obsidian had members that worked on Fallout 2(most importantly Chris Avellone, since he is also the writer of Cass and the Mohave Outpost where you find her, and he created Vault City – more on this later), and are close friends with the people that made Fallout 1. So it was not difficult for them to understand the entire narrative and expand upon what has already happened.To really appreciate Cass's complete story, you have to go back to the start of the series and understand your role in the Fallout universe. In Fallout 1(1997 in our world), the Overseer of Vault 13, sends YOU(""The Vault Dweller"") outside of Vault 13 in order to find a replacement for their failing water filtration system. The solutions to YOUR Vault's water problems cause the otherwise secret location of YOUR Vault to become known. The Overseer is angry that YOU have endangered Vault 13, so he sends YOU back out to save the Vault from YOUR mess. Once YOU are finally done ensuring the safety of Vault 13, YOU return home. The Overseer recognizes that YOU are no longer a Vault 13 citizen, YOUR travels have changed the person that YOU once were. He feels that YOU would be a danger to Vault 13's society. So after all YOUR hard work, YOU get exiled from YOUR home.Some of the other members of Vault 13 are angry at the Overseer for the choice to exile “The Vault Dweller”, and they all join ""The Vault Dweller"". They travel for a bit and eventually create the village of Arroyo. ""The Vault Dweller"" gets married and has a daughter. This daughter becomes the leader of the tribe. A generation almost completely passes before Arroyo falls onto hard times. They need a technological boost to survive.Fallout 2(1998) opens with ""The Vault Dweller""'s daughter(the leader of the Arroyo tribe) explaining to YOU, her child(""The Chosen One""), to leave YOUR tribe to find the required technology to help save everyone. Along the way YOU stop in Vault City. In the outskirts of town there is a bar. The owner of the bar is John Cassidy. YOU help him with his unfair debts. He wants to escape from Vault City now that he does not owe money and joins up with YOU. There is not much else to say. For the next 12 years(in our time) there is not much to talk about. John Cassidy was a popular choice to bring in YOUR party. He had a bad heart so YOU could store YOUR drugs with him without fear of him ever using anything but stimpack, but the man loves to drink. YOU can ask him what weapons he is good with. He tells YOU that he is mostly good with guns and knives, but is ashamed to tell YOU that he can use a spear(since it might make people think that his is just a tribal). The main character development seemed to be explaining to him that YOU are just a tribal, and he has learned his lesson about being judgmental of tribals.So why was all that back story about the stories of Fallout 1 and 2 important? And why did I capitalize all the ""you""s and ""your""s when talking about the Player Characters? I capitalized them to remind you that it was your choice for these things to happen. These are the canonical events. Even though you do not have to recruit John Cassidy, the official story states that you did.So jumping ahead to Fallout 3(2008). It is based on the opposite coast from the rest of the series, and barely tells us anything about what happened in Fallout 1/Fallout 2, like Fallout 2 did with Fallout 1. That is all that needs to be said about Fallout 3.Back to Fallout: New Vegas(2010). If you do not send Cass back West, she joins YOU. When YOU ask her about her name YOU learn it is Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Cass for short. YOU learn that she can use guns, knives, and spears. She gets annoyed with YOU, if you talk to her while high on any drugs, but gives you bonus for drinking alcohol. Especially her favorite kind, Whiskey, which gives YOU another bonus. When YOU ask more about her life growing up, YOU learn that her mother was sick and did not raise her much. Her dad just left one day, when she was young. All of the evidence should show that Cass is the daughter of John Cassidy. YOU!!!!!!!(""The Chosen One"" from Fallout 2) are the reason why John Cassidy leaves Vault City and Cass. YOU are the reason Cass's life has turned out this way. YOU are the cause of all her problems, just because YOU wanted a party member that was really good with a gun.The developers are the reason why Boone had a such a rough life. The developers are the reason why Christine was so obsessed with being in the ""Circle of Steel"" and solving the internal problems of the ""Brotherhood of Steel"". Even at the cost of her voice and her relationship with Veronica. The developers are the reason that ED-E is broken and that Rex is dying. The developers are the reason that Raul is locked up, or that Arcade has run from his past. The developers are the reason that Lily is going crazy and Dog/God's personality is split. The developers are the reason that Dean got caught up in the Sierra Madre. The developers are why Follows-Chalk and Waking Cloud are struggling with different aspects of tribal life.Sure, Josh Sawyer told Chris Avellone to do something with John Cassidy when the game was being developed. It is not completely YOUR fault. But you actually caused Cass to turn out this way. If YOU did not find John Cassidy's character to be useful, then Josh would never have told Chris to use that storyline from Fallout 2.YOU now recruit John Cassidy because if you don't, he doesn't help save the world, but still leaves his daughter and wife. Now this is the part of his story that YOU get to shape.Cass is one of the many examples of why I recommend this game to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the first of the Fallout Series that I've played and I am thoroughly impressed. The creators and successors of Fallout truly love their creation and put so much passion into their games and related items of interests. Only finishing FO:NV, I realise that I have only touched like 5% of the whole story. It made me curious and so I read the timeline of events in the whole Fallout universe and pleased myself with the reading of the whole story. I really enjoyed that as well!(From a first-time player of Fallout) FO:NV has great FPS gameplay including the VATS feature. The leveling, skill, S.P.E.C.I.A.L, perk and reputation system is vast and astonishing. I enjoyed starting new characters with high strength and luck and yolo it out in the Wasteland. The mass amounts of items, armor, weapons, ammo and drinks you can find is another aspect that'll make me enjoy and not get bored. Storyline is very non-linear and links up few quests so you don't have to got through too much trouble. The A.I is nicely designed for the era of the gaming industry when FO:NV was in. Companions are cool and there are many options to do with the companion (fight, stay, disband or just have a nice chat). Overall I just think FO:NV as an incredibly badass game.The main reason I played FO:NV was because of the massive hype for Fallout 4 that provoked me to try out the Fallout Series. I know now that I will definitely buy Fallout 4, when I have the money ofc. I am proud of Bethesda, Obsidian and the original creators Interplay. 10/10 I write poetry in my Brotherhood of Steel armor. Lasers are my ink. My enemies are my paper.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout: New Vegas may seem like an expansion for Fallout 3 than a stand alone game, but that is only at first glance. Fallout: New Vegas takes the focus of the Fallout franchise back to the west coast and does so in a very good way. The story isn't exactly amazing, however it lends itself to letting you create your own backstory, and making your own decisions. There really isn't too much to hold you back from doing what ever you want? The base game alone has hundreds of hours of contnent in it, and has a huge amount of replay value, from four different major endings and dozens of smaller end pieces. That being said it is not without a few flaws: namely the glitichs and instability. It manages to be worse than its predecesor in that regard, as well as numerous bugs; some hilarious, some that can ruin a run through. The only other real complaint I have is that you CANNOT continue the game after you beat the ending, which is a shame. Still there is more than enough to do in New Vegas, and with all of its DLC this is a must have for any Fallout fan, as well as anyone who likes RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War? War never changes. Neither does Fallout. Between Fallout 3 and New Vegas not a whole lot had changed. Heck, usually a sequel adds significant technical improvements. Not New Vegas. New Vegas trades out the setting for a slightly different one, trades in its story for something that Bioware would be jealous of. And adds a few new weapons and options. Other than that, New Vegas and Fallout 3 are pretty much exactly alike. And that is not a bad thing. I would have loved a more intuitive interface, or higher walkspeed, but I guess the developers held true to their creed of ""do not fix what isn't broke."" They also didn't fix was was broken, but big games have these small issues, and New Vegas is big. Huge. Ginormous. Not just in scale, but also in scope. There are so incredibly many things to do; if you'd try to do them all, you'd go mad. It is impossible to do it all in one playthrough; many quests have different angles and outcomes, and your alignment plays a big role. Oh, and this game isn't cushy with good and bad alignment. No, this game has a tonne of factions, and each keeps tabs on your relationship with them. You can suck up to all of them, or a few, or just go full paraiah and just kill everyone. Also, the game generally doesn't care about how you finish up a quest; just that you put an end to it. New Vegas is a true, and both technically and literally a sandbox game. Most of the world is desert. Miles and miles of barren, irradiated sand, rocks and broken roads. This is where the tedium sets in. Because for all its superfluence, there isn't much variation in the design. All the buildings look the same. Someone built the same dingy shack about 18 times over, all across the Mohave desert. You can only distiguish the various derelict factories from the name on the door. It's a shame. For all its complex relationship mechanics and over the top gore, it is easy to see where the developers cut costs.None of it really matters. The narrative just sucks you in, then spits you out to the side so you can go fishing for airplanes, only to draw you back in as you are rummaging through random hotel rooms. When you finally hit the climax, you'll have no idea about what and who you were working with. All the more reason to play it again, and waste even more time, looking for snowglobes in a giant desert while the future of mankind is at the mercy of antiquated fanatics who like to nail people to crosses for fun.

												Fallout: New Vegas is all about more. There's more to do in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, its superb predecessor; there's more complexity to its gameplay mechanics; and there are even more secrets to uncover as you roam the postapocalyptic wastes. Fallout: New Vegas' familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have you itching to see what other joys you might uncover. Occasional glitches and performance issues occasionally intrude upon your travels, along with the scorpions and geckos that might accost you. Don't let the quirks frighten you away, however: New Vegas' nooks and crannies are bursting with grimy treasures waiting to be dusted off and admired by intrepid explorers.There's a wild, wonderful world outside Vegas, just waiting to be explored.This latest trip into the desolate American landscape possesses many of the same elements that made Fallout 3 such a successful role-playing game, but its story doesn't boast as many memorable moments. The large-scale combat scenarios are less epic, and the surprises are less dramatic than Fallout 3's mid-game reverie. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid skeleton from which to hang a dumbfounding number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will invite you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you wondering about what will happen next. A society of ghouls with pie-in-the-sky aspirations is creepy enough to make you squirm, yet blind devotion to their dreams still inspires empathy. Socialites in formal attire run a casino known for its creative menu choices, and if you play your cards right, you might get to make a menu alteration of your own. You investigate the disappearance of a sharp-tongued wife in one town and bring star-crossed lovers together in another. Some of the most fascinating occurrences are the wittier ones. During one quest, a robot with a specialized skill and a gut-busting name might offer a service that surely no game character has ever offered before. A poet in an unlikely place mumbles aloud his difficulties in finding the right rhymes. Like with Fallout 3, the greatest delights aren't in the central storyline but on its periphery.While the tale isn't as evocative as it might have been, the way it blossoms as you advance, giving you any number of ways to proceed, is extraordinary. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. Maybe you'll fend off the robots defending a long-forgotten museum, but you might also steal an identification card that allows you to walk around (mostly) unharmed. You might provide a drug addict his fix, but if your speech skill is high enough, you can convince him to get on the straight and narrow. One lovelorn fellow will try to send you on a scavenger hunt for spare parts, but a high science skill means you can recommend another schematic and avoid the job altogether. However, there are certain cases in which the game funnels you down a specific path that might come as a shock if you prefer peaceful ends but are forced into a combat scenario with a single viable solution. And in certain cases, the quests just aren't designed particularly well. Searching for a key in a vault overrun with vegetation can turn into a major hassle. Avoiding an artillery bombardment isn't fun in the least and feels out of place given the measured pace at which you move. And an optional quest in which you hop from one computer terminal to another to isolate a virus leads to frustrating trial-and-error guesswork.Ghouls don't like it when you say 'eewww' to their faces. It's better to talk behind their backs at a later time.Large personalities give an edge to your undertakings. A mysterious man known as Mr. House presides over both the Strip, as well as your own adventures, and his singular focus on fulfilling his needs looms dramatically over the later hours of your escapades. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an ominous presence and a violent counterpoint to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. A ghoulish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a potty-mouthed head waiter, and a wealthy-but-desperate father all make an impression in spite of their very minor roles. You might even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also open up different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them tick.Fallout: New Vegas' major addition is that of faction favor. You establish a reputation with various towns and organizations by doing them favors or annoying them in some way or another. Which factions you align with has both subtle and profound consequences. If you're liked, a random somebody might run up to you bearing minor gifts, such as an iguana on a stick. (Mmm, tasty.) Or if you've gained a more violent reputation, a mugger might accost you with violent intentions, only to run off when he recognizes you. It's a pleasure to hear random citizens remark on how they feel about you as you pass by, even if the canned comments repeat a bit too often. (It's sometimes bizarre to hear two characters standing side by side deliver the same line, spoken by the same voice actor.)That Great Khan is no match for a sword made out of a bumper.Your faction relationships also have much more dramatic consequences on your adventure, opening up new quests while closing off others. The game is sometimes a bit opaque regarding how your actions may inadvertently affect the way a particular faction sees you, but this complexity manifests itself in awesome ways as you near the end of your travels. One great twist to this system is that by dressing up in faction-specific clothing or armor, you can disguise yourself and avoid a confrontation. Though, conversely, you might get dragged into battles against allies if you forget to change gear, which might damage a relationship you're trying to cultivate. This reputation system is a bit abstract, but it's a great addition to the Fallout formula, adding even more layers to a template already lauded for its flexibility.Glitches may give you a few minor fits, but the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is not in the same rough technical shape as its console counterparts, possibly thanks to a sizeable patch delivered a day after its release. That doesn't mean there aren't problems here. We encountered some bugs, such as a friendly quest giver inexplicably attacking us, even though he didn't show as an enemy on the directional radar. Characters might still randomly freak out as if you're about to attack for no discernible reason, only to return to their normal locations a moment later and act as if nothing had happened. But we encountered only a few scripting problems, and the game never crashed. Most complex role-playing games suffer from technical hitches, and this one is no exception. However, the oddities in this version aren't exceptionally disruptive, which makes it easy to stay invested.Hacking is one way to solve your problems, but if you aren't good at it, there's probably another way. Or three.If you played Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which used the same game engine as Fallout: New Vegas, then you won't be surprised by some of the other minor foibles, although many of them seem exac			",390,102,26,53,64,4,66

 I just love this gameI played it without Steam some years ago for about 150+ hours and want to recapitulate this experience now with some Nexus-mods. Took me about 4 hours to get it running smoothly and without crashes, but it's totally worth the time and money!! For me  NMC-textures and Nevada Skies crashed the whole game. So this was a bummer. I recommend the following mods:  Western Sky!!  Active Wasteland  db enhanced Blood Textures  Full Character Overhaul!  Improved Sound FX!!  Sprint Mod  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash  EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements!!  The radio stations: CONELRAD and Old World RadioI also recommend to start the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode (Windows XP Service Pack 2).But also without mods and stuff this game is absolutely great and except the grafics totally up to date! If you're from Germany, be shure to buy the UNCUT Ultimate Edition!!For More Blood etc. open Fallout_default.ini Config file found in:...Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegasand find the following lines:fDecalLifetime=10.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=50change the numbers to:fDecalLifetime=720.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=512 Bottom line: This is one of the best RPG of all time and can keep up with games like Morrowind and Skyrim!Update: It's still running pretty good, but every 2-3 hours it's crashing...But so what?!Update after 150 hours: Done most of the side-quests and it's still fun to scavenge and explore the wastelands. There's sooooo much to discover and I realized that last time I played it I missed many many cool quests and locations.Right now, I'm starting the Dead Money DLC with my level 34 character. This DLC seems to be quite out of touch with the ""normal"" Fallout NV world. There's something about ghosts, radios which will kill you if you go near them (you're wearing a booby-trap-collar (Battle Royale?!), which will detonate on approach) and some guy is forcing you to enter the Sierra Madre casino with some companions...Mhh, I'm eager to find out how this turns out!! I'll keep you updated!Update: Okay, totally got addicted again to this game! Played every DLC and maxed my character out...Mhhh, let's see, how long it takes until I play it again :-DI WILL BE BACK!!Update:   Okay, maybe I won't be back, because, people, hear me out: FALLOUT 4 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!  So for all of you who can't wait, get this game and prepare yourself for the wasteland!! ",245,97,10,36,22,3,21

												A great FPS/RPG game.  It’s longer then most normal games with tons of replay ability and I’m still finding stuff I’ve never discovered.  NV also makes for a good follow up to Fallout 3, as they are build off the same engine and for the most part have very similar play style.  On top of that they reworked combat outside of VATS to make if feel more fluid with the ability to actually shoot down your sights even at low level over FO3.   Another improvement was to repairs for weapons were now you can fix a gun to max condition even with low repair  vs FO3 not letting you do that.  Lastly the change to companions and making them more useful over FO3 is great.  I liked having companions to help out and all of them have missions and stories their own that add even more to narrative of the world you play in.New Vegas does come with a little baggage (Few bugs/CTD) but other then that, as long you have auto save on your ok.  The only thing that puts me off little on this game is it don't really have the apocalypse feel as much as FO3 does.  I'm ok with the more old western feel but I do miss the large destroyed city feel most of FO3 had.  Mods also can help add to your world, change whatever you want.  You choose how things turn out but as always, war… war never changes.***9.5/10***			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sequels that stay true to the cannon? Well fanboys of fo1 and 2, your sequel has arrived!

If buying this also make sure to drop by newvegas.nexusmods.com  to beef the game up further with hundreds of mods available.  Nevada Skies, Project Nevada and Weapon Mods Expanded for example, highly recommended.			",172,15,7,38,3,0,44

 I just love this gameI played it without Steam some years ago for about 150+ hours and want to recapitulate this experience now with some Nexus-mods. Took me about 4 hours to get it running smoothly and without crashes, but it's totally worth the time and money!! For me  NMC-textures and Nevada Skies crashed the whole game. So this was a bummer. I recommend the following mods:  Western Sky!!  Active Wasteland  db enhanced Blood Textures  Full Character Overhaul!  Improved Sound FX!!  Sprint Mod  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash  EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements!!  The radio stations: CONELRAD and Old World RadioI also recommend to start the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode (Windows XP Service Pack 2).But also without mods and stuff this game is absolutely great and except the grafics totally up to date! If you're from Germany, be shure to buy the UNCUT Ultimate Edition!!For More Blood etc. open Fallout_default.ini Config file found in:...Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegasand find the following lines:fDecalLifetime=10.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=50change the numbers to:fDecalLifetime=720.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=512 Bottom line: This is one of the best RPG of all time and can keep up with games like Morrowind and Skyrim!Update: It's still running pretty good, but every 2-3 hours it's crashing...But so what?!Update after 150 hours: Done most of the side-quests and it's still fun to scavenge and explore the wastelands. There's sooooo much to discover and I realized that last time I played it I missed many many cool quests and locations.Right now, I'm starting the Dead Money DLC with my level 34 character. This DLC seems to be quite out of touch with the ""normal"" Fallout NV world. There's something about ghosts, radios which will kill you if you go near them (you're wearing a booby-trap-collar (Battle Royale?!), which will detonate on approach) and some guy is forcing you to enter the Sierra Madre casino with some companions...Mhh, I'm eager to find out how this turns out!! I'll keep you updated!Update: Okay, totally got addicted again to this game! Played every DLC and maxed my character out...Mhhh, let's see, how long it takes until I play it again :-DI WILL BE BACK!!Update:   Okay, maybe I won't be back, because, people, hear me out: FALLOUT 4 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!  So for all of you who can't wait, get this game and prepare yourself for the wasteland!! ",245,97,10,36,22,3,21

												War? War never changes. Neither does Fallout. Between Fallout 3 and New Vegas not a whole lot had changed. Heck, usually a sequel adds significant technical improvements. Not New Vegas. New Vegas trades out the setting for a slightly different one, trades in its story for something that Bioware would be jealous of. And adds a few new weapons and options. Other than that, New Vegas and Fallout 3 are pretty much exactly alike. And that is not a bad thing. I would have loved a more intuitive interface, or higher walkspeed, but I guess the developers held true to their creed of ""do not fix what isn't broke."" They also didn't fix was was broken, but big games have these small issues, and New Vegas is big. Huge. Ginormous. Not just in scale, but also in scope. There are so incredibly many things to do; if you'd try to do them all, you'd go mad. It is impossible to do it all in one playthrough; many quests have different angles and outcomes, and your alignment plays a big role. Oh, and this game isn't cushy with good and bad alignment. No, this game has a tonne of factions, and each keeps tabs on your relationship with them. You can suck up to all of them, or a few, or just go full paraiah and just kill everyone. Also, the game generally doesn't care about how you finish up a quest; just that you put an end to it. New Vegas is a true, and both technically and literally a sandbox game. Most of the world is desert. Miles and miles of barren, irradiated sand, rocks and broken roads. This is where the tedium sets in. Because for all its superfluence, there isn't much variation in the design. All the buildings look the same. Someone built the same dingy shack about 18 times over, all across the Mohave desert. You can only distiguish the various derelict factories from the name on the door. It's a shame. For all its complex relationship mechanics and over the top gore, it is easy to see where the developers cut costs.None of it really matters. The narrative just sucks you in, then spits you out to the side so you can go fishing for airplanes, only to draw you back in as you are rummaging through random hotel rooms. When you finally hit the climax, you'll have no idea about what and who you were working with. All the more reason to play it again, and waste even more time, looking for snowglobes in a giant desert while the future of mankind is at the mercy of antiquated fanatics who like to nail people to crosses for fun. Serious business.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												What an excellent game! I've played the entire Fallout franchise and in my opinion this game is what Fallout 3 should have been. Not to belittle the previous title in the series, in its own right it was a fun game, with an excellent storyline, but this game is truer to the original Fallout's quasi-Western-like feel. As with this games predecessors, you wander the apocalyptic wasteland, Immersive stories begin to emerge, with some pleasant story lines and character references to previous games in the series cropping up from time to time. In this game you will encounter a range of factions with whom you can choose to become friends or enemies. Many of the decisions you will make throughout the very open world/storyline will also transform your experience. One of the greatest aspects of this game being the fact that following the first playthrough you can make entirely different choices in your second playthrough (ie, appease a group you previously were enemies with on first playthrough or make entirely different decisions at key points in the game to unlock a totally different storyline) and enjoy an almost entirely new game experience - within certain limits. In some cases the storyline wont be as flexible as you may like and will limit how far your ""alternative version of events"" can go. There are other core features of the game that are equally important to mention - hidden storylines that you from time to time accidently stumble into in that second or third playthrough that will totally open up the game for you again and keep it fresh. There are numerous weapons, armour types, places to explore, people to betray, people to ally, monsters to kill, adventures to be had, decisions to make - and most importantly - the type of character you create as you play through the game. Do you wish to be hero and saviour of the weak? Or perhaps make sacrifices for ""the greater good""? Are you super inteligent  and able to outwit those around you? Amazing with a rifle so that you can kill with a headshot before they get close? Perhaps you prefer to be a super strong brute that goes in close for the kill? Or are you the Rockafellar of the wastes - making a profit everywhere you go so that you can afford to buy rare and impressive weapons no one else has? The list of traits goes on, and you can choose to specialise in some or be a jack of all trades (and master of none) - the flexibility is all yours. Do you seek revenge? Do you crave power and influence? Do you hate bandits or perhaps wish to be one? The choices are *nearly* endless. The only thing I disliked about this game was not the game itself but the DLC. I only tried one or two of them and just could not enjoy them - even though they aim to expand some elements of the story line - I would consider giving these a wide berth unless you're particularly curious!For those of you who love post apolocalyptic themed games, sci fi, westerns, shooters, clever storylines, rpgs, action games, monsters, decision making and replayability. A highly recommended game that has been very cleverly made and well thought out. In most ways (aside from the FPS element) it remains true to the original Fallout games. A credit to the people who made it.			",113,13,0,33,60,0,58

												This game is brilliant. it fixes allot of what fallout 3 did not (iron sites ect...) the choice and influence that your charicter has on the world is increadable. you can end up making new vegas a utopia in the waste or enslave/kill all of his inhabitence. The DLC alone is enough to buy this game as it adds so much in terms of story, gameplay and maps. Although if you try to describe this game to someone it can seem a little wierd. ""the world has been nuked and a mail man gets shot in the head only to survive and go on a mail man phsycotic rampage, nuke two places, rob a casino, extermanate tribes and be the most baddas mail man there is"". I think that this was the true falout 3 (not that it was bad or anything it was realy good) but because most of the people, factions and references are for fallout 1 and 2, so it feels like this should have been were fallout 3 is, and 3 be a spin off game (a very good one at that)i give this game 5 stars and bannana out of 10			",119,12,1,15,7,2,10

												Fallout: New Vegas is pretty much the post-apocalypse game I always wanted. You have a gigantic world to explore, countless number of side quests in addition to the already meaty and choice-based main quest The gameplay is satisfying and is is the perfect balance between RPG and action shooter. The game easily has over 150 hours of content with all the DLC. It is a proper RPG, letting you play how you want, be it a suave diplomat, a sneaky thief, or a thug with a very big hammer, and has multiple factions to side with for the end-game.As someone who played the hell out of this on the Xbox, I got the game again on PC primarily for mods, and if anyone is considering re-buying for that reason, I whole heartedly say do it right now. Modding makes an already great game fantastic and utterly unique to you with thousands upon thousands of mods. Never a fan of any of the armour or weapons? There is probably a mod out there for you. Not a fan of the fast travel system? Get XRE cars and drive around the wasteland. Have Fallout 3 and want one huge game? Get Tale of Two Wastelands and combine them into one big game with the same character. Want the game to be less of an RPG and more of a shooter, with high damage numbers, sprinting and hotkeys for grenades and melee? There are indeed mods that do that. The possibilities are endless, and the main modding website for New Vegas is easy to use, letting you both manually install mods or have an app that does it for you if you aren't confident enough or unsure.  Pretty much any kind of mod you want, it's out there.The main downside to a game of this scope if the stability, and while generally stable there are some very common bugs everyone will come across when playing the game. Of course, if you have played any other Bethesda-style RPG you will expect this anyway. I made a post on the forums which has the main ones you will need to make the game stable and mostly bug free:http://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/522730700736948013/I can not recommend this game highly enough. One of the best RPG's of the last generation. If you want to see how awesome this game looks, check out my screenshots.			",284,49,2,19,17,1,35

												Fallout New Vegas really reminds the player of the original fallouts.Unlike Fallout 3 (which i highly recommend as well) New Vegas gives you choices that you may be morally conflicted with, yes Fallout 3 had choices in it, all good fallout games have, but New Vegas gives you more options. In addition to more choices the developers have introduced a reputation system, you do something good like help a community you will be liked more, but if you do things they do not like your reputation will go down. All of this matters in the endgame, who will support you depending on what side you took.Like many of RPG you will encounter people, you will talk to people. Throughout your travels you will meet interesting people you either like or dislike, all characters of importance are interesting, they have a story to tell, from Mr House overlord of the strip to the super mutants in Jacobstown.The graphics honestly are not anything to brag about. There is little change from Fallout 3, a few things have been brought over. But Fallout has never been known for their graphics, it has been for the story. If you are really bugged by the graphics you could just go and get a mod for it, there are plenty.VATS is back, along with other gameplay elements that made Fallout 3 popular. There have been changes made as well, more immersive elements have been added, like making ammunition, more crafting options, more weapons types, gambling and many more. I would not be recommending this game if there was no change, but there is change and it is a good change.Active community, Mods! The community is super active for mods, so many mods mods mods mods.Lastly the DLC. Lonesome road, Dead money, Old Wolrd Blues and honest hearts. All of them are good in their own respects but this review is looking at the core game, reviews for the DLC's will be on their respective pages or elsewhere.Fallout New Vegas is a game that is a game I will definitely recommend to anybody that asks.

 Fallout: New Vegas Alright, before you read the rest of my review let me get one thing straight, on the whole ""Fallout 3 vs. Fallout: New Vegas"" argument,  I believe Fallout: New Vegas is better  in my opinion Fallout: New Vegas is better than Fallout 3, now hold on, before you call me the devil himself,  I don't dislike Fallout 3 by any means  , it's still one of my favorite games of all time, I just believe that New Vegas is better. I'll be going over my reasoning for believing that New Vegas is better and generally comparing it to FO3 a lot.First of all we'll have to go over some pros for Fallout: New Vegas Fallout: New Vegas Pros  Improved Gameplay Mechanics: One of the biggest improvements over FO3 is the improved mechanics such as the widely improved crafting system, the weapon modification system, ironsights, nerfed VATS, gambling, and etc. Improved Character System Mechanics: Faction system, better karma system, almost no essential (unkillable) characters, hardcore mode Branching Storylines: One awesome addition was the branching storylines (I'll cover the FO3 storyline later) one great thing about the branching storylines was the replayability, I'm about the do my 4th playthrough of the game, the factions you could choose from are the  New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, Mr. House, and Independant Vegas.  Modding: The game itself is amazing, and mods just make it more enjoyable, fix bugs, or add more content, it's all there within the Fallout: New Vegas modding community. Fallout: New Vegas Cons  Bugs: FO:NV, just like any other Fallout game, or Bethesda games for that matter, are plagued with bugs. Whether it's clipping into the ground, mission glitches that make them uncompletable, or missing textures, even though a mod has probably been made or a guide that can be found with a quick Google search. Similarities: One problem I had when first playing is how it was too much was similar with Fallout 3 such as the user interface and it just felt like a Fallout 3 reskin at first. Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 Comparisons  World Design: I personally like the vibe that FO3 gives off more than FO:NV, while New Vegas gives off a ""humanity rebuilding"" feel, FO3 focuses on the apocalypse more and I personally like that about FO3, when I was gambling in casinos on the New Vegas strip it sometimes felt like a Las Vegas Simulator. Storyline: So this was my main gripe with Fallout 3, it's storyline, you would think I would have some choice, in Fallout: New Vegas there were 4 different storylines, all with different missions, and even side missions would affect the endings Fallout: New Vegas Verdict  9/10  ",135,4,1,11,13,1,6

												If you haven't been diagnosed with ADD prior to playing Fallout New Vegas, you definitely will be after playing it. There are so many places to explore, people to talk to, and things to do that it's difficult not to get distracted. But the game remains fun even when you happen to run off on some wild goose chase because the story flows so seamlessly. It never feels like you are on some irrelevant side mission. I love the stress-free freedom to do what you want, when you want to do it.The game left me in awe as to how intricate virtual worlds like this can be experienced in such stunning detail--definitely worth spending my time and energy. Its biggest disappointment is the inability to continue character development and exploration once the main quest is finished. You are forced to load an old save...			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Perhaps the greatest Fallout game, right up there with Fallout 2.Much better than Fallout 3. The game feels more alive and vibrant. I found a lot more of the towns and NPCs to be more memorable, and the DLC added a lot of fun and interesting things. (Some not so fun too.) There's a lot more feeling of choice and effects. Your companions are interesting and varied enough to have along most of the time.I still need to play through again before jumping into Fallout 4, and I look forward to trying new things in the game. It's worth playing again.			",158,26,2,25,8,3,28

												Difficult to say everything that needs to be said, so I'll start with the easiest thing. This is my favorite game. I thought that Morrowind or Fallout 3 would be very tough to surpass, hell even Elder Scolls Oblivion was a pretty comprehensive experience, but no, Fallout: New Vegas is a masterpiece of gaming. The core game is great, but when you add the DLC it really becomes a massively worthwhile experience. Lots of moral choices, lots of options in how you can approach the combat, plenty of customization, single player even lets you recruit companions and equip them as need be. The settings are masterfully done, and have plenty of variation. Some stuff can plain creep you out, and some can make you want to just stand for a few minutes and take it in.  If you want a fulfilling experience get this game and play through it. There are enough endings and your actions carry over through even the DLC, so its easy to play 10 times through and have just as many final conclusions that are distinct from each other.

												Fallout: New Vegas is easily and undeniably one of the single greatest games of all time (at least in my opinion). From the moment Ron Perlman mutters the simple opening line to the point in which you look back upon all that you have accomplished before your final decision at Hoover Dam, you experience a world filled with colorful landmarks and memorable people. On the surface, the game and its world seem crude, dirty, and vulgar but once that surface is cracked and you look inwards, you see an arrangement of mysteries and philosophies all waiting to be explored and experienced. Unfortunately, nothing can be perfect, every shining jewel is tarnished in some way or another- and in the case of New Vegas? The game is broken and unstable. You can not spend an hour in the game without experiencing the consequenses of an incredibly low budget and a development time of less than 2 years. Clipping issues, assets becoming distorted, quests not allowing you to progress, and so on. Not to mention the crashing. The game has some of the most insufferable crashes, often forcing you to sign out or restart your PC entirely. The final drawback of the game is its graphics. The game is ugly. It recieved no enhancement over Fallout 3. In fact, a noticeable percentage of assets and textures are borrowed directly from its predecessor. Of course all of these problems listed can be fixed with one simple method: mods. As one of the most heavily modded games of all time, its very difficult to run out of content, whether it be vanilla or added in at your discretion. Six years later and I still play this game regularly, and I'm hoping that Obsidian is given one more chance at the helm of the Fallout franchise.(Oct 2016) Nvidia and Windows have made this game absolutely unplayable. Can't even load a save, the game just automatically crashes. Thanks for the memories, New Vegas. We will never forget you			",267,68,3,32,39,3,36

												One of the Best Apolalyptic RPG games out thereStory 9/10Gamplay 9/10Replayable 10/10Achievement 7/10Fallout New Vegas is the fourth installment to the Fallout franchise. This game is a big step up from the previous game Fallout 3, one of my all time favourite games. It added more of a survival aspect and weapon upgrading to the already ideal nuclear apolalyptic world of Fallout. It seems that Bethesda wanted to take this game into more of a cowboy feel to it and  move away from the big city and the Brotherhood of Steel heavy power armour to the deserted Mojave wasteland with the NCR soldier look and The Legion Roman battle armour. Adding new and old weapons to aid on your journeybut still keeping the same look and style of Fallout 3. This game uses idea and references from the previous game studio Blackisle Studios plan for their Fallout 3 before Bethesda rebooted the franchise with more of a first person shooter.The story can be told in many ways and the actions that you take on your journey as the courier, the choices that you make truly make your character to survive the wasteland.At this time the game is easy and cheap to buy the game and all the DLCs and not break the bank but adding more whispers in the wind of the Mojave wasteland from the  science labs of Big Mountain to the cloud ridden get away Sierra Madre to the forgotten Divine, or to travel to an untouched land where the trees are green.I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the idea of apocalyptic worlds where you are the creator of your free will.Cause.War, War Never Changes.

												This game is great, but it also has many, MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES. Pros: - Good Story - Many Quests, a lot more than Fallout 3 - Great Weapon Variety -  Good and bad voice acting - Many Followers - References to the previous fallout games - The best dlc's i have ever played - Many different paths and factions to follow - Great locations and level design  Cons: - Bugs, frequent crashing, glitches - Terrible Gunplay, you will probably rely on vats for many battles - Bad Graphics, terrible for 2010 - Character Creation is lackluster, your character will most likely not look like you  I know i probably missed many things about this game, but this is what i came up with. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the fallout series and the dev and published Bethesda, then this is a must have game. If you enjoy western rpg's there is no better developer and publisher, however this is developed by Obsidion, and is made in a different sort of mood than Fallout 3. This game is bright and interesting. Fallout 3 can be interesting, but it is most often dark and gloomy. This is great game that anyone who enjoys rpg's should buy.			",121,5,1,11,6,0,7

												First review in quite some time, but I'll keep it more short and simple.This time, Fallout: New Vegas!Holy S#!% I love this game. The Fallout franshise has ceased to dissapoint me. However, New Vegas has to be my favorite. I just don't know, the characters and amount of content are just plain baffling to me. I spent HOURS trying to ally the Boomers and Brotherhood of Steel. I put my all into saving Goodsprings and Novac. It's just that these characters are great to love, like the King or Benny.  Graphics in this game are pretty alright too. My laptop set the game to medium, so I didn't really experiece the fullness of the detail, but it still looks great.Although there are several bugs, I haven't found anything gamebreaking, and that's just normal in a game.Fallout: New Vegas is possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and you may love it too.I totally recommend this masterpeice.9/10-Dynamic			",78,6,0,6,4,2,1

												I ♥ the post-apocalyptic vegas style, with the grimy feel of what once were grand buildings, casinos and neon lit streets overlooking a vast, scarce and dangerous wasteland, full of weird and sometimes wonderful things.Customise and create how *you* want to play by altering perks, skills and attributes from the beginning and developing whilst levelling up. Shun or gain respect with different factions and choose a path of destiny with the bigger factions that play core roles in the main storyline. The game is not really too difficult in normal mode but I enjoy playing this game in hardcore mode because it adds more realism to the gameplay, where carrying ammo is counted as weight, injuries take time to heal and ensuring to keep tabs on eating, drinking and sleeping enough.The battle system uses VATS, a targetting system that is entertaining to use if  zoned in on an enemy and they happen to have the weirdest expression or pose at the time!What really creates Fallout is the psychological dialogue of the characters encountered, giving clues to a history or a side-story in the background. Some of the characters are so quirky and memorable that it made me gain a thirst for knowledge about the fallout world. I think you will ♥ this game if you enjoy a combination of RPG, FPS, exploration. Plus there is a lot of DLC to dig into along with completing the main story and exploring all of the wasteland.Overall, this is one of my most loved games and I have to recommend it as one of the best games I have played, not just for the gameplay but simply for the character and role customisation that has been presented as an adventure. ♥			",936,446,28,144,88,3,138

Fallout: New Vegas is a Post-Apocalyptic RPG that is a great change from common Fantasy-Themed RPGsIn the game you play as a courier about 200 years in the future where america has been turned into a Post-Apocalyptic radioactive wasteland by a war with China in 2077. Small towns dot the lands, while remnants of large cities are ridden with bloodthirsty junkies and criminals. While there is so much danger in the world, there is one gem that sticks out and attracts wealthier people from all around: New Vegas. A city protected by a mysterious overseer called ""Mr. House"", New vegas contains gambling just as much as dirty criminals and squatters.You were delivering a package for the Mojave express when you were shot in the head and buried alive by scheming businessman and had your package stolen. You wake up in Goodsprings, a quaint town on the very outskirts of New vegas. The doctor patches you up and sends you on your way. Your Mission: find the man who tried to kill you and get revenge. On your way, you may be having to decide the fate of New Vegas, and maybe, the world.The Pros:The gameplay stays true to regular RPGs, with a balanced level system but a low cap at level 30. The game is easy to get used to and does have a more challenging mode for when you become a veteran at the game. Hardcore Mode is a mode that increases the difficulty of the game by giving ammo weight and adding hunger, thirst and the possibility of sleep deprivation. I dont reccomend playing on this mode on your first playthrough, but is a fun twist on the traditional game. The arsenal of guns is truly AMAZING, some obtainable through with expensive purchases while others you may have to do some hunting for. there are a large variety of locations in the game and there is even more if you buy the DLCs. All of them are great in my opinion but you may want to pick up lonesome road and old world blues before any of the others. Both give you interesting new areas to explore and cool storylines (lonesome road is a direct continuation of the story!) and maybe up to 10 hours each of additional gameplay. The game also has an INSANE amount of mods and a great mod community. Head over to the Fallout New Vegas Nexus for most mods.The Cons:The Graphics are a little dated since it uses the same engine as Fallout 3. The Game also does have a long tutorial period for learning the game, Which can almost stop you from replaying the game a third or fourth time. The ""Dead Money"" DLC is absolutely horrible, full of ugly puzzles which make you feel like you're not even playing Fallout, More like a horrible and buggy indie stealth-puzzler. The vanilla game is also buggy, some that can even stop you from progressing in the game.Despite these cons, Fallout NV is a great Shooter-RPG to pick up, and a cheap one at that! I give it an 8/10.

												""The New California Republic needs YOU strong!  Do not eat irradiated food!""Having played through Fallout 3 twice over the course of the past half of a decade, I was looking forward to giving Fallout: New Vegas a go but I always seemed to forget that it was in my library when I was choosing what my next 'main game' was going to be.  Finally, with the announcement of Fallout 4 being released in the near future, I pulled it together and started it up with the goal of completing it before the new release.  I was not disappointed.Fallout: New Vegas feels like a standalone expansion to Fallout 3.  However, this particular standalone expansion brings so much to the game that it may as well have had a 4 slapped onto the end of the title.  The roleplaying aspect is drastically improved with a faction alignment system, a balancing of the skills (all of them are extremely useful throughout the game now), and an incredible and deep storyline that alters the world and the ending based on choices that you have made throughout the game.  As opposed to saying that I enjoyed the story as I did in Fallout 3, New Vegas pulled me in and didn't let go until I'd finished the game in its entirety.The more action-FPS aspect of the game was significantly improved in this iteration as well.  Fighting outside of VATS seemed much smoother this time around and was genuinely enjoyable as opposed to merely acceptable.  Crafting was completely overhauled with several different skill lines unlocking hundreds of recipes that were invaluable at differing stages of the game.  The lands around New Vegas were a blast to explore and seemed packed full of life from one side of the map to the other.  Every trip I took across the wasteland resulted in discovering a new location to explore, a caravan being ambushed by the dreaded Caesar's Legion, or any number of other events that were a breath of life in the world.A great game, and one of my favorites now, that I highly recommend to RPG, FPS, and Post-Apocalyptic fans.

												Has some issues. Read the update below.ORIGINAL POST:Great game until it stopped working. I'm not sure if Windows 10 updates caused it but the game is useless now. The game loads to the main menu but crashes when I select continue or new game. A window pops up that says the game has stopped working. Bummer.UPDATE:With an outdated driver installed this game works again. It is a great game if you're willing rollback your driver anytime you want to play it. A spicy ravioli dropped some knowledge on me to use 368.81 nvidia driver and my particular problem was solved.			",21,0,0,4,1,0,2

												Orth, 3000 years in the future. The planet is a radioactive wasteland inhabited by ska-criminals, sentient rat mutants, and Fearum's deadly Waster clan. The Daybringer is the proxy agent for extrasolarian reverse-aging gas-cloud lifeforms which intend on re-arranging the events of all timelines so that only one timeline remains, freeing up valuable multiverse real estate. Jack and Jill are the most advanced paired AIs ever conceived, on a mission to sift through memories and sort out where and when The Techno Device is. Dzang-Sarang is an extradimensional refugee hoping that the other half of his body shows up at some point. The ruthless Praetarch Unless has made a deal with The Daybringer to spare this timeline, but at what cost? Dr. Tuce Dopeshow is the only man who has a handle on what's going on but he's been dead for centuries. You are Abe Stahl, a salt-and-pepper haired grifter who just wants a root beer.

												(Already played over 100 hours of this game plus the DLC on Xbox 360)Still the best of the latest trio of Fallout games, Obsidian ""got"" what exactly makes a great Fallout game. With excellent writing, memorable characters and great locations, the Mojave desert is a joy to explore. Luckily most of the major bugs that were present at release have been ironed out, both in official and community patches.Also, if you play any of the DLC, make sure to check out Old World Blues. Fantastic piece of expansive content.New Vegas comes highly recommended from me to you if the Fallout universe appeals to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of people don't like this game as much as Fallout 3, but in my opinion I find New Vegas better than FO3. Like FO3, you explore a large wasteland and take on different quests, explore different locations, encounter different people/creatures/things trying to kill you, etc. I like New Vegas more because of its larger selection of weapons, cool DLC (My 2 favorites are Old World Blues and Lonesome Road) and a vibrant modding community that adds even more weapons, gear and the like. Also, there's a Hardcore mode where you really have to pay attention to your hunger, sleep and radiation levels, as well as not lug so much ammo around (ammo has weight in Hardcore mode).

												""Best game ever"" - Was my first review for this game but I have decided to write a little more because why not. This game was my life for a while. I play through 3 game disks on Xbox when it came out, then I bought it on Steam and played around 72 hours on it. It's an Open World RPG game and It is one of Bethesda's games, which if you have ever played any before you know that it will be a really good game. Very similar to Fallout 3 except not as much of a big game, but still lots of stuff to do and have fun with. Little bit of glitches now and then but for the most part (as long as your not climbing mountains lol) you'll be fine. Now go play it because it's great!And just so everyone knows Fallout 3 is very hard to run on modern PCs. It is quite old and will crash and glitch up and stuff like that, so I suggest you buy this one first and if you find a way to make Fallout 3 work then buy that one later. Hope this helped people :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have looked at this game in my review list for months, of all the titles in my back catalogue Fallout: New Vegas is by far the most daunting. I feel that regardless of to what extent I praise FNV, I will still not be doing it justice.Fallout as a series has grown from some seriously humble roots, and what it has become is one of the finest post-apocalyptic open world RPGs to date. The world is alive, desperate, detailed, immersive and a true wonder to explore. Within this incredible world are some of the most spectacularly realized NPCs and stories ever conceived by Bethesda. The last time I remember being so aware of the lives around me was when I first played Morrowind.As if the vanilla game wasn’t amazing enough, the modding community is seemingly limitless. From tower defense, to a first person shooter overhaul, to countless add on stories and scenarios, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of content to lose yourself in. The ultimate kicker here is that Fallout: New Vegas is CONSTANTLY on sale. And not just dinky 15% off specials, during any given steam sale, FNV is almost always on sale for 2 or 3 bucks at some point. At this price, it is absolutely ridiculous not to pick up this masterpiece RPG.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												If I had one word to describe this game I would choose Spectacular! A lot of people have criticized this game because it had a smaller map than Fallout 3, that is a terrible reason to talk badly about this game. Yes the map was smaller but the locations in the map were amazing. It was super fun to be able to explore all of the casinos. In quite a few of them you could even get your own room.Pros:One of the Best games of all time!Beautiful vegas setting!Lots of new weapons and combinations!Several different endings that you can choose!Only $10 retail and $2.50 during some sales!Cons:There aren't any unless the smaller map bothers you!All in all this is a 10/10 game and for only $10 it is literally a steal. Seriously no other game on steam with a retail price of $10 is this good! If you haven't played it you are missing out! ",179,31,4,17,17,1,14

												I really am in love with this game and the fallout series, just to put my bias out there. Pros:-Great storyline-Many likable and rather ""hateable"" characters that will manipulate your emotions and affect your choices-Karma and repuatation gives the game another layer, plays on your conscience constantly. -MASSIVE amount of weapons, armors, clothing, chems, ammunition variations, that can either give you an advantage or mess your day up!-Enemies' levels remain constant, so some areas may not always be comfortably accessed which really encourages you to level particular skills that may give you an advatage.-The wasteland is HUGE, maybe not as big as it was in Fallout 3, but it is big with many places to discover-Full nexus mod manager support, which gives this game so much more life; you can expand the selection of items, skills, perks, and game mechanics. Give the entire mojave a makeover, or implement zombies, the choice is yours! The modding community is very much active and helpful. Cons:-Game crashes. You will have a few, guaranteed. Not sure if there is a memory leak or not, the game does have a spike in RAM usage when loading new areas. I have 8GB and have not really had many issues at all. I personally only had crash issues related to mod usage. Friends' crash issues are with the vanilla game, do not know why. I think I can remedy any issues with a 16GB RAM upgrade. -Sometimes there will be bugs where you may not be able to access particular dialogue that will activate the next part of a quest, this has been rare in my experience and can only be remedied with a load to a previous save. So on that note, save often. -Without atmosphere mods (Neveda Skies is one of the best, also various ENBs are pretty cool) the vanilla atmosphere does not carry the same feeling as Fallout 3. I don't know if this was intentional, I get the impression that game-makers where trying to show an america where the world is very much accustomed to the new-world. -Not an issue for me, but the game can seem slow at times.Overall, this is an amazing experience that I recommend to anybody who has a little patience. The game gives the land of fallout, another breath of fresh air, which has been welcomed and embraced by many.Edit: Now have 16 gigs of RAM. No crashing issues what-so-ever.			",342,19,1,23,22,1,21

I recommend playing on hardcore to make the survival more realistic and also to download some graphics/performance mods via Fallout Nexus to make the game more beatifull, smoother and more epic.

												Wow this is a good game. This was my first fallout game and I loved it. Now that I play other ones I see how different they are. Like in Fallout 3 companions have karma requirements which sucks. The music is one of the best parts. The mojave is big and sometimes empty and desolate. But the music helps with that even if it is. You don't know how often me and one of my friends starts singing I've got spurs that Jingle Jangle Jingle... Another good thing is companions, I love all the different companions. my only complaint is that you could have had more at one time. Also good job on rex and not making another dogmeat, like somebody! (Fallout 4) The main part I love about the game is how good it is to explore. At the beginning you can just explore and find random things and places. But once you hit level 20 you can get the explorer perk and do some hardcore hunting of places. For the traits in the game all I ask of you is to get the wild wasteland traits. It really adds to the game so just do it. Also get Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition you get all the DLC's and it's just better. Also before buying it though check if it will play on your computers because some people say it won't, just fair warning. It may look like I don't have much time on it but that is because it doesn't count offline time.			",49,4,0,7,3,0,0

												The BEST fallout game. The quests, backstory of the characters, the lore are just great. The sheer amount of content with the great DLCs are just fantastic. One of the best PC rpgs out there. And that all for a budget price and low hardware requirements. What else would you want from a game?			",142,30,1,31,11,0,21

The choises you make in the game will depend on how it's going to end which I like. I recommend playing on hardcore to make the survival more realistic and also to download some graphics/performance mods via Fallout Nexus to make the game more beatifull, smoother and more epic.

												If I had one word to describe this game I would choose Spectacular! A lot of people have criticized this game because it had a smaller map than Fallout 3, that is a terrible reason to talk badly about this game. Yes the map was smaller but the locations in the map were amazing. It was super fun to be able to explore all of the casinos. In quite a few of them you could even get your own room.Pros:One of the Best games of all time!Beautiful vegas setting!Lots of new weapons and combinations!Several different endings that you can choose!Only $10 retail and $2.50 during some sales!Cons:There aren't any unless the smaller map bothers you!All in all this is a 10/10 game and for only $10 it is literally a steal. Seriously no other game on steam with a retail price of $10 is this good! If you haven't played it you are missing out! ",179,31,4,17,17,1,14

												I have looked at this game in my review list for months, of all the titles in my back catalogue Fallout: New Vegas is by far the most daunting. I feel that regardless of to what extent I praise FNV, I will still not be doing it justice.Fallout as a series has grown from some seriously humble roots, and what it has become is one of the finest post-apocalyptic open world RPGs to date. The world is alive, desperate, detailed, immersive and a true wonder to explore. Within this incredible world are some of the most spectacularly realized NPCs and stories ever conceived by Bethesda. The last time I remember being so aware of the lives around me was when I first played Morrowind.As if the vanilla game wasn’t amazing enough, the modding community is seemingly limitless. From tower defense, to a first person shooter overhaul, to countless add on stories and scenarios, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of content to lose yourself in. The ultimate kicker here is that Fallout: New Vegas is CONSTANTLY on sale. And not just dinky 15% off specials, during any given steam sale, FNV is almost always on sale for 2 or 3 bucks at some point. At this price, it is absolutely ridiculous not to pick up this masterpiece RPG.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												I really am in love with this game and the fallout series, just to put my bias out there. Pros:-Great storyline-Many likable and rather ""hateable"" characters that will manipulate your emotions and affect your choices-Karma and repuatation gives the game another layer, plays on your conscience constantly. -MASSIVE amount of weapons, armors, clothing, chems, ammunition variations, that can either give you an advantage or mess your day up!-Enemies' levels remain constant, so some areas may not always be comfortably accessed which really encourages you to level particular skills that may give you an advatage.-The wasteland is HUGE, maybe not as big as it was in Fallout 3, but it is big with many places to discover-Full nexus mod manager support, which gives this game so much more life; you can expand the selection of items, skills, perks, and game mechanics. Give the entire mojave a makeover, or implement zombies, the choice is yours! The modding community is very much active and helpful. Cons:-Game crashes. You will have a few, guaranteed. Not sure if there is a memory leak or not, the game does have a spike in RAM usage when loading new areas. I have 8GB and have not really had many issues at all. I personally only had crash issues related to mod usage. Friends' crash issues are with the vanilla game, do not know why. I think I can remedy any issues with a 16GB RAM upgrade. -Sometimes there will be bugs where you may not be able to access particular dialogue that will activate the next part of a quest, this has been rare in my experience and can only be remedied with a load to a previous save. So on that note, save often. -Without atmosphere mods (Neveda Skies is one of the best, also various ENBs are pretty cool) the vanilla atmosphere does not carry the same feeling as Fallout 3. I don't know if this was intentional, I get the impression that game-makers where trying to show an america where the world is very much accustomed to the new-world. -Not an issue for me, but the game can seem slow at times.Overall, this is an amazing experience that I recommend to anybody who has a little patience. The game gives the land of fallout, another breath of fresh air, which has been welcomed and embraced by many.Edit: Now have 16 gigs of RAM. No crashing issues what-so-ever.			",342,19,1,23,22,1,21

												Very few games have grabbed me the way this one does. There's just so much to do, and that's before you start dabbling in mods of which there are many excellent choices, no matter what it is you're looking for. Yes, there are bugs. But by now the majority of them are hammered out, at least in my experience. New Vegas Script Extender and New Vegas Anti-Crash are must-haves and greatly improve the game's stability. The key here is exploration. Put one foot in front of the other for a little while and you're bound to find something cool to get involved in, whether it's a hostage situation in a ruined city or a showdown in a little desert town. The combat is quite fun, but it's the standard fare. You have guns, there are guys over there and ♥♥♥♥ those guys. Speaking of guns, there's an assload of them. Pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, SMG's, sniper rifles and even energy weapons, though I myself prefer conventional firearms, the energy weapons are still pretty badass. The storytelling in this game is superb, with little details everywhere. The story of The Survivalist in Zion Canyon is amazing to read through and experience as you seek out his journal entries across the little hideaways he's established throughout the area. There's also the little things like finding a skeleton laying on a bathroom floor in a tophat clutching a revolver that makes you wonder just what that poor guy's story was. The game manages to be dark and hilarious at the same time which is a tough balancing act to pull off.Overall this game is excellent and will draw you in and not let go. You'll be stuck on this for hours and hours and you'll love every moment.9/10			",78,7,0,6,11,1,11

												So what do I personally think of  ""Fallout: New Vegas?""  Well, I think this is probably the best Fallout game I've ever played. Simply a masterpiece for the Fallout universe that fits so well, with a new main questline nearly totally different from Fallout 3. SPOILER, GO! ->  Except they both sorta still involve water at the end... Sorta.  With even some new creatures, and a new look at the way I saw Super Mutants, which in comparison to the once in D.C., they're just so... beautiful.  *Slow tear drop*  So if you like horror games, Fallout may just be your ticket to a few new scares from Cazzadors, Radscrops, or even Ghouls! Then you have NPC's. As there are hundreds of dumby NPC's like there are in every Fallout that lack every bit of social skill, there are a large amount of interesting characters with interesting names apart from ""Novac settler."" These characters with names such as Easy Pete, Mr. House, Ceaser, President Kimball, Boone, ED-E, and more are all unique. So every time you meet someone new in the game, expect a new personality to communicate with! Each one apart of a faction. Well, almost. But thats right! Because in this game there are loads of factions to choose from. Factions that each may just change the political map of the Mojave for the entire Fallout universe. Things you do have an impact on your character, the Mojave, factions, and just everyday Wastelanders. So if you wanna make it suck, you can probably do that. Wanna make it the next safe haven of happiness? Feel free! The choices are yours in this game. No need to really prepare for the future, because you're the one who shapes it here! Just be sure you're the proper level before hitting New Vegas. Especially do the same before you get any of the worth-while DLC as well. So for me, all of this just adds up to be my absolute favorite of the Fallout universe, since Fallout, to Fallout 3, and to now Fallout: New Vegas. *Cough* But still your average bugs of course. Pay no mind to them. *Cough* Note however this is all from past experiance on the PS3.			",43,13,0,11,6,0,6

												Everything about this game is great.Story: Good olde revenge story, everyone can get aboard that one.Tone: Correct use of everything to get into the mood of the game.Visual Style: Lends to the post-apocalyptic world, but it is all rather brown XD.Fun to play: Very, I've played this game to the end 4 times, bought the game 4 times (across different systems and as gifts), and played through all the DLC. (:D => x_x; Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Dead Money.)Gripe: Bugs, Bugs everywhere!			",14,0,0,3,6,0,2

												Fallout is one of those games that I have fallen in love with. I started with Fallout 3 and at first it fealt dull. Some people will say that they prefer 3 because of its bigger world and more of a wasteland type feel. But with Fallout 3 you get a poor story line, annoying amounts of travelling, and an overall empty experience. None the less. Fallout 3 is still an amazing game it just doesn't feel as energetic.With Fallout: New Vegas the world feels more alive. With massive amounts of weapons, armor, and mostly MODS. You can play this game for hours and hours. It's not the prettiest game, and it has some bugs but thats what makes Fallout what it is. If you want to try an RPG and don't want to spend tons of money. Pick this up. I got it in 2010 and still start it up every now and then.			",52,5,0,11,6,0,3

												THE GAMEwonderful. Truly amazing, I wish this wasn't so underrated, it is a classic, the characters are great, the plot is great, the gameplay? AMAZING its truly amazing and worth your money. THE TECHNICALSglitches, glitches, and glitches, occassionally it crashes, but it really is worth it.  sometimes it IS bland and sometimes it feels like it was a bit rushed. i think this game should have had much more play testing and and been development for at least 4 more months. the graphics are a little dated, especially now, and sometimes the actors did not put enough enthusiasm in their acting, but danny trejo, yuri lowenthal, and a few other big name actors fir the roles amazingly. i just hope this makes more people want to join the profession, because Yuri had too many roles. but he did good.THE PLOTit's an original and welcomed addition to the fallout franchise, in my personal opinion, it's better than FO3 in almost all aspects, as i mentioned earlier the acting beats FO3 and most AAA titles. but only for the time period. and it is kind of hard to actually talk about the plot without spoiling the experience.to me at least, this was a show well worth my money, and a gamble worth taking, Fallout: New Vegas, gets a 9.5/10 and Fallout 4, bring it on! :)			",32,2,0,8,1,0,0

												Best roleplaying game for me. If you like exploring and survival, this game is for you. Discover dozens of Pre-War buildings & places, find new settlements. Install great mods which will improve the game in every way, turn on Hardcore mode, don't forget to drink water and to eat, watch for Deathclaws and explore the Mojave Wasteland, read every paper you find and learn it's history bit by bit. Because it sure is an interesting place.			",229,44,4,16,15,0,11

												After the wide critical acclaim and finacial success of Bethesda's Fallout 3, it was only a matter of time before a follow up was to be produced. This follow up developed by Obsidian Entertainement would not only meet fan expectations across the board but raise the bar of quality and world building for Western RPG's as a genre. What makes New Vegas a great game compared to it's contempararies is the level of depth and thoughtfulness when it came to presenting it's setting. The people, towns, and factions are all handled incredibly realistically, to the extent where each settlement has it's own food source and way of income. Comparitively in Fallout 3, such details are completely glossed over, leaving some very impractical settlements scattered about the wasteland. Since this game uses the same engine as Fallout 3, Obsidian had the luxury of improving where they Bethesda left off. As a result, players have the ability to aim down the sight of their weapons, switch between different ammo types, weapon modding, companion quests/companion perks, and a hardcore mode which offers even more gameplay mechanics to the mix. Personally, I'd say my favorite aspect of New Vegas is the thriving mod community that continues to still produce more content on already 100 + hour experience.If you're into games that present world worth engaging yourself in as well a wealth of opportunities for player expression, then New Vegas is definitely worth the purchase. Easily one of the best games of last generation.			",155,18,1,15,7,1,12

												I have invested 271 hours of my life into this game at the time of me writing this ""review"" and I can tell you from personal experience that, unless you have a raging desire to finish anything you start immediately upon starting it, you will find yourself constantly distracted from the main story line by little quests that you think you will finish within a few minutes only to return to the story line 20 levels higher than you were when you left. This game will make you a murderous hoarder whose only desire is to find the most effective way to kill an innocent civilian with the weapon you just obtained from the previous civilian that you totally didn't murder. This game is filled with ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments from seeing a horde of ghouls in a dark sewer to meeting your first Deathclaw that just wants to hug you. You are able to join multiple factions in the game from the Boomers, a community of explosive-obsessed xenophobes, to Caesar's Legion, a society of slavers whose sole purpose is to merge all ""tribes"" of the wasteland into the Legion and control the wastes. Overall, this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing at consuming your life and you should really consider buying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout New Vegas.I've spent a LOT of time with this game, more than I want to admit to, but one thing that's always, ALWAYS persisted through out this wonderful experience is the life in it.Now prick up your ears 90's computer game fanboys; this game is MILES better than Fallout 2, not to say Fallout 2 isn't a good game. New Vegas is just better.In Fallout 2, there was always this, this thing, the feeling of danger, lurking over your shoulder, ready to pounce for the kill at any moment. And while some argue that's a good atmosphere for surviving a nuclear apocolypse, it just kills the feeling of life. Everything's dead. That Brahmin's dead, Johnny Von Whathisface is dead. You're dead.Not so with Fallout: New Vegas.True to it's real-life namesake, there IS that feeling of danger, of forbiddeness, but that's probably mostly due to the gambling. See, while there are many things in the Mojave that can kill you instantly (Deathclaws), and many things that can scare you (Deathclaws) and just things that downright make you feel all alone and helpless, without anyone to help you (Deathclaws), there is always that little glimmer of life, like the feeling of old world charm rushing through you as you climb that first hill in Goodsprings and see The Lucky 38 shining in the distance, you feel, for once, a little bit of hope, in a world without care.Ain't that a kick in the head?

												Let me start off by saying this, if you can't decide if you should get the game or not, buy it! It's worth every penny. I didn't expect to like this game as much as I do. I constantly tell myself that I'll do only one quest, yet that's very difficult to follow through with. I'll end up spending hours on end exploring new locations, doing side quests, and just being an awesome wasteland adventurer. Whether which path you choose, good, bad, NCR, legion, or whatever other choice there is (there's plenty), the game never fails to satisfy. There are so many amazing things about this game that will make you want to keep playing. I recommend doing what I did and buy Ultimate Edition because it will give you all of the great DLCs and extra packs for a very good price. It also will help you at the start of a new game. If you dont have Ultimate Edition though, it's all good. The game is just as great with or without it. The DLCs are amazing, but if you don't have them you'll enjoy the game just as much!PROS: Amazing story, ALOT of side quests, many places to explore, ALOT of replay value (many different ending outcomes), plenty of humor here and there, Amazing DLCs, and pretty much everything else!CONS: I can't think of any. o:You will most likely enjoy this game, I recommend that you play it sometime. 9.5/10			",56,2,3,2,1,0,2

												Great game! Tons of ways to customise your character at the start and even more customisation as you play through the game. No two playthroughs are a like which means you will be playing the game over and over again countless times.As a step up from Fallout 3, you now have iron sights that you can use, as well as a much more varied arsenal of weapons and ammunition types (even more true with the DLC gun runners aresenal).This is by far my favorite RPG shooter. If you get it, be sure to get all the DLC with it! It's worth it!			",78,9,2,25,15,1,17

												If the thought of a huge, open, post-apocalyptic wasteland full of interesting places, people and creatures appeals to you then you'll probably love this game.It's not without its flaws, however. It has more than its fair share of bugs but there are numerous mods and plug-ins and such that can be used to largely negate them. Speaking of mods, there are tons of them available and a lot of them are excellent.This is also the best scavenging and loot-hoarding game I've ever played, so if that kind of thing floats your boat then that's another plus.

												Fallout NV just one of those games that you can play forever (or untill you've killed everyone on the map).The main story and quests were awesome and interesting, but there're a few side-quests (''Beyond the beef'', ''Come fly with me'', ''I forgot to remember to forget'' etc. )  and DLC content that I've found far more interesting than the main story itself, especially the ""Lonesome road'', which in my opinion could be easily one of the main quests in the game. Also i really love the fact that some of  the DLC have some characters that're connected to other characters in other DLC's, and because of this fact the Mojave Westland and the people surviving in it becomes even more interesting world to explore. Oh, and how could i forget the fact that when you reach levels 30+ you're starting to feel like an indestructible war-machine that can do and destroy whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he want. and have a LOT of fun doing it.Fallout NV is jsut one of those games that just throw you into their world, and never let go.

												Good ol' Fallout New Vegas! Let me start off with saying, I love this game. Now I know quite a bit of people which prefer Fallout 3 for its more post apocalyptic feel and just being how fallout 3 was, however I prefer this game. Now, although I will admit I have never played the original Fallout 1 and 2, I do know a fair bit, and really am looking forward to playing them, and from what I know, if you want to continue off from where Fallout 2 ended, or just want to get into more of a lore feel, this game is for you, not putting down Fallout 3, but it wasn't near the location of fallout 2, making it a lot harder to continue on the growing factions and people like Fallout New Vegas did. But if you're just here for fun, add mods and it can double the fun a lot of the times. There are some downsides to this game however. There are some technical issues, stutter, crashing and etc, but when looking past all these, its a damn fine game. However this is just my oppinion.			",150,7,0,10,14,1,15

												The dark humor combined with a retro 50s vibe set in a futuristic world makes for a unique experience that's just waiting to be explored. Blowing off a Mutant's head with your Hunting Rifle while listening to your radio is throughly satisfying but be aware that this game isn't for everyone. If you've played Skyrim and are expecting more of the lively, beautiful and colorful landscapes of Tamriel in New Vegas, you're in for a disappointment. New Vegas is not pretty. It's run-down, gloomy, abandoned and depressing. But that's the point. You're supposed to feel isolated and feel out of place in the vast wasteland of Nevada. This is by no means, the game's con but rather, its pro. Obsidian nails the feeling of a post-apocalyptic world and the characters that fill this world is where New Vegas truly shines. You'll come across hundreds of NPCs, each with their own interesting, serious and often, hilarious backstories. It's these characters that bring the game and its story to life. On that note, the story is decent and keeps the game moving and depending on your choices, the game's ending will be affected. As a result, the game offers abundant replay value and can easily extend over 60 hours and counting (that's being really conservative).The choices you make aren't superficial like most games that advertise a ""choice system."" In New Vegas, your choices have hard consequences whether it's making a faction hate/like you or killing off an NPC. Yes, you can kill ANY character you see in the game (besides children, although there's a mod that allows you to kill children as well) so the choices are quite unlimited. Doing this can cause you to fail certain quests because a specific character is dead so you should probably think twice before letting someone bite the bullet. Graphically, New Vegas isn't that great. In some areas, it's actually pretty ugly with some sloppy textures and the vanilla models are pretty basic. The animations are a bit stiff and clunky as well. Other times, the game looks good and mods can do wonders for the game and completely change how the game looks, making for an even more immersive experience. However, New Vegas shouldn't be looked upon for its graphics. It should be judged by how much flexibility and options it gives to the player in terms of its characters and story. That's where most of the satisfaction is going to come from.If you're sitting on the fence for this game, go ahead and pick it up, especially when it's on sale. For it's occasional on-sale price tag of $2.49, this game is an absolute bargain. You may have to spend a couple of hours to really get into the game and enjoy it fully because I had to at first. But once I did, I couldn't put it down. Fallout: New Vegas is a really unprecedented experience and one that I feel many people should give a chance. I look forward to the next installment in the Fallout franchise.			",25,0,0,3,3,0,0

												I have never written a detailed game review. I have written lots of reviews, but their short and generic. I am so enamored by this game i am going to write a full reviewFYI, I have not beat the game, or havnt even really touched most of the places or characters or quests. But after 25 hours with so much to do, I feel I can accuratly review the game.Overall Impressions:If you don't want to read a very detailed review of the game, just read this. If you want a detailed review (although u shouldnt be reading reviews and be clicking that buy now button) scroll down a bit. First off, I have not played FO3, so I have no way to compair weather its a better game than that or not. I had heard about fallout and the mascot for me was easily recognizeable when it came out, but I never had much of an intrest in the game or rpgs. Fallout:NV came out and when my friend got it for Xbox 360, I watched some and it looked interesting, but i was into other games and didnt want to play it. last christmas, while it was on sale, I purchased skyrim, my first rpg taste. Now I realize skyrim isnt as much of an rpg as FO but it got my feet wet, and I loved the setting, being an insanly big Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones fan. However, i LOVE EFFING SKYRIM TO DEATH. That made me go wow! I bet Fallout is awesome if Skyrim is this good! So i saw it on sale over haloween and i picked it up along with the witcher, payday 2, dmc4. I played mostly pd2 and dmc and witcher and kinda forgot about FO:NV. However, when I did, I wasnt just hooked like i was 2 skyrim. This became the most fun, and overall meaningful game to my playing to date. All of the options are great, there are a lot of different factions all fighting and weaving in and out and picking some sids but not others is fun and challanging. I havn't touched hardcore mode yet but I bet its fun, I just want to focus on enjoying the game right now before I go shoot myself haha! Anways this game is amazing and a MUST OWN. Now onto specificsGameplay:+Many weapons+GORE+V.A.T.S. system is a great and not overpowered.-spritingThe gameplay itself is good, it feels good to shoot and the slight waver in your hand adds to the realism and I personally liked the added challenge. However, not being able to sprint, while not bad, can be annoying as I wish I could rush from cover to cover. I give gameplay 9/10Visuals:+Has moments of beauty+Destroyed wasteland is great and it all affects the mood of the game-runs on old engin so graphics look mostly outdated-character models look a bit stiff to meThis game is 4-5 years old and still looks good! However, it does look outdated and abovementioned stuff 7.5/10Story:+SO Many options+tons and tons of ways to progressTo me the story so far is great. Every faction is interesting and your personal story is very cool. The sidemissions IMO are better than main ones, but the main missions are great so thats saying something. 9.5/10Final verdict:9.5/10This is my favorite game of all time. That doesnt mean its a perfect 10. It has a lot of bugs and outdated models, but the game itself is what keeps me going. Anyway thanks for reading!HODOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			",37,1,0,3,1,0,1

												When New Vegas came out, late 2010, many billed it quick as a mere ""data disk"" of popular Fallout 3. Six years later, not only it vastly superceedes Fallout 3 in every aspect, but proves itself worthy even compared to brand new Fallout 4. The writing and choices are superb (usual masterwork by Avellone himself) and the feeling of being part of postapocaliptic Mojave is unsurpassed. I reccomend this heartfully, but please apply adequate modding (the plain vanilla experience is quite... jaggy).			",124,36,1,16,7,1,21

Now I know quite a bit of people which prefer Fallout 3 for its more post apocalyptic feel and just being how fallout 3 was, however I prefer this game. Now, although I will admit I have never played the original Fallout 1 and 2, I do know a fair bit, and really am looking forward to playing them, and from what I know, if you want to continue off from where Fallout 2 ended, or just want to get into more of a lore feel, this game is for you, not putting down Fallout 3, but it wasn't near the location of fallout 2, making it a lot harder to continue on the growing factions and people like Fallout New Vegas did. But if you're just here for fun, add mods and it can double the fun a lot of the times. There are some downsides to this game however. There are some technical issues, stutter, crashing and etc, but when looking past all these, its a damn fine game. However this is just my oppinion.			",150,7,0,10,14,1,15

												""Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter."" This game can be taken very seriously. It is perfect for role-playing. You can choose multiple major factions that can change the tides of the story, or you can join side factions that have a deep lore. The mechanics also help role-playing. You can upgrade specific aspects of your character that measure the skills of said character. The dialogue system is also very good. It gives you choices of good and bad. Whether you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or an angel, it is possible. The karma mechanic is a tried and true part of Fallout. ""Hungry? Thirsty? Horny? Come to the Atomic Wrangler."" This game can also be taken very non-seriously. There is hookers, gambling, and even sex robots. This game can be outrageous. Kill good springs. Join the Legion. Hack the world. Of course this path is harder, but it is leagues more fun. Overall, the game is 9.8/10. Might run into some glitches. ",124,12,1,15,8,2,4

												This is currently the Steam game I spent the most time with. It added some interesting new features compared to Fallout 3 like better companion management and crafting. The story is not bad and has a lot of references to the older Fallout games. First I did not really like the game's main factions (Cesar and his Legion, Mr. House and the Strip) because I thought they do not fit too well in the Fallout universe. But later in the game when you get some more background information it plays out well. As with most Obsidian games also this one has some bugs and glitches. In my case the game sometimes crashed while saving or loading which forced me to restart and reload. No save games were harmed though. All in all a good game which I recommend to all Fallout fans and everybody that likes to explore an interesting open world. Comparing it directly with its predecessor I have to say I liked Fallout 3 a little bit more though.			",2100,844,70,234,232,18,362

												I have recently finalized my third playthrough in Fallout: New Vegas. Despite having played other Fallout games in the past, I intend to write a (short and sweet) review that addresses New vegas in a fair manner, and hopefully while attempting to remain unbiased. Here it goes!General notesFirst and foremost, as far as Fallout game comparison goes, New Vegas did not bring a lot of renewing elements to the genre. However, New Vegas does offer a very solid story, an immersive world and a fun atmosphere to be in. Moreover, the world surrounding the player is quite vast. Game worldNew Vegas contains a variety of dungeons for questing, looting and satisfying the player's homicidal needs. These dungeons come in various forms and shapes such as Vaults, caves and buildings. Additionally, there are faction camps, towns and similar places, where the player mainly interacts with NPCs. Above all, I consider ""The Strip"" to be an absolutely terrific aspect of New Vegas. It's quite refreshing to visit The Strip and have a change of scenery after poking around the desert for a while.QuestingNew Vegas provides a large variety of quests that initially aid the player in getting familiarized with the game, the various factions and the implications of making certain choices. More quests and quest lines will be available as the player continues to discover new areas, NPCS and factions. In my experience, it is not possible to complete all available quests in a single playthrough. This is primarily caused by faction disputes and the implications of completing a quest for a certain faction. As a result, an opposing faction might regard you as an enemy, and thus no longer willing to make use of your ""services"".DLCsNew Vegas offers a decent number of DLCs that will keep you going for a while. These DLCs often introduce new areas, weapons, companions and relevant quest lines. BugsNew Vegas is quite a buggy game, probably the buggiest Fallout game I have encountered so far. Game sometimes crashes when attempting to fast travel in the main world. This happens very often in the DLC areas. I have encountered a fair share of bugs with the companions as well. Sometimes they get stuck in walls, doors and rocks, or sometimes they just completely disappear when entering a dungeon for example. GraphicsWith regard to graphics, there is not much to say about New Vegas. The game simply does not offer a state of the art experience for the graphics enthusiasts out there. However, certainly not displeasing and good enough to keep the player going.Final verdictNew Vegas is an absolutely terrific game that provides hours of pleasure for the player. It offers a great story, immersive game world and a fallout experience that far outweigh the current bugs and not so advanced Graphics in the game. I would certainly recommend this game to new players and the Fallout veterans.-Sean			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the wide critical acclaim and finacial success of Bethesda's Fallout 3, it was only a matter of time before a follow up was to be produced. This follow up developed by Obsidian Entertainement would not only meet fan expectations across the board but raise the bar of quality and world building for Western RPG's as a genre. What makes New Vegas a great game compared to it's contempararies is the level of depth and thoughtfulness when it came to presenting it's setting. The people, towns, and factions are all handled incredibly realistically, to the extent where each settlement has it's own food source and way of income. Comparitively in Fallout 3, such details are completely glossed over, leaving some very impractical settlements scattered about the wasteland. Since this game uses the same engine as Fallout 3, Obsidian had the luxury of improving where they Bethesda left off. As a result, players have the ability to aim down the sight of their weapons, switch between different ammo types, weapon modding, companion quests/companion perks, and a hardcore mode which offers even more gameplay mechanics to the mix. Personally, I'd say my favorite aspect of New Vegas is the thriving mod community that continues to still produce more content on already 100 + hour experience.If you're into games that present world worth engaging yourself in as well a wealth of opportunities for player expression, then New Vegas is definitely worth the purchase. Easily one of the best games of last generation.			",155,18,1,15,7,1,12

												If the thought of a huge, open, post-apocalyptic wasteland full of interesting places, people and creatures appeals to you then you'll probably love this game.It's not without its flaws, however. It has more than its fair share of bugs but there are numerous mods and plug-ins and such that can be used to largely negate them. Speaking of mods, there are tons of them available and a lot of them are excellent.This is also the best scavenging and loot-hoarding game I've ever played, so if that kind of thing floats your boat then that's another plus.

												Let me start off by saying this, if you can't decide if you should get the game or not, buy it! It's worth every penny. I didn't expect to like this game as much as I do. I constantly tell myself that I'll do only one quest, yet that's very difficult to follow through with. I'll end up spending hours on end exploring new locations, doing side quests, and just being an awesome wasteland adventurer. Whether which path you choose, good, bad, NCR, legion, or whatever other choice there is (there's plenty), the game never fails to satisfy. There are so many amazing things about this game that will make you want to keep playing. I recommend doing what I did and buy Ultimate Edition because it will give you all of the great DLCs and extra packs for a very good price. It also will help you at the start of a new game. If you dont have Ultimate Edition though, it's all good. The game is just as great with or without it. The DLCs are amazing, but if you don't have them you'll enjoy the game just as much!PROS: Amazing story, ALOT of side quests, many places to explore, ALOT of replay value (many different ending outcomes), plenty of humor here and there, Amazing DLCs, and pretty much everything else!CONS: I can't think of any. o:You will most likely enjoy this game, I recommend that you play it sometime. 9.5/10			",56,2,3,2,1,0,2

												I have never written a detailed game review. I have written lots of reviews, but their short and generic. I am so enamored by this game i am going to write a full reviewFYI, I have not beat the game, or havnt even really touched most of the places or characters or quests. But after 25 hours with so much to do, I feel I can accuratly review the game.Overall Impressions:If you don't want to read a very detailed review of the game, just read this. If you want a detailed review (although u shouldnt be reading reviews and be clicking that buy now button) scroll down a bit. First off, I have not played FO3, so I have no way to compair weather its a better game than that or not. I had heard about fallout and the mascot for me was easily recognizeable when it came out, but I never had much of an intrest in the game or rpgs. Fallout:NV came out and when my friend got it for Xbox 360, I watched some and it looked interesting, but i was into other games and didnt want to play it. last christmas, while it was on sale, I purchased skyrim, my first rpg taste. Now I realize skyrim isnt as much of an rpg as FO but it got my feet wet, and I loved the setting, being an insanly big Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones fan. However, i LOVE EFFING SKYRIM TO DEATH. That made me go wow! I bet Fallout is awesome if Skyrim is this good! So i saw it on sale over haloween and i picked it up along with the witcher, payday 2, dmc4. I played mostly pd2 and dmc and witcher and kinda forgot about FO:NV. However, when I did, I wasnt just hooked like i was 2 skyrim. This became the most fun, and overall meaningful game to my playing to date. All of the options are great, there are a lot of different factions all fighting and weaving in and out and picking some sids but not others is fun and challanging. I havn't touched hardcore mode yet but I bet its fun, I just want to focus on enjoying the game right now before I go shoot myself haha! Anways this game is amazing and a MUST OWN. Now onto specificsGameplay:+Many weapons+GORE+V.A.T.S. system is a great and not overpowered.-spritingThe gameplay itself is good, it feels good to shoot and the slight waver in your hand adds to the realism and I personally liked the added challenge. However, not being able to sprint, while not bad, can be annoying as I wish I could rush from cover to cover. I give gameplay 9/10Visuals:+Has moments of beauty+Destroyed wasteland is great and it all affects the mood of the game-runs on old engin so graphics look mostly outdated-character models look a bit stiff to meThis game is 4-5 years old and still looks good! However, it does look outdated and abovementioned stuff 7.5/10Story:+SO Many options+tons and tons of ways to progressTo me the story so far is great. Every faction is interesting and your personal story is very cool. The sidemissions IMO are better than main ones, but the main missions are great so thats saying something. 9.5/10Final verdict:9.5/10This is my favorite game of all time. That doesnt mean its a perfect 10. It has a lot of bugs and outdated models, but the game itself is what keeps me going. Anyway thanks for reading!HODOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			",37,1,0,3,1,0,1

												The dark humor combined with a retro 50s vibe set in a futuristic world makes for a unique experience that's just waiting to be explored. Blowing off a Mutant's head with your Hunting Rifle while listening to your radio is throughly satisfying but be aware that this game isn't for everyone. If you've played Skyrim and are expecting more of the lively, beautiful and colorful landscapes of Tamriel in New Vegas, you're in for a disappointment. New Vegas is not pretty. It's run-down, gloomy, abandoned and depressing. But that's the point. You're supposed to feel isolated and feel out of place in the vast wasteland of Nevada. This is by no means, the game's con but rather, its pro. Obsidian nails the feeling of a post-apocalyptic world and the characters that fill this world is where New Vegas truly shines. You'll come across hundreds of NPCs, each with their own interesting, serious and often, hilarious backstories. It's these characters that bring the game and its story to life. On that note, the story is decent and keeps the game moving and depending on your choices, the game's ending will be affected. As a result, the game offers abundant replay value and can easily extend over 60 hours and counting (that's being really conservative).The choices you make aren't superficial like most games that advertise a ""choice system."" In New Vegas, your choices have hard consequences whether it's making a faction hate/like you or killing off an NPC. Yes, you can kill ANY character you see in the game (besides children, although there's a mod that allows you to kill children as well) so the choices are quite unlimited. Doing this can cause you to fail certain quests because a specific character is dead so you should probably think twice before letting someone bite the bullet. Graphically, New Vegas isn't that great. In some areas, it's actually pretty ugly with some sloppy textures and the vanilla models are pretty basic. The animations are a bit stiff and clunky as well. Other times, the game looks good and mods can do wonders for the game and completely change how the game looks, making for an even more immersive experience. However, New Vegas shouldn't be looked upon for its graphics. It should be judged by how much flexibility and options it gives to the player in terms of its characters and story. That's where most of the satisfaction is going to come from.If you're sitting on the fence for this game, go ahead and pick it up, especially when it's on sale. For it's occasional on-sale price tag of $2.49, this game is an absolute bargain. You may have to spend a couple of hours to really get into the game and enjoy it fully because I had to at first. But once I did, I couldn't put it down. Fallout: New Vegas is a really unprecedented experience and one that I feel many people should give a chance. I look forward to the next installment in the Fallout franchise.			",25,0,0,3,3,0,0

												If you can get over the plentiful bugs, weak engine, and disgusting graphics, you will find a real treat. Departing from the traditional Fallout scene of 1950's cold-war-turned-hot retrofuturism, this strong western post-apocalyptic story starts with you getting shot in the head, and it gets worse from there. Not gonna get into the story, what I am gonna get into is how EVERY decision you make WILL affect the ending. If you look after your companions and help setllements, they will get happy endings that will bring tears to your eyes. If you don't, you will get a sour tale that will break your heart and make you want to try again. You can feel a real connection to everything, and it makes you want to explore and take different paths more and more.Don't even get me started on the DLC. They even connected that to the main story. You can ask chars in different DLC's what the think about the whole thing. So much detail and so many options are simply nonexistant these days.11/10. I mean it. Above and beyond. We will never get a Fallout game as good as this again.			",88,7,6,6,14,0,3

												When New Vegas came out, late 2010, many billed it quick as a mere ""data disk"" of popular Fallout 3. Six years later, not only it vastly superceedes Fallout 3 in every aspect, but proves itself worthy even compared to brand new Fallout 4. The writing and choices are superb (usual masterwork by Avellone himself) and the feeling of being part of postapocaliptic Mojave is unsurpassed. I reccomend this heartfully, but please apply adequate modding (the plain vanilla experience is quite... jaggy).			",124,36,1,16,7,1,21

												TL/DR: 9/10A different take on the franchise, New Vegas takes you into the west. One of the most appealing RPGs for a broad audience. If you play shooters, this game has alright shooting mechanics with true iron sights, unlike Bethesda's Fallout 3. If you like traditional RPGs, this is still a great addition with impactful dialogue trees and awestruck stories. You can side with three different main questlines, each with amazing characters and vibes. If you don't like the graphics, get some mods. Game can look better than Fallout 4 and still be 6 years old. If you don't like the vanilla weapons, armor, textures, npcs, voices, there are thousands of mods online that change just that with specific rifles and companion mods. The level-up system is very impactful, every single perk you can choose can bend the game. To name a few, you can be able to create ammunition out of broken weapons,  to repair a hunting rifle with a different rifle, and many more. I've sunk over 400 hours into this game and I can't say that about Fallout 4. This game is truly a masterpiece by Obsidian Entertainment and should set the bar for other RPGs. 9/10			",99,21,1,10,13,1,10

This is coming from someone who had trouble getting into the Fallout series for years: This game is a gateway drug to the series.I love the setting, the characters, and the plethora of interesting mods that have been out for the game for a long while now. You can choose to join a legion of Trump supporters...I mean dangerous barbarians bent on wiping out the new civilization around New Vegas, the new military which has broken and divided leadership but means well for the people....or you could just screw them both over and go the independent path. There are plenty of fun side quests and DLC that will give you hours of immersive entertainment.			",125,17,0,16,9,2,5

												One of my favorite games of all time. Love the fallout franchise. This game has great new add ons and mechanics that make it better than fallout 3. Such as hardcore mode for the real fallout gamer! Or aiming down sights, a better quest line, factions, Very good dialogue, etc.. Even though the feel of a post apocapliptic wasteland isnt as good as fallout 3 its still a great game. The modding on it is outstanding also. Highly recomend buying this at the steam store!

												Gran juego, muy parecido a fallout 3, pero mejorando sobretodo la historia y las decisiones dentro del juego, el hecho de haber tres bandos da una riqueza al juego que se nota. Los contras, se puede hacer muy pesado y como siempre en todo juego de bethesda, los ctd pueden llegar a desesperar. Terminado con la RNC, todavía me quedan con los otros dos bandos, pero eso en un futuro lejano, por ahora prefiero descansar.			",428,155,6,77,20,3,66

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game set in the Fallout Universe, with the Oblivion/Gamebryo engine. It is in full 3D and you can play in 1st or 3rd person. This is a deep RPG with plenty of moral choices, tons of weapons and equipment, lots of locations and side quests, as well as a main quest line with multiple solutions / choices, and tons of companions. You are the Courier, left for dead in a shallow grave in the middle of nowhere. You recovered and want to find out why they robbed you and why you were saved. You will end up exploring the Wastelands around New Vegas. The Fallout RPG system is in full effect, and the background is pretty amazing. There are also 4 DLCs that adds more quests, and when you're done with those, there are user-created mods available. This game is easily worth HUNDREDS of hours playing, more if you try out multiple characters with different specialities, and should not be missed.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Fallout New Vegas is yet another game about Skyrim with guns, but this one is different, and in a lot of good ways, the world created is a charming yet surprisingly deep land of politics and interesting characters all around.Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if a game is worth playing you usually don't want to read all that much.Positives- The story always seems to be moving forwards and never seems to slow down always introducing new and interesting characters to meet.- The art style is beautiful, the world in general is extremely bright and colourful and everything is outline with more of a red tone than most games, this helps to differentiate its style from the crowd and really makes it a pleasure to view.- The characters are all interesting and I always found myself wanting to learn more about them and their origins.- The relationship between Boone and his wife is great.Negatives- The relationship between Boone and his wife might turn off some viewers.- The 'shooting' dynamic is interesting in some areas but it does get rid of some of the tension from certain battles.- The game ends on an extreme cliffhanger- Sound was nothing special.I would recommend New Vegas to most people if only because it is extremely short at this stage, it won't take you long to power through the 30000 quests, however if you don't like cliffhangers you should definitely hold off on playing New Vegas			",152,13,1,5,8,0,14

												Fallout: New Vegas, oh boy where should I start? Probaly a short bit about the story.WARNING! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE GAME SPOILED DON'T READ BEYOND THIS POINT! The game takes places in the mohave wasteland, an area around the remains of las vegas after the great war. Your a courier on a mission to deliver a mysterious platinum chip to the city of New Vegas, but your stopped by a man called Benny and his crew. They want the chip your delivering, so they knock you out and ties your hands so you can't fight back. When you wake up you see Benny pointing his trusty gun at you and shoots you in the head twice, they leave you for dead but you get saved by a mysterious robot known as Victor and he takes you to doctor Mitchel in the town of Goodsprings. Now you'r on a journey through the mohave wasteland to take back the mysterious platinum chip and get revenge on the man who tried to kill you.               Pros:                    + Good Soundtrack On The Radio Stations                    + The Story Is Amazing                    + The Humor In Some Parts Of The Game Is Really Funny                    + You Can Mod The Game To Your Hearts Wishes                    + The Detail Put Into The Game Is Just Splendid                    + The Graphics, Its A Improvment From Fallout 3              Cons:                    - You Can't Really Sprint But There Are Mods For This That Adds It.                    - Companion Ai At Times Loves To Block Doorways Infront/Behind You. Well thats about it for me, for me this game will always beat fallout 4 story wise, and I would truly love to see obsidian entertainment make another fallout game like this one day. I give Fallout: New Vegas a 9.5/10, If your a fan of Bethesda games or just First Person RPG's This game is for you.			",117,3,1,6,1,2,0

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being forced to take part in a ""lottery"" by Caesar's Legion, viciously mauled by a literal pack of Deathclaws, swarmed by poisonous Cazadores, or being thrown off Hoover Dam. Fun!So take the superb writers and designers who were behind the original two Fallout games (who also did other great RPG's like Planescape: Torment and KOTOR 2) and mix it with the gameplay of Bethesda's Fallout 3. The result is a game that, at first, is a bit annoyingly linear, but opens up later once you eventually find your way into New Vegas itself. But you also get a game that is overflowing with sidequests, dark humor, and neat little bonuses found all over the world much as you would in Fallout 2. In fact, there is so much to do here I am not positive I've actually seen everything there is to see in this game despite having 100% completed it.Obsidian, of course, is a developer that is rather infamous for bugs in their games, and there are some to be found here as well. As usual, save early and save often just in case something breaks or crashes, but usually that won't happen too often. It will probably happen more if you fill this game with mods like I and many others love to do, but that's something you will have to accept because mods make this already great game even bigger and better.So if you like the Fallout series, you... probably have already played this, actually. If you haven't, then you should. Otherwise you too might find yourself digging a shallow grave in the middle of the Mojave desert. o_o			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

 Fallout: New Vegas  It is a production created by Obsidian Entertainment in partnership with Bethesda Softworks. And so it should remain. The game is set in the Mojave Wasteland, and  we play as a Courier who was shot and rescued by a local robot and doctor. New Vegas area are embraced by the war between the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar's Legion and the inhabitants of New Vegas. The story is great and our every choice matters at the end of our story. Sound system as in any Fallout is great, but the songs are often repeated and can be boring. Fallout is guided by that we do not have to do the main storyline at once, we can go off to explore the area. And there is a lot to explore, some of the locations it may be a simple hut but sometime it may be a large warehouse or vault with his own lore and quests. List of weapons is huge. From the usual guns after laser or plasma equipment. There are also melee weapons. Graphically, its do the trick but you can always improve it through NexusMods. The game besides the normal mode its also offers a hardcore mode. It is much harder than usual because the game change into a typical survival game. Our character must drink and eat in order to survive in this world. In my opinion this is one of the best productions I played. Finally a game where our choices are important not like in a Telltale games or new Fallout. That is why I highly recommend this production if you still have not played it. I spent many hours in it and have no regrets because I had a lot of fun.  Lonesome Road  This is one of the best additions to the game. I highly recommend it is incredibly atmospheric and character Courier Six is very intriguing. Also, the location is really well chosen.  Old World Blues  In this DLC move to the Big MT research crater. It offers a large map to explore, although the story is good gameplay itself is boring also we can get to this location by incident with a low level and you cant laave this location until you finish the DLC so beware of satellite and and do not click on it. :D  Honest Hearts  Welcome to the Zion Canyon area which is a war between tribes. The story od this DLC is good as well as the character of Joshua Graham is a really interesting person. Map is quite a big but most locations do not offer a lot of experience.  Dead Money  The least popular DLC for this game. I do not know why I personally liked. We come around in the Sierra Madre Casino totally helpless and without our equipment. The game most of the time based on an stealth due to tough opponents. The story is pretty cool and a little creepy. Gun Runners’ Arsenal  Regular addition offering new unique weapons and challenges. And that's it.  ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

 Fallout New Vegas: THE GAME THAT FALLOUT 3 SHOULD HAVE GOD-DAMN BEEN! Where, do I even start on this beauty of the game? I guess I should state that this game, has everything that Fallout 3 stripped from Fallout 2 and them some. This game just absolutely masterpiece that Fallout 3 failed to be. Yet we have Bethesda Fanboys thinking Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are the epitomy of gaming. (Seriously though, I don't mind if you like Fallout 3 and 4 but to be honest, I don't feel they are real Fallout games)Okay, this game improved the gunplay, by so much. Iron sights may not be much, but it sure does help when you are trying to shoot the thing with the biggest weapon or the biggest fists or the biggest pinchers. Not to mention, there are plenty of beautiful, powerful, and unique guns in this game PLUS plenty of actual Unique/Legendary weapons such as Maria, Esther, This Machine, Dinnerbell, Alien Blaster, AER14, etc. Also, all the guns handle greatly compare to the ones in Fallout 3 which had the spread of the circumference of Mars.How about the RPG elements? Well, let me assure you, this game actually has those AND has plenty of choices to make in the wasteland that effects who has a ♥♥♥♥♥ier life. Plus, this game has plenty perks and traits that affect gameplay to the point of changing the Wasteland overall. Goodbye Fallout 3's Daddy's Girl (+5 to Science, +5 to Medicine) and say hello to Cowboy (Increased damage to western themed weapons such as repeaters, revolvers, knifes, dynamite, and more.) Did I also mention you can flirt with a gay and gorgeous scientist name Arcade Gannon? (Of course, that's only if you are into that kind of thing.) New Vegas, is also, a more direct continuation off of Fallout 1 and 2 as New Vegas has many of the elements and ideas that Van Buren (the original and cancelled Fallout 3) had.The environment this time around however, is kind of boring. Aside from the town's and settlements, the game should just be desert simulator. Places like New Vegas, Primm, Goodsprings, The Fort, Hoover Dam, are all great but at that same time, the surrronding areas have very little to them to make them really unique and the game lacks that true post-apocolyptic feel that Fallout 3 managed to catch so wonderfully but the game explains why the whole Mojave Wasteland isn't a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Now, for the DLC's that come with this pack.Dead Money is a great idea, that was poorly executed. The game's crappy stealth and overall run and gun feel, makes Dead Money not so great. However, it's story and characters are great. The story is about how you and 3 others attempt to rob the Sierra Madre casino after being captured by a crazy old guy. I won't spoil anything because boy would I end up spoiling everything about this DLC. Aside from what I mentioned above the weapons are really good. The Automatic rifle (The WWII BAR) boasts a beautiful DPS and great feel to it. The Holorifle, is a quite different energy weapon that is pretty much a damage-over-time shotgun that fires slug holographic rounds at your enemies.Honest Hearts is probably the weakest DLC but is still good. Beautiful environment with a somewhat boring story but once again, great weapons. The story is this, 2 tribes are fighting over Zion National park, the Sorrows, and the White Legs. With the help the Dead Horses and 2 New Cannanites, they are able to hold Zion National Park. However, they can justt barely do this. You, who was involved in an accident involving a caravan, go and help, decide the fate of Zion. The weapons... Tommy Gun, M1911, Tomahawks, War Clubs. Enough said. Old World Blues is by far, the most outstanding DLC as it involves the long forgotten Big Mountian which houses the world's greatest minds. After the nukes fell, the never left Big MT and they lobotimized themselves to become robots. You are abducted by them and theyn forcibly lobotomized you. This DLC, addes plenty of amazing perks, weapons, and enemies to the mix in BIG MOUNTAIN! The place clearly feels ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! Robots everywhere and you are allowed all the weapons you can bring to fill them with holes or vaporize them. Let me just say, you will get plenty of new weapons that will help your build in some way. The dialouge and story, while crazyily stupid and comedic, can have it's momentsLonesome Road is the big finale. Journey into the  Capital Wasteland  Divide to find a mysterious character who just wants to talk. Or kill you. Or nuke your faction. Or steal your robro! Lonesome Road lacks in story and makes up for that in grand scale badassitude, weapons, and challenge. Let me just say you will be getting Flare Rocket Launchers, Shoulder Mounted Machine guns, and more and you are sure as hell going to need them against all those Deathclaws and Ghouls armed with the same weapons. Hope you enjoy playing as swiss cheese!New Vegas is amazing. Everything about it is just amazing. Better gunplay, better RPG elements, more interaction, a true choice to be Satan himself if you so please or the Messiah. New Vegas shows what can be done should Obsidian take control of the Fallout series.

 Fallout: New Vegas  It is a production created by Obsidian Entertainment in partnership with Bethesda Softworks. And so it should remain. The game is set in the Mojave Wasteland, and  we play as a Courier who was shot and rescued by a local robot and doctor. New Vegas area are embraced by the war between the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar's Legion and the inhabitants of New Vegas. The story is great and our every choice matters at the end of our story. Sound system as in any Fallout is great, but the songs are often repeated and can be boring. Fallout is guided by that we do not have to do the main storyline at once, we can go off to explore the area. And there is a lot to explore, some of the locations it may be a simple hut but sometime it may be a large warehouse or vault with his own lore and quests. List of weapons is huge. From the usual guns after laser or plasma equipment. There are also melee weapons. Graphically, its do the trick but you can always improve it through NexusMods. The game besides the normal mode its also offers a hardcore mode. It is much harder than usual because the game change into a typical survival game. Our character must drink and eat in order to survive in this world. In my opinion this is one of the best productions I played. Finally a game where our choices are important not like in a Telltale games or new Fallout. That is why I highly recommend this production if you still have not played it. I spent many hours in it and have no regrets because I had a lot of fun.  Lonesome Road  This is one of the best additions to the game. I highly recommend it is incredibly atmospheric and character Courier Six is very intriguing. Also, the location is really well chosen.  Old World Blues  In this DLC move to the Big MT research crater. It offers a large map to explore, although the story is good gameplay itself is boring also we can get to this location by incident with a low level and you cant laave this location until you finish the DLC so beware of satellite and and do not click on it. :D  Honest Hearts  Welcome to the Zion Canyon area which is a war between tribes. The story od this DLC is good as well as the character of Joshua Graham is a really interesting person. Map is quite a big but most locations do not offer a lot of experience.  Dead Money  The least popular DLC for this game. I do not know why I personally liked. We come around in the Sierra Madre Casino totally helpless and without our equipment. The game most of the time based on an stealth due to tough opponents. The story is pretty cool and a little creepy. Gun Runners’ Arsenal  Regular addition offering new unique weapons and challenges. And that's it.  ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Surprisingly, this game was heavily criticised by Fallout fans, for being no where near as big as Fallout 3. Personally, I think New Vegas is the better of the two, and here's why.New Vegas, whilst it isn't as large as Fallout 3, still packs an awful lot of content into it's self. Whilst most of the map is a barren landscape, New Vegas is FULL of hiden quests, items, easter eggs and just swarming with things to do.Whilst it doesn't add much new to the Fallout series, in no means does it feel like a Fallout 3 copy. The story is great, full of twists and turns and most importatnly, player options. You get to choose how you want the grand finale to go, wheter it's the easiest way or the hardest. After you complete the main Act's, you still have a ton of places to explore, quests to solve, and DLC to download!My only problem with this game, is linked quests. For example, to progress one Main Act quest, you must complete either a very long side quest, or various little side quests that usually offer no impact on the player or story. This is not a fun way to play, and it feels like the game is forcing these quests on me, rather than letting me have the freedom of choice, like the title the game holds dear to its self.+ Story is very interesting, player involvement heavily influences it+ Hundreds of hours of content, including 6 DLC expansions+ You really feel as if you make in impact in the game universe+ The Wild Wasteland perk. Nuff said.- Alot of grinding is required for some parts of the game- Enforced quests are not fun- AI is sometimes sloppy, but nothing too major9.5/10			",113,22,4,15,5,1,5

												If you're a newcomer to the Fallout series or someone who is a fan of old fashioned RPGs, I would highly recommend New Vegas. Not many games make you feel like your choices have weight and impact the world around you. Political factions are portrayed objectively, each having positives and negatives. The theming and light anachronisms really make the game feel like a topsy turvy wild adventure. The modding community is massive too, so you'll be able to have even more hours of fun with this one. All in all, one of my favorite games, and one of the best I've ever played. More quests and more fun than Fallout 3. Between the way that the developers utilized the engine's resources, the established lore, and the mechanics imposed by Bethesda, I think they did a near as perfect job as possible in making this game. 10/10			",228,57,1,24,37,1,20

												This is one of my favorite games on steam. I can't seem to decide which game is better this or Fallout 3.(EXCEPT THIS GAME HAS MORE REPLAY ABILITY) This games brings a lot to the playing field if you compare vanilla FO:NV to FO:3. New Vegas brings in the factions. You can be friendly with just about everyone to make the game easier but in being friends with say the NCR you are going to have to do alot that will  make the Legion mad at you. And factions play a huge role in whether or not you character is played the ""right way"" or wether it is not. For instance if you want to play a guns character NCR is probably the best way to go. If you want to play a meelee character I would say Legion. If you want to play an energy weapons character then I would say go with the Brotherhood of Steel/Independent(independent for the end of the game fighting the last part of the main quest on hoover dam with the robots on your side). Also this game doesn't bring back that many things from FO:3 its got some basic weapons but there are alot more guns to choose from making every playthrough unique. There is an endless possibility to the playstyles you can do, you can be a chem addict, you can be a justice fighter fighting off of your own moral code in a city of sin, you can be a mercanary, its endless. You can even choose to be the lone wanderer. Also karma doesn't really have that big of an appearance in this game. The only way it affects you is if (for example) your karma with the NCR is good they will be nice to you and they may let you do more things then if you were neutral, also some factions will give you free things with a good karma disposition to them. If you have a bad disposition to a faction then they will most likely make quests involving that faction much harder and they will probably try to shoot you in the face and once you get a bad disposition with them it is not an easy task to bring it back up. You have to do just about every quest with them for them to think ""this guys 'alright' I guess"" if you want it to go back up once its low. You will never really regain that sense of THIS GUY IS OUR SAVIOR. Also if you have good karma with a faction like the NCR then their rival, The Legion, Will not like you and they will hunt you down, this is both because the NCR will have yous fight the Legion, because you are just helkping the NCR and if you are wearing NCR armor. Now onto mods. There are many visual mods and gameplay mods and they add so many unique features. I would not reccomend a heavily modded game it tends to remove the Wasteland feel of the game. I would only reccomend asthetic mods and mods that do not affect game play unless you are using Project Navada. Gameplay affecting mods would be mods that add guns to the game or mods that make the geme ""harder"" or ""easier"", If you are having trouble doing a quest, press escape and navigate your way to the difficulty and turn the diffculty down. But dying is part of fallout and I would only reccomend this if you have died 5 or more times on the same objective. Also this game has Iron Sights, which I think is amazing. FO:3 only has a zoom that kept the crosshair and there weren't really any ""working"" mods that would add crosshairs, accept for RH_IronSights. And in FO:NV you can use crosshairs which make the gameplay so much more emersive. Also if you played FO:3 with the FOWE mod (fallout wonderers edition) then you should probably pick up fallout Nevada Project for fallout NV it will do just about everything that FOWE did. But I have a guideline that I like to follow for Fallout, If the mod you are downloading makes the game any easier, then don't get it. Trust me you will have more fun play this game casually with beauty mods and emersion mods. This just about concludes my review and recomendations for this game.*** REPLAY ABILITY LVL 100 SO MANY CLASSES MIX EM MATCH EM DO WHAT YOU WANT ITS GREAT SO MANY THINGS TO DO RUSH THE STORY OR DO ALL SIDE QUESTS GUNS OR MELEE LAZORS OR EXPLOSIONS ***I give it a solid 10 Nuka Cola's out of 10.Its like skyrim... with guns			",230,21,1,31,13,3,28

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												having played Fallout 3 (did everything to do in that game and it's DLC..yes even Anchorage..) and having a reasonable time,i decided to tackle New Vegas..i didn't expect it to be good since i had problems with 3 but i was gladly wrong,where Fallout 3 suffered The Elder Scrolls problem of having only 4 voice actors for everyone but important characters and (yes hate on me for it) a crap story which i couldn't get into,New Vegas fixes most of that,better voice acting,better music,better AI,ALOT of improvements when it comes to combat(Vats isn't as essential anymore because you can f*cking aim properly now instead of having the gun on the right of the screen -_-) melee combat is a bit on the weak side still it's better than 3's,diffrent ammo types also help for more diverse playstyles,it's in my honest opinion just a direct upgrade from 3,it does almost everything better,the only thing i would like to have seen is more buildings you could enter,a thing i loved doing in 3 because almost every building had it's own little story,New Vegas is also a bit smaller as 3 but with the introduction of factions and the fact that it's more of a ""safer"" place than the Capital Wasteland(and thank good the Brotherhood of Steel plays a small role..) makes sense i geuss,overall i just like it alot more than 3			",160,30,0,30,16,3,23

The sights of New Vegas while falling from the sky is amazing, though when changing the game to night mode, it's even better.I have yet to play the newer Fallout 2 or Fallout 3.

												Even after the release of Fallout 4, I still find myself coming back to this game.  This game is the best of the modern Fallout RPG's.  It improves upon some of the more lackluster elements of Fallout 3 by having some more interesting venues to explore and removing the annoying green tinge to everything in the Wasteland, but still keeps some of the best RPG mechanics of this game that Fallout 4 will do away with, such as the karma and reputation systems.  There's memorable characters and locales to be seen in this game, and it is well worth the price of admission.			",414,155,7,71,46,5,65

												Never before has a game made me feel so at home like Fallout New Vegas.  The atmosphere, design, story, combat, strategy, mechanics, etc. blend perfectly togther into a delectable post-apocolyptic RPG cocktail.  It is more family to me than my own damn family.  Sure, mom packed my school lunches, but Fallout threw me a duster that didn't make me look like a tool, a plasma rifle, and said ""Here, my son.  Have a form of aimbot that makes sense and still doesn't ruin the skill aspect of the game.""  Honestly, there are so few games out there that have the kind of planning this game does.  Wanna shoot that store owner to get his nice hat? Have fun not getting the one modification you need for a perfect weapon later on.  Wanna shoot up a city?  You better have saved, becuase half of the quests in the game are probably in there.  Literally every action has a reaction in this game -- it's tough, it's gritty, and I love it for that reason.  Not to mention how well a 1950's sci-fi action movie was dressed up to be embodied by lucky players like myself.  Not only this, but lasers and beams are just as effective as bullets and javelins; it's all up to the player to decide.  So do you love story and atmospher just as much as gratuituos violence?  Good, Bathesda has that.  It's called Fallout, and it loves its community as much as its community loves it back.			",614,143,35,67,68,6,74

												This is the game that Fallout 3 should have been.  Would that they had spent all the effort wasted on Fallout 3 on this game.Recommend running with Nexus Mod Manager:http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?Definitely add this mod:Project NevadaAnd set the difficulty UP!  :-)Removes food & water healing for starters.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/?Other mods I enjoyed (some of these are classed 'adult' on Nexus):World of Pain (adult - language)  More mobs in existing locations,  more locations. Adds an oddly out of place zone called the 'underground' that would be better off removed IMOI like the addition of more mobs, and some of the locations fit well in the game,  but others do not.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38719/?Warzones (adult - language) On and off map areas with huge pitched battles.Some of the battles are so huge it will cause your game to stutter and/or crash.  There is a setting in the mod do regulate the size of battles if this is a problem.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40980/?Fellout Alters world tint and lighting.  Night is *DARK*  be sure to use the night vison from Project Nevada.I like the idea of darker nights - it makes the night perk, and the night vision from PN useful.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34888/?Yams Pinup Parade Adds huge numbers of period posters, ads and pinups to the game in various places.You really need to add this mod,  it adds a ton of color and richness to the game.  It's much more than pinups.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/43341/?Lauren's Bathroom Poetry (adult? puerile, but funny)Adds permanent marker 'poetry' and 'wisdom' to public bathrooms across the wasteland.What public bathroom is complete without scrawlings from the shithouse poet?http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41961/?Wasteland Flora Overhaul More plants, trees & grass for a greener wasteland.Make Nevada look more like Nevada.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39856/?Pin-Up playing card decks! Adds a unique deck of 50's pinup playing cards for each casino.Well rendered.  Makes Caravan even more interesting.(Caravan is actually a fun game once you figure out the interface!)http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/43734/?Any mod that allows Bottling Water (the one I use is outdated and unavailable)Any mod that improves ammo breakdown and creation (the one I use is outdated and unavailable)Also take a look at New Vegas Bounties I & III enjoyed them,  but found the dialogue in 'I' overly verbose.  Full of surprises. They are *fully voiced* amateur mods.If you're interested,  msg me about a period 1.35Gb ~19hr background playlist complete with public service announcements and advertisements.

												A typical day in the Mojave wasteland - I woke up in my dirty matress and took a drink form the nearby radioactive pond where I had recently shot a bunch of legionaier soilders. After getting dressed in my power armour attitre I was abducted by robots and asked to stop another robot controling more robots. After being returned to the fleshy world I decided to help liberate a village from marauders return thier livestock and kill a traitor amist them after which I was rewared with a few pieces of massive cockroach and mutated rats♥♥♥♥♥♥ While nomming on my new found lunch, my stomach started to make strange noises, it was then I decieded to seek a docter about my unnatural levels of radiation. On my way to see the docter I stoped over in the nearest city to stock up on ammunion and repiar my equipment. Unfourtnaty the city had been taken over by bandits. After repeditive death after another, I managed to clear out the city allowing its inhabitants to atend to me and my new found partner. Finally, after hours of treking through the nuclear wasteland, I reached a docter who was willing to treat my radiation. Thats just an hour worth of gameplay :P			",60,3,0,5,5,0,1

												War.War never changes.Except we actually have a active world and we can aim weapons! Anyways, Fallout New Vegas is a shining example of open world. You want to go to a NCR area and try and kill the troops for armor and guns? Go ahead, just good luck doing that. Or will you rush a cave filled with hard enemies to get that powerful rare weapon? Also, hardcore mode makes it so you have to eat sleep and drink, and as such it is a much easier game to roleplay.The nexus mod manager (or fomm if you want) will quickly become your best friend (and enemy) after your first playthough, as you can install many mods with ease.My main gripe with this game is that it is so BADLY OPTIMISED.Like jesus christ, my computer is rather beefy (can run bf3 1080p maxed, and bf4 1080p on medium with above 60 fps) and it still chugs like a fat person at the bacon buffet, also the lag spikes and glitches are really bad too, as you can go from a solid 60 to 10 just by walking around sometimes. Also the glitches can be super annoying, like a vital NPC will not talk to you, or you knowGet stuck in a cliff?This may be because I filled my game with mods. Great game, get it.Also DLCs are pretty good, just not as good at fallout 3's (in my opinion anyway)			",91,5,2,8,4,0,2

												My only warning: This game has some bugs and will sometimes crash, it's also a little funny with steam overlay, but that's hardly an Issue.This game is awesome. I'm not going to tell you the whole storyline and what happens and all that stuff, I'm just going to say that this game is so much fun. Play time is extremely long, It took me a very long time to beat this game once. The DLC's are grand, even Dead Money. Okay, maybe not so much Dead Money, but the rest were great.

												Just perfect sandbox game. You can edit main story how you like it. It doesn't matter who you kill. If you would kill one missiongiver, you just loose that mission. Thers no stupid thing like ""GAME OVER!"" You can do what ever you like. You can have companions to help you hunt, complete missions and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ And those funny sidemissions, what you can find around Mojave Desert. Game has no limits!       There is thousands of mods too. Myself I use 24 diffrent mods. All of them are useful. Weapon mods, Cars, Helicopters, Companions, new areas, houses, bases, everything ! I even have god items like hammer of thor. You can make mods easily. If you buy this, I tell you that this is not waste of money ! Well.. It is if you are MW3 idiot who yells to TV, what I hope your not. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off; you don't need to play any of the other Fallout games to play this one. It's a fantastic standalone game that needs very little explanation: you're in a post-apocalyptic world where people are trying to pick up the pieces of the old world. You just got shot in the head after a botched courier job and find yourself being revived in the middle of the desert wasteland which you are going to explore in an FPS-perspective with a bunch of RPG-elements to make the game an overall fun and crazy experience.I'll keep it short, here we go:GOOD+ The mix of shooter and roleplaying game is almost perfect. Leveling up is fun and it feels great to explore all the possibilities. Which means: REPLAY VALUE. Yay!+ The world and enemies are interesting and fun. The western theme works surprisingly well and you'll definetly find some NPC's you'll fall in love with, while others you will definetly hate. Lots of personality going on!+ THE BEST DLC EVER. I'm not talking about a few extra weapons or missions, these are total expansions adding new things to every part of the game. Old World Blues being my definite favourite, but they're all worthy of purchase! This is how DLC should be done!+ Mods. Mods. Mods. The Modding community is great and they can give you almost unlimited ways to change your game for the better! (Or worse, if you really want that)NOT SO GOOD- Graphics aren't great, epecially on lower settings. Mods fix this, but the vanilla game just isn't very pretty. Visual glitches are quite common too, I suggest patching the game completely before playing.-  The game is huge, which means you will surely run into some bugs and glitches. Be sure to patch your game, but it might still have some stuff that annoys you, which breaks emersion.- Not the most immersive of RPG's, but your mileage may vary.- Friendly companions have the common problems of being suicidal and having bad pathfinding. They're interesting characters, but sadly not very usefull. (most of them)- Some features like crafting are basically useless aside from some specific missions. Unless you buy the DLC, they improve the use of crafting somewhat.So if you weren't sure wether you should buy this game or not, I say give it a try! It might have a few issues but there is A LOT to love about it. And if you're into modding your game, then this is another playground to go nuts in.I'll see you in the wasteland!			",52,9,0,8,3,2,5

												Wow, the big one. Okay, here we go. In the interest of being objective, I may be slightly biased with this review. I have loved many of the past Fallout games and it may colour my review.Fallout: New Vegas is the follow up to the critically acclaimed Fallout 3. It's history is long. It was originally Fallout 3 when it was going to be in the same style to Fallout 1 & 2. We are able to get the storys originally wanted in fallout 3 (Codenamed Van Buren) now, because many of the developers of Van Buren set up Obsidion Interactive. Now with the backstory out of the way, How does the game play?It runs on the Gamebryo engine and handles similar to fallout 3, with each weapon having a unique feel, sound and uses. The player moves at a reasonable speed, and nothing seems out of place in terms of controls.World spaceIn contrast to Fallout 3, the world is not very interesting on it's own. The story is where the game hits its stride.Speaking of StoryIt seems that this is the inverse to Fallout 3. FNV has amazing story, with sub-par world space. while F3 has sub-par story with amazing world space.Which to get, F3 or FNVAs a player of the original Fallout games, FNV hits the perfect spot between F2 and F3 for me. If you never played the original Fallout games, it is really just a coin toss. They go dirt cheep on sales so you don't lose much if you don't like one.Downloadable ContentFNV has an overall good selection of DLC, with Dead Money, Gun Runners Arsenal and Courier's Stash falling flat, but Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road and Old World Blues being some of the best I've ever played.

Mods will not only help make the game function better (bug fix mods are a must) but they help extend the life of the game for several playthroughs. Also, if you don't believe that this game has replay value, I have over 800 hours into this game on the PS3, and modding the game is only helping to make it better. I personally recomend you get Ultimate Edition, as the DLC is some of the best in a video game, period.			",82,4,0,15,8,2,15

												Wow, the big one. Okay, here we go. In the interest of being objective, I may be slightly biased with this review. I have loved many of the past Fallout games and it may colour my review.Fallout: New Vegas is the follow up to the critically acclaimed Fallout 3. It's history is long. It was originally Fallout 3 when it was going to be in the same style to Fallout 1 & 2. We are able to get the storys originally wanted in fallout 3 (Codenamed Van Buren) now, because many of the developers of Van Buren set up Obsidion Interactive. Now with the backstory out of the way, How does the game play?It runs on the Gamebryo engine and handles similar to fallout 3, with each weapon having a unique feel, sound and uses. The player moves at a reasonable speed, and nothing seems out of place in terms of controls.World spaceIn contrast to Fallout 3, the world is not very interesting on it's own. The story is where the game hits its stride.Speaking of StoryIt seems that this is the inverse to Fallout 3. FNV has amazing story, with sub-par world space. while F3 has sub-par story with amazing world space.Which to get, F3 or FNVAs a player of the original Fallout games, FNV hits the perfect spot between F2 and F3 for me. If you never played the original Fallout games, it is really just a coin toss. They go dirt cheep on sales so you don't lose much if you don't like one.Downloadable ContentFNV has an overall good selection of DLC, with Dead Money, Gun Runners Arsenal and Courier's Stash falling flat, but Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road and Old World Blues being some of the best I've ever played.

												I have been playing Fallout from part 3 and I did find Fallout NV something refreshing and not like the Vault Boy stereotype. New Vegas gave more enrichment to the game saga with info on the ""Brotherhood Out West"" and details on the origin of various wasteland species ( specific to NV though). The only change to the series is the change in possible endings - none of them, in my opinion, is quite satisfactory, yet not all that bad if you think about it. Possible spoiler: Fallout 3 fans love the Brotherhood of Steel of the Capital Wasteland and the possible extinction of the NV chapter of the BoS in the possible endings do not go down well. I am sure that is the bitter pill in all this even though both Chapters are quite different in their ideologies. The BoS in FNV is closest in comparison to th Capital Wasteland Outcasts.The new species and communites (including Jacobstown which is quite a good addition to the story if not very expansive towards storyline ) and the major factions trying to grab power in the Mojave forces the player to step carefully while choosing allies and making various decisions that affect the outcome of this story.The DLCs are...well...okay, I guess. Not very major or something to rave about but sits comfortably with the main storyline.The only reason why I have an isane 700+ hours in this game is because of the Fallout community and modding. Get yor character to play as Deadpool or the Terminator. Better yet - Chuck Norris! Have Mass Effect Cerebrus textured sentry bots. Heck, have your own pet Death Claw who can carry out a conversation with you or let him loose to rip your enemies to shreds. With modding, this game has taken off with a new lease of life. The only issue with the Fallout games is that they are quiet buggy and tend to freeze or just plain crash. For this there are mods and various solutions. Anyway, come what may, I am still a big fan of this series and recommend this game.			",556,196,38,78,70,2,52

												This game is as far as I am concerned an excellent game in the Fallout franchise and arguably my favorite in the series. The combat has not changed much since fallout 3, but that does not make it a bad game. The combat system is very rewarding and make for an interesting change of pace from most shooting games. The story has immersed me for hours with the personal stories every character has involving pain, suffering, and remorse. This has given me hours of enjoyment and equal amounts of horror at the stories of the wasteland. Also, you can still drink dirty water and do drugs that you find on the floor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Shot in the head, left for dead, and already a hand in the total demise of two pre-nuclear apocalypse towns, the Courier's got it cut out rough from the start.War, War Never ChangesIt's been just over two-hundred years since the world burned in the atomic fire of the Great War in late October, 2077. One-hundred twenty years since the Vault Dweller left V13. Thirty-nine years since the Chosen One was sent out to save Arroyo. Four since the Lone Wanderer left V101 in search of their father. 2281 is the year you are ambushed and shot in the head. Odd, it seems, for the simple delivery of a poker chip...You're the Courier. Courier Six, of six, a delivery runner for the Mojave Express. You're a nobody. You're a wastelander. You have no say. But now you're at the center of the oldest power struggle in Las Vegas, and a major player in the current war over Hoover Dam.And you're not about to let a little bullet kill you.- -Fallout New Vegas pulls back to the olden days of Fallout, before ugly Tactics, unmentionable Brotherhood of Steel, and quasi-decent Fallout 3. It's cowboy, it's retrofuturistic, it's got really silly humor in the cracks of apocalyptic deconstruction of modern politics.The game itself plays much like Fallout 3, or Oblivion, or even the newer Skyrim. Awkward menu screens, slow response at times, and an engine that'd make GoldSource weep. The worldspace isn't fantastic, but has some really neat sights and landmarks based off of real-world locations. The combat is also much improved on over Fallout 3 - no more standing around in one spot smashing the fire key, you've got to use tact (or hellfire movement) to keep combat from killing you. It gets way easy at high levels, though.However, New Vegas is more about story. It's actually got four different branches to the main ending, with a few dozen more side-quest endings! There are quests galore in this game, all hidden around the world and within certain factions. I still find new ones, and I'm on my fourth playthrough with upwards of 650 hours! (A waste, maybe, but it's actually gotten me to DRIVE to Vegas to see the sights)There's the NCR, who were in Fallout 2, and sort-of in the original. A democratic, California-based minicountry that is pushing Eastwards for land and profit. They're overstretched and are having no end to troubles, as are the locals, who often complain about NCR taxes.The Legion is next. Caesar's Legion. A military machine of 87 enslaved tribes built in the image of Rome's Empire. A dictatorship run by a previous Follower of the Apocalypse, Edward Sallow, now calling himself Caesar and nursing a brain tumor. Yeah, he's a bit off his gourd, and an egomaniac.Robert House is another faction. A pre-war business magnate and overall genius when it comes to mathematics, House entombed himself and Vegas, to sleep over the war, per-say. Really, it was a coma caused by software crashes when the Lucky 38 nuclear defense system was activated to save Vegas, which could've been avoided with a certain Platinum Chip.Then there's Yes Man, or the Independent faction. This one is especially interesting because, while playing much like House, it's by the player's own thoughts and feelings. Don't like the BoS? Blow 'em up! Or don't, if you like them.The whole plot is about the Courier, Courier Six of six, who were sent out with packages to Vegas, each holding some kind of playing piece. Six was holding the Platinum Chip, which House needed for his software upgrade. Benny and his goons, the Chairmen, want the chip for their own so they can take full power of the Strip. It gets much more split-off after that, and, well, getting shot in the face. Twice. Oh, and there's a war going on between the NCR and Legion over the power/water at Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, but that's a whole chunk of later story.You can decide a faction, though you might be swindled up by House, or NCR, or even Legion, depending on who you bump into and how they strike you. The game gives you plenty of time before mentioning a decision needing made, so you can play the first few quests of each faction safely.There's also the side quests, which are more often linked to small factions like the Brotherhood of Steel, the Followers of the Apocalypse, or maybe one of the few towns in-game, like Goodsprings, Novac, or Jacobstown. These make up the meat of the game, since you'll likely pass through each of them.You also get a decent array of unique, quest-involved companions to drag along. I think there's nine in all, and you can take one humanoid and one non-humanoid companion at a time. There's a dog and a robot who act as secondaries, and they actually have very well-done quests involved in their companionship. But a lot of the triggers for these quests are hidden, so be sure to take everybody everywhere, and listen to everything they say.On top of ALL OF THAT, you get to customize your own character and, left with minimal history to the Courier, decide who they are. The core of a good RPG, if you ask me. Even better than the original Fallouts, with their scary Albert and... that big guy... and, uhm... I only remember Albert. Sorry, Interplay, your characters weren't memorable.The SPECIAL stats remain in, and new perks/traits have arrived with New Vegas. There's so many, though, that I won't go too deeply into them. Just be sure to consider Wild Wasteland. It adds some comic relief to the post-nuclear political state of New Vegas.So, uh, yeah. I feel my playtime speaks for itself. If you like RPG/Shooters, with lots of time to kill, then New Vegas is a good one to get. It's old, now, but the modding community is active, and kept well alive by Gopher, the Skyrim mod guru, and AlChestBreach, the man who made New Vegas (not really, he's just some Long Islander who talks to himself in funny voices).New Vegas. 9/10, for glorious story telling, political simulation, a bad engine, and old ladies beating me up in an alley.

Thers no stupid thing like ""GAME OVER!"" You can do what ever you like. You can have companions to help you hunt, complete missions and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ And those funny sidemissions, what you can find around Mojave Desert. Game has no limits!       There is thousands of mods too. Myself I use 24 diffrent mods. All of them are useful. Weapon mods, Cars, Helicopters, Companions, new areas, houses, bases, everything ! I even have god items like hammer of thor. You can make mods easily. If you buy this, I tell you that this is not waste of money ! Well..

The story is where the game hits its stride.Speaking of StoryIt seems that this is the inverse to Fallout 3. FNV has amazing story, with sub-par world space. while F3 has sub-par story with amazing world space.Which to get, F3 or FNVAs a player of the original Fallout games, FNV hits the perfect spot between F2 and F3 for me. If you never played the original Fallout games, it is really just a coin toss. They go dirt cheep on sales so you don't lose much if you don't like one.Downloadable ContentFNV has an overall good selection of DLC, with Dead Money, Gun Runners Arsenal and Courier's Stash falling flat, but Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road and Old World Blues being some of the best I've ever played.

												Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3. This is the order I list these games on my list of  favorite fallout games. New Vegas is just as fun as the original Fallout games, the atmosphere and the feel brings back all the nostalgic love of the original two games. The Team over at Obsidian, some of the same people that worked on the original Fallout, did an excellent job and I hope they get a chance to work with Bethesda on another Fallout game in the future!I highly recommend this game to everyone that is a Fallout Fan, whether you are an old school Fallout fan from back in the day, or a newer fan that got started with Fallout 3.

												The Desert. The Heat.The Loneliness. It has been days since i saw anything alive. Water is running low. Sometimes I see a little shimmer in the distance. Sniper? Broke glass? Water? I can barely walk anymore. Fall on my knees and beg to God to end it. Someone is aproaching. What do i do? I decide to go to them. I can barely see anything and yell ""Hello"" after a short pause they answear ""RETRIBUTION"". F*cking Legion. Shoot them without even thinking. Loot their bodies, cut off their limbs, and set them on fire. Fast Travel to nearest town and sell their stuff. This is the last time I go realism.10/10 Nuked Fortification hill			",26,1,0,5,1,0,14

												Do I recommend Fallout: New Vegas? Yes. New Vegas is a great game, with lots of variety for anyone who is a fan of RPGs. However, get mods. Mods will not only help make the game function better (bug fix mods are a must) but they help extend the life of the game for several playthroughs. Also, if you don't believe that this game has replay value, I have over 800 hours into this game on the PS3, and modding the game is only helping to make it better. I personally recomend you get Ultimate Edition, as the DLC is some of the best in a video game, period.			",82,4,0,15,8,2,15

There is a setting in the mod do regulate the size of battles if this is a problem.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40980/?Fellout Alters world tint and lighting.  Night is *DARK*  be sure to use the night vison from Project Nevada.I like the idea of darker nights - it makes the night perk, and the night vision from PN useful.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34888/?Yams Pinup Parade Adds huge numbers of period posters, ads and pinups to the game in various places.You really need to add this mod,  it adds a ton of color and richness to the game.

												As one of the first, modern open-world RPGs I've been able to play in a LONG while, Fallout: New Vegas has got me hooked. As the first Fallout game I've ever owned and played, I guess I can't say too much about New Vegas in comparison to its predecessors, but I think the game is just amazing overall. So far, the main story is great, the combat is spread out and fun, and there's just a lot to do. I would say that a half of the time I've spent playing the game I've been exploring the landscape for loot and discovering new places that aren't on the map which then leads to new quests. Character development is also another enjoyable factor of the game I've found whether you're going with a stealthy, assassin like character or a full out explosives one. Much like what Bethesda did in Skyrim, all the choices are yours to make.Although I have played this game for quite a bit of time (some will probably disagree, like those with 400+), I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of this game. I'm looking forward to finishing it in the future and then eagerly waiting for Fallout 4's release9.5/10			",24,1,0,1,2,2,1

												Fallout:New Vegas (Fallout in general) is singleplayer RPG. Now here are the pros of buying this game.===========================================-Decent Graphics for the year it came out.-Only around 10€.-Very good Story.-Many cheap Dlcs.-The game has a lot of Side and Story Quests.-Many different Weapons/Armors/Companions and Places to discover.-No Health Regenration.Seriously this element that shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield have ruins managment and allows Players to win the game without any tactic.Thats one main reason why i love Team Fortress 2 or Counter Strike.-Much freedom. You decide when somebody dies.You decide when and  where to go.You decide who hates you and who not.You decide how the game will end.Its just like Postal 2 or Grand Theft Auto not like in Call of Duty where the Game decides when you go somewhere, who you kill and who hates you.==========================================Now like in every Video Game there are also Negative Sides but not to much.==========================================-Some Enemys or Companions have a horrible KI.-The Game crashed in 75 hours about 8 times.-The game has a couple of glitches and bugs.==========================================I give 9/10 Points.==========================================			",102,12,0,6,4,1,4

												At the start of this year, Fallout: New Vegas was hands-down the game I'd put more time into than any other, at least within the last ten years.  I'd put more than four hundred hours into the Xbox version over the course of several playthroughs.  After my time with the Xbox version, I would still hear the Mojave's siren call as I wandered the tundras of Skyrim, the streets of Columbia, the alleys of Dunwall, and many other fantastic places games took me.  Recently, I returned to walk the wastes as The Courier.  And according to Steam, I've put over 120 hours into my latest playthrough, all within a month's time.Given all this, I feel comfortable saying that I'm crazy about this game.  It isn't perfect.  It can be frustrating.  Even three years after its release, it's still a buggy mess at times.  Nonetheless, I love this game.My experiences aside: I'd encourage you to take a visit to the Mojave wastes.  Maybe our paths will cross along the Lonesome Road in a land beset by war.  And as we all know - war: war never changes.			",433,269,12,116,66,5,100

												Amazing game, anyone with money should own a copy. Takes all the amazing features from Fallout 3, adds in more amazing features plus a bug here and there = an amazing game where you meet a host of interesting characters with their own interesting stories and you just can't help but shoot them for their hat			",166,61,2,21,33,3,33

												Okay. So now that Fallout 4 has come out, I must say I am not dissapointed in it, having over 60 hours of play time so far. But with Fallout 4 having little to no RPG elements, I find myself going back to Fallout NV again, longing for the said RPG elements. Fallout: New Vegas is an amzing Open-World RPG made with interesting characters, unique areas to explore, free choices to be who you want to be and what factions you want to join. This game is a must buy if you love a RPG FPS with lots of free choice and lots of replayability. I would know- I have over 750 hours of Game Time for this game.Honestly, FNV is my favorite Game of All-time. Its my favorite Fallout game. Its my favorite RPG. Its my favorite shooter!You WILL have a fun time playing this. With 4 factions to choose from (NCR, Legion, Mr.House, Yes Man) and up to 12 different endings depending on choices made during the game, this is a fun freaking game. Mods and DLC expand upon this game EVEN MORE :DNow before someone says ""This review is new so this guy must be a bandwagon new Fallout player who is praising NV for its RPG elements"", I have played this game since 2011. I played it for years until Fallout 4 released, and I find myself going back to it. I am making this new review to overshadow my older, shorter one. This game is my baby. So many memories I have in this game.So please, if you must, buy this game. As a Fallout fan (I own all Fallout games ever, from Fallout 1 to 4) and a RPG lover, buy this beauty. It has aged SO well. Overall, Fallout: New Vegas is a 10/10 game. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed. I guarentee it. :]			",17,2,0,7,1,0,0

												(Keep in mind that this review isn't affected by mods, which add so much more to the game)STORY:Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in the year 2281, 200 years after a nuclear war with China devastated America, and in a post-apocalyptic version of Nevada, California, and Arizona. In Fallout: New Vegas, you play as the Courier, who is hired by a delivery service to transport a very important package across the Mojave Desert to the Las Vegas Strip. However, problems arise when your character is shot in the head and left for dead in the middle of the wasteland by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot and brought to a local doctor, the Courier goes back out into the arid wasteland to search for answers to questions such as, “Who tried to kill me?” and “What was in the package?”When first starting out, it can be a little intimidating, as you’re thrown into this huge world without any sense of direction or objective, except to find the package you were assaulted for. From there, you have to earn the trust of people just trying to live in a cruel, unforgiving place. Once you figure out what you’re doing, you embark on your quest of vengeance.The game really immerses you in the story, but doesn’t force it on you, so you can always have your own fun with the game. Also, this may be a little bit of a spoiler, but when you finish the story, you are told how your actions affected the future and some people you came across during your adventure. I would have to rate the story: 9/10.MUSIC:The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, but before that, in-game American society was fascinated with 50’s culture, so on the game’s radio stations, music from the 40’s, 50’s, and the 60’s and artists such as Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin plays. This music really adds to the environment because all of the buildings, features, landscape of the world were the same before the event that changed everything, just destroyed, so it’s nice to see that something from the old world survive for 200+ years. Also, the game features background music for intense situations, but I never really notice it that much. I would rate the music: 9/10.GAMEPLAY:Fallout: New Vegas plays like a regular RPG mixed with a FPS. In the beginning, you can select your SPECIAL stats, SPECIAL meaning Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. Based on which category you put your points into, your main skills will be different and you’ll be better at some things, but not others. For instance, if you put a lot of points into Agility, you’ll be able to draw and reload your weapon faster and your Guns skill level and your Sneak skill level will be increased. But, to put points into Agility, there will be a category that won’t have as many points in it. There is no way to get every category maxed out at first because the system is designed to make your character have strengths and weaknesses.Fallout: New Vegas has a combat system called V.A.T.S. You can use it to pause the battle and aim at a body part of an enemy to inflict serious damage. Doing this uses Action Points, which are used and then replenish over time, so that way you can’t use the system all the time.The game also has a karma and reputation system which both affect how NPCs react to you. The karma system is a system that reflects all the good and evil decisions you make in the game and how those decisions are perceived in the eyes of the NPCs you meet. You can be very good, good, neutral, evil, or very evil. It all depends on your decisions throughout the game. In New Vegas, the karma system doesn’t have as big of an effect as it did in other Fallout games. Instead, the reputation system has a more important place. The reputation system is a system that tracks how the many factions in the game feel about you and your actions. If you perform actions that benefit a group, you’ll gain Fame, but if you perform actions that harm a group, you’ll gain Infamy. Your reputation with a group is measurement of the balance of Fame and Infamy. If you’re more famous with a group, they can give you discounts from vendors, allow you to get into areas you otherwise you be able to get into, etc. If you’re more infamous, you can be shot on sight. Those aren’t all the significant gameplay features, but those are the best. I’d have to give the gameplay a 9/10 for the reputation system and SPECIAL system.GRAPHICS:For a game that came out in 2010, the graphics aren’t all that spectacular. The ground and the walls don't have many details, but the people you encounter look fine. The weapons and armor are pretty detailed, but most are grey, boring, and not fun to look at. The outside world is a big mix of browns, but that is a good thing due to the setting being post-apocalyptic, so everything would be discolored and dreary. The sky is blue mixed with blue with white clouds, so nothing special there. I’d rate the graphics: 7.5/10. CONTROLS:The controls in this game are not very complicated and it’s very neat that you can change buttons around so that way you can play in your own style. For instance, the default setting for the B (Xbox 360) is to activate the Pip-Boy, but I changed that to the right bumper. Other than that, there’s nothing special to say about the controls, it’s pretty standard FPS/RPG controls. I have to rate the controls: 9/10.There you have it, that’s my review of Fallout: New Vegas with a score of 8.7/10. The game is not perfect, but I definitely recommend it to people who haven’t checked it out and like RPGs. Thank you for reading!			",162,26,6,22,18,2,8

												You know.... I never played fallout before. I have 1 2 and tactics that i got on a bundle but i never sat down to play those because i simply could not get them. The one i played the most at the time was fallout shelter when it came out which was a nice distraction but nothing to get my attention all that much and when i saw fallout 4 i got interested on it but i just didn't care that much for it. One day however when i was chatting with a friend the subject of fallout came by and i told him that it wasn't something i cared that much and well, he said that i should at least try new vegas because it's the most ""newb friendly"" of the series so.. Naturally i said ""allright allright, bought the vanilla version of this game, played it and.... I still cannot put it down. This quickly became one of my top 3 favorite games of all times. The gigantic and expansive map, the characters, the fact that you can act in any way you want with everyone, you being able to do everything at your own leisure... I mean... Talk about a game where you can do whatever you want. I never played anything that gave me such a sensation of freedom before and this game delivered it and then some. I'm still playing it. Already beaten it twice and got all DLCs and played the heck out of them (Except Dead money... Honestly it just falls flat by taking away everything the game was providing so far.). Overall one of the best games to exist in my opnion and hell, it aged fantastically. So overall... Kudos. If you never played fallout before and want to pick it up... Start here. You're not going to regret it.			",70,14,0,9,1,0,2

												Great game! Albeit pretty much just an addon to Fallout 3, New Vegas heads back out west, towards the original Fallout game's roots. The story is great, and the characters are fantastic. I haven't spent this much time on a game besides maybe Halo 3, and Team Fortress 2. (I'm including my hours played on the Xbox 360 release too.)Definitely pick this up if you're into the entire ""Wasteland RPG"" thing. You'll fit right in.			",101,7,2,8,6,2,1

												This game is awesome.Fallout New Vegas really feels like the middle child between the firstborn (fallout 3) and the newest member of the family (Fallout 4).  Fallout 3 laid the foundation for what was to be expected from the next iterations in the series - a solid, well rounded achiever that was the first modern foray into an unexplored first person Fallout.  Being the first allowed it to carve out the series' baseline expectations; a fresh, interesting, and well received experience that introduced a number of new ideas. Fallout 4, the newest bundle of joy, is young, athletic, and good looking - trying to capture its attention from the audience on mostly looks alone, but lacking the depth of the firstborn.  It can run circles around the other two graphically and is good at sports, but spends too much time in front of the t.v.Fallout New Vegas, being the middle child, found its identity by studying hard at school and differentiating itself from the other siblings.  It added the deepest of the modern Fallout RPG elements and excelled in English class, with interesting well-written quests.  It also learned to do things that the firstborn couldn't, building on its foundation, but lacking the flair of the youngest of the family. It can't compete with Fallout 4's superior looks, but knows deep down it will eventually get the girls when they become bored and look for a deeper commitment.Pros;Great quests/faction interactionsRPG elements/perksImproved gunplaycharacterslength (the dlc is fantastic)16,000 + mods on the NexusCons:can be temperamental (glitch)Less emphasis on explorationgraphical fidelityFallout New Vegas is a must have if you enjoy RPG's.  It might have a few pimples, but it can hold a long, interesting conversation with you.  19.99 for the ultimate edition really is a steal, especially compared to what I spent on the original Xbox 360.

												This might be my favorite game of all time. Fun gameplay, excellent atmosphere, and Top-Notch story and role-playing experience. Yes, there are glitches and it hasn't aged all too well, but it still mostly holds up. And hey, there are TONS of mods to make the game prettier and more functional.A rare 10/10 game.

												Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3. This is the order I list these games on my list of  favorite fallout games. New Vegas is just as fun as the original Fallout games, the atmosphere and the feel brings back all the nostalgic love of the original two games. The Team over at Obsidian, some of the same people that worked on the original Fallout, did an excellent job and I hope they get a chance to work with Bethesda on another Fallout game in the future!I highly recommend this game to everyone that is a Fallout Fan, whether you are an old school Fallout fan from back in the day, or a newer fan that got started with Fallout 3.

												Fallout: Nev Vegas is a great RPG. The game has great combat mechanics, a perfect skill system (having a high skill in something can open up helpful conversation options), and good characters, as well as having the style and charm of the 1950s. The only real negitive is the graphics which aren't even good by 2010 standards. I give Fallout: New Vegas an 8/10.  ",13,0,0,2,3,0,1

												There is some debate over whether Fallout 4 was better than New Vegas, yet few can deny that New Vegas is a classic that still provides players with the post-apocalyptic RPG experience today, 7 years later.New Vegas is meticulously crafted, and the world and lore is immersive. Choices matter. Different people would prefer different endings and it really takes a lot of roleplay to decide which one you would prefer. In creating good and bad, the NCR might fight for the return of old world democracy, but come across as intrusively imperialist; the legion might come across as villanous brutes, but to a certain extent they would bring back order and stability, if you're willing to accept slavery as  a norm of society. House would bring about a benovolent dictatorship, and Independence really looks at the choices that you have made. Sub-factions are pre-determined if you follow NCR, Legion or House paths, but only in independence can you make your own decisions among them.Characters, especially the companions, were people with complex identities. Veronica reveals that she fell in love with a girl, but was frowned upon by the Brotherhood because it demands certain female roles; yet Arcade is openly homosexual and he's just going along, trying to find ways to do good in the wasteland, it brings to light the differing treatment of lgbt's (which Fallout is still opening up to, great!) but neither of their personal quests revolve around their sexuality, which is a genius approach to it; they're just who they are. Veronica is a vivacious, forward-thinker stuck in a conservative society that tells itself it will succeed because it has succeeded before with the old ways. Boone is associable because we've all made grave mistakes that we can't forgive ourselves for - but Boone takes it a step further, by blaming a big personal loss on fate catching up to him for a mistake that wasn't even his fault. You find him in Novac (a play on no vacancy) and it's almost as if he's juxtaposed to be living there as a purposeless wanderer because his past has consumed him so. Nightkin Lily takes prescribed medicine, which keeps her sane, but the medicine also causes her to forget her past life as a grandmother to two children. What you encourage her to do with her medicine also takes a lot of roleplaying and what you feel is best or right for her. Point is, these characters aren't stock characters. Hell, they're more interesting than the people I meet in real life, because I relate to them and in helping them through their personal quests you also come to understand yourself and what you value.Fallout New Vegas gives you a number of perks and skills to invest in, and they change the way a player goes through the game diversely. Female characters' Black Widow, for example, opens up special dialogue options when talking to male NPCs - creating rare opportunities to bypass longer processes. Speech 100 will get you through a lot in the name of fighting with words. Or you could just fight, with guns. 'It's a free wasteland.'Last but not least, I am hopelessly in love with the soundtrack, both orchestral and licensed. Music direction was good and it added to my immersion. It made wandering through the Mojave a little less lonely.I'm hoping, along with many others, that Obsidian will develop the new Fallout post Fallout 4, but this is the game that really piqued my interest in the series, and now I'm headed on to finish my collection.

												I'm on the verge deciding whether I like  Fallout 3 or Fallout NV more, for me they're on the same level. I'm going to make a short comparison:Fallout NV:- Less power armor focused- Strong wild-west theme (some like it some not)- Interesting characters, questline for every companion.- More things to do (like gambling etc.)- An amazing faction system, way better than FO3's karma.- Some of the best DLC's I've played in any game.FO3:- Real post-apocalyptic feeling.- Simpler-cleaner game mechanics- The main antagonists are much more strong and interesting- Less bugs (only for me?)- More interesting locations and landmarks- Creepier, more eerie than FONV.Anyway if you plan on buying the game buy the Ultimate/GOTY edition with all the dlc, it worth it. Just like with any Bethesda game, modding it is highly advised (not only to get rid of the numerous bugs, but to enhanced the gameplay and outdated visuals).			",536,176,15,92,64,7,96

If you don't have it, you should.All fun aside, it's classic Fallout, set in a cool world, full of loveable characters. I've really enjoyed my time so far. If you've played FO4 as your first taste of the series, and want something fresh, then FO:NV will satify your craving for more.			",57,3,0,8,2,0,1

												A classic game for a classic man.The land of the Mojave is incredibly ""colorful."" By that, I mean memorable. It's a mixture of suave 1940's-50's style finesse, and the dry, heated Hell of the Nuclear Desert. The characters you encounter are fun, dark, dry, deadly, and lovable all together. The combat, incredibly satisfiying as you aim, shoot, and watch as your opponent's head gets blown off. The combination of finesse, a great cast of characters, a mind-boggling arsenal at your disposal, and an entertaining story-arc will blow you away. Literally.Fallout: New Vegas truly is easily one of the best games I have ever played, and that's saying something.Traditional Rating: 3 out of 4.Personal Rating: ""Legendary.""			",52,6,1,10,9,0,9

												Now this is a game worthy of the Fallout title! Alot of people liked Fallout 3 alot better, and I'm actually not sure why. I LOVED New Vegas! Yes, the Mojave landscape is quite boring, but it brang back what we want to see in a Fallout game! Choice! About 90% of all the quests in New Vegas, have different endings, or at least different approaches to completing it. I was sucked into the world of New Vegas MUCH more then I was in Fallout 3. If you want a game where it's your choice how things play out, this is the game for you. Oh, and it still has the amazing range of weapons, items and quests we all love.			",169,31,0,16,16,1,9

												I don't think there are words that can accurately describe my love for this game, but I'll try anyway.Fallout: New Vegas was a game released in 2010. While Bethesda did publish the game, Obsidian developed the original product over the course of 18 months. Unlike Fallout 3 and 4, New Vegas takes place on the west coast, and is more in tune with the storylines of 1 and 2. New Vegas is ruled by an enigmatic, mysterious figure named Mr. House (think of him as the Walt Disney of Las Vegas) and the three tribes working under him - the Chairmen, the Omertas, and the White Glove Society.The game takes place about 4 years after the first battle of Hoover Dam, fought between the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion of Arizona. You play as a Courier working for the Mojave Express, assigned to deliver an item called the Platinum Chip to Mr. House. Along the way, you're ambushed by a men in a checkered coat and his group of Great Khan friends, who steal the chip and leave you for dead. Luckily, someone rescues you before you die, and you wake up in the clinic of a town called Goodsprings. This is a notable contrast between FNV and Fallout 3 and 4. While the latter two have a slower paced story, New Vegas basically puts you out into the world within five minutes.With the inclusion of all 4 major DLCs, your character's level cap will be 50 (unless you take a trait called Logan's Loophole, which will cap you at 30), and you're able to pick perks every other level. Skills from previous games such as Repair, Science, Speech and Barter are in New Vegas as well, and your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats actually matter. Entire quests, particularly ones in Freeside and North Vegas, can be completed with nothing but skillchecks. Additionally, many quests have optional solutions, some of which can be figured out by the player.Lastly, the DLCs of New Vegas, prior to their initial release, are and were heavily alluded to in the base game. As you run around the Mojave, you'll sometimes see and hear references to the Burned Man, Father Elijah, and the particularly vengeful man that set you on the course to deliver the Platinum Chip, to name a few. The DLCs themselves last for hours, and add major content to the game.In conclusion, Fallout New Vegas is an RPG done right. It provides the one thing Fallout 4 lacks: depth. It's an immersive game that grips players with fun gameplay and compelling story-telling.			",97,20,0,40,4,1,15

												Fallout: New Vegas™; a game everybody has their own, unexplored world in which to conquer, one quest at a time.You, as the main character, are a Courier, your job is to deliver a package to New Vegas; it is from the old world, a torned down, and rebuilt city that is a hubble of life, filled with many, many different opportunities that you get to explore. You are ultimately kidnapped by armed men, which you will get to know more about later in the story, and are shot in the head in a cementary outside of a small, un-disturbed town, known as Goodsprings. From here on out, you get to make your own decisions, and make a rebuttle of what is left of the Mojavé-Wasteland. This game is a huge advancement compared to it's predecessor, Fallout: 3™. The amount of gameplay added to this game, which, might I add, is much, much more defined in the sense that you're really there; you feel as if you know your friends, enemies, and places you've been to. The quests and DLC make a surgated wall that can support the main quests of this masterpiece; as in Fallout: 3™, they don't. Fallout: New Vegas™ adds many more intelligent AI with never-before-seen dialogue that you can fiddle with -- meaning that some of your perks and skills can actually change the way you play the game, if done correctly, that is..      Factions have always been a big-hit in this games overall franchise, and in this game, they really show you how they've completely re-fortified that way it was meant to be. They're not just a few, big ones in this game that are good and evil [Factions] that you only get to choose from one-or-so faction, but many of them. The three main factions in Fallout: New Vegas™ are the N.C.R., Caesar's Legion, and the Brotherhood of Steel. tl;drI highly suggest buying this game - it is absouletely worth the twenty-dollars you will pay for it. I also recommend buying all the DLC whilst you're at it. It will make you have a brand new experience of playing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the beginning of the game I was a little shocked after waking up obviously from a chloroform knockout and seeing a strange bald man (thinking I was molested) I got very wrathful I mean CMON! Bethesda thats MY damn job! after about 28 hours straight of playing this game I got a blood clot in my left leg and it shot to my lungs and now here I am typing this off of my new iphone 3 in the detroit medical hospital while my 85 year old parents are yelling at me and breaking my computer I can't stand this world good bye!

												Having completed this game several times on the Xbox, and played it for a while on the PC now, too, I can definitely say that I love it. A lot. The story is great, the modding capability is great, the replayability is something I've never seen before in any other game - if you've enjoyed Fallout 3, Skyrim or anything of the sort, there's a high chance you'll have fun in New Vegas.

												This game is awesome.Fallout New Vegas really feels like the middle child between the firstborn (fallout 3) and the newest member of the family (Fallout 4).  Fallout 3 laid the foundation for what was to be expected from the next iterations in the series - a solid, well rounded achiever that was the first modern foray into an unexplored first person Fallout.  Being the first allowed it to carve out the series' baseline expectations; a fresh, interesting, and well received experience that introduced a number of new ideas. Fallout 4, the newest bundle of joy, is young, athletic, and good looking - trying to capture its attention from the audience on mostly looks alone, but lacking the depth of the firstborn.  It can run circles around the other two graphically and is good at sports, but spends too much time in front of the t.v.Fallout New Vegas, being the middle child, found its identity by studying hard at school and differentiating itself from the other siblings.  It added the deepest of the modern Fallout RPG elements and excelled in English class, with interesting well-written quests.  It also learned to do things that the firstborn couldn't, building on its foundation, but lacking the flair of the youngest of the family. It can't compete with Fallout 4's superior looks, but knows deep down it will eventually get the girls when they become bored and look for a deeper commitment.Pros;Great quests/faction interactionsRPG elements/perksImproved gunplaycharacterslength (the dlc is fantastic)16,000 + mods on the NexusCons:can be temperamental (glitch)Less emphasis on explorationgraphical fidelityFallout New Vegas is a must have if you enjoy RPG's.  It might have a few pimples, but it can hold a long, interesting conversation with you.  19.99 for the ultimate edition really is a steal, especially compared to what I spent on the original Xbox 360.

												Now this is a game worthy of the Fallout title! Alot of people liked Fallout 3 alot better, and I'm actually not sure why. I LOVED New Vegas! Yes, the Mojave landscape is quite boring, but it brang back what we want to see in a Fallout game! Choice! About 90% of all the quests in New Vegas, have different endings, or at least different approaches to completing it. I was sucked into the world of New Vegas MUCH more then I was in Fallout 3. If you want a game where it's your choice how things play out, this is the game for you. Oh, and it still has the amazing range of weapons, items and quests we all love.			",169,31,0,16,16,1,9

												Even though the initial game isnt as good as fallout 3 its a pretty fun game with plenty of new features to keep one entertained plus really cool DLC's. But the mods make this game incredible. Highly recommended for anyone a fan of RPG's or shooters.Now this game is something special, playing the game with a modest mix of mods make this game quite an experience, better than Fallout 4 by a long shot.First the RPG aspects are LEAGUES better than 4, leveling a character is a lot more advanced, which isn't saying much compared to 4, but it has depth and thought to it. You can create whatever character you want instead of being stuck with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dad. Loot is a lot more varied and gunplay forces you to build your character with some thought as that isn't the focus. The dialogue is great as it has choice and can change the tide based on your character.Modding is very easy to do, no wierd way to do it.Once I upgrade my PC, I plan to reinstall this game and mod it to hell. While this game is a 8/10 for an RPG, the overall feel and gameplay makes this a solid 9.5/10, while Fallout 4 is a 4/10 as an RPG and a 7/10 as a Fallout game. Please support this game people, Bethesda needs to make a Fallout game with a lot more focus in the RPG aspect like this one here instead of forcing a backstory and character onto you.

												I have put many hours into both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas and I can solemnly say that I did not waste a single minute. So far, I have found it impossible not to discover something new on each playthrough (Of which I have completed many) and being able to follow a different story path each time has been a large part of this. While this game may throw you in at the deep end fairly early on, you have a clear objective and many different ways of completing it. Any fan of open world games or shooters will quickly realise that they have been missing out on a superb game for some time. I strongly recommend this title			",107,14,0,10,1,0,2

												After admittedly rushing through Fallout 3, I felt a bit let down at its seemingly linear plot and short main questline. I already had picked up New Vegas from this past Winter Sale and had been waiting to try it out, in hopes that it would extend my simple experience of 3. What I jumped into far exceeded my expectations. I felt like I was truly the player running across the wasteland. Whereas in 3 I was a kid from the vault following a paper trail to my father to do good for Washington, D.C., here in NV I had all the power to do anything from creating an autonomous society to becoming the main driver for a loose military force.What I learned from 3 and my initial playthrough of NV is you have to pace yourself. Explore aimlessly a lot more than you find yourself doing in the sister/rival Elder Scrolls games. There is no actual endgame in ES like there is in FO. You have to leave your mark before you make the big choices. You also find your personal morals driving your decisions. And unlike ES, the citizens of the Mojave Wasteland will not forget you. Screw the NCR, they will screw you back.I found myself enjoying the company of the smaller ""tribes"" more than the big players like the NCR and Caesar. Again inserting myself as the player character, I was another person in the wasteland, I just ended up shaping it to my whim.If I had to criticize one thing, it is the somewhat-lack of incentive to scour every location. Reaching Level 28 on my second playthrough and choosing the Explorer perk was a good choice to find some difficult and useful locations, but just as many of them were not. I found a place called ""Chance's Map"" which only on further investigation did I learn it meant something, but only in the comics. I wasn't expecting valuable NPC's to be waiting every 5 meters, but possibly have a bit more to find under the rock. Despite this, the minutia in development is another reason to praise this game.And the average 2010 graphics? Doesn't matter, it was all about the detail and story, anyway.9.75/10			",108,14,6,22,5,0,10

												Best Fallout game, with alot of interesting quests, and a huge Wasteland to explore. The story this time is based along the war between the New California Republic (NCR), and the Legion. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and you can join whichever you want to complete the game, or go through and independant New Vegas, and kick both of them out of Nevada. A vast improvement over Fallout 3 in terms of weapons, iron sights, and locations. The characters are quite memorable, and the companions are badasses if you get them the right gear. Both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave make appearances, but in vastly dimmed down appearances than their Fallout 3 counterparts. Which is a shame, as I like the Fallout 3 Brotherhood better than New Vegas's. There are four pieces of DLC for New Vegas, but they all have their ups and downs.Dead Money is an extremely confusing, and creepy DLC to play, but gives you a good few hours of gameplay. This was my least favorite of the four.Honest Hearts is my favorite, as it gives you a huge part of Utah to explore (namely Zion National Park), gives you some awesome armor to wear, and has some pretty awesome characters, namely the Burned Man himself, Joshua Graham. A must play even just to get the Desert Ranger Armor.Old World Blues was a pretty standard run to this place, grab something, run to this place grab this, and so on and so forth. The one thing that sets this out from the rest is the ""Brains"", a group of former scientists from before the Great War who placed their brains in robots so they could continue living. I won't spoil anything, but their entire dialogue is absolutely hilarious to hear, and it is hard not to like their dialogue. This is my third favorite of the four.Lonesome Road. This is the last DLC, and the second best. The area you explore is extremly hostile, looks great, and everything is out to kill you. You also get to find out about your past before you accepted the ill-fated job from the Mojave Express. Ullysses is a great antagonist. Suffice to say, this is a great one to play as well, and you really should.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best game i've ever played. The story behind Fallout is a variation of the wanderer exploring an apocalyptic wasteland. The themes present revolve around war, human nature, and exploration. The gameplay is similar to Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3. In this day and age of indie and early access games, Fallout: New Vegas has very few noticeable bugs. The graphics, gameplay, and story hold up extremely well against modern competitors. If you've never played the Fallout series, I'm very excited for you because you're about to go on an amazing ride. MUST HAVE			",171,30,5,29,27,1,43

												One of the best RPGs made up to this day, Fallout: New Vegas tells a story about a society which is rebuilding around you, and leading into a huge battle, proves that humans don't change, and because of that war... war never changes.A really good story, with really memorable characters and landmarks you'll remember. Huge open world which captures the essence of a nuclear wasteland desert, full of life and funny memorable moments.If you're gonna buy it, please do it with all their DLCs, which also have their own stories, but also, a major story between them all that expands New Vegas' story even further.

												Hmm... Fallout: New Vegas. Ya know, throughout this series we've heard the phrase uttered time and time again; ""War, war never changes"". Each installment of the Fallout series has given us insight on what exactly holds for us if we ever do come to some sort of ""End-of-the-World"" pinnacles. Sex, drugs, guns, and money. Seems nothing more than simply a fantasy but when you look deeper into it, it's more than that. It's a reality. A reality of something that could be, because of both the human nature to preserve but also because of the most catastrophical ideal that we humans have. A trait that not a single person on this planet is free from. Something that given time, can destroy lives, families, friends, countries, and well.. even the world. Greed. Pure greed. Now, I may have lost you with the philisophical mumbo-jumbo, but hear me out. Fallout is easily known for reaffirming the negative repercussions of human greed within the series, but Fallout: New Vegas does it the best. Personalities such as Benny, Ceasar, and many other characters shown to us forthright how damaging their personal greed can cause so much chaos is scary. One damn near kills you and another damn near destroys all of New Vegas. As the player, you go through so many different obstacles that while not incredibly damaging to your playstyle, can seriously change the outcome of future events drastically. All winding down to something as simple as not being friendly to someone. In hindsight, this may not seem incredibly.. so much to do with just greed, but all of humanities existence. A test of patience and time, to make choices and risk the outcomes. To make friendships that will drastically alter the course of the game. Given all this, could you really sit here and say that this is a bad game? It takes a lot to accidently make people philisophically question things. It takes a lot more to actually try and do it.

												I'm on the verge deciding whether I like  Fallout 3 or Fallout NV more, for me they're on the same level. I'm going to make a short comparison:Fallout NV:- Less power armor focused- Strong wild-west theme (some like it some not)- Interesting characters, questline for every companion.- More things to do (like gambling etc.)- An amazing faction system, way better than FO3's karma.- Some of the best DLC's I've played in any game.FO3:- Real post-apocalyptic feeling.- Simpler-cleaner game mechanics- The main antagonists are much more strong and interesting- Less bugs (only for me?)- More interesting locations and landmarks- Creepier, more eerie than FONV.Anyway if you plan on buying the game buy the Ultimate/GOTY edition with all the dlc, it worth it. Just like with any Bethesda game, modding it is highly advised (not only to get rid of the numerous bugs, but to enhanced the gameplay and outdated visuals).			",536,176,15,92,64,7,96

												Wonderful game, extraordinary plot, tons of action, and an amazing lore. The DLCs are all great in their own special way, but Dead Money is the most challenging one (and my least favorite). Without DLC: 10/10. With DLC: 10/10, -1 for Dead Money, +1 for ED-E in Lonesome Road.			",28,4,0,9,5,1,1

												There is some debate over whether Fallout 4 was better than New Vegas, yet few can deny that New Vegas is a classic that still provides players with the post-apocalyptic RPG experience today, 7 years later.New Vegas is meticulously crafted, and the world and lore is immersive. Choices matter. Different people would prefer different endings and it really takes a lot of roleplay to decide which one you would prefer. In creating good and bad, the NCR might fight for the return of old world democracy, but come across as intrusively imperialist; the legion might come across as villanous brutes, but to a certain extent they would bring back order and stability, if you're willing to accept slavery as  a norm of society. House would bring about a benovolent dictatorship, and Independence really looks at the choices that you have made. Sub-factions are pre-determined if you follow NCR, Legion or House paths, but only in independence can you make your own decisions among them.Characters, especially the companions, were people with complex identities. Veronica reveals that she fell in love with a girl, but was frowned upon by the Brotherhood because it demands certain female roles; yet Arcade is openly homosexual and he's just going along, trying to find ways to do good in the wasteland, it brings to light the differing treatment of lgbt's (which Fallout is still opening up to, great!) but neither of their personal quests revolve around their sexuality, which is a genius approach to it; they're just who they are. Veronica is a vivacious, forward-thinker stuck in a conservative society that tells itself it will succeed because it has succeeded before with the old ways. Boone is associable because we've all made grave mistakes that we can't forgive ourselves for - but Boone takes it a step further, by blaming a big personal loss on fate catching up to him for a mistake that wasn't even his fault. You find him in Novac (a play on no vacancy) and it's almost as if he's juxtaposed to be living there as a purposeless wanderer because his past has consumed him so. Nightkin Lily takes prescribed medicine, which keeps her sane, but the medicine also causes her to forget her past life as a grandmother to two children. What you encourage her to do with her medicine also takes a lot of roleplaying and what you feel is best or right for her. Point is, these characters aren't stock characters. Hell, they're more interesting than the people I meet in real life, because I relate to them and in helping them through their personal quests you also come to understand yourself and what you value.Fallout New Vegas gives you a number of perks and skills to invest in, and they change the way a player goes through the game diversely. Female characters' Black Widow, for example, opens up special dialogue options when talking to male NPCs - creating rare opportunities to bypass longer processes. Speech 100 will get you through a lot in the name of fighting with words. Or you could just fight, with guns. 'It's a free wasteland.'Last but not least, I am hopelessly in love with the soundtrack, both orchestral and licensed. Music direction was good and it added to my immersion. It made wandering through the Mojave a little less lonely.I'm hoping, along with many others, that Obsidian will develop the new Fallout post Fallout 4, but this is the game that really piqued my interest in the series, and now I'm headed on to finish my collection.

												Been a huge Fallout fan for so many years, played the first classic games and even dabbled a bit with fallout tactics and brotherhood. When Fallout 3 came out i spent so much time on that game it was insane, would play it for hours on end only stopping for toilet breaks, sleep and to eat something before i turn into a skeleton. So eventually when New Vegas was released i quickly grabbed a copy on the consoles and not long after on the PC and yet again had my time get sucks down the time sink. After playing it for 500+ hours i can honestly say it was ALOT of fun and i loved the amount of mods and freedom the developers gave to their fans when it came to making your own mods for the game, but of course there are negatives. I hated the setting the game was in, alot of the towns are great i abolutely loved Goodsprings and the strip, but got tired quickly of just seeing just sand, occasional building and flat nothingness. What i loved so much in Fallout 3 was that you were in a destroyed capital, you could walk through destroyed buildings walk across a huge city seeing buildings that collapsed, stores destroyed and so on. But in New Vegas its just....sand.While so many fallout fanboys will comment on this ""Review"" and get all butthurt that i didn't like their precious new vegas game, i by no means say its a ""Bad"" game. Just not a great one in my opinion, and i certaintly don't get how so many people are being butthurt over the newest installation Fallout 4. Don't like fallout 4 then get a refund and stop complaining about the dialogue box or the ""Missing"" RPG elements. Other than that i would reccomend this game to people who want to buy the fallout series and see what its all about and to more importantly have fun. But don't play the game if you are looking for a bug free game, its a bethesda game so its to be expected.			",390,133,8,99,51,3,58

												This is by far one of my favorite games I've ever played. Filled with hours upon hours of gameplay, and with tons of replayability, this game is definetly worth buying. There are so many missions to do, and some of them you can aproach from different angles. Or, if you don't feel like questing, you can just turn of some Radio New Vegas and let Mr. New Vegas's luxorious voice serinade you as you travel throughout the wastes looking for people to help, or kill. I've not even scratched the surface of this game, there's just so much content, you need to check it out for yourself!			",81,21,1,9,11,0,9

												Not sure what you would need to read a review for.It's Fallout New Vegas. If you don't have it, you should.All fun aside, it's classic Fallout, set in a cool world, full of loveable characters. I've really enjoyed my time so far. If you've played FO4 as your first taste of the series, and want something fresh, then FO:NV will satify your craving for more.			",57,3,0,8,2,0,1

												This is probably never going to be seen ever but I must say this, this is no understated work, it is loved and priased, and i can EASILY see why, it is immersive, it is diverse, it is immense, and all other words ending with 've' or 'se' that are positive.Of course it isn't perfect, yeah the dialog was said to be the weak point...I don't see that, no what ISN'T great is the crashes...thankfully only twice but this is a warning to Windows 8 users, this game has been known to crash until it either stablizes itself or mods or patches to the coding through notepad *Look it up* I had the former happen.The Guns feel pretty good, they sound like how a gun SHOULD, and VATS is immensely satisfying to use, the scarcity of items is perfect for the situation...Its the Post Apocalypse, what would you expect to find? a fully functional automobile filled to the brim with guns?'If the best mechanic in the world appeared before you, you both would not be able to start up this car' *Anyone who gets the reference gets pancakes*I lost track altogether didn't I...Oh yeah, sometimes your companions will get stuck but quicktravel will fix this, enemy AI is pretty intelligent all things considered *They actually run if they feel a situation is too much for them to handle* its satisfying to mess up a Fire Ant's Antanae and cause them to go into a frenzy, killing fellow ants and some Legionaires who tried to kill you while you were dealing with a group of said Fire Ants...And just watching those Legionaires roast while they try to kill you, completely ignoring the fact that an ant is setting them on fire...Yeah sometimes AI isn't perfect, as the above example shows, like you'd think they'd abandon their attempts to kill you and focus on the thing thats just roasting them on a spit, maybe just split the forces in half so one half deals with the ant and the other focuses on you.But in either case, this game is satisfying to play, enjoyable, and while the sale is over *Lonely Man *From Hulk* plays in background with sad face* you can still get this for 10 bucks *or 10 quid if you are a dandy...seriously though, Englishmen are fun to listen to.* And I haven't even gotten to the DLC  *Don't have it so I cannot judge, expect maybe a follow up review*TL;DR: This game is amazing and you should play it!

												I'm on the verge deciding whether I like  Fallout 3 or Fallout NV more, for me they're on the same level. I'm going to make a short comparison:Fallout NV:- Less power armor focused- Strong wild-west theme (some like it some not)- Interesting characters, questline for every companion.- More things to do (like gambling etc.)- An amazing faction system, way better than FO3's karma.- Some of the best DLC's I've played in any game.FO3:- Real post-apocalyptic feeling.- Simpler-cleaner game mechanics- The main antagonists are much more strong and interesting- Less bugs (only for me?)- More interesting locations and landmarks- Creepier, more eerie than FONV.Anyway if you plan on buying the game buy the Ultimate/GOTY edition with all the dlc, it worth it. Just like with any Bethesda game, modding it is highly advised (not only to get rid of the numerous bugs, but to enhanced the gameplay and outdated visuals).			",536,176,15,92,64,7,96

												Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It follows the same ""Skyrim with Guns"" approach that Fallout 3 takes but in my opinion has a better storyline, with ""true"" ironsights and better general gameplay. Some people appreciate the grimdark devastated atmosphere of Fallout 3 over the more hopeful, western approach of Fallout New Vegas, and I can understand that. It feels weird in a post-nuclear war to have such thriving societies built in the rubble, but I enjoyed the charm and innovative ways that society has managed to survive. In addition to this, during any kind of nuclear conflict they enemy would send millions of nukes at Washington D.C., where Fallout 3 is located so it makes a bit of canonical sense to have Fallout 3 be way more decimated than the Mojave Desert. I'm a bit too young to have played the earlier Fallouts but from everything I've read New Vegas is a more direct succesor to the older games.Fallout New Vegas has a faction system in lieu of a more traditional blanket morality system, which I find fantastic considering how the various storylines of the game can play out. It doesn't make sense that EVERYONE would be mad if you decided to shoot that innocent wastelander in the face, but if that wastelander happened to belong to a particular faction, they would be unhappy with you. This lets you reliably play as an ""evil"" or ""good"" character without the pre-conceived shackles of either disposition. If you manage to upset any faction too much be sure to expect them to send ""hit squads"" after you that can show up at any time, adding a real danger to exploration. The map also is a lot more packed with interesting locations, and the open nature of the environment means you can stumble across all kinds of mutated horrors that wayyyy outlevel you at any time. Really amazingly terrifying stuff. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is still in place, as well as the perk system. I've found speech to be a bit OP, but I really enjoyed talking my way out of dire situations time and time again.Seriously, if you haven't had the chance to play this game yet, buy the ultimate edition now. The DLCs are all great fun and on PC, you can mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. I recommend Project Nevada for beginners, it adds a sprint functionality and rebalances all the weapons and perks to be more challenging, but also more enjoyable. Walking across a desolate desert littered with the remnants of the old world, hearing rifle shots as your companion Boone murders anything hostile that comes within a mile of you while listening to the ""Big Iron"" by Marty Robbins on the radio, you too will come to realize the elegant brilliance of this RPG. If anything, play it to get a handle on the lore of the Fallout universe and prepare yourself for Fallout 4!			",710,163,17,69,63,8,96

												A few months ago I wrote a negative review about Fallout New Vegas. It was wrong of me to only play this for an hour and call it trash without actually getting to embrace the game. Now my playtime is over 30 because I began to learn how much of a fun game this was.Remember those old Fallout games back in the 90s? Those point and click ones? Bethesda came up with an idea to reuse the elements of the old games and bring them back to a resurrected FPS. The execution of this idea does not dissapoint. There were things I liked about the old Fallout games that caught my eye, such as the type of ammo that can either pentrate armour or do more damage. Bringing them back to New Vegas was the bomb. (No war-pun intended) Companions in New Vegas are now more easy to manipulate with the Companion wheel, and the fact that you can choose your own ending instead of the game choosing it for you is like Nuka Cola combined with some Sunest Sarspirilla. However this game is not perfect. There will be crashes here and there when you play, which get a bit annoying if you didn't save your game. Sometimes, the Mojave Wasteland looks blank and dead, which makes sense since the setting takes place in the desert, but nothing like some Fiends and Deathclaws to add a bit of flavor to the taste. Overall this game DESERVES a 9.5/10. I highly recommend you get this game if you enjoy RPG's and like a bit of challenge here and there. But if you do, word of advice...Actually I have no advice to say, only play this game like there is no tomorrow c:			",38,3,0,7,2,0,1

												Been a huge Fallout fan for so many years, played the first classic games and even dabbled a bit with fallout tactics and brotherhood. When Fallout 3 came out i spent so much time on that game it was insane, would play it for hours on end only stopping for toilet breaks, sleep and to eat something before i turn into a skeleton. So eventually when New Vegas was released i quickly grabbed a copy on the consoles and not long after on the PC and yet again had my time get sucks down the time sink. After playing it for 500+ hours i can honestly say it was ALOT of fun and i loved the amount of mods and freedom the developers gave to their fans when it came to making your own mods for the game, but of course there are negatives. I hated the setting the game was in, alot of the towns are great i abolutely loved Goodsprings and the strip, but got tired quickly of just seeing just sand, occasional building and flat nothingness. What i loved so much in Fallout 3 was that you were in a destroyed capital, you could walk through destroyed buildings walk across a huge city seeing buildings that collapsed, stores destroyed and so on. But in New Vegas its just....sand.While so many fallout fanboys will comment on this ""Review"" and get all butthurt that i didn't like their precious new vegas game, i by no means say its a ""Bad"" game. Just not a great one in my opinion, and i certaintly don't get how so many people are being butthurt over the newest installation Fallout 4. Don't like fallout 4 then get a refund and stop complaining about the dialogue box or the ""Missing"" RPG elements. Other than that i would reccomend this game to people who want to buy the fallout series and see what its all about and to more importantly have fun. But don't play the game if you are looking for a bug free game, its a bethesda game so its to be expected.			",390,133,8,99,51,3,58

												Imagine a world where choices matter, people judge you for the slightest action and factions seek vengence on eachother for reasons unexplainable from decades of war. Fallout New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic action RPG game that expands its limits with other 65,000 lines of diolog, memorable characters, badass weapons (Such as the ""Fat man"" that fires a mini nuke that devestates and destroys everything in it's path), however that is not the only weapon of mass destruction, there is much more that you as the player should explore and endure along your treck across the wasteland of the mojave desert.   Who are you?""You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn…for the worse.""Left for dead and abandoned you make a recovery and thus your adventure begins...where your actions differ the outcome of the game and most importantly the ending. Become a saint among the people and help anyone or needs it and become ""A Hero of the Wasteland"" or turn to the dark side and become evil and sly, killing everyone and making the mojave a living hell. The possibility is endless so what are you waiting for ADVENTURE ON...you dig.			",96,12,1,21,12,0,14

												One of the greatest games ever made. Although essentially the same base game as Fallout 3 the writing is superb and introduces enough new gameplay elements to really make things seem like a new game rather than a reskin or expansion pack.It focuses on factions and currying favor or hatred from the various groups rather than a binary morality system. As such, the gameplay is different, as you have to decide your allegiances fairly early on. This also really impacts replayability as the game will feel different and play differently depending on which groups you are actively trying to support.Although Fallout 3 really nailed the bleak post-apocalyptic atmosphere, New Vegas's landscape feels much livelier, and more hopeful. Compared to the Capital Wasteland of Fallout 3 the Mojave Wasteland is thriving, including an actual functioning city of Las Vegas. The world is very well populated with NPCs that are all unique and have their own motives and stories for you to explore.My two biggest gripes with the game are: 1. After a certain point enemies become so powerful that small arms fire is almost useless. 2. Unlike Fallout 3 after beating the game you cannot explore the world, so beating the game means you will no longer be able to play as your character, which is disappointing since you spend so much time trying to build the world the way you want, and then have no chance to see the results of your actions.Now I'll do the DLC's as separate, brief reviews:Dead Money: Hard. Although the enemies were not that bad, and the plot was interesting and the characters well written, I got so frustrated trying to navigate the insta-kill mines and bomb collar triggers that I considered skipping this DLC altogether. That said though, The Sierra Madre Casino is a fascinating and unique place and the storyline of the DLC is very well written.Honest Hearts: Again, really great storyline, although overall it is very short. The scenery of Utah is very well captured and beautiful to look at, but the DLC feels a little stifling. Doesn't really add a lot of new weapons or things to carry over to the main game. Worth it for the storyline alone though.Old World Blues: A lot of people consider this to be the best DLC. It is definitely unique, well written, and adds a lot of new items to the game. However, it is very difficult to do since enemies are scaled to your level and very damage resistant. In addition, if you are a guns user, ammo is very scarce. If you enjoy crafting this can be mitigated, but I hate crafting and was constantly having to scrounge for ammo or just use whatever weapons I had to get by.Lonesome Road: Also somewhat difficult. But great storyline. Really focuses much harder on the post-apocalyptic atmosphere that Fallout 3 was so good at capturing.			",62,35,0,29,9,2,13

												Very good installment in the Fallout franchise.I still see this game as the best Fallout game after Fallout 4 was released a while ago. This game is very good with dialogue, decent quests, and characters. The only minor issue I have with the game overall is that it feels empty, by that I mean the map itself. I can understand why it may be like this, but it just feels like it should add more to this slightly empty Mojave Wasteland. This is a very godd game like I said, I recommend playing this.

												I'll keep this short and sweet.This game was a surprise for me. After playing Fallout 4, which was my first Fallout game ever, I expected an outdated poor version of a Fallout universe, which would bore me in a few hours. Man, was I wrong... Fallout: New Vegas turned out to be JUST AS GOOD, if not even slightly better than Fallout 4, all-in-all. Of course, this is my opinion only... There is the issue of graphics, general stability etc. But, after a little getting used to them - the game looks ok, and the occasional crash is nothing serious.One advice though - do not complete the final quests (no matter which side you take) before you've completed everything else you want to omplete (DLC's, started quests, locations that weren't explored, undiscovered quests...). After you finish the game - it's finished. For good. There's no coming back. So - leave the last quest of the main storyline - for last.9.5/10			",141,25,1,13,11,0,11

												Fallout New Vegas is one of those games that you get addicted to and end up binge playing it for 8 hours at a time.  In New Vegas there is so much to do that this game will keep you busy for weeks and you could end up putting 150+ hours into just one save.  It has addicting gameplay, intresting characters and loads of great side quests that will be more than enough to keep you busy.  But all of these thing aside the game does have some downfalls like texture glitches and fetch quests (Bleed me dry which is seemingly a waste of time except for the awesome rewards).  Don't let these things deter you from enjoying the game because there is plenty to enjoy in Vegas!9.2/10 ",86,5,0,16,3,0,2

												ok so now to fix this reviewi did find a fix and i found this game better on PC and i can tell as i played like 3 hours on xbox but pc im on what 63 hours and i found that on pc i can have more fun and i acctually decided to get most of the unique weapons with the help of eso fallout and elder scroll guides.i found myself constantly searching for new locations and weapons and achievements and its very entertaining.The only downside is that the nexus site wont do anything when i click download but the game is still very good.At the moment i find there is a lot of guns but im getting bored and i havent even bought any dlc for some reason.this game has a reasonable amount of achievments and most are from quests or repairing so its pretty easy to get them aswell.now for the pros and consPROS- very fun gameplay-masive open world-lots of hours of content -nice amount of looting to be done-if u like being killed by very hard enemies *cough cough deathclaws* this a perfect game for u-very good exploration and sometimes it can be rewarded *cough cough bloodboune cave*- wide variety of enemies and companions-gore and dismeberment ++-lots of skills-a gazillion perks to chose ( i spend about an hour going through wich perk to chose)-wild wasteland perk (always a plus) *cough cough alien blaster with aliens to fight to get it*-good graphics-good gun modsCONS -sometimes can get annoying-u could save and then its a very hard part and u wouldnt be able to do itoverall i adore this game so much and the hype for fallout 4 is over the top.i am definetely getting fallout 4, might not be on pc but will be on consoleoverall this game gets a :9.5/10thanks for reading guys and peace ;D			",136,11,6,8,9,1,3

												Each time I return to New Vegas, I find my self enjoying it more and more than previous playthroughs.Fallout New Vegas is as close to another Black Isle Studios' Fallout game as we are gonna get. It was made by most of the team that made those games to boot. You are a courier and you were shot in the brain.

												OBSIDIAN NEEDS TO MAKE FALLOUT 4!Fallout New Vegas is the best game I have ever played. It's ugly, yes, (fixed with texture and ENB mods) but the world is just so alive compared to F3, Skyrim, Oblivion. There are multiple ways to manipulate the fate of the world and it's factions. Also, there is a lot of humour in the game. Everything from sex robots to people blowing up when you shoot them in the foot. But at the same time, it's a dark dystopian universe with slavery, postitution, war, and serious issues for characters which doesn't feel like just another cardboard mute NPC.  Most of all, it's not F3. Vegas is all F3 should have been but never was. Bethesda has a lot to learn from the masters of Obsidian, which they ignorantly just didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about in Skyrim. ♥♥♥♥ you, Bethesda, you suck.			",28,1,0,4,2,0,6

												Each time I return to New Vegas, I find my self enjoying it more and more than previous playthroughs.Fallout New Vegas is as close to another Black Isle Studios' Fallout game as we are gonna get. It was made by most of the team that made those games to boot. You are a courier and you were shot in the brain.

												Fallout New Vegas is a game that some people are not entirely sure about. While some still prefer Fallout 3 others think that New Vegas is a superior game to play. In the end that doesn't matter to the reviewer only how good New Vegas is. New Vegas adds several things to the formula established by Fallout 3. Weapon add-ons, gambling, ammo types, survival based skills,   and a hardcore mode have been added to help make the game better than it's predecessor. Gambling, hardcore mode, and survival had all been added to Fallout 3 via mods; so it seems like Bethesda wanted to do it their way rather than releying on the moders to do it themselves. This is smart as it allows the modders to change it if they don't like the way that Bethesda went about it and allows the company to adapt to what is has done wrong based on the mods. Weapon add-ons are a nice change as previously you had to ditch your non-scoped rifle for a scoped version assuming you found one while out in the wastes. Ammo types are an unexpected change and having the ability to craft them makes them even better. Deciding between ammo is not important unless playing at higher difficulties but nontheless it is an enjoyable feature. The combat and skills are just as balenced as in Fallout 3 so do not expect any new fixes or content there. The storylines are actually fairly enjoyable with even small remote locations with what seems to be nothing in them having stories if you look hard enough. The main questline is actually really enjoyable with each of the groups (NCR, Legion, House) having a wide vareity of characters in them that allow for an enjoyable playthrouh regardless of who you decide to follow. The game has a lot to do and each thing has alot in it to acomplish before it is finished. The way that the war for the mojave is handled is done in a fun manner. You wil find people fighting for dominance of towns roads etc throughout your travels and makes for a much more interactive war than say Skyrim. The game does have faults though: As a Bethesda game it does have it's fair share of bugs, it suffers from a lack of diversity when it comes to enemies compared to the previous game, issues with the gambling system, and a weird level scaling regarding the map hurt the game. A majority of the enemies in the game are either insects, scorpions, or people with a heavy reduction in the amount of Supermutants, animals and ghouls. This makes the game slightly stale as you are just killing the same things over and over again. The gambling system is slightly messed up as you can not use it forever. Casino's will eventually kick you out and not allow you to continue gambling at what is imo a rather low amount. This lessens the impact of gambling on the game as it is basically free money up to a point rather than being an interesting system that helps you ease stress, The map has it's issues in that things are scaled rather akwardly compared to Fallout 3. In Fallout 3 the difficulty scaled the further you got away from the vault/megaton. With the distant city and it's subways to the east and the wastes of the NE being some of the most dangerous places on the map. This still allowed you to go whatever direction you felt like going in from the start. In New Vegas you are forced to go south/east with the ideal route being along the road. Both to the West and North of Goodsprings are plenty of high level creatures to tear you to shreds for daring to try and venture off the beaten path set forth by Bethesda. You are told to follow the path downwards to loop around the entire map to try and go to New Vegas the long way. You can obviously pray for a lucky run through the deathclaws to New Vegas and enjoy your life there. The force of control on the player really is an issue in an ""Open World"" RPG. Some of the locations just randomly placed around the map are suprsingly high level for just being alongside the road where measly lvl 5-10 mobs are sitting around. Mods, like in all Bethesda games, are one of the saving graces and fix plenty of the issues present within the game. Like all Bethesda games  it needs to have a seperate mod rating as the game changes so drastically. Vanilla: 8.7/10 Modded: 9.8/10			",44,5,1,16,7,0,19

												when i got this i was just getting over all my skyrim saves being overwritten when i stumbled across this in a steam sale. and. it. blew. my. mind. i found a game better than the elder scrolls!!!!! there are so many choices and events you can litteraly go through almost the entire game without firing  a bullet. and the landscape is astounding even though its an old game and every one looks like giant potatoe mutants the wasteland can look amazin some times. and in NV their not scared to get dirty there,s a dismemberment system the npcs dont have to censor themselves like most games do and even thoug theres some pretty wacky $*** it still pulls you in and immersifies you.in this game i dont feel like i need mods like i did in skyrim or oblivion because they catered for everyone even without the DlCs. and that,s why you should buy this game plain and simple.

												This game has a lot of haters, but it's a worthy sequel to Fallout 3 that won't be remembered as fondly as the original due to the sheer amount of bugs and lack of random events in the Wasteland. Here's hoping they learn from their mistakes in Fallout 4 and the series returns to the form (and universal acclaim) of the first game in the Fallout 3 series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPG's out there, Fallout 3 still comes out on top imo.Incredibly addictive, you will loose ALOT of hours in this game.It's worth loosing those hours.If you're wearing headphones on max volume be careful when you have a companion, if they kill something miles away you can be sure this game will show you the 'killcam' without warning and every time without fail it will scare the s*** out of you.10/10 Not a single con about this game.

 Fallout New Vegas Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas. It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. Fallout new vegas is a Action, RPG game released on the 22nd October 2010.This game is so Good , The huge amount of choices  the game gives you, makes you want to try every single one which makes this game worth playing. As with skyrim , you can install Mods for this game to make your gaming experience better but i wouldn't see why you would want to, The game is good already.Pros:- Very good gameplay- Good storyline- It makes you want to play more.Cons:- The graphics could be improved ( in my opinion).I will give this game a 9.98/10 because i am a graphics fanboy so that 0.02 percent that didn't get added was because of the graphics but it's a Splendid game.

												You start the game dead and buried, and unearthed by your robot companion who hates you. A kindly doctor breathes life back into you before sending you off to fight in the arena you later learn is New Vegas and it's surrounding desert. Giant scorpions and bandits who explode when punched dot the landscape, eager to greet you with grenades and gunfire as you pop their heads using your godhand and wristwatch calculator. Wearing glasses improves your stats, boosting you from an average Joe to a green beret as soon as you put them on. Ghouls prove to be the most loyal creatures in this game, probably because they understand you're just as dead on the inside as they are.Vegas itself is heavily guarded but not really that interesting, since everything is broken in Fallout except the super computers on top of very tall towers which remain undamaged by the global nuclear destruction.Augementing yourself with a government issue nano-suit, you eventually punch, kick and jab your way to revenge, impaling the villain on a pool cue with the rest of his evil brethren.It's then revealed that computers are the source of all life's misery, and you're given a crucial choice to play the game out or end it there.

												I got so many and mixed feelings for this game. Fallout 3 was mindblowngly good and I had some expectations from New Vegas. I knew it couldn't look like a major AAA title release if it stood in front of FO3, but I was expecting more.Allow me to make things as simple as I can.PROS✔ Loved finding interesting places in the map while scavenging. You can find useful stuff in every corner. There's some attention to the detail in a few settings, like finding hideouts and lookout points that made you feel that someone indeed lived and died there some time ago.✔ Relived the glorious Fallout environment. I enjoyed it, I felt all that overdose of nostalgia left inside me ever since I played FO3.✔ Tribal, racial, community differences. Man I loved exploring them, finding out their background stories. Deciding their future. We need more of that!✔ Side quests with story impact. You know I'm not talking about how one can change a game's ending. But more like how NPCs treat you and talk to you, the way they appreciate you or hate you depending your actions and quests and decisions. i really enjoyed it. it made me feel that what I did mattered, it helped me get into character. It felt like an actually successful RPG element✔ Crafting. ♥♥♥♥ yeah crafting and disassembling stuff rules!✔ Mods. No need to same more. Blow your brains out with tons of them.CONS✖ Terribly limited. One can literally learn byheart every corner of the map. You can literally use and craft every single piece of material in the game in much less time than you could in FO3 or in any elder scrolls game. WTF? Why so small? This game was out as a stand alone title, full priced and with DLCs. There's no excuse to give players such a limited world to roam in!✖ Endless desert. What's up with that? Too bored to design different environments?✖ Cowboy cult. No need to say more.✖ Buggy. It unfortunately still is. My latest example is that my first main character got bugged into a female voice somewhere near the end. Even some NPCs greeted me as a woman lol ✖ Uninteresting story, FO-wise. Nothing memorable to it. No big scale ideals. No massive plans. Just a small story about taking over New Vegas under a power of your choice and a war of hardly 50 NPCs scale. You can literally speedrun the main quest in 2 hours without spending one single bullet and finish it at level 7 or 8.MIXED☢ There were some little graphical improvements done here. I loved the physics from body animations and face expressions. There were tiny bit gore details added when it comes to body dismemberment. Though the rest of the whole game felt exactly the same with FO3. Same engine, same environmental effects and physical geometrical interactions.☢ The voice acting was so carefully done for so many named characters. However the generic onelined greeting and goodbyeing was ridiculously off. For example you could speak to Melissa Watkins in the Brotherhood of Steel, who is designed to have the voice of a young girl, and there was no way in freakin hell you wouldn't miss that different deep mature female voice saying ""hello"" or ""goodbye"".☢ Music. To put it simply; I enjoyed the way all levels and moments were designed to much a musical background, the way only Bethesda knows how to introduce, but there's absolutely nothing memorable to it. There's simply no OST value. ☢ DLCs. Gun Runners’ Arsena and Courier’s Stash should had been given to players at RELEASE and not make then pay extra for them. Also in the rest of DLCs introduced there are major environmental designs showoffs. I REALLY enjoyed most of my DLC gameplay (well except the proximity deaths in Dead Money) but they all left me with the taste of unsatisfaction. They could only make nature and massive city designs just for the DLC? Why? Did the developers got too bored to give us that awesome design concept in the main game so they went on to demo-introduce it to us in tiny short bits of experiences? This is not what I would expect to happen in FO4. They better use the information they got from feedbacks to make an awesome job for the next title! Environment is one of the keys of success for this franchise!!☢ 100% game completion including quests and achievements is more like a chore than a unique experience. After 245 hrs on record in this game, I can safely say as much.FINALMy fellow Fallout fans. I'm a fan of the franchise too. But we need more than that in our games.FO:NV is an example of trying to juice out money from the pockets of a crowd that begs for new content.When Bethesda can prove to make wonders just like how FO:3 turned out, we need to expect nothing less than more major game releases with great improvements. Not modified versions of a previous title with a different story-to-be-told shoved in it and push it out the market to make more money.I'm giving Fallout: New Vegas a 6/10. It would had been an 8 or a 9 if they were more inovative with environmental designs. And it could easily drop down to 4 or 5 for all the reasons regarding lazy money making titles.It made me feel that I played a slightly above average game. It left me with tons of mixed feelings.I hope the next title will blow our minds off like FO3 did.Grab it only on special offersCheers			",168,14,7,16,7,0,7

												Favorite game of all time.While it does have it's problems, such as bugs and aging graphics, it's still the best RPG experience I've had. And you have a helpful community, with community-made patches and a load of mods.You'll probably spend a while on fixing issues like mouselag or mods not working correctly before you actually get into the game, but once you get past that, you have a game that you can keep playing for hundreds of hours.Don't really have much else to say about this.

												Fallout New Vegas is a game in the Fallout Universe that takes place in 2281, 4 years after the events of Fallout 3. You are a courier hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a secret package to Mr.House in New Vegas. A casino manager by the name of Benny wants the?package to take over Vegas so he finds you with aid of the Great Kahns (one of the tribes in the Mojave Wasteland, Benny takes the package (soon to be know as a Platinum Chip) (The Chip can override the securitrons, Robots that protect Vegas. Anyways Benny shoots you in the head and buries you in the Goodsprings Cemetary, a securitron named Victor digs you out of the grave and takes you to the Goodsprings doctor , Doc Mitchell.So you wake up in the Doc's home and you set up your character and all that, After you leave the doctors home you can go to the ""Prospectors Saloon"" and meet a girl named ""Sunny Smiles"" she will give you a gun and let you do target training. In the Mojave Wasteland you can do quests for four opposite factions : NCR (a military army that tries to bring good across the Wasteland), The Legion (a group of slavers, evil people led by Caesar), Yes Man (a securitron?reprogrammed by Benny that would help him take over Vegas), Mr.House (the father of New Vegas who protected most of Vegas from the nukes of the Great War of 2077) The game is addictive so much greatness, you can do quests for people across the wasteland to earn caps, weapons and good or bad karma. I highly recommend the game if you are a fan of Fallout 3 or the past Fallout games, the game is not really that difficult it depends if you are new to Fallout or not. Sounds are great but the game full of npc's should have more voice actors, Graphics are awesome, The game offers a lot especially the DLC's Just be warned the ""Dead Money"" DLC will fill you with rageThe DLC's are:Lonesome Road Honest HeartsOld World BluesDead MoneyCourier's StashGun Runners ArsenalIf you want  a game thats $10 i highly recommend this games $10 is almost a steal			",52,5,0,10,2,0,1

												Ah, where to begin. In this fine tale of blood lust and adventure, just about every living thing that is not in a town (unless of course you do something like steal a fork) wants to spill your guts and roll around in them until it's nothing but a red pulp. Especially one. single. thing. Or actually MULTIPLE little things, and when i say little, they are actually vary big. This is the cazadors. These ♥♥♥♥ers are out for your blood, They spot you  at least 100 yards away and if you aren't prepaired their stinger is going directly in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥, with 0 amount of lube, so bite the god damn pillow, but wait, i forgot they don't even offer a pillow to bite on, they simply make you scream bloody murder. Oh and i forgot to mention death claws, These big mean ugly mother ♥♥♥♥ers will kill you in around say 3-4 hits, if you're equpited with propper armor. But never the less, it's a extremely fun game. And i highly recomend it, You wana be the evil guy who kills anything in his/her path? you can do that, you wana be a high horse gambler/ the loser who lost all his caps? you can do that, you wana join a bunch of single minded tribal warriors? yeah go right ahead. And mods are easy to install, just go to nexus mods and download acouple of programs and your set! So enjoy your stay in new vegas while getting destroyed by extremely OP creatures when you try to run to vegas at level 1			",46,5,0,4,5,2,0

												I have put countless hours into this and I think it is great you can find new things every play through. The charcter creation is easy to use and you can make a unique charcter. A very good thing is he unique weapons that are better than the normal ones.   I also love the weapons mods that can turn a rifle into a sniper rifle. A litttle tip the hunting rifle is amazing with a scope.			",67,22,1,19,5,0,12

												Fallout: New Vegas is a good game, maybe even a better game than Fallout 3, and here's why. Pros: - The best thing about this game is the music. It's upbeat and hilarious. Even if you're not normally a fan of songs about homicidal cowboys, a lot of these classic 40's and 50's tunes will get stuck in your head all day nonetheless.- The Mojave is a vibrant, interesting background for the kinds of fun shenanigans that make Bethesda games a blast.- The characters in this game are great, and in many ways more interesting than the characters in Fallout 3. - The game engine now allows you to aim using iron sights, as well as a time-freezing mechanic called ""V.A.T.S."" Fallout 3 had only V.A.T.S., no iron sights. - Enemies are more varied and interesting than the same old rehashed enemy types from Fallout 3. Now you can kill ""giant flies"" and ""glorified LARPers in Roman armor made from football gear"", as well as the tried and true ""radioactive zombies"" and ""giant scorpions.""- There's a big modding community that's put a lot of work into creating free content to extend your wasteland experience even further. Sometimes the mods are even as good as the content in the vanilla game.Cons: - It's a Bethesda game. Luckily by now most of the bugs have been patched, or can be patched if you download a few mods from the Mod Nexus. But still, buggy, crashy, sometimes laggy. - The story's a bit meh. Even though the characters are, IMO, better than Fallout 3's, the story isn't quite as fulfilling or engaging. All around, New Vegas is a lovely game with a beautiful soundtrack and a lot of really fun elements to it. Another masterful example of the RPG genre from Bethesda.  ",114,34,1,20,28,1,38

												I remember playing Fallout 2 for countless hours and the same thing applies with NV too. Well, actually I've played it 220+ hours via Steam and some tens of hours from the dvd. It's my third time I'm playing through Fallout NV story. First two times I went without DLC but now I got subplots along the main story aswell. New Vegas is huge and there's simply tons of stuff to go through. The story is catchy but maybe not as good as in the previos parts. The Legion, a well organized group of savages dressed like ancient Romans, is a little bit silly crowd to think living in a post-nuclear wasteland. That's probably the most annoying detail in the story. Other than that, I can't really blame the designers not putting enough effort on the story. Story 8/10In Fallout 3, the wasteland was huge and so it is in New Vegas. However, this time most of the irritating (invisible) obstacles that limit player's movements are removed or replaced with more plausible obstacles. Movement and HUD is pretty much the same as in Fallout 3. Again, a lot of time is spent with the pip boy. Using it simple but somewhat inflexible. Companions get lost sometimes in rugged environment but usually they'll find their way back to the player without any bigger hassle. Player can choose whether to fight taking turns or without and it works nicely. Taking turns feels safer what comes to spending ammo aiming a running enemy in the limbs or head is usually sketchy. Gameplay 8/10The overall graphics are fine: nothing extremely beautiful but works nicely in a story that takes place in a wasteland. Sometimes some shining surfaces look plastic especially when moving around with the flash light on and it actually gives me a headache. Soundscape is minimalistic yet working. Appearance 8½/10Overall experience is really good. At least I got what I wanted and I'm really happy with the game. Yes, there are some bugs and issues with the game but considering the extent of the game these flaws are somewhat acceptable. Moreover, gameplay works most of the time smoothly, so the good experience is not often disturbed. Maybe the best way to describe Fallout New Vegas is that the game holds on to its addictivity and after finishing the story for the first time there's still a lot of stuff to do. In general, this post-apocalyptic concept simply works. In my opinion, Fallout New Vegas might be the second best part of the Fallout franchise after Fallout 2, and not even far behind the first place.For a Fallout franchise fan New Vegas is a must-have, and it gives a good run for a Fallout-newbie's money as well.

												A game of endless content. Great replay value with many different endings depending on the many -sometimes quite difficult, polically or ethically charged- dicisions made. I must've sunk over 400 hours into it (before I owned it on Steam) and on every playthrough I discover new area's and side-stories. When you finally think you've really seen it all... you get into modding. This is when you find out that all flaws that you used to ignore because the rest of the game is so awesome, have been fixed by the community along with plenty new game mechanics, tweaks and hours, no, days of extra, often fully voice-acted content. I would say this is my favorite game without a doubt, if not for the other masterpieces that have been created with the same engine: Elder Scrolls IV and Fallout 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've ever played. You can get so many hours out of this game; I only have 25 at the moment but I only got this game recently on PC, I've mostly played it on 360. There are so many different ways to play, I've started at least four different files and each one felt entirely unique.  Add modding and you've got a game that can last you a long time. Also, this game can run on pretty low-end PCs, which is always a plus. If you don't like the graphics, there are a ton of ENBs as well. And don't even get me started on the DLCs; all four are absolutely amazing. Overall, the only negative thing I can say about this game is that it can be glitchy at times, but they can be funny and there are a ton of fix mods to remove them. $20 is a steal of a price for such an amazing game, and if that's still too pricey, New Vegas is extremely cheap during sales. 10/10ASSUME THE POSITION			",60,9,0,10,7,2,2

												My favorite game of all time, it is in simpliest form an expansion to Fallout 3 which was made in 2008, a year before this game was released, it was ahead of its time and it combines everything a player would love. The only drawback is it takes a bit of time to fully understand the game and this game to be played to its full potenital...you have to be, well... smart... But you can still have fun if you aren't that great of a thinker, you can  just shoot everything you see! No one is spared to the player... I also love the console system in the game... I play this game on Xbox but got it for Steam and I love the options... but it makes you really want to cheat which sucks... But its ok! the game is still hard! I would recommend this game to everyone who is a serious gamer or who enjoys becoming the character of whom you chose their path, and there are so many to chose from! 9 out of 10. It still has some bugs, but get over it! :D Enjoy playing Fallout gamers!			",53,2,0,6,11,0,5

												Undoubtably one of my favorite games. You cant go wrong buying it. At any price it would have been worth my money. The Fallout games always have a strongly immersive enviornment that really grabs you and pulls you into the game. The soundtrack, NPC detail, and substance in the world all contribute to this. NPC's have personality; NPCs act acording to their peronality and the post apocolyptic envionment that surrounds them. The soundtrack (radio songs) give the game an ""Old Western"" type feel that goes great with the chaos and disorder of the world. They also make the world feel somewhat eerie and desolat; wandering the wasteland, everythings quiet, something could pop out and eat you alive at any moment and your listening to Jingle Jangle. It's a good contrast between sunch a ""fun"" song and a dark enviornment. The songs definently end up growing on you. Every corrner has a secret behind it. The world is full of mystery and curiosity. You can wander in some abondoned building only to discover it ihabited by the hostile robots who once used to work there or find some cave at the bottom of an ocean. The more unfamiliar the world is, the more lost you feel, the more exciting the game is. Mods add even more too the game, adding more immersion, longevity, and options. Some mods might be immersion breaking, I wouldnt recomend those. The game runs stable on most machines I would assume. The quests will never leave you unentertained as they are numorous and almost never ""go fetch this"" of ""find this dude."" The DLC adds hours and hours of playtime so I highly recomend you buy the Ultimate Edition. The DLC is unique, adds characters, story, weapons, items, quests. Each of them are like mini-main story lines, heir more than side quests. The Fallout series is just too great. I hope 4 will be as good as this one. War, war never changes			",110,7,2,8,4,0,3

												New Vegas is the reason why I love listening to Frank Sinatra. Why? Because one thing this game taught me is that there is something magic in exploding heads with a Shotgun while listening to ""Blue Moon"". That's just a new level of awesomness.The start of NV is a little bit boring and cliche. Your character was shot, and you wake up with amnesia: ""Why? Who? When? Where?"" Nothing new to see here. The tutorial also doesn't make a good impression. Shoot some ugly creatures, talk with some folks, make a tour around, just to warm up and to prepare you for the greatness that awaits on the desert. When you step out of the first city,well...that's when things start getting interesting, specially with the V.a.t.s. shooting system by your side. It's time to see some heads exploding, arms getting ripped out, blood spilling all over you...That's when you know you are playing a Fallout game. But it's just 10% of it's awesomness. Everything in the desert seems to tell you a story: the buildings, the characters, the cities, the objects, life just seems to emanete from everything you encounter. The dialogue system flows so well and feels so good and charming that you will get attached to every creature you meet. The quests are also one strong point, because every single decision you make feels like it's changing the world around you, and the destiny of many characters you care about. Is it a perfect game then? No, it isn't. And you want to know why? Bethesda famous trademark, thatt's why...You know,bugs and ugly models. Since Bethesda is Bethesda, you know what's coming. But don't worry, it doesn't ruin the experience...not a single bit. I think it even makes it more charming.If you like to play games, buy Fallout New Vegas. Because when someone asks you ""Why do you like playing games?"", You will know what to answer: ""Fallout New Vegas, mate"". Believe me.			",35,17,0,2,11,2,1

												In ''Fallout: New Vegas'', you return to the post-apocalyptic West Coast of the ruined United States of America, like in the first ''Fallout'' game and its sequel ''Fallout 2''. For the first time you get to explore Nevada and the city of New Vegas. A city untouched by the nuclear warheads that devestated the rest of the world. You take the role of a courier from the Mojave Express in Primm. You were supposed to deliver a platinum chip to the Lucky 38 in New Vegas. A seemingly easy task. But as misfortune would have it, you get ambushed near Goodsprings by a man in a checkered suit and a handful of Great Khans (the descendants of the Khans and New Khans). The man in the checkered suit tells you that it was bound to happent to fall prey to his ambush, before shooting you in the head.You awaken in the clinic of Doc. Mitchell, the doctor of Goodsprings. Here starts your tutorial level and you get to create your character and define their traits. The character creation has been slightly expended upon, since ''Fallout 3'', since you have an age slide now, but other than that it's identical.Once you have done that, you are supposed to talk to Sunny Smiles to start the tutorial level. Here you get taught how to use firearms and V.A.T.S. ( Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System ) and have the optional objective of being tutored in the new skill ''survival''. This skill is particularly handy when you're using Hardcore Mode ( where you can die from hunger and thirst. ).Overall the game is really enjoyable and I have spent many hours on it. You have a lot of freedom, because of the enormous mod database at Nexus Mods and the decisions you make throughout the game have impact at the end game. But don't worry, the choices you make are easily recognised wether they're good or bad. Although if you start the end game, there's no turning back and you're just finished with the game after the slide-show and narrating about the impacts of your action. Luckily, the game automatically saves your game, just before the end game starts, and you can just return to the Mojave Desert after that.Overal I give the game a 9/10			",139,20,1,17,10,2,6

												Fallout: New Vegas utilizes the same engine as its predecessor, Fallout 3 & The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but it offers a new locale within the same imaginative universe of Fallout 3's post-apocalyptic wastelands. If you played and loved the sandbox world of Fallout 3, then Fallout: New Vegas is a must! However, it should be noted that the game's engine still suffers from the same flaws as its predecessor (mouse acceleration, occasional crashes, etc).			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

Takes you to some amazing places of nevada. The expansion story's will make more sense when you beat the main game storyline and side ""quest"". The factions: Caesars legion, Brotherhood of Steel, Ncr, and the boomers. All very amazing with there own perks should you choose to join and rank up in one.This game i reccomend to all, even if you haven't played and previous fallouts.			",64,2,0,5,7,0,5

And you have a helpful community, with community-made patches and a load of mods.You'll probably spend a while on fixing issues like mouselag or mods not working correctly before you actually get into the game, but once you get past that, you have a game that you can keep playing for hundreds of hours.Don't really have much else to say about this.

Lots of unique gear to hunt down and interesting armors you can dress up with. More dangerous enemies and a survival mode that's worthy of the fallout series. Also has cowboys.

												Fallout: New Vegas is a great game for Fallout fans, old and new. You could help Caesar rid the wasteland of all threats but at a lost for freedom for many. You could help NCR take over but listen to their rules and laws. Let anarchy rule the wastes, but let all be free. Or let Robert House gain total control over the Mojave. One of the terrible parts of the game is the fact that you cannot play after The Second Battle of Hoover Dam. You could destroy all factions, major (such as the Legion) or minor (such as the Kings). You can decide wheter to spare or kill the man who shot the Courier. It shows in-game that starting off as someone of minor abilites could make a large difference, as all Fallout games do, and shows that actions have consequences, good or bad.			",11,2,0,10,1,0,0

												Very, very, very fun game. There are many mods for this game so it won't get boring for a couple hundred hours. One new feature about New Vegas is that now there are factions and you choose what factions to help and how the Mojave will be changed by that faction. Karma isn't a big thing in this game, instead it is more focused on factions. Be careful though, if you help out one faction, you might make another faction hate you. The storyline starts off slow but gets more exciting later. While the main story is somewhat short (13 hours) there are many sidequests to do along with sweet guns, secrets, references to movies and cool DLCS. Steam doesn't put this game on sale that often anymore so if you see it go on sale, add it to your cart quickly! I say it is totally worth $20. The only cons about this game are the glitches. But you can get a mod to patch it. Although, after you reach level 30, the adventure sort of stops because you can no longer gain XP to level up. Another cool thing about the game are the vault's stories. Just go and check some of them out. One last downside to the game is that you cannot continue after you beat the main story so you have to continue a previous save and explore all the cool places the Mojave has to offer. Although some of them are a little dull because it is nothing but a shack. Other than that this game is pretty sweet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my personal all-time favourites, Fallout: New Vegas is an amazing entry into the franchise. It includes great RPG elements and a fantastic storyline with several choices available for the player to become immersed in the massive and detailed frontier of the Mojave Wasteland, which has many locations and factions that the player can choose to side with- or destroy.An entertaining combat system is introduced, with iron sights and cinematic kills aided by the satisfying VATS.NPCs and companions are better than ever, as almost every character has their own unique tale to tell and can be linked with a large amount of side quests and unmarked quests, without over-using generic fetch quests and other repetitive mechanics to keep the player occupied.One of the best things about this game is the outstanding modding community, which keeps the game supplied with new content even today, 3 years after its release. From graphics enhancements to new quests, items, locations and characters, it can all be used to make this game even better. I highly recommend this game as it's worth every penny, especially right now with the current Steam sales.			",95,5,0,9,7,0,11

												This is probably the closest thing I have to a favorite game. I spend a lot of time drifting from favorites to favorites; some days it's Deus Ex, somedays it's Planescape: Torment. This is a game that I always come back to no matter what because it has everything I really want in a game.- Active modding community.- Well-written story that's faithful to its predecessors.- Opportunity for completionists and roleplayers alike.- Ability to kill very nearly everyone you meet (even story characters!).- Interesting characters (don't get me wrong, I like Fallout 3 but the characters all have the personality of sandpaper).- Infinitely replayable.- Ambient music, as well as some old-timey Vegas music. And Marty Robbins, if that's what you're into.- Actually fun (fun is this crazy new concept in the game world that is, contrary to popular belief, NOT synonymous to overpriced downloadable content).So as not to sound like a blind fanboy, I'll also fault the game on a few issues.- While this game allows you to develop your character as you choose, I will admit that everything leading up to Freeside/New Vegas feels relatively railroady (as in you're not forced to go forward, that's just where all the action is and there's no good reason not to go forward). Not that this is a major issue, as Fallout 1 and 2 were the same way.- Crazy amount of bugs. Like, game-breakingly bad bugs. Some bugs can render the game unplayable, and you may need to reload a save. If you're like me and you tend to play RPG's late at night, you might find yourself getting nightmares from the following bugs:* Dogs with floating eyes!* String cheese people!* Game freezing while really eerie music plays and you're in an underground bunker surrounded by feral ghouls, and all you can hear is a repeated sound clip of their ghastly taunts!* FalloutNV.exe has stopped working.Thankfully, many of these can be fixed with patches, then broken again with the next twenty mods you inevitably add right after.- Sub-par graphics, but they're passable enough to ignore and there's plenty of community-made ENBs, patches, and graphical tweaks.- The engine isn't great, but it's VERY popular with modders. Some people can accomplish amazing things with it, just look at some of the quest mods.Overall, this is the only game I've ever played that I would give a 10/10. Any issues I find that I have a problem with can be patched and improved. This game is extremely addictive, and I have given it at least 500 hours of gameplay when my time playing it on PS3 is taken into consideration. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas is a bit lengthened sometimes, but still a very cool game.---The gameplay is very conformable to Fallout 3 and it's now possible to use ironsights too, but i never played with it to be honest. V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) + quick aiming via crosshair is the perfect combo in my opinion.Visually it's still looking good after installing better textures and other things from http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/.The story is OK but not good as in Fallout 3. You have to choose a side later in the game. The replay value got increased by that.There are many more things to do as in Fallout 3 quest-wise. It's slightly to much sometimes.Vegas as scenario is very refreshing. :) 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent game. This review is going to be presented very loosely, sorry. I had owned this game before but decided to get it on steam.There's all sorts of tales this game is waiting to tell. Accepting to do a quest which may seem intriguing at the time may not later as it'll sacrifice others which may seem more worth your time; for example, a companion insists that we take down two big companies as they had done something cruel, however doing this will remove the chance to converse with a myriad of interesting characters, which when killing them, may feel like beating up petty dogs- because you hadn't found out their ambitions and characteristics. The game is tailored to the whims of the player and makes you try to justify your actions in order to avoid feeling regretful. Any game can do this on paper, but to make it this enrapturing, requires a team that's dedicated to setting a benchmark instead of satisfying greedy shareholders. This paragraph also highlights the replayability of the game.The quests are intertwined into a bigger system often making you meet new npcs- they give you a better grasp of the motives of the factions and will give you the neccessary information to make your mind up about the ultimate ending. Go through computers and tapes as these tend to be fleshed out with stories. Another example: There's a staff complaint about the unexpected shipment of stealthboys, as some mischievous staff have been using them to satisfy their curious minds, or perverted in this case.I find the unsettling atmosphere to be very engrossing: the sun soaked visuals, rough tarnished surfaces along with the ambient sounds and fallout's occoasional press of a sombre piano key blend in to make New Vegas a belivable wasteland.More songs on the radio(s) would be nice( mods could sort this out though) but then again you'll spend quite a  bit of time in combat, so listening carefully to your surroundings will help and reward you. You may find this game frustrating on harder difficulties when you're suddenly outnumbered and your skills don't seem to be paying off. You're suddenly relying on vats more often to get the dirty work done, and when you're out of it, you're spamming your favorite pistol- which till now had been working wonders just isn't so you're dead. There's always a way avoid these situations.  This is a role playing game in which all the mechanics and options to manevoure a tricky situation in your favour have been realised. If you think not, there's an abundence of mods out there that are dedicated to polishing this gem.Luckily for me, I played this long after the launch date so I've very rarely encountered bugs and I am playing without mods, which i should have a look at.The game truly has spurs that jingle jangle jingle: there's always something which keeps me coming.

												Fallout: New Vegas' Plot and story is very well made and offers something for any kind of gamer. There is no way that you'll ever get bored because there is so much to do. At first, the story may seem slow as you struggle to get decent supplies, but as you progress through the game everything makes more sense and you'll quickly find your bearings. The only bad things about this game that I've realized is that sometimes the game crashes unexpectantly and the terrain can be rather depressing albeit it's supposed to be a wild west theme. Overall, I would give this game an 8/10 for a good story, and great gameplay.			",68,4,0,9,7,0,2

												This game is simply astounding. FInally there is a true successor to the majesty of the old-school isometric Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. The writing is witty and on target, The storylines are engaging. The characters and deep. The setting is immersive. This isn't just a game, its a window to a living world set in the alternate timeline of the whizz-bang neon future of the 1950's torn asunder by war - a future that you must explore!

												(Ignore low playtime, had a disc when I first got it and re-bought the Steam version)This game is excellent.  This is one of the best video games I've ever played, the best Fallout game by far, and a massive accomplishment.  The story is great.  The game lets you play the way you want to play - if you decide you don't want to gun down everything in FPS style, you can negotiate, backstab, and compromise your way through objectives.  The array of side quests and interesting diversion is massive. The mod community basically built another game on top of this one, so you're getting far more than the sticker price.  The DLC ranges from zany fun (Old World Blues) to heartbreaking (Dead Money) to abysmally grim (Lonesome Road).  This is one of the best games I've ever played. I can't recommend it enough.

												This one sticks to lore better than Fallout 3. It's story is dynamic, with lots of choices on which factions to side with and which to oppose. Your actions carry weight, and have their pros and cons. Like all Fallout games it stays true to the dark humor it has, never ceasing to be interesting and this one tests your morals more than Fallout 3 at times. This game is more of a have it your way setup, do what you want and shape the world in your way you see fit. The game improves on weapons and crafting which is much more useful now. Compared to Fallout 3 it lacks on level design, many areas seem to bland but thanks to the characters it's more memorable. So go into the Mojave wasteland, you have a big world to explore.

												Fallout New Vegas is a game in the Fallout Universe that takes place in 2281, 4 years after the events of Fallout 3. You are a courier hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a secret package to Mr.House in New Vegas. A casino manager by the name of Benny wants the?package to take over Vegas so he finds you with aid of the Great Kahns (one of the tribes in the Mojave Wasteland, Benny takes the package (soon to be know as a Platinum Chip) (The Chip can override the securitrons, Robots that protect Vegas. Anyways Benny shoots you in the head and buries you in the Goodsprings Cemetary, a securitron named Victor digs you out of the grave and takes you to the Goodsprings doctor , Doc Mitchell.So you wake up in the Doc's home and you set up your character and all that, After you leave the doctors home you can go to the ""Prospectors Saloon"" and meet a girl named ""Sunny Smiles"" she will give you a gun and let you do target training. In the Mojave Wasteland you can do quests for four opposite factions : NCR (a military army that tries to bring good across the Wasteland), The Legion (a group of slavers, evil people led by Caesar), Yes Man (a securitron?reprogrammed by Benny that would help him take over Vegas), Mr.House (the father of New Vegas who protected most of Vegas from the nukes of the Great War of 2077) The game is addictive so much greatness, you can do quests for people across the wasteland to earn caps, weapons and good or bad karma. I highly recommend the game if you are a fan of Fallout 3 or the past Fallout games, the game is not really that difficult it depends if you are new to Fallout or not. Sounds are great but the game full of npc's should have more voice actors, Graphics are awesome, The game offers a lot especially the DLC's Just be warned the ""Dead Money"" DLC will fill you with rageThe DLC's are:Lonesome Road Honest HeartsOld World BluesDead MoneyCourier's StashGun Runners ArsenalIf you want  a game thats $10 i highly recommend this games $10 is almost a steal			",52,5,0,10,2,0,1

												The younger and more attractive sister of Fallout 3, New Vegas takes pretty much everything 3 does and makes it better. The gameplay is better, the story has more depth to it, and the setting is just wonderful. It's also worth noting that FO3 wasn't 100% accurate to the FO lore, whereas this isn't the case with FONV.If you're familiar with FO3, FONV's gameplay is basically the same, with a few neat additions. If you're not, think of an FPS mixed with an open world action RPG that's broken up by dialog choices and searching for stuff. It really gets at the survivalist mentality that a lot of people seem to be getting into these days.Where FONV differs from the original, outside the obvious gameplay additions, is the story elements. The characters really feel alive in FONV, there's a real charm that New Vegas has that just makes you fall in love. I wish I had more room to talk about it, the FEEL of the game is just so fantastic.Anyway, I highly recommend this game. Highly replayable.			",203,58,4,59,30,1,48

												I consider myself to be a huge Fallout fanatic. Fallout: New Vegas is perfect for those who enjoy a very linear storyline, quirky characters, and open-world exploration. One negative that I found with New Vegas was the amount of walking the player will need to take to progress - unlike Fallout 3 where you could walk a few acres and find a new location, easily.

												Chances are you've seen that Fallout 4 came out and that some people are going crazy about it. Your question; ""Shouls I play any of the old ones?"" Yes. I'd recommend this for most people, but, if you like to explore go for Fallout 3. This game can be played in a seemingly endless amount of ways. You want to be a pacifist? A Scyscopath that collects teddy bears and Dino toys? A badass that kills Deathclaws with only a switchblade? (You probally don't want to do that) If you really want your Fallout experience to be off the charts? Get mods. 'Nuff said.This game is awesome. One of my all time favorites.			",22,1,0,4,0,0,0

												When it comes to the Fallout games, the biggest questions you need to ask yourself usually consist of ""Is it still canon?"", ""Is it really that moddable?"", and probably ""Is it enjoyable?"". Rather fortunately for New Vegas, the answers tend to be yes.The franchise itself is not without some tarnish (looking at the PS2 and Xbox game I'm not fond of mentioning!) but New Vegas is more than capable of delivering the brand from the dark, gritty, heavy metal future it was careening into and taking the series back to its roots: gratuitous sex, violence, political intrigue, and 1950's Americana.New Vegas isn't exactly a flawless jewel of the desert, though. It does have a rushed feel to the ending, like the majority of Obsidian's games (read: KotOR 2 and Alpha Protocol) and the game has an entire phylum of bugs indicitive of a Bethesda game. The game also lacks any sort of sandboxing continuity following the ending, a major flaw for a game this expansive. Play it, regardless.			",86,10,0,9,1,1,15

												Fallout New Vegas is easily one of the most openworld, exciting, gritty games I have ever played. The choices, factions, graphics and wide range of weaponary and outcomes makes this game one of the most gripping, addictive and just simply incredible games out there on the market. You can go from being a sneaky, threatening terrorist working with Caesers legion to a brave, couragous mercanary trying to win independance for the citizens of the Mojave wasteland. Or if neither of these outcomes is to your liking; you can work with a rogue securitron and take over New Vegas for yourself. The sheer amount of gameplay avaliable makes this game unique, addictive and one of the best roleplay/action games of the decade.			",93,13,1,8,11,2,7

My Electric Sheep. My Citizen of Kane.It's moddable, well written, releases serotonin into my cranium. If I could gift it to everyone, I would. This is one of my favorite games. Yeah, the previous games were the best, namely 1 and 2.... tactics, you can come too. That doesn't mean this is awesome. The atmospere, the explorin', the Benny, the Chip, the House, good god.I love this game. Fact.This game is good. Fact.You're a loser for not already having it. Fact.			",174,21,2,23,5,1,14

												This is my favourite fallout game so far, prefer it to fallout 3 as i feel that you have more freedom in exploration and more variety. This is a personal preference though. The missions are really interesting and you have multiple ways to complete them which include the factions that you may want to side with. I also have a guide for the game which is good reading and might help you make the best decision for the way you want to play.Also a big modding community for this, but i think that even without the mods this is really great.

												Not great graphically compared to today's standards (but there are mods for that), but other than that Fallout: New Vegas is probably one of my favourite games of all time. Great story with multiple cause/conseqence endings, roleplayability (that's definitely a word), funny at times and dramatic at others, varying dlcs, fun weapons. I'd recommend this game to anyone, even ones that have never played an RPG before.			",25,6,0,3,1,0,1

												Very immersive; easy to sink many, many hours into this game. Great quests; loads of unique, fun-to-use weapons...quite a few  broken elements to the game though that I'm surprised have not yet been patched/fixed yet. For example, some quests must be completed in a certain order, despite the open-world nature of the game. Can be very frustrating to either go back to an earlier save and complete the quests in the correct order or to find out the console commands to bypass the glitch. Better than Fallout 3 I think, if not simply because it's much less depressing/bleak and it seems like there's a greater density of interest points, or whatever the locations on the map are called. I recommend this game, very fun. DLC is worth it, too!			",112,44,4,19,8,2,13

												i take back what i said a year ago, its worth more than one playthrough, and its good. since i first played it a year ago, i liked it, but then started fallout 3 to find that i enjoyed that one more due to its brutality but i never finished that game. fastforward a year and ive got ~25 hours in skyrim and i need something that is a little less, overwhelming.i reinstalled the game to not only find out that new vegas has cloud support, but that i dumped ~80 hours into the base campaign (well, minus th very last main story quest...) and 2 of the add-on/dlc's (""honest hearts"" & ""old world blues"", both of which i loved); and acording to the wiki, i still got half a map to go through and a look at my pip boy says i got several loose ends to tie up. best part is i get to brave through it with some horrible jack of all trades character i couldnt get to work properly!the only real things i still dislike about the game is cazadores (huge amber wing-colored flies that move at the speed of light compared to your annoying snail's pace), simplistic difficulty setup (needing 300 bullets to kill one creature isnt hard, its just boring, time AND resource-consuming, not making a creative way to ramp up the difficulty of a single-player game just makes the game a drag for those who want a challenge), and the fact that you cant continue to play once you finish the game. thats all i can say that's bad about this game, so buy the ultimate edition now!

												What is there to say about the absolutely best game that has ever been created, except that it is the best game ever made?Perhaps that the game is epic in every way possible, that the story is increadibly deep, that there is almost too many guns for you to possible obtain in one gameplay... Wait.. That last one is probably false. But even if you could collect every weapon in the entire game, you sure as hell would never EVER be able to carry all of them. Now where was I?   Yes, there!*clears throat*That you can install mods on most of your weapons, as long as you  have the ultra-cheap DLC ""Gun Runners Arsenal"", that you can blow/shoot/chop peoples arms/legs/heads of, that you can craft both ammunition and various tools and explosives, that every weapon and armor in the game has got a durability, which means that it will break after you've used it a lot, that the game is increadibly entertaining, humoristic, and silly over all, and of course, that YOU decide exactly what you want to do.If you haven't bought it already, you really should.I assure you, it's worth the money to 110%BUTThere is one downside.The game, at least if you are like me, is addictive as hell.Once I start playing it, it's almost impossible to stop.I guess this pretty much wraps it all up.Also, If you've read this far, you've got to buy the game, or else you and all your family will be brutally butchered while asleep.Good night!

												Fallout: New Vegas is a good game, maybe even a better game than Fallout 3, and here's why. Pros: - The best thing about this game is the music. It's upbeat and hilarious. Even if you're not normally a fan of songs about homicidal cowboys, a lot of these classic 40's and 50's tunes will get stuck in your head all day nonetheless.- The Mojave is a vibrant, interesting background for the kinds of fun shenanigans that make Bethesda games a blast.- The characters in this game are great, and in many ways more interesting than the characters in Fallout 3. - The game engine now allows you to aim using iron sights, as well as a time-freezing mechanic called ""V.A.T.S."" Fallout 3 had only V.A.T.S., no iron sights. - Enemies are more varied and interesting than the same old rehashed enemy types from Fallout 3. Now you can kill ""giant flies"" and ""glorified LARPers in Roman armor made from football gear"", as well as the tried and true ""radioactive zombies"" and ""giant scorpions.""- There's a big modding community that's put a lot of work into creating free content to extend your wasteland experience even further. Sometimes the mods are even as good as the content in the vanilla game.Cons: - It's a Bethesda game. Luckily by now most of the bugs have been patched, or can be patched if you download a few mods from the Mod Nexus. But still, buggy, crashy, sometimes laggy. - The story's a bit meh. Even though the characters are, IMO, better than Fallout 3's, the story isn't quite as fulfilling or engaging. All around, New Vegas is a lovely game with a beautiful soundtrack and a lot of really fun elements to it. Another masterful example of the RPG genre from Bethesda.  ",114,34,1,20,28,1,38

												If you haven't bought this, well, then you're a complete silly since this is one of the best games I've ever played. Fallout New Vegas combines the amazing sprawling open world gameplay of Fallout 3, but mixes in the atmosphere of the first 2 games, making the ultimate Fallout experence. Fans of the first games will feel right at home, and fans who played 3 only will love this to death. The storyline is an incredibly cool power struggle between 3 factions warring for control of Hoover Dam, and ultimately New Vegas itself. New Vegas is the last beacon of humanity, a city untouched by nuclear holocaust. You play a Courier, assigned to deliver a package to New Vegas, when you are shot in the head and left for dead. And so begins a tale of revenge and power. Gameplay is almost identical to Fallout 3, with a few new features. The DLC is great, and it's just fantastic. Buy this now.			",84,16,0,2,3,1,11

												Fallout New Vegas:     FNV is an open world, action rpg set in a post-apocalyptic Mojave desert, with civilization starting to re-emerge out of the ashes. The fairly large map (21 square miles) surrounds one of the few places doing relatively well in the wasteland: Vegas. The landscape in vegas can sometimes be a bore, with a lot of dry rolling hills around you, but the excellent 30's, 40's, and 50's music will make you forget all that, and just hum along.      Story wise, FNV is not amazing, but still good. In the opening cinematic, you, a simple courier for the mojave express company, gets shot straight in the head by a suave, but evil and cocky son-of-a-gun fellow named Benny. Once you are healed in the nearby town of goodsprings, your new goal is to hunt him down and bring him to justice. The story brings the player around the whole map, greeting the player with dozens of side quests. Once the player finally does kill Benny, the story really takes off, allowing the player to join one of the three factions viyng for power, or take over by yourself. The three faction are :The New California Republic, a gorup wanting to bring back the world before the apocalypse, Ceasers legion, a crazy dicator bent on ruling like a roman emperor, and Mr.House, a high tech robot wanting to bring back the 'glory of vegas'.    Gameplay is where this game truly shines. With the old-school RPG like character creation complete with a plethora of unique and fun perks, you can create a variety of different classes, each with their own playstyle, allowing for a lot of replayability. There are dozens of different weapons varying from a simple smg, or an orbital strike cannon, or a plasma rifle, a super-sword thing, and dozens more. With the expansive map filled with locations ranging from a ski lodge with super-mutants, to deep vaults giant fire ants, the postapocalyptic world is a truly crazy place.      FNV is not perfect, though there are hundreds of bugs and glitches, which is to be expected with a game of this size. Some of the quests are bland, and some of the locations are quite small and boring. There seems to also be only a few voice actors, evenif thats not the case. Most of these problems can be fized with mods, which brings me to my next point:the excellent modding community. There are hundreds and thousands of mods on the nexus and various other sites, ranging from high quality lore friendly quests, to crazy weapon packs, graphical overhauls, spiderman cars, companion mods, bug fixes, to more risque things.     With the points made above, I strongly reccomend this game to anybody who loves rpg's action games, well written experiences, and pretty much anyone who has likes video games. I do not reccomend this to a completionist though, much like Skyrim, the buggy quests, and the sheer size of the game makes it quite hard to 100% complete, and maybe not in a good way. To anybody else that likes anything, by this game now.Score(do I need this?) = 8.5/10With mods = 9.5/10			",61,2,0,14,9,0,6

												10/10Fallout 3 was more than a game for me, it was a revelation. The post-apocalyptic setting, deep customisation system, and engaging, witty, touching narrative captured my imagination from the first. I had played RPGs before, and shooters. I had played games that combined TPS/FPS and RPG - games like Bioshock and Dead Space that, though brilliant, did not have the massive sandbox immersion of Fallout. (Criminally, it would be some time before the already-released-at-that-time Shadow of Chernobyl came to my attention.)  Initially Fallout 3's combat felt jagged. TPS, FPS, V.A.T.S., real-time, etc., the number of mechanics seemed to diffuse the combat experience. However I soon settled into the FPS perspective and developed an appreciation for the turn-based flavour V.A.T.S. leant the game. By the time I moved on from Fallout 3 I'd invested 60 hours in the game. By nature a serial monogamist, for me every game I'm playing is, for the time I'm playing it, the only game I'll ever play. And for Fallout 3 that felt a little more true than usual.For nearly a year after purchasing it, Fallout 3: New Vegas sat untouched in my Steam Library. I couldn't shake the fear that its Western styling would be overbearing and tacky, that it would take Fallout 3's brilliantly decrepit post-apocalyptia and riddle it with jerky-chewing cowboys, main-street shootouts, and robots with Texan accents. In the meantime I discovered a number of TPS/FPS-RPGs, games like Borderlands 2, that fed my habit in different ways - and it was after killing Handsome Jack for the fifth time that I turned my still suspicious eye back towards FO:NV My fears of a tacky western-themed cash-in - a sort of anti-Call of Juarez Gunslinger - were almost immediately put to bed. FO:NV inarguably occupies the same world as Fallout 3. The same Gamebryo engine and Havok physics are used by both games. NPCs, mobs, textures and buildings could equally well occupy either game, as could the UI and combat system. FO:NV doesn't just bring the nachos and beer to the party that a DLC might - rather, it fully caters an after-party with open bar, starting at midnight and running till - well, by the time I'd finished FO:NV, I'd happily plowed in an even 100 hours, 40 more than I had with Fallout 3, not just completing but completist-ing the game. Like Fallout 3, The New Vegas DLC are uneven. On the one hand, Old World Blues brings a large new area, rich characters, and a deep, witty, touching storyline. I personally enjoyed this DLC as much as or more than the game itself. Lonesome Road, though shorter, follows not far behind - a self-contained journey I loved every second of. On the other hand, Dead Money is a frustrating deviation from Fallout's tradition of open world gameplay. It forces the player down a very narrow channel indeed, and seems to do everything possible to prevent you from appreciating its hidden gems. It is fraught with cheap tricks and back-tracking, all set in a hopelessly clumsy and claustrophobic map.Fallout New Vegas, like Fallout 3 before it, is a generous game. Its enormous landscape is lousy with well-drawn characters, dark secrets and nascent adventure. The ""sub-quests"" (I hesitate to deprecate them with the prefix ""sub"") hanging off so many items, places and characters are the soul of FO:NV. Like life, even the ""central"" plot is a structure pieced together from numerous tangential sub-plots, each with its own flavour and authenticity. Also like life, the sub-plots that make up this structure are for you to choose, and are different from each and every perspective. Character composition is a true joy in New Vegas; honing your character throughout a thousand decisions, positioning your character according to a hundred others, deciding their stance towards dozens of factions. Morality is not limited to an overly-simplistic system, such as ""positive"" and ""negative"" karma points, or the like. Again, as it is in life, your character's ethics are something you will have to create and hone with every move you make. Perhaps even more so than Fallout 3 before it, New Vegas is a game where the real forum of character creation is not in the levelling of skills, the choosing of eye colour and kitting-out your armory - it is in playing the game itself.

												This was such a nice game to play. I liked the storyline, though I thought it was a bit too short for my taste. Fun quests and dialogues. Had lots of glitches during the game, and it also didn't unlock my steam achievements. But other the that it was a fun game, and I really enjoyed it.			",139,31,1,18,23,0,7

												Fallout: New Vegas transports the player to a completely different world. The introductory video will introduce you to people and factions who will become your greatest enemies and your best friends, but it's left up to you to decide who is who. Playing as an amensiac courier, you must piece together your own past, but when you have all the facts, it's time to decide the future. You face difficult choices that will influence the rest of the storyline which culminate in the Battle of Hoover Dam, but your story isn't over. A final video extends the stories of communities and characters well into the future based on your actions.The iconic Fallout style shows throughout the game, and many old factions are shown in a refreshing light. Each faction has a unique style, philosophy, and history, that can only be gleaned through extensive dialogue options.			",52,5,0,5,6,0,16

												Fallout New Vegas; a cacophony of carnage.I freed the slaves underneath Caesar's boot, I helped bring back order to the NCR and annexed New Vegas for California. I roam the Wasteland of the Mojave bringing order into its system. I burnt out the deathclaw nests, I reopened trade routes for caravans, I've lined the raiders and bandits against the wall and promptly shot them dead.Yet every ♥♥♥♥ing time that karma meter says I've done a good thing.Through all the killing, all the lives I've ruined to save another, all the roads I had to take, to be renowned as a dirty mercenary, a hitman, killer-for-hire, a sinner. Is this the path I chose? A courier turned into vicious psychopath in the eyes of the public? A vicious brute to the Khans, a heretic to the Legion, a murderer to other wastelanders, a Grim Reaper to those without blood money. Is all this blood worth all these caps?Also, great game. Hard to put down, easy to pick up even after going a few months without playing.I prefer this one over Fallout 3. Haven't tried all the DLC yet but it just means I'll have a reason to keep playing after I do try it out, and before I forget.""Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.""

												One of my personal all-time favourites, Fallout: New Vegas is an amazing entry into the franchise. It includes great RPG elements and a fantastic storyline with several choices available for the player to become immersed in the massive and detailed frontier of the Mojave Wasteland, which has many locations and factions that the player can choose to side with- or destroy.An entertaining combat system is introduced, with iron sights and cinematic kills aided by the satisfying VATS.NPCs and companions are better than ever, as almost every character has their own unique tale to tell and can be linked with a large amount of side quests and unmarked quests, without over-using generic fetch quests and other repetitive mechanics to keep the player occupied.One of the best things about this game is the outstanding modding community, which keeps the game supplied with new content even today, 3 years after its release. From graphics enhancements to new quests, items, locations and characters, it can all be used to make this game even better. I highly recommend this game as it's worth every penny, especially right now with the current Steam sales.			",95,5,0,9,7,0,11

												First off, don't believe all that stuff about the game running like♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics being sucky, everything just being awful, it being boring, etc, etc. It's only boring if you try to have no fun. The wasteland is...Supposed to be a wasteland...Some parts...Are irradiated because they're supposed to be...Be a mann and wade through that radioactive sewage! Be a mann and kill those deathclaws! And if this game bores you, just do whatever the hell you want in it. Get power armor and blow up the BOS Bunker with 20200102001 dynamite, slash through hordes of ghouls, just murder everyone. And if murdering everyone and satisfying your bloodlust isn't enough, do it for the nostalgia. And if nostalgia isn't enough/doesn't exist, avoid this game.Gud?1. Many hours of gameplay, many places to explore.2. You get to do whatever you really want to do. Usually with consequences, but go ahead, kill everyone! It's fun!3. Mods. Are. Amazing.4. If you're like me, and are easily impressed by graphics and say Donkey Kong had the best graphics, well, then the graphics are on par with Donkey Kong. If you actually don't think Donkey Kong had the best graphics, then the graphics in this game are pretty good. If you're a stickler, decent. If you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, awful. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, go die.5. So fun to explode people, dismember people...God, I am violent. Also, hardcore mode! Fun!Bad?1. You can only have two companions, one humanoid, one non-humanoid. Can be fixed with mods, so you get out there and make a glorious army!2. Nothing...Else?Please realise that this review is extremely biased. In a non-biased opinion, the game is exceptionally fun and has tremendous replay value if you enjoy exploring and RPGS, and action and stuff like that.			",47,3,0,8,2,0,0

												New Vegas is the reason why I love listening to Frank Sinatra. Why? Because one thing this game taught me is that there is something magic in exploding heads with a Shotgun while listening to ""Blue Moon"". That's just a new level of awesomness.The start of NV is a little bit boring and cliche. Your character was shot, and you wake up with amnesia: ""Why? Who? When? Where?"" Nothing new to see here. The tutorial also doesn't make a good impression. Shoot some ugly creatures, talk with some folks, make a tour around, just to warm up and to prepare you for the greatness that awaits on the desert. When you step out of the first city,well...that's when things start getting interesting, specially with the V.a.t.s. shooting system by your side. It's time to see some heads exploding, arms getting ripped out, blood spilling all over you...That's when you know you are playing a Fallout game. But it's just 10% of it's awesomness. Everything in the desert seems to tell you a story: the buildings, the characters, the cities, the objects, life just seems to emanete from everything you encounter. The dialogue system flows so well and feels so good and charming that you will get attached to every creature you meet. The quests are also one strong point, because every single decision you make feels like it's changing the world around you, and the destiny of many characters you care about. Is it a perfect game then? No, it isn't. And you want to know why? Bethesda famous trademark, thatt's why...You know,bugs and ugly models. Since Bethesda is Bethesda, you know what's coming. But don't worry, it doesn't ruin the experience...not a single bit. I think it even makes it more charming.If you like to play games, buy Fallout New Vegas. Because when someone asks you ""Why do you like playing games?"", You will know what to answer: ""Fallout New Vegas, mate"". Believe me.			",35,17,0,2,11,2,1

You want to go on a mad rampage killing everyone and everything in your path, sure, go at it. feeling like shooting the head off of your very boss, who contracted you to deliver a ♥♥♥♥ing casino chip to him? Why not? Finished the game once before? Want to bypass half the starting quest? You got it buddy! Want to make scrap metal to ammo? get the right perks, skills, and S.P.E,C,I.A.L. and you can do that too! Basicly this game fullfills what it set out to do:Be an RPG. And if you think there's something missing, just check out the modding community, chances are, there's a mod to help you with that.			",37,1,0,2,1,0,0

												I highly recommend this game, to anyone who likes action RPGs. One problem I have with it, is the games abundance of bugs and glitches. Compared to Fallout 3 there are a thousand times more bugs and glitches. Luckily, these problems can be easily fixed with unofficial patches and fixes provided by the modding community. Thanks, to the modding community the lifetime of this game has been increased greatly. One thing I liked most about Fallout: New vegas, is the similar features it shares with its predecessors Fallout 1 and 2, such as traits and getting perks every other level. Fallout 3 was the more stable game of the two, but Fallout: New Vegas gave old players of the franchise a nostalgic feel. Also, Fallout: New Vegas, gave players a wide variety of weapons to choose from, unique locations to visit, and brought back old characters, and factions.

												My favorite game of all time, it is in simpliest form an expansion to Fallout 3 which was made in 2008, a year before this game was released, it was ahead of its time and it combines everything a player would love. The only drawback is it takes a bit of time to fully understand the game and this game to be played to its full potenital...you have to be, well... smart... But you can still have fun if you aren't that great of a thinker, you can  just shoot everything you see! No one is spared to the player... I also love the console system in the game... I play this game on Xbox but got it for Steam and I love the options... but it makes you really want to cheat which sucks... But its ok! the game is still hard! I would recommend this game to everyone who is a serious gamer or who enjoys becoming the character of whom you chose their path, and there are so many to chose from! 9 out of 10. It still has some bugs, but get over it! :D Enjoy playing Fallout gamers!			",53,2,0,6,11,0,5

												Even though I don't have many hours on the PC version, I had hundreds on the PS3. This game is a step forward from FO3. Why? Well, factions are a big one. It's neat how choices you make will change the way a certain faction feels about you. for example, with Caesar's Legion and the NCR. If you decide to help the NCR, you will beocme hated by the Legion, and vice versa. Also, if you help certain factions, they will help you in the final fight at Hoover Dam (Example is the Boomers and the Great Kahns). Another big stepup is the the amount of new weapons and enemies there are. This game feels more story driven than the last, because you can carry it out in multiple ways. The only thing I can see that FO3 had better was that the Karma actually meant something when you play. Also, it can run on Windows 7. I definitley recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world games.			",87,16,0,7,14,0,2

												I played half an hour about two years ago and didn't get the feel of it. After watching a youtube video on how fallout 3 failed to live up to its predecessors (of which I am a huge fan), I gave it a shot.This game IS the real Fallout 3. -It has the humour of the original fallouts.-There is a difficulty curve, along an roughly expected path, unlike the levelling of Fallout 3/Skyrim, etc.-Quests are varied and interesting, with puzzles, rather than endless fetch quests.-The voice acting seems more varied for the most part, and, in the DLC, is quite frankly excellent (I'm looking at you, Old World Blues).-It has ""Romanes eunt domus"" painted on a legion base wall. This is worthy of a point in itself. -Morality is less black and white.-YOU are the main protagonist, rather than following your damn dad around. And revenge is a ♥♥♥♥♥. Just go get it alright? Grab it on a sale with all the DLC for under $10 and you certainly won't be disappointed, especially if you appreciated regular references to the places and people of Fallout 1 & 2 throughout your journey.

												Fallout new vegas, where do i begin. When i first picked up New vegas for the xbox 360, i thought it felt abit stale, like i had already seen this before. But i was wrong, i bought both fallout 3 and new vegas on the pc (again becuase i had them both on the xbox 360) and i completed fallout 3 almost 100%, I LOVE THAT GAME, then i played fallout new vegas. With the same graphics and style as fallout 3 you woulld be surprised when i call this game different from fallout 3, and it is different. New vegas has got everything from fallout 1 and 2 and then just put it into fallout 3, i can tell you know, they chose well to do that. New vegas feels different because the whole setting is more developed then the Capital Wasteland, as in you would see civilisation more often in New vegas, where as in fallout 3, almost everyone is trying to kill eachother, which is nice for both games since it adds more of a reason for me to those whether i should play fallout 3 over new vegas or new vegas over fallout 3. Also new vegas doesn't have that awesome green tint from fallout 3, which is good since its different.			",124,15,0,15,9,0,5

												This is an absolutely breathtaking game, from the first cutscene to the final battles. Even once the main game is finished (that takes a while and consists of tons of missions, gameplay, and stories), the DLC's add so much more to the game. I would recommend this game to any single-player FPS fan, and even those who want to have a shooter, but don't have much experience with shooters or long games with great, complex stories. Definitely my favorite game ever.			",76,4,1,4,8,0,8

												Pros:-An extremely well written story with multiple endings that not only include the main factions but minor ones as well that makes each playthrough a little different. -Multiple character builds, melee, unarmed, guns, energy weapons, explosives or just a passive playthrough. -Four amazing DLC, the worst one is Dead Money but it's still worth playing through. -Extremely artistic dialogue that shows reason and logic on both poles of the political compass of New Vegas. -A well done playthrough will take at least 25 hours (45 or more doing the DLC)-Wide variety of weapons-Multiple ways to accomplish something. You want to get into a safe? You can pick lock it, hack into a terminal or loot the password off of the owner, etc. -Lots of side quests that make the content seem limitless. -Great Fallout 1 and 2 references that bring nostalgia back from the Windows 98 days. Cons:-There is a lot of unused map space, making it about 1/4 smaller than in Fallout 3-There's a ton of useless locations that serve no purpose other than just cluttering up the mini-map-Lack of voice actors makes conversations repititive. -Game is prone to crashing, rubber banding and audio skips-Issues with CTD'ing when I first purchased it. -Invisible walls in the game make traversing the waste land very annoying-Game is a lot more scripted than in Fallout 3-The main quest line is only fun the first time playing through. SPOILER ALERT: Basically, you're shot in the head and you're tracking down the guy that killed you and while you're tracking him down, you sometimes have to do side quests for people to get information on the whereabouts of your wouldbe assassin. The only reason you'd do these side quests on a second playthrough on up is for experience and for a longer ending. Other than that, they're useless. -I found the Vegas Strip to be an incredible let down. Throughout the game, they make it to be this big and marvelous place but when you get there, you're like ""meh"". 8.5/10Great game, worth every penny, just some minor issues that seem to bog it down from being perfect.

Pros:-Interesting characters and quests-a true fallout game-improves on nearly every aspect of fallout 3-amazing, atmospheric soundtrack-loads of replay value (700+ hrs)-great modding community adds even more replay value-great level design across the board-good optimization-simplisticCons:-low-res, unappealing graphics, even for 2010-poor aiming and combat-main story isn't as engaging or interesting as fallout 3-buggyConclusion:A very unique and well done game that improves upon much of Fallout 3's shortcomings. If you didn't like 3, you probably won't like this game, either. Absolutely worth every dollar. There are so many different ways to approach quests & you can be any character you want: bad, good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, whatever. There are a wide variety of guns and clothes to choose from. If you like this game at all, it can definitely suck your life away. Better than Fallout 4.			",34,0,0,6,1,0,0

												Set in a post-nuclear desert known as the Mojave Wasteland, you are a courier searching for the man who tried to kill you. Weapon sights, more varied perks, cooking and crafting systems, quirkier writing and a larger variety of gear and characters separate NV from Fallout 3. Unfortunately, the graphics are terrible (no environment shadows, muddy textures, undetailed meshes, and so on), AI is laughable, and combat is a mess of suicidal NPCs either strafing or standing completely still. Fortunately, combat isn't all - conversations and the choices you make are important. You'll be able to threaten, praise, blackmail and so on, influencing other people - alongside the impact that your skills, traits and perks also have. Sadly, most characters are boring or lifeless due to sloppy writing, terrible animations and sub-par voice acting. Plagued by design problems, bugs and a disappointing ending, NV is quantity over quality. It gets the job done, but it could have been a lot better.			",178,23,1,24,16,0,16

												One of my most favorite games ever made. The only issue is that there IS an ending. But as long as you avoid it, It provides endless hours of immersive, post-apocolyptic fun! If you have the money this game is a neccesity.			",102,7,0,18,5,0,3

												More story-based than RPG.Not saying thats a bad thing.I will say to NOT ignore side-quests in this game since they affect everything (including the ending).Also, get a bug-fix, it helps a lot.One more thing, save a lot.Done.			",29,3,0,7,0,0,0

												What is there to say about the absolutely best game that has ever been created, except that it is the best game ever made?Perhaps that the game is epic in every way possible, that the story is increadibly deep, that there is almost too many guns for you to possible obtain in one gameplay... Wait.. That last one is probably false. But even if you could collect every weapon in the entire game, you sure as hell would never EVER be able to carry all of them. Now where was I?   Yes, there!*clears throat*That you can install mods on most of your weapons, as long as you  have the ultra-cheap DLC ""Gun Runners Arsenal"", that you can blow/shoot/chop peoples arms/legs/heads of, that you can craft both ammunition and various tools and explosives, that every weapon and armor in the game has got a durability, which means that it will break after you've used it a lot, that the game is increadibly entertaining, humoristic, and silly over all, and of course, that YOU decide exactly what you want to do.If you haven't bought it already, you really should.I assure you, it's worth the money to 110%BUTThere is one downside.The game, at least if you are like me, is addictive as hell.Once I start playing it, it's almost impossible to stop.I guess this pretty much wraps it all up.Also, If you've read this far, you've got to buy the game, or else you and all your family will be brutally butchered while asleep.Good night!

												This game... When it was released, I hated it. The map was smaller than 3's and it just didn't feel like how I wanted it to. But then as time went on and it seemed as if we were never going to get a Fallout 4, I came back to it, started modding it and really just enjoying the game for what it is. AND THEN, YEARS LATER.... FALLOUT 4 CAME OUT! While I did and still do enjoy FO4 from time to time, it really made me appreciate New Vegas. Fallout 4 has the huge map, the shooting mechanics and the great graphics, but where it failed is where New Vegas shines, in the gameplay, the RPG elements and actually good game mechanics. If you're looking for the REAL Fallout experience then play Fallout New Vegas, it's a great game with a HUGE modding community to keep you busy for hours and hours before or after you fininsh the main storyline depending on whether or not you're using CAGE (Continue After Game Ending). If you're having stuttering problems, get Fallout Stutter Remover. Want weapons? Check out the Millenia team on Nexus. If you're looking for a quest mod, check out the New Vegas Bounties series by Someguy2000. For those of you who are scared by the word ""MODDING"", as a grizzled modding veteran, here are a few tips I will give you.1. The first thing you should do for ALL BETHESDA GAMES is download the corresponding Script Extender for that game, for New Vegas it is NVSE.2. There are numerous tools you can (should) use to mod your game: Nexus Mod Manager/FallOut Mod Manager to install your mods for you and LOOT to manage your load order (which is the order by which your mods are loaded and if done incorrectly you will have compatability problems like missing textures or Crashes) but not to worry, LOOT will do that for you. 3.Then, there's FNVEdit, this tool is used for cleaning mods, and it requires a bit of modding know-how so for people new to modding, don't get this till you're a little more experienced.4. Don't feed the Yao Guai... That is all...Well.... I guess that's it then, To all you Fallout newcomers reading this: Enjoy the ride, it's going to be a long one, and to those, like me, who have devoted countless hours into playing and modding this game, I guess we've got a case of the Old World Blues.

												Though I feel that fallout 3 was a better game, It can't be said that new vegas is a bad one. Tons of side quests, branching factions, and content will surely keep both beginners to the series and old fans happy with bethesda's take on the post-war mojave desert.			",204,11,5,18,9,0,12
