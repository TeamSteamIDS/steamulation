												Zombie Shooter 2 is a fun game that builds on the first one. There is definitely more of an RPG feeling as you get to choose from quite a few perks to make the gameplay more interesting. There is more of a story, and the graphics look less arcadish and more gritty. Definitely stronger than the first title. This is a fun game to play when you want to kill zombies and relax while doing it. I have had fun playing this with family multiple times			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Certainly a better designed game than the first Zombie Shooter, but I think it lost a bit of the mindless janky fun when the quality improved. It's still fun to mindlessly mow down zombies, but there's a lot more RPG elements in this one with stats and buying weapons. There are a couple vehicle sections that are fun. I was playing on easy and came to a spot that seems impossible about 2/3 through the game. I'm not having enough fun with the game to continue pounding my head against this wall, so I'll consider my time with this game completed.			",680,270,14,90,52,8,108

A missed opportunityWeeeeelllllll! How do we start?This game is slightly better than Zombie Shooter, but as a sequel it's still weak.Pro: - Characterbuilding and choice of different characters.       - Graphics that look darker and more fiting to the genre.Con: - The gameplay still is sucky, there are sometimes invisible obstacles that stop a shotgun burst amongst other bugs.        - The sound gets soon very enervating, especialy the noises that double up as music.        - Though it's dated, the game could have been more than what was delivered. It is better than part one, but since part one was the original sin - this game doesn't at all get away good.All in all there is to say, this game is only good when on some kind of bundle. And even then it might dissapoint you. I can't recommend this game even to genre die hards, because it has only a limited charme.			",1553,811,51,244,215,11,265

												Zombie Shooter 2 is pretty much just a slightly upgraded version of the original. However whereas with the two original Zombie and Alien Shooter games Zombie was the slightly better game with the sequels Alien Shooter is the superior speciment, for what little that means.They're still pretty much the same game. For the sequel a small RPG feature was added and the maps opened up a bit more. Unfortunately it's still a pretty crappy game, not really worth your money.Thanks to the Indie Gala however many people will end up owning this and if you do you can get quite a few more hours of out this because it's done away with the atrocious short campaigns of the original. With a bit of exploration there is 5-6 hours in Zombie Shooter 2 and while it can be good for a bit of fun the game is just such a low budget money grab that you will feel a little dirty after playing.Best selling point of Zombie Shooter 2 is the dialog and voice-acting which is so bad it actually is hilarious.

												Ugh. I enjoyed the first game, so I was slightly excited to see what improvements were made with the sequel. Instead of being sprite-based, it has polygon zombies and character models. That sounds like an improvement, but it chugs on my system. My computer can max out any AAA game as of this review. Even after turning the settings to low I have the same problem.Also, you can see that they tried to change/upgrade the weapon system, but it turned it into a clunky mess. The voice acting is terrible. You can tell it's europeans speaking with terrible American accents. Actually, that may be the best part of the game.  ",718,178,11,58,65,8,79

												[Pros]-Three modes availiable: Campaign, Survive and Gun Standmode. Play first the Campaign mode, then the others. They extent the gameplay time significantly. Only the Campaign Mode took me 5 hours to complete it.-When you start playing the Campaign mode of the game and you are ready to select a character......READ THE BIOS OF ALL THE CHARACTERS!!! The Bios are the best part of the game!!!I'm joking of course, but please read them.They are the most wtf, weird, unbelievable, hilarious, background stories I ever read!!!! Pure gold!!! -You start the game with a special perk for your character. I wanted to say all the perks are good, but..........select the Vampire perk right away. Killing millions of zombie/mutants hordes and getting health for each kill is the best way playing this game [for me at least].-The gameplay is a pure action shooter with some RPG elements on it. You get levels after you killed enough enemies and you can update your character by putting point in different skills.Also you can change the weapons/items you are using depend how useful/powerfull is for you.-The weapons are indeed the biggest part of the game. Nearly all the weapons you are using in the game are perfect and enjoyable murdering the endless waves of enemies you meet. Also they are so many of them that I finished the Campaign mode without using them all!!!Every single time I found or bought a weapon, I acted like a little kid trying my new awesome toy.-Many secrets you can find in the game and gladly nearly all of them are actually worth find. Find a secret a get a powerfull armor/weapon is always welcome.-Big Variety of enemies to fight from a simple zombie rat to giant mutants with rocket launchers!!! My favourite enemy are the wing naked ladies you fight :3-The story is hilarious, classic ,cliche B-Movie style and ridiculous. Even the dialogs are cliche as f*ck.-The enjoyment of killing thousands or enemies in a sigle room after a hard day at work......Aaaaaaaaa the feeling is good.I suggest you to buy the Minigun and a giant Multi-Rocket Launcher as soon as possible. -Controlling a Tank and a FlameThrower Robot is a nice break and relax a little for worring about dying. [Cons]-The graphics are VERY outdated and look indeed like a 10 years old game, but let face it, they serve their purpose and the gore look good. Personalty not a con for me, but for others it might be.-Before start playing, go in the Graphics options and turn of three things: Film Effect, Vsync and Bw/Color.Two reasons why:1.If the Vsync is on, the game surprisingly lag REALLY bad. I hope this not happen to others, but test it first to be 100% sure.2.The Film Effect and Bw/Color make the game look like a black n' white Horror B-movie. However this didn't worked for me....I prefer to see the things as it is in this case.-Problem with the screen resolution. I tried many times to fix it for a 16:9 monitor, but again the screen doesn't fit. -The unpleasant feeling when you try to move around to small places and get stuck from small objects.-At some point you will drive a car with a giant gun on top of it. Sound great but sadly the driving is terrible...-It is a Zombie game. Yes, in our days the Zombie Theme is a negative and I will admit, I am sick of it as well a little myself.Final ThoughtIf you want to have a relaxing day by killing a massive hord of zombies with a giant variety of weapons, this game is for you. However I suggest you to seek for guidance on Forums if you have technicals problems with the game.Also if you are sick of Zombies, then this game isn't for you.8/10			",767,341,9,95,54,6,85

												 I have to say I liked Zombie Shooter 2 more than the Alien Shooters, but I think that is personal preference.Is it much different from Alien Shooter 2? Not really, the music is the same, the graphics (and environments) are the same, the characters you can play are the same- same for the gameplay. The three survival missions are the same as in the other games, too. Only difference- you shoot zombies instead of aliens.So why do I like this one more than Alien Shooter 2? I like the layout of the screen, start screen and the menu more- they are more sombre and better fitting the the theme of the apocalypse.  I also like the ""storyline"" more- although you won't get any Shakespearian plots here.  The campaign and missions are different from Alien Shooter 2,so you are playing through different levels- although the environments are basically the same as in Alien Shooter 2.Oh, and this time round you have also the option to play the game in black and white- with only the blood as red (or green). Quite atmospheric.Should you buy this?If you liked Alien Shooter 2 and like more of the same, I can recommend this, I had quite some fun with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sequel to ""Zombie Shooter"", now with improved graphic and some story added for single campaign.Campaign mode has 15 levels and needs 4 to 6 hours to complete.Although many weapons are added, most of them are useless so don't expect much replayability.Just play campaign mode once and uninstall and move on.I wouldn't have bought this game unless I had got it via ""Alien vs Zombie"" bundle for US $0.99. lolTips for campaign mode: Just buy weapons for slot 3 as slot 1 & 2 becomes useless on latter part, and choose ones based on its price, the more expensive the better.A rocket launcher with higher damage and wider blast range is enough to clear the path.Most of newly added weapons are useless so try to save your money.Remember to buy missile-intercept drone, it's one of indispensable items on latter part!(Japanese translation below)==================================================Zombie Shooterの続編、前作に比べグラフィックが向上しキャンペーンモードには物語性が多少つきました。今回のキャンペーンモードは全15面で、4～6時間程度でクリアできます。武器や装備がやたら増えましたが大半は役立たずです、クリアしたらアンインストールして次のゲームを探しましょう。101円のエイリアン対ゾンビバンドルが無ければ、まず買うことは無かっただろうゲームです。キャンペーンモードで役立つ情報：数ある武器の中で役に立つのは3つの武器スロットのうち3番目のスロットだけ、残り2つは序盤で使うだけで終盤は使う機会がありません。より値段の高いものほど優秀ですので、大半の武器は無視してひたすらお金を貯めましょう。高火力で誘爆範囲の広いロケットランチャーが1つあれば、並み居るゾンビ共を蹴散らして突き進めます。またミサイル迎撃ドローンが店屋に並んだら必ず買いましょう、後半で必須と言っていい装備品です。			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E6 Alien and Zombie Shooter 2 

			Views: 1,119		

			Both of these games are awesome and worth the small price, if you really like one maybe consider getting both, otherwise just test out the demos for what looks most interesting for you and stick with...		

Zombie Shooter 2: An awesome take on run and guns that gives you some unique survival modes that can give you a good solid few hours of entertainment and a decent campaign to play in which you kill the hordes of horrific undead monsters. Like the other shooter, it takes on some RPG elements like getting points and experience to raise stats as well as money to spend and buy different and bigger guns and armor. $10.00 USA regular on steam, a bit more than Alien Shooter 2 and not as refined with its UI in-game, as always wait for a steam sale if you can, however if you gotta pick Zombies and you like what you see test out the demo and buy it for yourself, either way you, won't be disappointed -Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork ",349,48,4,71,30,3,49

It's best if gamers just stick to the first episode or Alien Shooter 2.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Overall this is a decent top down mass monster killer alike Smash TV or Alien Swarm.  However the recomended settings of Black & White with film grain really do not give it justice.  Chance the settings to color, lol.  I did feel that it felt much more clunky than other games of this type and Zombie Shooter 1 is actually a more fun and enjoyable game.   The basic concept is to play level to level, buying new guns and upgrading your basic stats with each level & cash.  Only purchase if you love these kinds of games.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												I'm a really big fan of old alien shooter and alien shooter 2. These 2 was one of my favourite games 10 years ago. And I really like zombies. But wtf is this? It looks like first alien shooter with changed textures, buggy engine and alot of more crap. I'm not even talking about boring gameplay. I played like first 3-4 levels of storyline, and they were so bad . Somehow I walked out from map while looking for secrets few times. I stucked few times in a wall, and just died from nothing. Don't waste your time with this one.			",23,2,0,4,1,0,1

												This sequel manages to be worse in every game play aspect. The graphics, models, sounds, and music appear to be the same, so you should expect a very cheap presentation and overall quality. This is very low budget even on a 1990s standard. The voice acting is absolutely terrible, which made me actually laugh a few times in the beginning, and the game gives you the chance to cringe because of it quite often. The AI has not been improved over the first game, and this is made obvious from the very first zombie you face. They have a tendency of spinning in place and being stuck, with conjunction of terrible path finding abilities. The developers decided to make the display grainy and purposely of lower quality than it would already naturally be, as well as using a very small amount of color throughout the game. There are spelling errors throughout the bleak mission briefings, as well as many bugs and glitches that manifest themselves as menu issues and clicking problems. The game play mechanics have stayed about the same as the original, where you simply move and shoot at any zombies coming your way, but also with the addition of operating a turret from a moving car that you have no control over. Zombie Shooter 2 looks and feels like an extremely low-end development, with all of its facets being obviously rushed, poorly designed, badly implemented, and generally deprived of creativity and any true enjoyment. The original Zombie Shooter provided the player with mindless and lackluster game play, but at the very least it had its few game play merits of running and gunning with the occasional smile or smirk. The sequel fails in the continuation of the series, and carries on lousily while adding many other problems that did not exist in the original. The character's movement is sluggish and sometimes not very responsive to control. It feels like Zombie Shooter 2 was a junior college computer programming project that was barely finished. It lacks polish, imagination, and game development technical skills. The folks at Sigma Team have showcased how limited they truly are. The game's description boasts RPG elements that do not actually exist in any way, shape, or form. There is simply nothing there to make any such absurd claim. You are able to make weapon and ammunition purchases, as well as some other items that may aid you through each of the levels, but there are no RPG mechanics or elements whatsoever. This claim is basically not true. Upgrading health, speed, and accuracy do not equate role playing mechanics. The difficulty levels are not programmed properly, in addition to some of the stronger zombies being extremely overpowered and with an unreasonably large amount of life. Sadly, there is just too much wrong with Zombie Shooter 2. It is almost entirely crippled, unbalanced, and limited in every describable way. The music is also rather poor and of low production value, but thankfully, you are allowed to turn down its volume or to mute it completely. The loading times are atrocious for such a low quality game run from a modern computer. The vehicle levels where you are able to control direction while shooting can be slightly satisfying, yet short lived. The save system is nothing short of idiotic. It does not use checkpoints, and it does not allow you to save mid level, or any time you so desire. What it does instead, is that it saves it for you at the end of each level only. This means that if you die during a level, or near the end of a level, you will be forced to do it all over again from the beginning; meaning that you may waste another 30 minutes or longer attempting to beat certain levels again and again. The unbalanced and overpowered enemies makes this bad design decision much worse. If you have enough patience for an extremely poor, low budget title, there is some small amounts of fun to be had with Zombie Shooter 2. There is really not much to enjoy in it.Zombie Shooter 2 is bad.			",1294,339,60,143,147,16,197

												From the great makers of Alien shooter, the Zombie shooter 2 (steam) is quite enjoyable, and if you have ever set your hands on alien shooter once you'd instnatly get that great feeling back.There is a wide selection of characters aswell as plenty of weaponry to keep the hordes of the undead away from you, the game is a RPG action game. Level up, rack the stats up, buy new sell old weaponry and go chaos on the undeads.I think the reason I am loving the game is you can feel the Alien Shooter in the game, the mechanic is lovely and there is a lovely voice acting with the npcs which could keep you interested to proceed to the next area :)7/10			",730,217,26,101,67,10,102

												This is the game that came before Alien Shooter 2 reloaded. If you are familiar with the Zombie/Alien Shooter games and liked them then you will like this one. Major draw back about this game is your forced to play in a sort of black & white screen color. Only blood,explosions,weapons,gfx effets are in color everything else is in black n white. Annoying and odd move by the dev but I always play with nightvision goggles so eh.I recommend getting it in a pack that has the other shooters in it or when its on sale for 75% off. Do not know if I would pay $10 for it (no offense to the dev) but the screen color is to big a turn off.			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

												Well this game not the best, but not the worst as well. For the price You can get it, it is worth. The one thing that I was a bit dissapointed, it was that it felt completely the same as Alien Shooter 2 only with zombies in it. But regarding that, it is great time waster, when You dont want to play anything serious, don't have mood for serious gaming, or just dont know what to do. So if looking for some cheap time waster, with shoot them all gameplay, it is worth it.			",184,35,2,37,27,0,33

												Nostalgia! This game was obviously developed to mimic many of the old school top-down shooters from the 1997-2001 period. This game is cheesy, incoherrnet, unforgiving and heaps of fun. Unique characters, retro graphics with interesting contrast and use of light, simple leveling system, 90's techno music,♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of cool guns and an absolute ton of zombies to mow down. Campaign took me just under 5 hours, and I'm still getting some fun out of survival mode. If you can appreciate the retro style then this is a great game to kill some time on.

												Zombie Shooter 2 is a far departure from the first Zombie Shooter. In some ways the departure from the series is good, but mostly it’s bad and ruins what makes the original fun. Zombie Shooter 2 has way more structure than the original as there is actually some degree of freedom and choice with weapon selections now. You can buy guns and sell those you found or guns that you no longer have any use for. Sadly that’s all the positives. The gun control and accuracy is the most important aspect of top down shoot-em-ups, Zombie Shooter 2 flops hard on this aspect with it’s floaty♥♥♥♥♥controls and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t terrain hitboxes. The graphics while acceptable were overdone with shadows, film grains, and other post processing to hide imperfections, low detail and cloned foliage, as well as bad textures. This in turn causes horrible performance issues in some action packed scenarios. Mix all of the above with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ npc dialogue and balance issues and this becomes a passable title.

												attempts to improve the first game force a nosedive in quality. the first zombie shooter was entertaining for its lighthearted feel and solid gameplay. zombie shooter 2 tries to hamfist a story and nigh desecrates its pacing with heavier and uneeded rpg elements. not a single person on earth is going to take this game's story seriously. I say that because I'm not either. the difference between an excuseplot of the original to the sequel's full-on b-movie feel isn't very enjoyable because the game's artstyle and music do not coincide with the scenario. this would only be a minor complaint if the game delivered on its gameplay but sadly it does noton the positive side, stats and perks actually matter. on the negative side, because now they do matter, it is possible to have a character that really isn't equipped to face the final levels (I recommend cash perk if you're going to play). cash is MUCH more important so save for the bigger weapons and only the big weapons. you see, instead of having fps weapon bar with everything at your disposal, you have only 3 weapon slots: small, medium, and large. this more or less means you use a pistol, machine gun, and rocket launcher... the whole game. being that the enemies are generally idiots the lack of interesting guns until very far in contrasts with the pacing of the original. the insistance on rpg elements makes the early half of the game a sort of a grind and, really, I just wanted to shoot zombies, not deal with half-arsed progressionso there is equipment now, but it is just armor that functions like old fps (and the previous game) and implants that raise your stats. changing implants for your situation can supply depth, but it is marginal. sometimes I wanted more hp, sometimes I wanted to move faster. the OPTIONS! anyway it's stupid expensive to repair armor so you're further punished for just playing the game. if you take damage in a level run through then you're digging yourself into a hole unless you're wearing cheap or no armor - and then why is there even armor? ammo for powerful weapons is also expensive, so yeah. have fun with your pea shootersthe game is an exercise in poor resource management. the enemies and environments are varied enough to warrant a good time, but instead of being a jump-in action game, it's some kind of frustrating survival shooter. hordes of zombies with rediculous amounts of life aren't really how survival games operate. the inventory system, story, and rpg progression are a step back from the original, basically. I must praise the game's so-called film filter though, it gives the game a unique feel that was somewhat lacking from the original. I'd turn off the black&white option though - what's so fun about black blood. the soundtrack is on par with what sigma puts out, so play your own music gents.or don't play this game, it's not worth the aggravation. did I mention there are points in the game where you can get stuck in the environment? totally stuck, movement will get you walking into the walls. it's possible to leave the way you came out, but it may take minutes to figure out the precise angle, and many people find that they need to restart the levels. if you, for some godawful reason, really need more zombie shooter, try alien shooter. if you have to play this game, give easy mode a shot. I did not play on easy mode but I wish I did. the modal difficulty does not excuse the game's flawsto quote the game's villian, ""farewell... and let the progeny... understand me...""

												Good game. If you like shooters you shouldn't pass this one up. A sequel that's even better than the classic that spawned it. That's rare folks...			",2,1,0,0,2,0,0

												Excellent game. I love both Zombie Shooter games, and this one just adds to the first. If i recall this one does get a little harder at times than the first game. Very entertaining isometric horde shooter. Buy it!			",522,106,31,71,69,3,89

												I'm not sure I understand the bad reviews.Yes, this is a trashy little shooter game. But it does it well!You will be done in a few hours, even if you give it a second playthrough on a higher difficulty level. But those few hours I thoroughly enjoyed. There's a choice in weapons, blood and gore as much as you want and a good zombie mayhem atmosphere.The pricetag might be a bit high, but not by much. All in all this was a fun experience for me.

												Well, what can I say... The game has improved a bunch when it comes to atmosphere. You still shoot up zombies, insane amounts of them by the way (not really). You collect money and ammo and stuff and get better weapons to kill the stronger zombies even harder and so on. Still fun! Unless you really don't like these games. But if you do, meh, you can give it a shot, but this game isn't much of a must. The voice acting though, that's terrible.All in all, it's recommendable, but kind of ""meh"" status. Hope you get what I mean.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.
