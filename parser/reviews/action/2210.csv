												Just played through Quake IV. I got to say I was super surprised of how much I liked playing through this game. I thought this was going to be a lot like DOOM 3, but Quake IV is different. A lot different in my opinion. The single player storyline has a sort of high-tech sci-fi feel to it. The environment is very exciting and unique.  I also liked the squad-based combat. Playing through Quake IV was highly enjoyable and would definetely recommend to play this game. HIGHLY recommended.  10/10			",70,0,1,15,21,0,18

												Sorta like Doom 3. But feels like multiplayer in single player. I have been playing this game for a long time, and wrote the complete walkthrough. Graphics are great, for a game made in 2003/4. Plus... WIDESCREEN SUPPORT! WOOH!!!!! I would recommend this game to basically anyone. It uses the old health system which is OP. I remember when this game first came to store shelves. And how fast it flew off of them. Very long, but it is worth it. I personally like games that give a long story line. I feel alot more involved, than a short campaign. I remember upgrading my graphics card for this, Nvidia Geforce 7950gt, I think.VOTE ""BEFORE IT WAS COOL"" Awards 2016.			",36,2,0,1,1,0,5

												Gameplay wise, it doesn't really feel like a Quake game should do. Instead it feels much more linear, slower paced, and steel corridor-based just like Doom 3. While the gameplay might not be worth writing home about, the enemies are pretty awesomely designed and there are some great sound effects, music and visuals that help make the game's ""alien warfare"" atmosphere stand out really well. And there are some occasional vehicle sections that usually take place in wide open areas.Although I generally think Raven Software did a better job with Wolfenstein 2009's gameplay (despite it being very COD-esque), it's still pretty fun shooting aliens in the face with the famous Quake weaponry making a much appreciated return appearance, not to mention there's also one particularly very memorable sequence, which I won't talk about here.Overall, worth playing if you enjoy shooting gruesome monstrosities in the face in a gritty sci-fi environment (like I do), but don't expect TOO much from the gameplay if you enjoyed the older Quake titles.

												Quake 4 is yet another linear old-school'ish FPS in a Quake franchise. A franchise where no previous games were connected to each other, think of Final Fantasy. Quake 4 is proud exclusion, being a direct sequel to Quake 2, where space marines battle against cyborgs made of steel and human flesh on their planet. It was developed by Raven Software in 2005. And uses Doom 3 engine, so beware of sharp dynamic shadows.There also was Collector Edition which came with Quake 2. As you expect, Steam version is not one. And there also was X360 port, that had Quake 2, some achievements and a bad optimisation. Not missing much there.So, as for technical side. You will notice that textures are low quality even on Ultra Setting. That's because engine doesn't recognise mordern hardware for what it is and thinks you have very little memory and refuses to put correct settings in. You have to edit config files for textures. I recommend you to take a look at Steam community guides, there is a good one that tells you what commands to change.I also would still have some small glitches with lights/shadows after playing for a while, but very minor and rarely, unlike what I had in Doom 3.Another thing is that it had an awful lot of stuttering, especially when opening door to a new room. As if it tries to load something but for some reason has a lot of problems.While game has options for widescreen aspect ratios, not all widescreen resolutions are there. Edit config for those too.No alt-tab in fullscreen and no Steam Overlay.As for multiplayer community, it's tiny. There are only few people, I only got to play in 3-player deathmatch. But in all honesty, since Multiplayer is similar to Quake 3 Arena one, it can be quite enough. You know, game where people tend to duel.Apparently a lot of servers use Q4Max mod. It's low size anyway, and only seems to add more server options for competetive scenes, like full-bright skins, while not changing core gameplay itself, so it's OK. And some fixes. And gamemodes.And in this plot you play as Kane, a silent protagonist and a badass who already got famous for things we don't get to do in this game. You are part of Rhino squad with who you will spend some of game time too, occasionally.The Earth launched a second invansion on Strogg planet, hoping to fully clean it up while they are in supposed chaos as the certain badass killed their leader in Quake 2 (and another badass destroyed base on asteroid and another sissy blew up Gravity Well). Sure thing it was about as effective as assassination of political leaders, especially when we are talking about polished army of machines with purpose to kill, so you are about to get some more of hot time.But at least this time 99% of marines weren't immeditly killed.Not to mentioned that this time you will have some small cutscenes, radio chatters and NPCs to give the world more of living feel and to move a storyline. While still mostly focused on action and gameplay.And yes, while it's not mazes, rather being what you would call a corridor shooter, it still can be considered old-school action. While having badass graphics. Frankly it didn't try to be spooky or dark like Doom 3, instead deliviring some shooting and aciton that Doom 3 didn't. And if you measure quality of FPS by how effective shotgun feels, then buy it immeditly, because shotgun in this makes ragdolls hoversault and just blows.And yea, it's continuation of Quake 2, so you will see some familar elements from that game. But I feel that this one realized them much better. Which wasn't hard, seeing how Quake 2 felt unimpressive and somewhat generic even for a year of it's release. I mean, what tech advantages of Q2 would matter if you can't see anything past color red of art style. Anyway, Quake 4 isn't red, it actually has a art style that can show you dark grotesque images of creepy meat factories while staying colorful. Everything was slightly redesigned to be more badass too.Gameplay also can be counted as superior. This one seems to pull weapons from Quake 3 arsenal though, with lighting gun and such. Well, with blaster instead of gaunlet. Don't worry, they are balanced around each other for single-player, having need to reload and special abilities of some. Monsters aren't as lame either. Melee berserkers can actually chase you down instead of never being able to hit a walking player. Monsters aren't as hitscan based either, having plenty projectiles to shoot and tactics to employ, making it more varied and fun too.It's just shame that I can't say that it's music is better than Quake 2 soundtrack. I mean, main menu theme is nice and such and very Quake-like. But during actual gameplay you will be only occasionally hearing some kind of orchestra of sorts. Something from generic non-interesting heroic movies soundtracks. It still pumps you up during game, so it works.And most awesomely, Raven Software took a few lessons from then-modern games and used them to improve pacing, variety and overall enjoyment of this linear campaign.That includes masterful mix of rest moments and high-action ones. Sometimes you shoot many baddies, other times you are crawling over conveyer belts. To that extend it also employes parts where you are stuck on a turret of venichle or have to actually control one and get to another point. Thankfully, those sections are simple to control, aren't hard, short and fill quota on explosions, so they are most welcome.Another thing that it takes are teammates. No longer you have to travel in Strogg world all alone, while failing to get immersed because you don't belive that every marine would become insane just from managing to land onto planet. I am referencing to Quake 2 again, yep. Sometimes in some sections of a game you will be followed by one or even up to three of marines, who will help you to effectively clear out the rooms, while rarely getting under your crosshair. They also don't suck, don't die easily and can kill stuff. And just make it feel more alive and that you are part of team. And some can heal and give armor. Don't worry, there is enough of lone wolf action, like one-man-army you are.It also keeps on changing in player abilities, and not only by giving you weapons. It even updates the existing ones, giving them new propereties. Like turning nailgun (yes!) into scary weapon with projectiles that follow target. Or giving lighting gun ability to spread on others nearby. Thus also making you thing of how to balance your weapon choice and usage through the game. Even if railgun and lighting gun feel underwhelming.It also even once updates your character, diving game into slower-paced half and into more of solo faster-paced one. Well, I am mostly talking of character speed. Let's not spoil the cutscene.And yes, it has a few bosses. Not many, most are put together in the end of a game. But still some and they are nice, even if final boss feels a bit dissapointing. Maybe. Those are actually quite good last encounters, just can't help the feeling. I also should mention that last levels were actually surprisingly hard, died a few times.Now, multiplayer part. It's Quake 3 copy! Why I never heard much of cheers and why didn't it replace Quake 3?Well, not sure, some people mention something about netcode or about ""doesn't feel as good for some reason"" or such. Though the more reasons that I can understand is that levels use single-player textures and assets in more dull way, making boring-looking levels, though with sleek feel. And same goes for weapons look.Otherwise multiplayer seemed to be improved, from my non-pro look. Like, it added some cool crouch-sliding from Quake 2, there are two new weapons. It feels sleek to me. Projectiles can go through teleports and grenades bounce off jumping pads.Still a blast.Certanly, best id title in a sense that it has 'both' good singleplayer and good multiplayer.

												This game is absolutely amazing. I remember once trying it out when I was younger and I never really made it very far into the game. But then my friend gave me this as a gift because like me he likes Quake and I thought 'well why not lets give it a go' and that was one of the greatest decisions of my life. the singleplayer campaign gave me around 8 hours of gameplay and it was spectacular.the game has fantastic atmosphere and goes from badass shooter to tactical shooter to♥♥♥♥♥♥scary 'oh sweet jesus may god have mercy on my soul' in a matter of minutes. the game is fairly difficult to be honest, enemies do quite a bit of damage even on Corporal, which I assume is the 'normal' difficulty but it's never too hard only requiring you take your time and don't rush in guns blazing hoping things die. The guns are absolutely lovely and each enemy seems to have a gun that works best to kill them, some flat out requiring you smash them with the local superweapon which may at first sound like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but it really isn't, it's just the simplest way to take them down without using all of your ammo and I never found myself using the superweapon that often until the final level where I used the aforementioned 'rush in guns blazing and hope people die' strategy and it seemed to be the best way to go with little cover and all the strongest enemies trying to absolutely destroy you. One 'issue' I had though is that there never seemed to be more than a few enemies attacking you at any given time, wether this was an issue with ID tech 4 (the game engine) or wether this was just a design choice made by the developers to help with the fact that enemies do quite a lot of damage and you need to sit back and take your time and if you didn't constantly fire and risk getting shot right in the face then you would quickly be overrun.all in all the dark setting, kickass weaponry and all round 'creepy' atmosphere (which makes sense, this is war time and your forces seem to be very heavily outnumbered by the Strogg) really work well to keep you very interested in the game and I never fealt myself getting bored and wanting to play something else. The story is pretty interesting (or I thought so atleast) and the characters aren't all that bad themselves though they do come off as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s most of the time by making you walk off on your own to fend for yourself in this horrific setting with monsters potentially around every corner wanting to rip your face off but it made getting back to them so that you aren't dealing with the horrors alone all the more relieving and you never really go too long without someone there to watch your back which some may see as an annoyance that takes away from the dark and scary atmosphere but I don't really like that all too much and I'd much rather have that in bursts and still have someone there to keep me company so I don't go completely insane from time to time.so all things considered this is a truely great game and I would more than recommend you buy this, I would recommend you get some friends to as well (I found a co op mod and haven't tested it myself but have high hopes). the game is fun, story is enjoyable and I found myself connecting with the character and found myself putting myself in their shoes which is a great thing for games to do and I don't get often. though I do wish that I could have more than two weapons with torches on them while it does add to the creepiness as they are the two weakest weapons in the game (well the lightning gun is pretty bad but atleast it looks cool).Gameplay - 10/10Story - 9/10Badassery - 11/10 (gun that basically shoots black holes!)Overall - 10/10Oh and don't even bother with the multiplayer, I do like that it is VERY heavily based on Quake 3 and if you liked Quake 3 as much as me you will probably like the little bit of nostalgia offered by it but that's about it.

												Holds up much better than I might have expected.  I replayed this in 2016 on a lark because I was wondering if I could get some insight as to why an old school id shooter like Quake 4 was well received but didn't blow anyone away at the time but an old school id shooter like Doom (2016) is one of the top games of the year.Turns out, the premise of that question was fundamentally flawed because there's actually a ton of difference between ""Quake 2"" old school and ""Doom"" old school.The movement speed felt really sluggish at first, but that didn't bother me once I got into the groove of things.  It's slower than Quake 2 which itself was slower than Doom.This game was developed by Raven, but has that ""punch"" to the combat that is the trademark of an id game.  The Doom 3 engine is put to great use here; the visuals (mostly) hold up pretty well even by today's standards.  The overall aesthetic might be similar to Doom 3 since they're both sci-fi action games with cybernetic monsters on the same engine, but it's pretty distinct and there's a lot more variety.  Think more Starship Troopers instead of Aliens.  The game gets dark and creepy at times but other times you're outdoors in trenches or in more open and interesting areas indoors.  Doom 3 was going for relentless claustrophobic dread pretty much the entire game, but this game has a lot more variety in color, tone, and emotion that it's attempting.The overall level design philosophy is very close to Quake 2 both in the Strogg architectural motifs as well as just the design of the combat areas and layouts.  Except for some reason the sky isn't orange - maybe they thought that would make it look too much like Doom 3's Mars?  Also the maps are maybe a little more linear and there's a much lessened emphasis on secret hunting.The story and characters aren't really engaging in any way.  The stroggification scene was cool but they didn't really do anything with that concept afterwards and it was spoiled in the trailers.  The story that is there is functional in that it builds the tone and feel they're going for.  This is an area where the game excels.  Fighting alongisde other marines in trenches while explosions go off around you creates a strong, early Call of Duty-esq war feeling to the game, but more Starship Troopers than WW2.  There's also a strong element of body horror as you work your way through the game, see the stroyent creation, the stroggification facilities, see biomechanically crucified marines merged with computers, etc.  The  soundtrack is more cinematic than Quake 2 and less memorable (outside the main theme), but builds this atmosphere better.  Just overall, Quake 4 feels less bland and brown than Quake 2 did at times.This game picked up some bad habits of the games in between the old school shooters and the more modern ones; exposition-powered doors, NPC's standing in your way until you let them finish talking, forced turret and vehicle sections with bad looking outdoor areas and clunky controls to ""break up the monotony"" - there's gameplay variety from strong central mechanics that give the player interesting choices, like Dishonored or Doom 2016, and there's insecurity that your players will get bored so you force them to do some other type of gameplay for a while.  There's weapon upgrades, but unlike Doom 2016 or Rage they're just gated based on your progress through the campaign and given to you at specified times so that feels kind of pointless to not just make the weapons have all the features to start with.  Unlike Doom 3, this game is more straight action, without any real puzzles or environmental interaction, but that means the handful of times the game expects you to do anything but just ""shoot the thing until it dies"" it's frustrating not because it expects you to do anything hard to figure out, but because you're not in that mindset.  There's some frustration from having a handful of old school big arena fights but now you have to contend with drastically reduced movement speed and reload times and no sprint mechanic.Most of the weapons are very satisfying to use, but some of the weapons feel nerfed, like the grenade launcher, the railgun, and the BFG.  Weapon reloading was fine early game, for the assault rifle and shotgun, but when you have 10 weapons it's annoying to constantly cycle through all of them after each fight to make sure they're ready to shoot.  The railgun is already a slow firing weapon so adding a long reload animation after 3 shots was excruciating.  Keeping the reloading for the human weapons, and maybe the hyperblaster would have added to that more realistic war feeling the game was going for without hurting the gameplay for the rest of the large arsenal.So there's some flaws and frustrating / dated bits, but it holds up well as a game from that last generation of shooters on the evolutionary tree of games like Doom and Duke Nukem - games like Doom 3 and Prey - before the genre split out into different directions with games like Far Cry or Cod4 etc.			",220,83,1,16,14,2,20

												Semi-Nostalgia distant planet fps, that turned out to be quite decent, Quake 4 brings you a terrific game with graphics from the early 2000s, and gameplay at it's finest. You are Corporal Kane, and here brings you this mission: drive the strogg, your enemy, back to hell!I first got this game in 2006 (not on steam), after my dad showed me the quake series with him. I thought the game was truly one of the top-dogs back then, the storyline was actually very well detailed, combat seemed smooth, and difficulty seemed well played (despite that those spider enemies make me want to kill myself half the time). The weaponry you are given seems very well flexible, the machinegun wasn't very useless, the shotgun didn't seem useless, and balancing your ammo with every gun seems very thorough. Quake 4 also has multiplayer (but noone really plays that anymore).The few boss encounters in this game seemed very difficult at first, but after a while, it isn't really that bad, considering a few  enemies late in the game have the same complexity as one or two bosses. The ways to kill every boss seemed interesting (noticing every boss in the game has a health bar, so I think there is 3 or 4? There may be more, but those are enemies you'll never see a lot as you walk around on the battlefield) and the final boss was the most interesting, along with the story that went with it.Yet, I could see a little improvement, since I'm told there might be a new Quake (there is a new Doom coming out), I did see some slight errors with the game. The game's AI that are on your side seem to be a little wonky at times, sometimes they'll be overpowered, sometimes they won't. The enemy AI rarely screws up, and when it does, you'll sometimes need to literally restart a checkpoint, which could get frustrating. All-in-all, I didn't see that many glitches/bugs/exploits in the game.The level design for almost every level seem very organized, balanced, and smooth. Early in the game they don't throw that many obstacles in your path, but later in the game, they'll toss in a hefty amount of enemies, spiced up to hardcoreness. As I mentioned difficulty earlier, there are four difficulties to the game (pretty simplistic, right?), Private for the easiest level, and General for the hardest. I've only played on the mid-tier difficulties, Corporal and Lieutenent (Normal/Hard). Both of the mid-tier seem very easy to play after you've had a chance to deal with every enemy. Fighting each boss on the easier difficulties, you'll know what to do on harder difficulties (bla bla bla).Is this worth the price tag? If you really want to wait for a sale, I'd wait for a seasonal sale, or quakecon sale. It's definitly worth the twenty dollars if you're looking for a decent challenge, and a game that's somewhat old, but actually feels smooth.			",153,11,3,9,9,4,10

												Raven Software's Quake 4 is often regarded as the black sheep of id Software's famous FPS series and while it does have its shortcomings, it's well worth a playthrough, so let's get out the Nailgun and kick some Strogg♥♥♥♥♥That is if the game worked properly to begin with. When I first started the campaign, the game's graphics were terrifyingly... bad. It seemed to have issues streaming textures in, giving the game a very washed out and comicbook-like look. This problem is a common occurance according to many Steam users but don't you worry, Sikkmod not only fixes those problems but makes the game look incredible to boot. I recommend everyone to download that mod, here's a tutorial on how to set it up: 


YouTube™ Video: How to - Mod Quake 4 with Sikkmod and Parallax 

			Views: 19,332		

			For steam users place ""+set fs_game sikkmod +set com_allowconsole 1"" under launch command to have the game always boot with Sikkmod.		

Sadly, the FPS lock of 60FPS can't be circumvented, which is a shame, and for a game with competitive multiplayer a rather questionably decision. However unlike Quake 3, the multiplayer is pretty much dead which is to be expected.The story is set right after the events of Quake 2. The Makron has been killed by some lone Space Marine (heh!), the Strogg's defenses have been weakened and it's the perfect opportunity for the Space Marines to strike. You take on the role of Cpl. Matthew Kane, a ""certified badass"" for reasons unknown, shooting your way to the communication hubs with Rhino Squad to destroy them and cripple the Stroggs' communications. But things never go as planned and you get captured by none other than... the Makron? After having some ""enhancements"" done to you, you get rescued in time by your squad and the real fun begins...One of the things you'll notice at first is your movement speed, which compared to earlier entries of the Quake series is quite slow. This can be circumvented with the console parameter ""pm_speed x"" and should be binded to a key as the game reverts your changes after loading a save or new map (bind key pm_speed x). I suggest increasing your running speed to 230, the same amount after your character gets ""enhanced"". FOV is good enough to begin with and can be increased further by typing in ""g_fov x"" in the console. Again, bind it to a key. The shooting in this game is very satisfying though I found the hit registration to be somewhat unreliable. I often found myself having trouble to kill even the weakest enemies as they seemingly absorbed most of my bullets. This only happened with the Machine Gun and Railgun however and it may as well have been my own incompetence so take this info with a grain of salt. The combat is what you would expect from a oldschool shooter: fast paced, mostly projectile based and alot more difficult than todays games. I'd consider myself fairly competent at FPS games (the genre I play the most) and Quake 4 isn't gonna go easy on you. I died quite a few times on Lieutenant Mode (Hard) and reflecting on my playthrough I can only think of 1 or maybe 2 times where the game decided to be cheap (like getting knocked into an abyss by a homing rocket). Quake 4 also has a few vehicle sections which mark the lowpoint of this game. They are just boring and cumbersome, luckily they don't last for too long.Quake 4's levels are more linear than its predecessors which may be a turn off for some people but Rave Software did a great job designing them. Stroggos is a biomechanical nightmare you don't want to experience in the flesh. One level in particular titled ""Waste Processing Facility"" is especially unnerving and creeped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me (a gorehound). Quake 4 does feel a bit ""cinematic"" and sometimes hinders your progress (Marines blocking your ways, doors not opening) but it's bearable and doesn't destroy the pacing. Kane's squadmates are a likeable bunch and some of the events in the campaign are very memorable. The music is a mixed bag, rangin from nice ambient level tracks to standard action oriented songs. The main title by Chris Vrenna is nice to listen to.Quake 4 is a damn fine game. Now move out soldier!			",212,7,2,1,6,1,3

												Raven Software was asked by Activision to create a sequel to the Greatest Multiplayer Game... Ever. Quake 3: Arena by id Software - This is one example of Raven doing a damn good job at capturing the storyline and feel from Quake 2's Plot-Line against the strogg for a surprisingly original and excellent Single-Player campaign (It was praised for this on launch) - and a very very good Multiplayer that tries way too hard to be more of the same while slowing down the gameplay movement; and even slowing down how fast rockets and the rail gun fired - Overall it creates an excellent B+ MP experience that I could spend 100's of hours fragging in and be fine; but does not come near the A+ perfection that was, and is Quake 3. Raven has been asked a lot by Activision on ip's they did not create - Raven being a talented studio that has created excellent ip's in the past its the shame that id titles (Quake IV, Wolfenstein *(2009)*) began Greed-a-Vision's dominance on the company; With those two titles They had been given freedom in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer; since then they have been forced into a Formula with Modernwarfare 3's Multiplayer and forced more-so in Call of Duty: Chokes err Ghosts Multiplayer (Along with all of the motion capture and more than half of the singleplayer; with Raven (Aided by members of Neversoft) making something out of nothing with the Extinction game mode; the only positive that is in Call of Duty Ghosts; -This stays as a landmark title that was enjoyed by just about all who played it. Wolfenstein 2009 had a semi-open world and Raven designed a super gorey fun to gib nazi's in realism style singleplayer; along with a Gun that made IGN's top 10 weapons of all time in a Video Game list; Although Wolf2009 had a very forgettable Multi-Player that saw the title with much less replayability compared to all titles prior; id's Return To Castle Wolfenstein had and still has one of the most popular multiplayer modes.. Enemy Territory; Pioneered by Splash Damage (Who then make the A+ MP GOTY Quake Wars: Enemy Territory; the Publisher Rushed ""Brink"" which had great potential and was fun.. - and now are taking time to perfect the F2P Competitive FPS market with Extraction *was called Dirty Bomb for majority of its existance; it's some of the most fun I've had with A+ Netcode going back to Closed Pre-Alpha; into Closed Beta right now). Let's hope Raven can spread their wings and start to innovate titles as they did in the past; and not be restricted by Activision as they are now. Go look at the games they made over the years. Somepeople may not know Raven was responsible for titles that they cherish. Cheers!			",315,28,2,40,15,5,32

												Wow, what a hell of a game for something that is 10yrs old! I started playing it again after at least 3 years break and had forgotten what a quality game this is and after 11 hrs played so far it just gets better.Not quite finished but feel the end is near, but based on what has happened the finale will be tough and heaps of fun I have no doubt.It is quite a while since I have experienced playing and jumping with fright from surprise attacks from small and some enormous enemies that appear to just keep on coming and which often appear from nowhere and when you least expect it!The graphics are great and I think recently improved by updates, as I have had at least two since starting the game again and it all looks a bit better. Shadows and contrasting lighting add to an eerie feeling of impending personal destruction. Whilst moving around you will be unnerved by the sounds occurring and some pretty disturbing visuals that totally get your attention while expecting something to jump out at you at any time and soon. (And yes, something usually does)!Missions are good and backed up with a good selection of weaponry (and supply of ammunition and health) you will eventually progress, but be prepared to die on a fairly regular basis. I have done so, but maybe I am slowing down a bit and my reactions may not be as quick as they used to be.Well worth the money for some 'Good Old Fun'!  I would rate this 7.5/10 and if you liked Doom3, I would suggest you will like this.			",228,47,1,9,8,0,16

												Quake 4 was developed by ID software and Raven Software, and they do not let us down with the amount of content in this game. I was going into the game thinking it would be similar to DOOM 3 but that is not the case. Playing through it, it felt alot like Quake 2 gameplay wise. Now continue reading for the good and the bad of Quake 4.Pro's-Great Story-Weapon Mods/Upgrades-Huge arsenal of weapons-Very challenging Boss fights-Unique Characters-Sections were you control vehicles are brilliant-Satisfing ending to campaign-The Strogg is a very interesting enemy-Everything that DOOM 3 and Quake 4 have in common Quake 4 does better-Many different Multiplayer gamemodes-Very well executed squad mechanic, much like the one from Half-Life: Opposing Force-Atmosphere is great-Level design is awesomeCon's-Multiplayer is dead, you might find 1 or 2 servers on a day-There are parts where you go through listening to pepole talk, these sections are kinda boring-Dark-Matter Gun is really overpowered (although I think that was the idea)-Early on in the game  before you become a Strogg  there is a sneak option which is useless since this game requires no sneaking-The ""Blaster"" weapon is useless after you get the ""Hyper Blaster""-Does not support Steam Overlay			",85,6,0,4,3,0,1

 CAMPAIGN  -- Absolutely my most favorite game of all time. I adore this game.  The good aspects of an arcade-styled game with all the scenery of Dead Space, mixed with the same level of story as Half-Life 1 and 2.  MULTIPLAYER  -- An absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. Can be very fun when you get good at it, but until then it's dying every 10 seconds. It's like an older game where there are tons of action, fast-moving characters, and explosions.   CAUTION  -- This game is very old, the game's timeframe's (2005-2006) graphics cards were meant to be played with this game. There will be MANY graphical errors. Simply follow  this guide  to fix this. It takes an actual 30 seconds - 2 minutes to do this. You don't have to download anything, just change a few values in the game's text files. You may have to rinse, wash, and repeat this a few times every week or so, as it seems it likes to slip. ",89,2,0,5,2,1,2

If you're more worried about Multiplayer don't even look, even when this game came out it was still overshadowed by Quake 3 Arena.  Play that instead for your MP needs.			",117,26,0,42,11,0,19

												Classic PC FPS. I still have this game on DVD. But have always prefered STEAM as a gaming platform. That being said, its has seamlessly been incorperated into STEAM, even cloud saves, if you asked me cloud saves are the best! Even to this day Q4 is a pretty decent FPS. Being an oldschool gamer, Q4 really is a must have. Although you can only do 1080P and the textures are kind of ugly, still a very fun and interesting game. There seams to be a lot of screen tearing though for some odd reason. Even if you have to wait for a sale, it comes highly recommended from me! 9/10 considering it was published in 2005. One does not really need a remake if it was done right in the first place. No console port here, its meant for your kb/mouse setup.			",815,195,33,60,28,3,43

												Never had more fun playing a online game then I had with Quake 4.Played it more then 1000 hours, so don't judge this review by my""hours on record"" on Steam.The solo ""campaign"" is very solid as well, but the MP did it for me.I've played alot of Q3 as well, but I like Q4 MP a lot more. I know mostpeople will not agree with me on this, but the little less fast action(it's still fast as sh*t) made me play it more tactical. I never used my hearing so much in a MP game.50% of the kills where based on hearing where footsteps/jumping/shootingsounds came from. I'm not saying it has the most realistic audio/accousticengine. But it sure as hell makes u to use it if u want to have a benefit.Oh, and I also love the crouch sliding.			",161,23,1,7,6,0,14

												Quake 4 took me by surprise.  As soon as I started the game, I was immersed in my role as Kane.  A certified Bad♥♥♥♥♥marine.  The only odd thing about this game is that Kane never says a word, lol.  Everyone just keeps talking around him as though he was a mute, he he..  A seasoned marine, and always determined to complete his mission; Kane goes through a very painful (you better believe it!) and cruel transition at the hands of the Squids while captured.  However, that didn't  stop him from completing his mission.  As it turned out, Kane's new body was a blessing to his superiors.  Kane would be able to infiltrate the Stroggs defenses and ultimately destroy the heart of the Nexus, which controls all Stroggs and all valuable information sent to them, thereby, creating confusion.  With an arsenal of unique and powerful weapons, Kane along with the rest of the marines set out to destroy the Strogg and their never ending torture against mankind.The graphics look great.  The voice acting is also great.  There's lot of action and of course, different modes for you to choose from.  If your choosing hard, remember to *fast save* whenever you can.  A great feature, which is a big PLUS.  I hate repeating the whole level over and over again.  Use Xpadder or other program for controller support.  I played this game on the Xbox many years ago and I can honestly say that this game deserves a well thought out sequel.  I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake 4 was a true disappointment that nearly killed the franchise. The story is dull, levels are just a bunch of generic shooting galleries glued together. But my main problem with this game is that you can't play multiplayer maps with bots like you could in Quake III Arena and since human opponents are long gone this game is properly dead.

I've felt more emotion for the guys in this game, and the people tortured by the Strogg throughout than I have in any other game for a very long time. Absolutely recommend.			",164,15,1,17,17,0,22

												Honestly I dont know why some Quake fans hate on Quake 4 but Ive been playing Quake Since i was 5 for over 17 years an I think this installment wasnt a bad one. Its not as fast paced and has a multiplayer feel to it sometimes but over all a good experience. Plenty of Strogg types to kill some good guns they kept from the old games to fit into this game and plenty of gore and ambient lighting to top it off. Strongly feels like a sequal to Quake 2. Has a decent sized Single player mode so its worth the money if you ask me. If you decide to try it out I hope you have a good experiece like I did. Peace			",122,5,0,11,3,0,1

												The game was always great and I've loved it since it came out.Too bad that, when I got it again on steam (I used to have a retail copy), it was unable to support a decent resolution and wasn't at all friendly towards higher sensitivities or extra buttons of any kind. On top of that, it just becomes incredibly unstable with higher settings (which shouldn't be with my hardware setup).TL;DR: The game is amazing if it allows you to play it at all/ if you can handle an eliptical crosshair and unusually wide people.

												Quake IV is an OK game, to start off with this mini review, let's focus on the campaign since multiplayer is dead and Quake III / Live is a better option for that, this game lacks of replay value due to its linear nature, similar to Doom 3, but i felt like this singleplayer was much shorter compared to the other, in Doom 3 there are some secrets and stuff to collect like the codes and PDAs, but yeah, it took me 7 hours to beat it, but it was still a enjoyable experience, the level designs are really good except for those horrendous turret/vehicle sections, there is a nice roster of enemies and a extense weapon arsenal, although the BFG is missing here (I was expecting it to be here since it follows the Quake II storyline) but you got a nice replacement, there are bosses too, some of them become regular enemies at the end of the game and you have a couple of ""final"" bosses, but they are not that exciting to fight, just run around them shooting them till they die (like some of the Doom 3 bosses). The story isn't that deep but is good to explain more about the QuakeII/IV lore and the graphics are really amazing (for the time). I think this game could have been better if the campaign was more deep and long, maybe some alternative endings or paths, even the final boss is not that threatning and easy to kill, leaving a really weird and anticlimatic cinematic. I would recommend this to people who wanna try something different on the FPS genre, not the best of them but it really shows how oldschool shooters were back then when all that mattered was the fun of shooting things with overpowered guns while running like a madman.

												Quake 4 is an excellent FPS game that has a great singleplayer campaign and an excellent multiplayer component.  This is a worthy sequel to Quake 2 (with some caveats).The singleplayer campaign picks up shortly after the events of Quake 2.  The Strogg's planetary defenses have been disabled and a second invasion operation by the humans is underway.  I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign.  There's a stronger story this time around, named characters pertinent to the story, medics and techs that can heal you and provide armor recharges between fights (on occasion - and try not to let them die), and you get to fight using an assortment of heavy weapons - including a tank and a battlemech (they call it a ""walker"" *pff*).  A f'n battlemech!  They had me at tank...  *tear* *sniff*The graphics are very nice, running on the impressive ID Tech 4 engine introduced with Doom 3, and while there have been advancements with graphics technology in the last 10 years - they still hold up extremely well.  The architecture in the game is very detailed and the texturing very well done.  There are some large open areas on the planet's surface, but most of the game you're running around inside of the, often tight, corridors of the enemy compounds.The sound design is solid, with ambient sound permeating and creating much of the mood for the areas you'll traverse.  And throughout you will hear radio chatter that gives you an impression of the scope, cost of the war being waged, provide you with story points, and levy objectives on you.  The sounds of weapons' fire and impact are all very good - no whimpering shotguns here.  The music is sufficient, but it lacks the unnerving moodiness of previous Quake titles.The weapons you get all have their benefits and deficits.  For instance, some enemies will take bullet after bullet from your rifle when another is quickly turned into swiss cheese, but they all seem to be more susceptible to certain weapons over others - one enemy type in particular will explode almost immediately when hit with the lightning gun.  You start out with a pistol with infinite ammo that is actually quite useful in certain situations.  You will also gain a rifle, shotgun, hyperblaster, nailgun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, lightning gun, and a dark-matter gun.  Throughout the singleplayer campaign you'll get little upgrades from techs in your unit that add new features to some of these weapons:  a bigger clip, increased damage, a targeting scope, etc..The developers clearly tried to add alot of combat flavor to the game, arguably absent from the first game (a minor quibble).  There is a portion of the game where you have to man a mounted gun on a moving tram and take down enemy aircraft as well other vehicles.  In another you have control of a hover-tank and have to quickly maneuver and destroy an assortment of enemies and armament whilst trying to navigate to your objective.  In another you get to man a battlemech fighting off the enemies with it's heavy caliber guns and rockets.  Yippee ki yay mutha♥♥♥♥as!!There are around 20 or so different enemy types, not counting bosses and all fairly disgusting, especially the zombies that puke acid (this might explain why I need pills to sleep at night).  They get similar weaponry as you, though some have unique energy weapons, flamethrowers, and whatever the hell the Iron Maiden's awful scream attack is supposed to be.Quake 4 does drift away from the feel of Quake 2 a bit too much, imo.  The Stroggs of Quake 2 lived on a planet with a thick blood red sky.  Their installations were dark, gritty and minimalistic.  The architecture was authoritarian with big red banners draped on their exteriors that reminded one immediately of the Nazis during WWII.  Their technology was function over form.  It had dangerous fauna and some truly memorable enemy types.  Exploration (which often required some puzzle-solving) was rewarded, you could swim underwater, you could throw a grenade - using it's tick-time once activated to good effect, the hyperblaster was like a gatlin gun that shot lasers and made a unique piercing sound when it was fired, you were given objective information by a computer that notified you with quirky voice, etc..Meanwhile in Quake 4.......the sky is blue and reminiscent of Earth, their installations are often well-lit and incredibly high-tech.  The architecture barely resembles that of the previous game.  There is no dangerous fauna you'll come in contact with and most of the enemy types have been completely reimagined and some are just completely missing.  The story is supposed to take place after Quake 2, but everything looks and feels just too different.  There's almost no exploration to be had and it never involves puzzle-solving, there is no water ANYWHERE and so no swimming either, you can't throw grenades, the hyperblaster here makes a sad whoomping sound and seems more like the plasma gun from Doom, and there is no computer updating your objectives.  I'm sure I could think of more if I sat here long enough.  I just don't understand why Raven felt the game world needed such a makeover.  Updating the graphics using new technology - awesome!  but this level of reimagining was totally unnecessary.  The upside is that the game is just as dark thematically as Quake 2 and includes some very gruesome, gory content - arguably more disturbing than what Quake 2 was able to convey.  In the end this is an excellent game that just falls short of reaching the level of awesome of it's predecessor Quake 2.			",214,37,6,63,20,0,43

												The game definitely plays more like DOOM 3 than it does a Quake game. It looks absolutely fantastic for it's age with some amazing lighting effects some modern games can't even match. Shooting mechanics are solid and aside from some tedious elevator rides, ride alongs and forced On-Rails shooting/vehicle segments, it's a fantastic game. Game should be played on a higher difficulty otherwise it feels way too easy. Some boss fights were over before they started, especially with the Dark Matter Gun & Rocket Launcher combo. Some checkpoints took me back way too far, so saving when you can will save you a lot of hassle. Game took me 8.5 hours, coulda shaved it down to 7 if my deaths didn't take me back too far due to the checkpoints. Overall a very solid experience, graphics are still fantastic, mechanics are great!

I highly recommend Quake IV to those who are fans of ID Software's classics and or to those who enjoy a solid shooter without much concern for story or QTE's or just general avoidance to the modern day FPS games filled with pointlessly boring (and repetitive) mechanics.Quake IV offers a great blast and if you haven't tried it out or any of it's previous titles, it's a series you might want to consider!I rate this game a 7.8/10!

												Doom 3 is essentially a remake of the original Doom, though series fans will find reimagined versions of almost every monster from both Doom and Doom II in the new sequel. You play as a nameless, voiceless 22nd-century space marine called by the Union Aerospace Corporation to its Mars research facility beset with mysterious problems--the forces of hell, to be exact. You'll end up single-handedly fighting back legions of hellspawn using weapons like shotguns, machine guns, and rocket launchers. As in the classic Doom games, your foes here are liable to strike at any time--often just as you round a corner, grab a much-needed power-up, or set foot into a new area. So, while your enemies will materialize without notice, and may occasionally startle you as they leap out of the darkness, Doom 3 cannot easily be described as scary or suspenseful, but is still an amazing experience at first hand.wait this is quake 4whatever			",385,43,9,33,28,4,43

												Actually a really enjoyable shooter. I had fun playing it for the first time even a decade after its release. There's a huge amount of great stuff going on in the first Act that must have been very cool upon release, and even still impressed me. The game drags on a little longer than perhaps it needs to, but this is still a great one to pick up on sale.			",212,25,0,7,11,0,22

												A really great game! I love the very epic and scary story, it's way better than the Quake 2 story. While the quake 2 story had a lot more hero feel, this has the more realistic war feel. Both are good. I personally like Quake 2 as a game more, but like the story of Quake 4 more. Awesome enemy designs, awesome weapons designs and ♥♥♥♥ING awesome music. So yeah, a really great game. sad that there probably won't be a Quake 5. But if you like SCIFI games and kinda old school gameplay, then I recommend it for you.			",96,4,1,4,6,0,8

												With the Quakecon sale kicking off on Friday, I was a bit surprised to see that there was a Quake 4!  Sure, I got away from PC gaming for awhile and it had been a REALLY long time since I was heavy into Doom and Quake, but I felt a little funny that I didn't know this existed!  With a cheap price I figured it was a must play for nostalgia's sake at the very least. I didn't expect a whole lot out of it, which is good because it turns it's okay.  Not great, but okay. I run a couple of movie podcasts, so I watch a lot of flicks.  The state of the modern shooter in comparison to classic style shooters compares pretty well to the world of movies.  Most of the time, you like to watch a movie that's well put together, highly polished, engaging and engrossing.  This translates to your modern shooters in the game world.  Games such as Bioshock Infinite or even Deadspace are a different beast than the shooters we all cut our teeth on.  They're deep, they have branching stories, they're well put together. It's a production...an experience. Jumping back to your movie world. you have another class of movie which boils down to your dumb action or horror movies, stuff put out by the likes of Syfy Channel or Asylum.  These movies are cheesy with no depth whatsoever.  They're there simply to treat you to explosions and special effects, nothing more than the spectacle.  Quake 4 fits in perfectly with this type of movie; there' s no depth to it whatsoever, it's there simply for you to run around and shoot aliens.  And that's it. Much like watching the movies though, sometimes we simply don't feel like wrapping our head around something deep. We want to munch popcorn and watch stuff explode.  Video games are the same way, and Quake 4 is a pretty perfect fit for those moods.  It's a solid through back to the good old days where you're only concern was checkpoints and finding your way to the rail gun.  The story is a nice aside but really doesn't do anything to suck you into the game.  You're sticking around for the fun of shooting Stroggs and seeing what the weapons do. There's some sections in Quake 4 that are annoying.  The vehicle sections are slow and clunky which makes them frustrating when you're trying to dodge.  Some of them feel like you're on a rail shooter without a whole lot to shoot at.  The game is way too long for what you're there for too.  In the end though, things blow up pretty well and it play smoothly while showing it's age.  It's worth $5 and a Sunday afternoon.  ",364,56,12,63,30,5,42

												Quake IV is a almost 10 year old FPS that still holds up quite well today. The core gameplay is quite linear and baisic, but it does make up for this with some excellent shooting mechanics thanks to the briliance of the Doom 3 engine, each ounce of lead (or lighting, or dark matter, or nails, etc.) you pump into enemies feels satisfying. Couple that on top of the wide enemy variety (complete with bosses), the very diverse set of weapons you find (with upgrades too!) and ragdoll effects on enemies that never quite get old, you got yourself a very entertaining shooter at it's core.Now as for everything else:Level design: Probably the next best thing about this game, while quite linear, it does provide a very good sense of atmosphere with the  very  ♥♥♥♥ed up things around you. The lighthing and effects of the game really do help you feel like you're in a very bad place. I can't say much more without spoiling it, but expect to feel uncomfortable with places that make you go ""What the ♥♥♥♥ is THAT?"" or ""That's seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up."", and belive me, you will have a ton of those moments.Soundtrack: It's okay, nothing really special about it, the soundtrack fits the moments I guess, but you'll be too busy kicking♥♥♥♥♥that you'll forget what's playing in the background.Story: Also not much to say about it, you are a marine that has to kill aliens and destroy thier main base to save the earth, something happens in the middle of it but that doesn't stop you from kicking♥♥♥♥♥and saving the world. I'd also like to note that the moment around the middle of the game  will  leave you remembering it for the rest of you life.Graphics: You'd think it would look particularly bad thanks to the game being 10 years old, but with the engine it was made on, this is far from the case, while it is low in polygon count compared to newer games, it has much better lighting and particle effects then most of the games I've played, that's very good considering it's age. Look up screenshots of the game on max settings or play it yourself on max and you'll see what I mean.Misc: Voice acting is good, nothing spectacular. Game has little or no replay value due to it being linear, however there are plenty of mods that offer new campaigns and levels that should keep you going if you want more.Overall I give Quake IV a 8.5/10, it's excellent at what it does. Anybody looking for a amazing fps with it's own unique identity must check this game out, if they do not mind  the baisic and linear ""kill anything that moves"" style that comes with it ",231,16,4,16,4,1,19

												Quake 4 is a direct sequel to Quake 2. Which adopted a more traditional premise to the original game's ""Cthulhu inspired castles"". Where you play as a Space Marine up against the borg-like Strogg.Quake 4 however does a lot to distinguish itself from Doom 3 and it's predecessor Quake 2 infact. There are NPCs for one who aid you in battle. While you are still the ""One Man Army"" archetype in most FPS games it does feel a lot more story driven as a result.Of course like it's predecessor Quake 2, it has a marvelous heavy metal soundtrack to compliment it's atmosphere. If you enjoyed Quake 2 or Doom 3 I guarantee Quake 4 is the next step for your remaining action quota.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Quake 4 is a great game. Unfortunatley, it doesn't work on newer machines for most people.  This game should be taken off the store until the issues are resolved.To start, no matter how high you put the graphics settings, they will automatically load low res textures and turn off AA.  You can fix this and many other bugs by editing the config file.  Once that is done, the game looks pretty damn good.  However.,... if your like most people, the singleplayer will randomly crash and dump you back to the main menu for NO reason.  For me it is certain mobs that crash it, and there seems to be no way around it.  Too bad, because I grew up playing quake 1 and 2.  I was truly looking forward to playing the 4th one, and I can't... I've searched the internet for a fix and came up with nothing.  This is a massive problem and they shouldn't be allowed to sell this game in it's current condition.			",67,0,0,7,3,0,2

												Built upon glorious id tech and injected with the frenetic, sanguinary gameplay that Quake is renowned for. Blast your way through the harsh architecture of a malevolent alien race with a formidable assortment of weapons, fighting against a plethora of varied monstrosities. The action is well-paced and presents a consistent challenge, keeping players alert and committed, the scarce moments of rest feel deserved and include an exorbitantly barbaric medical scene that serves as a strong narrative development. The bland vehicle levels and ardently dismal turret sections create a few chinks in the armour.Quake 4 is yet another gem in a series that shows no signs of slowing down.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay is still solid, the weapons are still interesting, the enemies are still unique as I remember them (and they still all want to turn you into a read smear on the wall).  The graphics are also still quite good for a 2005 game!  While it does suffer a bit from the ""identical shooter scenery"" syndrome of its time, the levels are still quite interesting if you take the time to look at them when you're not getting shot at.  As a side note, Quake IV still has one of the most gruesome first-person scenes I've seen in a game to this day.  The Stroggification scene.  No game will ever come close to matching the horror of that sequence.  STATUS: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ",140,24,0,10,5,1,2

What I liked about the game •	I liked the industrial/science setting of the game. I liked seeing all of the machines in the environment working, seeing lots of information on the computer screens next to the machines. It made the environment feel more alive. The skyboxes in the game looked really cool as well. •	The weapons in the game were awesome. I liked how they brought back some of the weapons from Quake 1, like the bolt gun and the nail gun. •	Plenty of Strogg to fight and awesome boss battles. •	Gore, gore, gore and more gore. •	I liked how you weren't alone through the whole game, sometimes you were with a squad, which didn't have stupid AI; the marines were quite useful sometimes and they didn't get in the way. The medic could replenish your health, the Tech could replenish your armour, and some marines could upgrade your weapons.•	There were levels in the game were you could drive a Tank and there was a level were you could operate a Walker.  What I disliked or was disappointed with •	The game is too short. •	There aren't really any hidden secrets. There are hidden ammunition/armour stashes, but they are really easy to find. •	No power ups, like quad damage or the silencer. Conclusion A fantastic game, highly recommend it to any FPS fan. 93/100     ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

SPOILERS:I would have liked to explore what effect Kane's assimilation would have had on him and his squad mates. Was he conflicted at all?

												A solid go. Singleplayer is a blast to play because it doesn't funnel you around, exploring is allowed and hell, even secrets are present. Fastpaced classic style gameplay with cool soundtrack and story of a marine who attacks the strogg base.Multiplayer was also very fun and you can actually still find some people who play the online side of the game. It's the fastpaced quake experience, except quake 4 had a unique mechanic which allowed you to keep speed while strafing. id Software didn't want to add aircontrol (maybe because to not ripoff CPMA, who knows?) and so they added crouchsliding. A feature which if you did, you didn't lose your speed and thus got around corners and turns while strafing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the Quake we were hoping 4As a sequel to Quake 2 the story is very good. The gameplay, level design and voice acting however leaves a lot to be desired.Lets mention the bad. The vehicle and turret sections are just garbage. There's just no other word for it. Luckily they are usually quite short when they happen.Theres some sequences where you walk around base listening to other people. Something that was done quite well in the Half-life games and Doom 3, not so wellmade here. I just felt like they were holding me back from actual gameplay. Exposition in other parts of the game was done over radio, they should have kept it all that way.This game also has a sneak button rather than a run button. In a game without stealth this is completely useless.Lets mention the good.No reloading health. Thats actually one of the few modern FPS tropes this game did not use and thank all that is holy for it.The parts where you just walk around and shoot thngs are pretty good.The settings and mood is overall really well executed. It's very much a mix of Quake 2 and Doom 3 going on in the looks department.I don't regret playing it but I'll never play it again.			",467,101,8,98,29,4,105

												Quake IV is essentially a brighter, more action-packed DooM III with alien cyborgs instead of demons. The weapons are more satisfying to use than in DooM III and your default weapons come with a flashlight attachment. On the downside, the game features some forgettable vehicle segments, a bland soundtrack (where is Sonic Mayhem when you need him?), the puzzling lack of sprinting as well as annoying friendly NPCs that get in the way. The game is at its best when you are on your own, on foot and Stroggified - which thankfully is most of the game.Overall, not as memorable as Quake II nor DooM III, but still enjoyable enough.It's better than RAGE, that's for sure.

												Overview:  First Person ShooterThe Good:+ Game still looks good despite its age + Unique weapons that feel great to shoot. Weapons get upgraded with new mods as you play through the campaign.+ Fast paced shooting and gameplay+ level design is consistent; each area features a mix of wide corridors mixed with open areas for better strafing and movement. Though the areas are linear in nature the game provides a consistent pace to the single player campaign introducing new enemies and weapons at just the right time.  + old school health system, every encounter matters. The Average:Though the game tries to vary up the gameplay and feel between each level, the last few levels start feeling repetitive very quickly.   The Bad:- Graphic settings is broken, you must go into the config.ini files to manually adjust many of the settings. - No subtitles - Multiplayer deadConclusion:It uses the Doom 3 engine and it has the same look and feel as Doom 3 as well but just plays out much faster. Quake 4 seems to successfully combine some old school gameplay with newer level design.   ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Takes place after the repetitive Quake 2 Story/Game.. It's actually a fun play, Bosses were unique, story was pretty good. Didn't feel like you were running in circles for nothing like its predecessor. On top of all that the voice acting is flawless. The voice acting alone makes the game great and worth the 6ish hours of gameplay. Buy on sale for a fun FPS			",287,39,7,22,10,2,22

												I know that is the weird graphic. But I have felt the Quake atmosphere from that. I can't tell more about that game. Good things: 	-Low hardware require. 	-Enough horror + sci-fi atmosphere and story. 	-Easily find the way forward. Bad things. 	-Too short Single-Player. 	-Too less play in Multilayer. 	-I guess there was too dark, but I might that was the concept of the developer. I recommend this game all those who liked the Quake series, because there are many of Quake feelings.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												id Tech 4 at it's best. Based mostly on the physical copy, bought back in 2007.PROS:+ Quick and fluid gameplay.+ Enemies are diverse and fun to battle.+ A cyber-punk meets biomechanical visual aesthetic that still feels fresh.+ Graphics have aged like a fine wine. Looks amazing for a 10 year old game.+ Tight controls.+ Modest hardware requirements.CONS:- Multiplayer isn't as fun as Quake III Arena.- Texture issues with Windows 7, but can be fixed via: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6g1qxf8wgdxzbd/quake4config.cfg?dl=0 put into the ""q4base"" folder.

												I never played this back when it came out, but I remember people having mixed feelings. What everyone wanted of course was a sequel to Quake 3, the game that people put highest on their multiplayer pedistals. Instead they got a game not far descended from Doom 3, a singleplayer experience with a multiplayer mode more like the deathmatch from the Doom series. It is, in fact, a direct sequel to Quake 2, dealing witn the human invasion of Stroggos. The game does use the D3 engine and I think it suffers from it, in that they (Raven) wanted to create a game about a grand war and planetary invasion, but the D3 engine is pretty limited to basically a corridor-set of environments. You do often go into ""outdoor"" spaces but it's pretty obvious you're in a room with a sky texture instead of a ceiling. They serve to break up the long stretches of indoor space, but it feels slapped together instead of inspiring. The weapon variety is nice and I felt like every weapon has its place, and the enemy variety was challenging and kept spice to the game. The boss challenges I felt were fairly boring, mostly uninspired bullet-sponge affairs where I ended up expending most all my ammo while circle strafing, that kind of thing. Overall the game has a short length but the story is semi-interesting enough to make it worth it, including the point at which you yourself change... biologies. Recommend at a sale price for a younger old-style shooter.			",712,200,33,112,78,8,163

												Background: I'm a big Quake fan, lot sof time spent in Q1 and Q2 plus their mission packs.  I first got this game in 2006 when I bought a new PC.  I actually got 2 copies. I bought one on DVD, then got a CD copy when I bought my video card :P  I started the game but rage quit/bored quit as the game was slow to load and just boring.  Years later I got a copy on Steam and as part of a challenge to play my backlog, I finally finished the game this year.This game has a bit of a slow start, and years ago the game just ran slow.  On newer computers the latter isn't as annoying allowing you to move into the more interesting parts sooner.  This game was built from the Doom3 engine but it feels like the runt of the litter in some ways.The game doesn't really shine till the 2nd half.  I started off having to force myself to push on, but later I wanted to push on.  I wanted to see where the story was going to go, I wanted to see what the next big guns would be .. what the next massive baddies would be, and even where the story would go!  Lets be honest, this is a Quake game, people don't get into it for the story :PLater on your various weapons get some useful upgrades as well as upgrades to you making you move faster etc.  As I look back at the screenshots I took in January I see so many colourful scenes, I see a lot of gore and a lot of cool scenery waiting to be admired.This is a game which went from thinking .. I'll finish it one day to thinking that I am definitely going to replay it, and soon!			",369,43,22,34,22,4,71

It does have texture issues on Steam though, I had to find stuff on the forums to get the game to look as pretty as it does on the XBOX 360 (I had to change a couple things in the config file).

												Who doesn't love Quake IV!? Sure, it's just DOOM 3 with brighter colors, but it fit so well into the Quake universe. Most of the characters were memorable and you were saddened to see them die, and the main silent protagonist's suffering and what he endures really bring you into the story. You REALLY hate the Strogg and want to hurt them by the end of the game. Bonus for not cringing during the first-person mutilation scenes!			",219,21,5,8,11,0,8

												Now, my friends,I will demonstrate to you the difference between a comma and an apostrophe:Id, do this again.I'd do this again.Both statements are equally correct.This is a direct sequel to Quake 2 and has some weapons from Quake 3 and Quake 2 (Id's numbering system is a bit like Final Fantasy) and begins with the opening statement of a lone marine taking down the Makron (chuckle).I beat the Quake 2 campaign with a John McLane player model and was half expecting Kane to say ""Yipee Kaye Motherf***er"" as he did in Quake 2, but sadly, this was not the case. But it doesn't stop this from being a solid game.This transitioned Quake from a fast-paced arena shooter to a slower, military shooter, but it makes this transition rather well. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't played it yet, but you might be in for a surprise.I do have one complaint about this game, so brace yourselves.*Inhale* ID! WHY, OUT OF ALL THE WEAPONS IN THE GAME, DID YOU CHOOSE TO REMOVE THE BFG??!!! INSTEAD, WE NOW HAVE THE LAME-O ""DARK MATTER GUN, AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE STUPID 3-ROUND MAGAZINE FOR THE RAILGUN! *exhale*In all fairness, I haven't had this much fun in awhile. While it does kind of feel like DOOM 3, you can actually see your surroundings and the graphics are actually pretty good considering the time period.I will always be faithful to Id, but I hope they will return Quake to its arena-shooter roots and not try to be Halo: Combat Evolved or something similar.Let's see... we've got a new DOOM, and a new Unreal Tournament is in the works...With Quake 5 and Half-Life 3, the 90's can be back in style, baby! Until then.... Quake 2 and UT will be my go-to LAN games.			",58,2,0,2,1,1,1

												The level of sh*t this game got when it launched is unfair to say the least; especially since Quake 4 is the only FPS game to tell the story of a futuristic human invasion of an alien planet and do it decently.The first half of the game you play as “regular” soldier Kane. I use quotation since there’s nothing regular about him. Your character is somehow the same as in Quake 2 (or of equal fame) and a silent protagonist, so not much is known about him besides the fact that he is super awesome no seriously u guys.But even with your Samsonian power, it all goes bad during a cut-scene in which you're knocked out (thank's Opposing Force!). Because of course, you’re invading an advanced alien race, what did you think this was? Somalia? Things go south and most of the human army is killed, but NOT all of them (unlike Q2) and you will find and fight alongside small groups of soldiers, doing their best to stay alive. This is probably the most immersive part of the game.Indeed the invasion part of Quake 4 feels truly unique, with humans clinging desperately to survival while higher command keeps yammering about them advancing in the fray. Of course, as games go, both sides agree to call it a day and send you in.Even so, it doesn’t take long until♥♥♥♥♥♥go fully up and your entire assault squadron is routed, with you captured by the Strogg after a failed boss fight; one of the first true main issues of the game, since, while this is a fight you are meant to fail, you must fail in a SPECIFIC point and after a SPECIFIC time, making the whole thing a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥After that, you pass a few (spoiler-free) steps that make your character quicker and more prone to working alone, turning the whole thing into a slightly more classic affair of quick-pace shooting. Pew-pew forward and you might notice the game beginning to get a bit bland. You will still get exposition and sometimes even find colleagues, but the suspense from the beginning will be gone.The ending is also a bit flat, with it finishing on a cliffhanger that still hasn’t delivered (2016). Even so, the game is still worth it if you enjoy military SciFi themes, The Quake 2 lore or simply find it at a discount.			",207,25,1,30,23,0,57

												An older game that I still particularly enjoy after starting it up again, recently. I used to have it hard copy, but not sure where it is now. If you like id Software, you'll likely enjoy this game, especially if you've played the Quake games before.Be careful with newer systems and check out the forums for help with the graphics. You'll need to set up some options so that everything isn't ultra-low quality as the game is glitched a little. Somebody should do something about that.But Quake IV is a fun FPS game. It can be pretty scary at times, and it even scared me more than Doom 3 did in many places. There are some scenes that are just... wow, like the Stroggification.Check it out!			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												Being fair, I liked Quake 4 but I don't think it was a truly fitting continuation of Quake 2. Whereas a lot of people didn't like Quake 2, I loved it. I enjoyed the solitude and desperation of a single marine stuck far behind enemy lines and the visual prompts that allowed you to put a lot of the story together yourself. Quake 4, on the other hand, constantly placed you as part of a squadron and forced mission briefings down your throat, taking away all the mystery of the Strogg. That said, the idea of stroggification gave a tantalising insight into the workings of the Strogg... Just a shame I couldn't make out most of it because of the bad textures...Full review below if you want to check it out:

												It's Id Software's biggest & badest Quake Title yet for the PC & XBOX 360 Consoles. Quake 4 brings Quake into a new Generation using the All-New DOOM 3 Tech Engine, it's got more Strogg that'll make you weap & cower in utter fear but don't worry, The Earth Defense Force has got more Weapons that are Bigger and Badder than ever!Be sure to get Quake 4 & brace yourself for Mass Destruction on the Strogg's Latest Master Plans for Galactic Conquest.The Earth Federation will keep on fighting the Strogg and They will win!

												   At its core, Quake 4 is a old-school shooter and is leaps and bounds better than Doom 3. While the story isn't the most compelling (why would you play a shooter for the story?), it's decent enough to stand on its own. Every weapon is unique, and upgrades you recieve throughout the story encourage you to use your full arsenal. The game is suprisingly good-looking for its age, and runs incredibly smoothly. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes classic shooters or who want a taste of the new DOOM.87/100			",130,29,1,25,18,0,20

												Quake 4 is a fairly decent old school shooter. The graphics have aged very poorly, the game looks horrible and I’m not comparing it to today’s standards because I can go back to games like quake 2 and appreciate how good it looks for a game released in 1997. The textures in particular are so low res and muddy. The level design is not very interesting or memorable and the story is very mediocre aside from a cool twist a third through the game that affects both the story and the gameplay. Gameplay is very standard old school shooter gameplay with health packs and no weapon limit. There is not much to say other than it is fun but it does get repetitive in longer play sessions because there is little variation in the shooting. They do try to mix it up a little with vehicle sections but they are just awful to play through. At least the game is much better then doom 3 it has that going for it but it is the weakest game in the franchise. 6/10 (Decent)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												This game is Amazing. The Graphics are great (especialy if you use sikmod and a highrez texture pack). the story is really well done and has great scripted sequences. The geometry is still incredible to this day. Quake 4 was the first game to use a lot of strange geometry and it really holds up well. it has controler support built in if you like that. I've played through this game 4 times already.  and i have a steam library of 200+ games. I keep coming back to this one because it's that good.  ",183,30,3,16,6,1,5

												Damn fine old school FPS. Of course being old school and a console release, it has it's quirks such as a janky check-point system, semi-annoying vehicle sections and such. But provided you can deal with that and do some minor .cfg file editing to get it to not stuff up with modern cards, you'll get a decent, single player with a ""touch"" of body horror.

												Quake 4 is fun. The story is shady, though. It's essentially Iraq/Afghanistan War propaganda. The story is that you're part of the marines invading a desert planet fighting the locals, much like what the US was doing when this game was released. The graphics still hold up fairly well considering this game is just about a decade old. There are a lot of well realized technologically, industrially advanced locations filled to the brim with details. The setting is gritty sci-fi and the aesthetics really sold the dark atmosphere. There is a fair amount of gore in the game. The game certainly has some similarities to Doom 3, which was released around the same time. Quake 4 leans more towards sci-fi where Doom 3 more towards super natural horror. The lighting is really well done. The colorful lights from the computer screens and machines contrast well with the mostly otherwise pitch dark rooms. Think of the lighting at a rave and you've got it. When first arriving on the planet, the main character can't understand the alien writing on computers and it just looks like jibberish, but a little ways in something happens to him and then the computer consoles start displaying messages in English, like the character learned to understand the language. The main character looks like Robocop without his visor on and it looks bizarre. The combat is decent. There are a lot of corridor battles and the 'ol trusty running backwards in a circle, shooting up the enemy tactic still works a bit too well. The weapons were standard issue. There wasn't anything too exciting, but they were suitable for the game were fun to shoot. The level design is mostly simple and straight forward, but combat was never boring. The boss battles were challenging, yet not too bad. I will say, the final boss was much more difficult than I anticipated. It took me a while to figure exactly what I needed to do. There are some on rails sections and some where vehicles are controlled that break up the on foot parts that make up a bulk of the game. Frequently NPC marines will join the fight and every one of them gets a name and so I always felt bad when they'd inevitably get mowed down. It took around 10 hours to finish. Quake 4 is not the revolution that the first one was two decades ago, but it is still a fun game that holds up today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While definitely not a bad game and actually a very competent attempt at a fps action shooter, this game is commonly referred to by Quake fans as the weakest one in the series. It did to the Quake series what Doom 3 did to the Doom series: modernized it to a sort of Call of Duty-ish game devoid of any personality or style that made the previous games so amazing. It is basically an early version of Doom 3. It is pretty much the exact same dark spaceship/spacestation surrounding ultra-tight corridor shooter with no heart in terms of id softwares previous games, just a above average military-esque shooter. I don't know one person who cared about this when it came out and not many people played its MP. Even today, more people still play Quake 1-3 mp than Quake 4. Quake 1 had the dark evil atmosphere that was pretty terrifying for its time and provided a hell of a challenge, Quake 2 abandoned all of that but still managed to be one of the all-time great pc games, Quake 3 did too even though it was mp only, and Quake 4 is just an outcast game that the only thing it has in common with previous Quake games is its name. Disappointing garbage for Quake fans, competent in its own right. I am passing it only because it is not a bad game by itself, even if it does ruin the Quake name. If I had to guess why Quake 5 hasn't been made yet, I would say it is because Quake 4 probably had such bad sales numbers.6/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												So....when Quake 4 first came out i played a demo of it and i thought it sucked so i refused to buy it full price. But when steam had it onsale for around 5 bucks i bought the game.  The game seems to continue where Quake 2 left off.  The game engine used in Quake 4 sucks. The game also tried to incorporate vehicles and what not, which at the time was the big thing alot of FPS games were doing.  It seems like the game is a giant soup sandwich.  You look at Quake 2...awesome game. The whole game fit the game play, the bad guys AI, the levels...It all fit. Quake 3....awesome game. Quake 4 bad game trying to combine Quake 2 story game and Quake 3 stye of pay made the game horrable. itis why the Quake Wars games put out didint go very far.

I am running a ASUS PG279Q G Sync 2560x1440 IPS 165hz monitor and it only supports 1920x1080. This is also me playing no the highest settings, and it still looks like♥♥♥♥♥ Also, the game doesn't support Steam Hub. I tried Shift + Tabbing a lot hoping it would do something but it never did. But that doesn't mean it's a bad game.No, This is a really good game! Having played through Quake II, I really enjoyed what the game had to offer. Although this game is much less Quake and more Doom 3 Meets Military Shooter in Space with Quake Weapons. If you don't mind the change, I think you will absolutely enjoy it. I did. The weapons are there, your character gets a badass surgery that makes him even look more cool plus you get upgrades later. I haven't tried multiplayer as I do not know if it is still supported. But Quake IV is a really good game. So here is the million dollar question. With Doom 4/Reboot coming out, when's Quake V/Reboot?			",200,9,3,12,12,1,17

												As a huge Quake 2 fan, after dealing with some initial graphic problems, I jumped into the game. And about an hour was enough for me. It's really, really boring. The level design is lame, enemies encountered in the first hour are lame and mostly huge hp sponges, weapons are lame and not very satisfying to use. The game has slow as hell pace and I spent first 15 minutes wondering whether sprinting was possible (nope). You basically just walk through boring corridors at turtle's pace, encounter enemies, sidestep if they're ranged or step back if melee. Or you can just wait for a while and wait for your immortal squadmates to wipe them. Boring, generic, disappointing. ",118,14,0,8,11,0,18

Quake 4, the high definition but not that memorable homage to Quake 2.The GoodGreat graphics for a game that is more than 10 years old!Lots of references to its predecessor, Quake 2Keeps up the interesting horror elements and design of Quake 2.The BadUses all the first person shooter clichés in the book: squad dynamics, escort missions, rail shooter sections, convenient weapon placement, reactivating generators, aligning satellites, the list goes on.Story is short, generic and not very interesting. Gameplay is very linear.Shooting weapons and killing enemies is not that satisfying. Driving vehicles isn't usually very smooth. ",311,40,9,43,15,3,43

												Well... this is a game with an identity crisis. Or with a bold vision of what it wants to be...but the experiment failed.Here's what Quake 2 would have been if it was made with the Doom 3 engine: more about the visuals than the gameplay. That saddens me, because the visuals haven't aged well and the game is left with nothing of value or note. Quake 2 did frentic fast paced shooting with one-man-against-the-odds better,Halo and GoW did the 'chumy space marine' angle better.Countless other games have provided a better shooting feedback loop -- Turok, Halo, Half-life, you name it.Quake 2 has so much more... heart, and it upsets me that what was meant to be a spirtual successor failed to point me towards any touchstones or even remind me of the earlier game at all.

												Apparently this game has a decent story (at least for Quake standards), but who cares... it's Quake. You don't want to be stopped to hear your teammates blabbing about your next mission nor would you want to walk around in home base with nothing to shoot. You want to run and gun. But for some reason you cant run, all you have speed-wise, is this leisurely walk, whitch, if you press shift, slows to a geriatric crawl. Graphics look nice enough for a 10 year old game, but on a modern computer you need to edit a cfg-file, to get hig-res textures loading. With standard in-game highest settings the game loads the ugliest textures possbile. Game itself has steel corridords... a lot of steel corridors and military themed combat. If you are into those things, you might enjoy Q4, but I am not and got bored really quickly. At the end I did give up and clicked through a Let's Play in YT to see, if there are some changes that would inspire me to continue, but sadly it is the stame thing all the way through.So... no recommendation from me.

It's sad, but it's true, in reality i just couldn't get myself to finish this game, or even get past de first mission, but it just seems to me like such a generic first person shooter, it's the kind of shooter that the industry kept producing after the whole ""Call of Duty it's the best game ever"" kinda attitude that a lot of people on the industry began having back then, it just seems so unpolished, bland, and all over the place, it's nothing like the first quakes neither, the first couple of games were clearly made with passion, you could tell, it's just a feeling that you get, this game in the first couple of minutes just seemed to me as a shooting fest, a game souley made for the purpose of cashing in an incredible, beloved franchise, for a lot of gamers, but i don't know, it's clear that a lot of people enjoy it, so it's fine i guess.

												So I have no idea why it took me this long to write this review but let's say that Quake 4 was...dissapointing. I remember playing quake one and two to a big degree back in the day and sometimes now (you might see my playtime for those games is not as big as you might think but I use to play with DOS box to get them running on this and other comps) and after playing just five or so hours of this game....I honestly felt nothing. This is not in a sense of changing difficulty but rather how the game was trying too hard in it's single player campaign. Where Doom 3 was interesting, New and felt cool...Quake 4 failed to keep what made quake interesting.I bought the game when it was on sale back during the Quakecon promotion (mostly for the Genuine Original Rocket Launcher for TF2) and if you buy this for more than $30, you will feel cheated.5 hours is all it took me to beat the game's story, and I wasn't trying hard.Just get Quake 1 or 2...Mostly 2			",69,9,0,18,5,2,2

												I really wanted to like this game but with the hours that I played it I got stuck and wondered around to find that I have gotten to a place on the level that I wasn't sapose to be and I was stuck in limbo breaking the game in the process. Quake 4 is just absolute garbage as a quake game. There is no real point in playing it because the NPC's do everything for you! From killing enemeys to doing things in the game that you the player should be doing!! Heck the whole point of this game is for them to tour guide you through the entire game. Not only that but its really annoying that this game has you walk slower than a freaking turtle for its ""running"" mechanic, its pointless and boring. Quake 4 probably was good for its day but it definetly doesn't hold up with todays standards of a good first person shooter. Instead this game rubs off more as a generic shootem up, if you can even call its gameplay that.Over all Quake 4 is just over praised garbage!Its not that old, and its a piece of crap.

												This game is broken beyond any recognition. For starters it refuse to work on modern machines, so you have to manually rewrite cfg. Then if you managed that, game will have worse textures and geometry than quake 1. Go back to cfg. Then it'll refuse to save any changes in settings menu. Go back to cfg. And after all that it still runs at 15-30-60 FPS randomly on 2x GF970 in SLI. Add to that random crashes and long freezes.And even if we forget all that - the game is still utter cowmanure. Level-design is boring repetitive corridors, movement is sluggish, enemies are dumb and boring, weapons are dumb, boring and ineffective. Half of guns utterly useless and you will run close quarters with shotgun till the final boss. Everything else is console-bethesda levels of awful too. But on the other hand being cowmanure become industry standard, so this game is just mediocre. And it smeared so much crab all other me so i kinda liked it in the end and it had its moments. Stockholm syndrome, obviously. Q4 is like little mentally challenged relative of prey, who crab under himself. They share a lot of similar themes, UI and types of guns. But this one starts with telling player how good Q2 was and then take all the worst part from Q2 and amplify them and take all the best parts of Q2 and throw them away. Even horrible voice acting with fake accents really tired, in the end actor who explaining you what to do next is so disengaged that he almost yawning all the time.There would be a chance that i'll let it pass, but horrible state as a product and overall brokenness is a no-no.

												Normally I'd review a game when I'm finished with it unless the game's utter wank.Quake 4 is one of those games.  Why can't I complete it, you ask?Let's start with the fact that the game is just plain ugly.  It looks uncannily plastic, and the textures are of mediocre quality.  The controls are not great, especially the mouse sensetivity.  Even at the highest level of sensetivity settings, it still moves at a snails pace.  The gameplay is much more on-rails and linear compared to the previous games in the series and is, alongside the story, generally boring.  It doesn't leave you inclined to push on whatsoever.But in all fairness, I didn't have any high expectations for this game.  I've never been a great fan of the Quake series and I've had my fair share of flak for having this opinion.  At least I got this on a sale.  Too bad I can't refund the ♥♥♥♥er, though.

												I am writing this review after getting frustrated with the game on the easiest difficulty and giving up. Read on to find out why.For reference, I am playing on the PC version with a trackball. Even then, the mouse sensitivity on the highest setting is still woefully slow for the majority of combat situations you will be finding yourself in during the course of this game. I hope your mousing hand has had training from Usain Bolt, because you'll need every ounce of arm speed you can muster.What on earth is a reload mechanic doing in a Quake game? Considering the Quake games (used to) focus more on mobility and feeling like a badass even when the odds were not in your favour, having to hide and reload (or worse, having to reload in the middle of a heated firefight) really destroys the pacing of the combat. The mechanic itself is not a bad one, but it is handled poorly in this game. You get the sense that it wasn't planned into the fabric of the game very well at all. It is infuriatingly slow to reload and a lot of the time, as stated before, you find yourself in the middle of a fierce battle having to reload. Now, often this isn't a problem when you are with other members of your squad, but if you are in a solo battle, you have very little chance to survive. Indeed, I find that if the PC game did not have a quick save/load feature, this game would not be recommendable in the slightest. (I wouldn't dare try playing this game on a console under any circumstances.) The only way you can have a hope of surviving (and even then, it is a slim chance) is by mashing the reload key/button after every battle, no matter how big or small, because if you don't have full clips for all weapons before you turn the next corner, you will be toast, more often than not. I have found that the way to get around the slow reloads is to make sure you have a full reload in all weapons and simply switching weapons instead, because switching weapons is much faster than reloading.Speaking about slow, your run speed in this game is slower than Quake 1's walk speed! Trying to run away from enemies is useless. Just pump ammo into them until you run out, then give up, die and restart. You will have to play through the previous 10 minutes of gameplay again.Also, this game is entirely too hard. As stated in the intro, I was playing on the Private difficulty level, which is the easiest of the four difficulty levels, and I cannot count the number of times I have found myself surrounded by enemies with an empty clip in my gun or less than 20 health. I had to quick load some parts of this game up to 20 times just to try and see if I could quickly kill a guy behind me (whom I couldn't hear because of radio chatter from my squad) while I was on under 10 health. This is immensely frustrating, and is essentially the reason why I could not be bothered to finish the game. If I am having such difficulty with the easiest setting, what use is there playing a harder difficulty?There are some really good aspects to this game though. The atmosphere of war at the beginning of the game, and being able to work with your squad in the more typical war-battle based segments was great. It really captured the sense of battling an enemy much more powerful than you, but still giving you the feeling that you had a chance against them. (That feeling didn't last longer than 30 minutes, though. You get quickly overpowered by the enemies.) Your squad also help you when you have to hide and reload. (When you are allowed to fight with them, of course.)Multiplayer is basically a copy of Quake 3. Owing to my single player experience in this game, I didn't try multiplayer, because I have Quake 3 and would rather play that instead. Quake 3 is even a better single-player game anyway, even with its lack of a story or campaign.In summary, Quake 4 is to Quake what Doom 3 was to Doom. It could have been a decent game… only if it was thought through much better, and wasn't called Quake. Associating this game with Quake's rich heritage and therefore, having fans of the series remember and try to apply the play style and tactics of the earlier Quake games, has done more harm than good to this game.If you like sci-fi war FPS games and have no knowledge of the Quake series, this might be an enjoyable experience for you. Pick it up for £5 or less if you want to give it a go. It isn't worth more than that in my opinion. However, if you have any experience of the previous Quake games (and I have been playing Quake since it came out in the late 90s), I would steer clear of this game. Despite the title, it's not Quake.			",29,1,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake 4 feels like the illegitimate love child of Quake 3 and Doom 3. Add to that the feel of someone who once read about what a cool game Quake 2 was, attempting to create an edgy modern tribute.The game is pretty bloated with annoying and unnecessary friendly AI, who's main purpose usually consists of swinging by just to say something pointless and/or die. They also enjoy shouting mean slogans at the Strogg! Theres also laborious vehicle segments that are always a drag.The game wasnt THAT bad, but it frequently felt like work, and by the end i just wanted it to be over. Pick it up on sale if youre a long time fan of the series and a completionist, just dont expect much.EDIT: More fun stuff! Also spoilers probablyThe guns are fairly bland, most the upgrades feel like they simply make a poor gun usable rather than doing anything special. The gravity gun is just a BFG knock-off, the nailgun doesnt even make any sense appearing in the Quake 2 arc of the story, the assault rifle and shotgun are both basically as generic and lifeless as it gets.The horror aspects of the game are also delivered poorly. Their idea of scary seems to largely consist of disembodied torsos. I mean theres only so many torsos you can see before it becomes tiresome - like seriously theyre everywhere. The main characters stroggification procedure was one of the few saving graces.The first(?) boss where you get the gravity gun was pretty good, but the rest were kinda meh, and the end boss was utterly dissapointing. You shoot it a couple times with the gravity gun and it just drops. Then you get a second phase where you essentially do the same, except theres a momentarily confusing shield/generator phase to get through. The overall difficulty of the game was pretty easy, even on second highest difficulty. The only reason i didnt play on highest is a melee unit kept 1shotting me with its special as soon as it came on the screen at the start of the game.Vehicle/rail shooter segments consist of spamming the fire button in the general direction of enemies, and hoping they die before you do. Theyre neither rewarding or enjoyable.The enemies Quake 4 provides were actually one of the better features. They all feel pretty good and show clear progression and strategies to deal with.

												call of duty meets halo meets q3 arena. sounds badass at first, but then you get to the steriotypical turret sections, and vehicle shooting. they could have done this so much better. it isnt quake as quake is known for, its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of the franchise. Its not all bad as the multiplayer can be intense. all in all, I give it a 3/10 and thats because of its redemable qualities.			",64,2,1,9,1,0,0

It looks pretty decent in ""Ultra"" visual settings and with ""force analog shadows"" turned OFF and anti-aliasing turned ON and maxed out to 16x. It is too difficult to succeed at.

												The Quake Series -  These games focus on Gameplay and they do it well.  Fun weapons, fast gameplay, rocket jumping, and mosters from knights to demons.  Always focused on speed and Mutiplayer Gaming.QUAKE 4 - basically for me... ended my love for the series.  The graphics were nice, the weapons were the same, however it just didn't feel fun.  It has vehicles and some alike elements... but the combat levels feel flat, colors boring, and something feels a miss.  I cannot put my finger on why I did not enjoy this game.... I guess I would not recommend it.  Get Quake 3 instead, lol.That being said:  This game and some of the other Quake games really pushed the FPS genre into mainstreme and as a competetive sport.

												By far the worst FPS I have ever played. I can't believe this is part of the Quake series.It starts off okay, but quickly the enemies become bullet sponges and your weapons are weak as hell. Pair this with the snail-paced movement speeds, and you have an extremely boring and tedious game.It's a real shame because if they fixed the combat and movement (KIND OF IMPORTANT IN QUAKE), it could have been a respectable sequel to Quake 2.

												Not a bad game but I can't recommend buying it when the price is 20 euros. I've had a great time playing this shooter but only after installing some mods. Let me put this straight - this game is not properly optimised for Steam. I have a good graphics and enough RAM to run most games but this Quake 4 game even when put in Ultra Quality settings has crappy textures. Add an overall gray-brown-black-metal surrounding and your graphics may look like well, mud.I have most of the same gripes with this game as I've had with Serious Sam 2 - the vanilla game didn't age well. Graphics are not optimised for High Definition, the main character is moving pretty slow for a cyborg, some encounters seems heavily scripted, weapons sometimes don't pack as much punch as they should. But after installing SIKK MOD and PARALAX MOD the game just got better. Graphics are finally nice - dynamic lights, most of objects are retextured to some HD textures, we get some blur effects, etc.. But we also get some problems with levels loading and game crashing after modding so this is a mixed bag of goodies and uglies.Let's try to sum up all of pros and cons for Quake 4 Pros:- modded graphics look really pretty- enemies are grotesque, mechanical monsters with solid design- sound is fine- plot is ok for a single player mode- weapons have nice design - Nailgun and BFG both look nice and have a considerable power- sometimes we can control vehicle like tank or mech suitCons:- although vehicles are fun, those levels with vehicles are pretty long and boring- some of weapons are underpowered - I think that grenade launcher, rocket launcher and most of all railgun are somewhat weak- graphics without mods- most weapons have clips that you need to reload every now and then - really, who thought that would be a good idea in a Quake game? For example Railgun has a 3 ammo in a clip. Most stronger enemies take 3-5 hits with a railgun. Same goes for shotgun - we need to reload it slug after slug up to the point where we get a magazine upgrade and then we can reload a whole magazine (about half of the game). Luckily, we can remove clips with a SIKK mod- character moves really slow and enemies move fast. That can escalate rather quick... - we can change that with SIKK mod- no replay value - single player campaign is scripted and multiplayer is possibly dead- buggy as hell when modded - I needed to move config files manually every now and then when some levels didn't load. It was pretty annoying to save game just before next loading screen, then exit to desktop, move files, run game, load saved game, pass through a loading screen into a next level, save game, exit to desktop, move back those files, run game, load saved game and finally play it. Really, this is pain when you need to do this about 20 times during whole game.After all I can recommend playing this game after modding it a bit (if you can grab it for let's say 5 bucks/euros that is) but if you're not a Quake fan then you can skip it. It's definitely not worth 20 euros, it aged poorly and looks bad without mods. I've had fun but I would not play this game a second time. It's barely playable without mods and thus I can't give thumbs up to a game that requires mods to be fun. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are a sections of this game that are seriously fun. Unfortunately they're separated by generic vehicle sequences and other indications of ""checklist"" game development. The best parts of this game are the solitary interior spaces where you battle through hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons -- in other words, the parts which you can find in Quake 1 and Quake 2. I haven't tried the multiplayer here, but I have a feeling Quake 3 did a better job of that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake 4 was one of the first games I played on my Xbox 360 around mid 2006. I wasn't expecting much out of it, even though Quake 2 is one of my favorite games of all time (but for its multiplayer, not its singleplayer). Plus the reviews of the 360 version of Quake 4 were pretty bad.Even though it was indeed a bad port, I really liked the game. It was a good shooter with a nice weapon upgrade mechanic   and a sweet story twist around the halfway point of the game. But now, in 2014, I'm afraid that it just hasn't aged well. I played Doom 3 before trying my hand again at Quake 4 PC, and Doom has aged much better. Quake 4's graphics look good from a technical standpoint, they don't have the crazy intense atmosphere of Doom 3 but they also don't have Doom's muddy textures. However from an artistic standpoint they're just...flat. Everything feels very generic, very ""been there done that."" The shooting feels like a relic from another era, your weapons feel powerful but you need a ton of bullets to take down your enemies and there's a lot of them, so in firefights all you do is shoot at everything that moves until they drop.  No real tactics here, just shooting. What made those 90's shooters so satisfying is the crazy amount of stopping power you had at your disposal. The double barreled shotgun in Doom 2 can take out a whole room of low level minions if aimed correctly. THAT'S satisfying. Needing 5 shotgun shells to down one guy while his two or three buddies use you for target practice? Meh.So, yeah, leave this one in the past.			",190,83,1,48,11,0,45

												Not worth the money at all, 5 and a half hour single player with a lackluster multiplayer. After beating the game I can say that the story is dreadful and there is only a few pros I can mention. Note that I have always loved Quake but IV was a major disapointment.Pros: Good Blood Effects, Good Ragdolls, Cool GunsCons: Terrible Story, Misplaced Textures, Lots of bugsIf you guys are interested in this game then I'd say don't get it unless it's on sale. If anything, get Doom 3: BFG Edition. It is similar in some ways but improves on the mechanics and gameplay. Or try Rage, also very similar with some improvements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't buy. Enemies and game world has a disney-esque feel, like people who made WoW designed it. It comes off as a really silly and stupid, nothing like original quake, No sense of scariness. Movement feels clunky and slow. Enemies are a direct rip off of Star Trek Borg. Just deleted it after dying for 2nd time on a part that is not so much hard as it is tedious and boring. You have to man a turret on a tank in a convoy. You don't get any control over where you're going in this whole part which is at least 10 min. long. The game suddenly forces you to play it like its a rail shooter. What is this 1995? I bought this to play an fps not a rail shooter. You will die over and over not because of difficulty but because you are just so bored with how it is lulling you to sleep and you just want to ""get to the good part"", so you wind up rushing through or getting lazy with your aim and dying because you're barely paying attention its so boring. Don't waste your money you've been WARNED.			",64,15,1,16,5,0,2

												Not a bad game; looks a bit dated compared to more modern shooters, but the corridor action is great. The outdoor areas were interesting, but really showed up the Doom 3 engine; it's put to better use in the claustrophobic interiors of the game. Worth a few hours of your time, especially if you can pick it up cheap on steam, but once the plasma burns have cooled, I don't think I will remember this game as fondly as the earlier games in the series.

												It's generic as hell, the story is pretty garbage (and ♥♥♥♥ that cliffhanger ending, seriously) but the game is still really fun. Wide of vareity of weapons that get upgraded throughout the story, pretty decent level design and some ok vechile segments. Oh, and the multiplayer was copy and pasted from Quake 3 so it's not that bad.			",569,117,13,95,22,3,82

												This was a great squeal to Quake 2. The storyline was flowed very well and there weren't too many times that I became lost. The graphics were kind of old school but had alot of detail to them. There was so much going on on each stage of the game that I found myself looking around just to admire the creative mind behind it all. The sounds in the game were creepy at times and made me jump a couple of times when a scrog would be around the corner, the guns sounds were powerful and made you feel like you had power. This had the feel of Doom 3 with how it moved and played. The multiplayer aspect of it was disappointing because there weren't too many people playing online but it was still active. Its more of a singleplayer game then a online shooter. The online fighting wasn't as smooth or fluid like it was in Quake 3 Arena. It was very jagged and was hard to get a good rhythm. The overall game was very well done and I highly enjoyed it.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Unlike Doom 3, which was a well-executed reimagining of an old franchise, Quake IV is more of an uninspired extention. Gone are the days of being a lone marine who is humankind's last hope of salvaging the invasion of Stroggos, you now have squad members with you at all times and a commander talking in your ear telling you where to go and what to do. The levels are far more linear than in Quake II. Ammo and health is abundant and enemies are only remotely a challenge on the highest difficulty, and even then they're pretty easily beaten (except for bezerkers, seriously ♥♥♥♥ those guys). The persistence of the Quake ammo/health + armor system and the classic weapons/enemies are really the only things keeping this game from falling into the generic military shooter family of games. It's an alright game, but fans of Quake II will be disappointed.			",228,19,0,21,10,1,36

												I've just bought the game on sale, works fine on a Windoz 8.1 system, had to increase the video resolution in settings but that was all.  The graphics are fine, the player models are a little blocky, but it's an old game. I like the flashlight in dark corridors.    I'll work through the single player then see if anyone still plays multi. six bucks for a classic quake game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quake 4 is a fairly old game, but the graphics still look great and the gameplay is fast-paced, varied, and very satisfying. The storyline puts you in the shoes of a marine sent to a hostile alien world to fight a race of undead machines. You must travel across the planet towards your objective, causing destruction and racking up a huge body count as you go.  About 3/4 of the way through the game things take a different turn and the game becomes even more intriguing and exciting. If you like sci-fi FPS's like Doom 3, Prey, and Painkiller, you will love Quake 4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(I play offline often so my hours on record may be inaccurate)A direct sequel to Quake 2, Quake 4 introduces one Matthew Kane to take up orders to kick ***. The story is engaging and the game is one you just don't want to put down until you beat it. It has a Doom 3 feel to it but still feels original. Enough weapons to make you a one-man-army. Much more playable than many CoD titles, this has a classical feel. A must play for FPS lovers or someone just looking to kill some time.Recommended for FPS players, Doom 3 fans, or anyone who wants a good game to play through.8 out of 10 ",75,19,2,19,4,0,1

												Solid sequel to Q2: you get to meet your crew when they're still able to think straight, you see more Strogg folklore, you check out Strogg medical care and you can explore various important facilities in their planet, checking out all the neat technology they have mounted there.Oh, and destruction. Lots of jolly destruction.Definitely worth getting on Steam.			",249,37,1,18,23,1,20

												Easily my favorite release using id's Doom 3 engine. Quake 4 is a great hardcore Space Marine style game, which I originally played on the 360 and am now enjoying on the PC. Don't forget to tweak the graphics options for best effect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
