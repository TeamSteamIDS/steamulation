												Worst game i ever purchased and i made the mistake of preordering...  The game is so bad that they had to change the name from Merchants of Brooklyn to Drug Wars.  On release, the alpha version was released and buggy as hell.  Then they released the correct version and it was about as bad.  Terrible, terrible game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The trailer makes it look really cool with some Halo/Quake style fast paced crazyness and it uses the same engine as Crysis but it's actually a buggy, broken mess. Within the first 2 minutes i got stuck in a wall and i had to reload the last checkpoint. The enemies also have zero AI and their tactics consist of either standing still and shooting or charging at you like kamikaze soldiers.It's as if someone remade a low budget FPS game from the Playstation 2 in the Cry Engine.Not very good.Buy a sandwich instead.2/10.

Literally worse than Hitler.Quite possibly the worst videogame I've ever played in my life and a mortal threat for epileptics.My friend bought it for me as a joke, thinking it could be a case of ""so bad it's funny"", but it's just too bad.The game supposedly has a multiplayer focus, but there are zero servers listed in the server list and I doubt the any of the multiplayer modes are even functional. I booted up a server to try it but it wouldn't let me start without a secound player. I don't know another person who owns this game luckily but at least I got a good glimpse of the nice textures that were flashing white and stretching into the sky all across the map.There are seven weapons, none of which feel satisfying or fun to use on any of the bullet-sponge enemy varieties (there are two; the big dudes who take about three times too many bullets or punches to kill and have awful hitboxes and then there are the armoured kind of those guys). Some weapons lack the functionality they are described as having (looking at you, ""Radio Frier""). The single-player campaign ends in an unwaranted cliffhanger and has three maps in total, all of which are near-impossible to navigate because everything looks the same and it's like the developers went out of their way to make sure that the way you're supposed to go is placed in the LEAST intuitive place possible.The voice-acting is atrocious, the story is awful, the graphics are admittedly not terrible (aside from character models and character animations) but they're buggy instead. The framerate is horrible and inconsistent. The game crashes both regularly and irregularly.There are maybe four songs in total that repeat throughout the entire game (when it isn't being completely silent aside from that one enemy that fell through the floor and is now shooting you from outside of the map) and yet if you asked me to hum one of them, I couldn't. They figured out how to put the least possible effort into creating the songs while making sure they still qualified as music somehow. Many things in the game lack sound effects entirely and the existing sound effects will only play at random occasions. An enemy can walk up to you from behind and start beating/shooting you in your back and you will have no idea until your screen turns red because no sound is playing at all.Don't buy this game for any reason except maybe if you're a hardcore masochist, in which case you'd still have more fun wedging hot needles under your thumbnails.

												I bought this early and consigned it to the pile of games called 'Big Mistakes'.  If you are thinking about buying this game, don't.  When I got this the Alpha didn't even load.  The game has pretty much been abandoned, and essentially if you paid for this, you were robbed.I can't believe Steam still have this game up for sale....			",257,47,11,13,18,7,25

												How bad is it? When it launched, it was titled 'Merchants of Brooklyn.' They actually changed the name months later in an attempt to hide from the word-of-mouth the game had generated. It seems to have tricked the Metacritic link on the store page, so that actually somewhat worked. (Metacritic says 35/100, which is actually pretty generous)			",2439,766,93,291,276,30,350

												I'm going to save both you and me the trouble and tell you right away, do not buy this game.A) There are no servers what so ever, so no multiplayerB) I have no idea what's going on in single player land. Seriously, I got to a boxing ring with two guys (btw, we are in a jail and some random thugs show up with weapons. What)C) The main character is basically Bionic CommandoD) The game is just plain oddI don't know what drew your attention to this game, but whatever it is, it really isn't worth it. I got this as a gift, and I feel sorry for the guy who wasted his money on this.Verdict: AVOID			",650,177,40,79,76,8,92
