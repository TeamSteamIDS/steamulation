												So, I played this entire game through from start to finish. I was really looking forward to playing this game, because I am a fan of the actual roleplaying game. To say the least, I was thoroughly disappointed. The game suffers from lighting errors early in the game, which already establish a bad image for the rest of the game. The annoying lighting errors aside, the actual graphics of the game aren't horrible, but aren't impressive either. I recall some texture errors on armors, in which a glitchy texture covered the entire armor set. In addition, I also recall many of the armor models being reused, so  quite a few of the armor sets look the same. The actual game play is accurately described in the description as, ""hack and slash"", so I can't complain about the mostly tedious game play. There really isn't much room for character development, which is limited to four different classes, each with a set race. I will however say that despite limitations, the concept of leveling up, and upgrading your equipment, is what keeps the game playable. As for the actual storyline, I won't spoil any of it, but I will say that in my opinion, the storyline isn't satisfying and the final boss fight is nothing short of frustrating and redundant (and for me, one of the lowest points of the game). If all of the bugs were fixed, and there was more room for character development, then with some expansions onto the actual content (like maybe a sandbox mode or more of a storyline, because the actual game is very short), then this game would be a decent game. However, at its current phase, I cannot say I would recommend it, and overall I was disappointed.			",61,8,0,13,8,2,10

												Although it is certainly possible to glean some enjoyment from this game, it is impossible to pretend that it isn't a huge failure in every way imaginable. Like nearly every D&D title not adapted by Black Isle Studios and/or BioWare, it is an affront to all the grand-daddy of RPGs stands for. It is a barely customizable linear hack'n'slash with a wonky camera, unintuitive targeting and unresponsive controls.Note also that both the develepor and the multiplayer platform, Bedlam and GameSpy respectively, are out of business. So neither support nor dungeon-crawling with strangers are an option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've tried to come back to this game a few times now but just can't seem to stay interested.  Not sure if it is the simplistic story or the silly way in which the NPCs just grunt at you while the dialogue comes at you (reminds me of a Nintendo game actually), but I just haven't been able to stick with the game long enough to finish it.  Combat mechanics are ... meh, and you are forced to pick from a mostly premade character with no ability to really create your own character which is also disappointing considering this is a D&D game.Kind of felt like Gauntlet-ised D&D.

												I would rate this game a 5/10. A lot of reviews would have you think it's the worst game in the world. That isn't true, it's just the worst D&D game I've come across.The game suffers from so many flaws it's hard to put them all in words. The combat and camera is wonky. The writing isn't good. The graphics weren't anything special even in 2011. Yet, here I am 4 years later playing through it for a second time. It has a pseudo-Dark Alliance vibe to it that can be an okay diversion for 5-6 hours. At the end you'll probably end up wondering why you didn't spend those hours playing something--no anything--else.			",133,24,1,39,20,4,38

												I found a note from Volothamp Geddarm the other day in my ""Grand Tour of the Realms"" guidebook - he must have snuck in my stronghold while I was over in Athkatla picking up supplies and having coffee with my old friend Jaheira. In the note Volo spake in words with his famous quill: Sir Spamicide, one best not slip a foot into this false interpretation of our wondrous realm, or thou will surely feel as thou hath been flatulated upon by a Pit Fiend and under compulsion to consume the fecal pie of an Ettin, which is the consistency of packed clay containing various undesirable items such as goblin feet, unusual bones, teeth, hair, mushroom-like gut flora and at least a few fingernails. I know this my dear friend as I have played the game and only Khelben Blackstaff of Waterdeep could restore my sanity. So, I extend this offer to you or any of your companions that hath endured the torturous experience of this game: Stop by Neverwinter any day during Kythorn and meet me at the Sunken Flagon where Sand, a mage of renown and thine own self will cast an ""erase selected memory"" spell, followed by a ""permanence"" spell, which are the instruments Kehlben used to cure me of the memory; we perform said services free of charge. With departure I must bestow this wisdom upon you - only play games that have been developed on the Black Isle near Evermeet or by the Biowarians deep with the Jungles of Chult. Safe travels my good sir,   ~Volo			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy. This game is no longer supported.  Atari no longer even admit to owning this game. The developer is out of business. Gamespy does not exist so multiplayer is out of order. The sound may not work at all. This game does not support 1080p resolutions. I finished this game once, not long after it was released. It is a sub-par game. Its controls and camera are badly done for pc. The games difficulty comes from the lack of control the player has over his own character. The plot is thin and the enermies respawn too fast. The whole game is very monochrome. Even if you can get the game working you will miss out on multiplayer. This is yet another game that fails to do D&D well.			",125,40,0,33,15,2,35

												I definitely seem to be in the minority with this game, but I really enjoy it.  Other than an odd bug that happened towards the end of the game when my primary and secondary weapon buttons on the mouse got reversed and I couldn’t change them back, I never really experienced any problems.  Is the game the greatest thing since Swiss cheese?  No, but if you can get it on sale, I think it’s definitely worth it.  I just finished my first play through with the fighter and plan to go back and try someone else.  Don’t go in expecting the world and you will definitely get your money’s worth of enjoyment.

												Finished it years ago and neglected to review it - like most games in my account. Not as bad as some say, in my opinion, but probably not the best either. Lower your expectations (if you ignored the negative ratings) and you might actually have som fun. Strange minor bugs once in awhile but nothing gamebreaking that I know of or experienced personally. No major technical issues either. I actually liked Daggerdale, despite its shortcomings, and I still do. My biggest complaint would be the fact that you cannot remap your keys without some tweaking in the ini or through the use of software such as autohotkey. Very annoying even though I got it to work in the end.Also, the current price for it is likely a bit steep. The game is abandoned so there are not going to be any official fixes for whatever you might bump into while playing. Have to check the internet or forums for that.6/10			",19,6,0,11,0,0,6

												I bought this game years ago, and then had to find and install patches for it to work. That's not the biggest issue I had, though.The game is almost unplayable (unless you choose dwarf cleric) if you prefer to solo, and because of the collapse of the multiplayer servers, everyone has to play solo. I took my solitary cleric far. I made it all the way to the end. I fought a dragon and drove it off, only to be held back by an impassable wind barrier. Because of that, I couldn't finish the game. There wasn't a way for me to reach the main bad.Add to that that I was constantly covered in development textures, making the game feel largely unfinished and greatly rushed.The game is unbalanced and the developer is underwater, buried, and long gone. Leave this game with them, buried and forgotten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've tried three times to play through this, only making it to the end on my final attempt. This game is poorly written and very buggy. Half the equipment does not load textures properly, so expect to be clad in nasty blue if you want the best equipment. The ending was so bugged that I read several articles and watch multiple YouTube videos on how to get it to complete, and I still couldn't finish. I could beat the final boss, but the game would always crash before it would save my victory. This game is just awful. It captures none of the magic of Dungeons and Dragons. Stay away. Free is too much to pay for this game. You'll never get the life you waste on it back.			",40,5,0,11,0,0,7

												The absolute worst use of D&D ever.  I played the demo and thought it was alright so bought it.  I was wrong.  Basically this is an attempt to shoehorn D&D into an action RPG and it fails miserably.  D&D skills are based around turn based combat and this game does very little to try to make them work in a real time ARPG setting.  This makes the combat a bit bland and boring.  The real crime here is the story though.  The best D&D games on PC are memorable for their storylines and characters.  There is nothing of the sort to be found here. The vast majority of voice acting in the game is groans and grunts, you soon wish there was no noise at all when you interact with NPCs.  There is a big bad guy at the end but by the time you get there you've forgotten why you care about him and you just want to finish the game so you never have to play it again.  If you are after D&D there are better games out there.  If you are after an ARPG there are better games out there.  Avoid at all costs.			",164,22,7,41,12,0,19

												To be perfectly honest I wish there was a way to have a null vote, that aside. D&D: Daggerdale is plagued by bugs and glitches. Most predominant is when wearing the majority of magically imbued armours your character will tend to tun into a grey and blue/purple thing. I can't say I'd recomend a game that allows such a thing to occur, particularly with a $14.99 price tag. The good points of the game, well, aside from being few and far between, is that it actually follows the 4th edition ruleset that it is based off, instead of dodging around a lot of the rules.There are too many bugs, glitches and things that need to be fixed before this game would be really worth paying $15 for, were it to be fixed, it might actually be make a name for itself, though I am doubtful that such a thing will occur.

												An excellent simulator of being a sentai member accidentally marketed as a Dungeons & Dragons game, D&D: Swordville is a delightful game to spend a little time playing, especially for those who enjoy accidentally selling off their entire inventory when attempting to scroll down a merchant's inventory list.Considered a game of the year 2011 by such respectable institutions as Wikipedia and Metacritic, this is a title definitely worth picking up if you find it on sale for at least $20 off the cover price.(Note: I haven't beaten this game and likely will not until/unless I try it on a different computer, because it started crashing on startup after my first two play sessions and has continued doing so ever since. That... pretty well fits with how well the game was working before that, but still.)			",923,363,8,393,62,1,217

												Dungeons and Dragons: Daggerdale is a short, mostly easy game that can be completed in under 10 hours. It has a multiplayer option that is powered by Gamespy, and as of this writing on 29/12/2013 one can create a new account and play through online multiplayer with other players (though it does take a few tries). For what you get I'd generally only recommend buying this game when it's on sale. It's just not long enough to justify the higher price tag.			",184,32,0,43,4,1,7

The multiplayer part of this game is what I personally enjoyed the most. So, if that was still part of the game id recommend it to anyone, but since its no longer able to be an online multiplayer game, I would suggest those to invest in a different game, unless they perfer only single player games.

												Bland And Boring: Daggerfail is what they should've called this. There, I summed up the game in an amusing way, if I do say so myself (I'm hilarious, what can I say). Ok, let me explain some more. The graphics aren't that bad, but they ARE bland and the faces are ugly as hell. It's like I'm looking at people with down syndrome (no offense meant). Add some (and now I'm being generous) bugs and glitches and NO FUN whatsoever and this game is the result. I normally love dungeon crawlers, but the combat is clumsy, as well as the interface. The loot is crap. NPC's are (or get) stuck in environments and objects, (solved) quests aren't always triggered, the camera swirls around so much that it disorients me and I could go on and on and on. But it's just not worth it. Leave it be.[Rating: 52/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												For when it was released only two years ago, this game is shockingly laking in basics, e.g. voice work.  Embarassing grunts and groans with text replace proper voice work.  It is the first game for years that I have bought in a sale for less than a fiver and still felt robbed.It plays and looks like a sort of single character version of Dungeon Siege but even then doesn't have that classic feel.  I would rather reload Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna than play this anymore.  If Steam had an Amazon-like section ""Game for Laptops"" it might belong there.....			",136,17,0,33,4,0,13

												I find DnD:Daggerdale a fun game. I've played DnD table top and it has a lot of same builds. The controls are easy nothing to hard or complex. and at for the price its a steal. The story line is good and the game play is fun. The only down side is you can't make your own char. You can only pick from a Mage Halfling, Elf rogue, Human Fighter, and Dwarf Cleric. I wish they would have let you build your own. This game is still worth play. I recommend it the game not hard so it could dull the game play later on. But it just really sucks you can make your own Char. That really kills the fun for me.			",187,24,4,36,26,4,30

												This is not a very good game.  It isn't balanced at all for single player, the characters are a bit too one dimensional and inadequate to face the number of enemies that will be encountered at a time.  I didn't run into any serious bugs while I played but during cut scenes the game has a very aggravating habit of teleporting the character around, moving you to a different position so that you may be a bit disoriented when you regain control of your character and on occaision it will have back to back reloads of a level when you complete a quest.

												Daggerdale was presented as a hack-n-slash action-RPG in the vein of the ""Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance"" games that appeared on the XBox and Playstation 2. Those were fairly uninventive RPGs (no party, no significant role-playing or dialogue) but still enjoyable for all that. I was looking forward to more of the same.But Daggerdale doesn't even reach the unimpressive standards of a console RPG. It is a dull and dreary game. The level design is exceedingly linear, and every foot of it looks the same. The music is perhaps the most uninspired I have heard in any recent game, and the ""Simlish"" speech (doubtlessly used to save on localization costs; why pay for voice-actors when you can just use random grunting in place of speech?) is terrible. The controls are sluggish, the auto-targeting is terrible and the action is poorly paced. Nor is there any redeeming quality in the loot; none of the weapons are in anyway impressive. Story and setting are equally under-whelming. And the savepoints are poorly placed.To top everything else off, the game is buggy; textures didn't show up, the game crashed randomly and too often my on-screen avatar just stopped responding to my controls (my favorite bug is how, in the climatic quicktime event -yes, the game resorts to those, too- my character wasn't even visible on the screen! The only possible saving graces to this game was the inclusion of co-op play... but then, I'm not sure I'd want to subject a friend to this game anyway. The four-hour gameplay, normally a disadvantage, was a god-send since I'm not sure I could have stomached more of this game anyway.Daggerdale sucks. Even at sale it isn't worth the price. Avoid at all costs. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isnt a recomendation its a warning!The Controls are clumsy at best between character movement and Camera control, the game progresses you along without warning and can move you to the next step making you run back to collect anything you didnt get or whatever you wanted to do before hand.Character creation is a Joke, if they would have allowed a more varied creation such as a dwarven rogue or a Human Wizard it would have been easier to overlook the control aspect. As it stands your pretty much locked into the ""feats"" you take because you have no real control over character creation.I would give this a 2.5 out of 5 rating because it has potential but it failed at reaching it!

												Dungeons and Dragons: DaggerFAILThis game is a port from the Xbox Live Arcade version of the same game. It feels like it'sa game that's been  in Alpha testing and then they've just decided to release it as a joke.The game advertises it's 4-player co-op, however you are unable to connect to any Multiplayer games. There is absolutely no options in the lobby so you just have to sit and wait, and hope someone else can connect to your game. Trying to join someone elses game presents the same issues. I can only imagine that the game is so horrible no-one else is playing it.So stuck playing 1P. First item I received was a helmet. I equipped it, and it had no textures. The controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The 'cutscenes' that tell you what's supposed to be going on in the game are jerky and disjointed. Sound = horrible. When you click the button the guy swings his weapon. This is about the only thing that actually works.This is just about the worst game I've ever played. $15 down the drain...			",105,11,0,28,11,3,34

												Despite how fun this game looks, it isnt. Forced into a Race/class combo (without letting you even choose most of your stats!) this is a Diablo rip off, and not a good one at that. On top of the lactluster gameplay, There is a lack of complete voice overs except at the end of chapter (Grunts for everything else). The flaws dont even end there Skellies taking full damage from swords and arrows and ghosts are able to take damage from everything regardless if its a magical weapon or not. Every thing with special texture also is bugged, it is replaced by a Blue and White texture, and has been since release of the game (Unless you enjoy running from Gargamel, this is a bad thing). All and all it is not worth the 15 dollars spent on this game. Burning your money would give you more enjoyment and a closer experiance to DnD then this game could offer (Fire is ALWAYS fun). This recommendation is more of a warning. Dont buy this game unless you want to be extremly disapointed.			",185,29,0,55,10,1,34

The texture issue is quite annoying, running around blue and white because your armor doesn't have a texture.The final boss fight was a bit annoying as well, being so different from the rest of the game.The game is also very short.  You can finish it in one sitting.  And the ending, just feels like it was the end of chapter one and there is no chapter two.The game play is hack and slash action RPG.  Nothing wrong there.

												This game has a headache-inducing camera, character movement is a bit awkward, interface is bad, skills are limited (may be a 4e thing, not sure), you're locked in to stock race/class/stat combinations with little customization, gameplay seems repetitive (mind you, didn't manage to force myself to play too far in) although isn't terrible, and the cutscenes and voice acting is awful. Except for a nice cutscene of an earth elemental at the end of the tutorial (which the game doesn't allow you to fight anyway), all the cutscenes in the introduction scene (with no backstory to speak of, too), and first hour of the game are still photos - every dwarf you speak to brings up an identical portrait of a bedraggled dwarf, and a voiceover of a single bemused grunt from stock sound libraries no matter what the dwarf is trying to say.tl;dr: Sadly awful.

												Don't bother with this game.  For something released in 2011, it sure feels and looks like the early 2000s.  I guess the DnD license can just be used by anyone to create terrible games nowadays.The graphics are horrible, the music is awful, and the gameplay is mediocre.  Instead of actually having voiced lines, someone decided to just give all the conversing characters grunts instead of actual words.  Textures in the game kept failing on me and the only reason I bothered beating it was... well I don't know.  Random loot drops is the *only* thing the game had going for it.  Nothing else.  This is definitely one of those ""play and uninstall as quickly as possible"" types of games.  Don't even bother looking back.Rating: 2/5 (Just barely)			",182,21,0,31,7,0,19

												Personally, I feel this game seems like it was a rush job when I've played it. No options for voice chat when they have voice chat in the game. Saw a post on the forums and apparently it's powered by GameSpy Arcade? Something that seems non-existent? Some of the armor does not have proper graphics, so as the dwarf, one could say I look like a Smurf. Yup, a blue and white character model.If one truely wants this game, I would only buy it if it was dirt cheap. Friend of mine got it to me for free, played it with him, felt like it was a waste of my two hours.It does have potential if they would actually fix all the crap within it, but considering when it was released (June '11) and when I posted this (Jan '12), I doubt any progress has been made.

												I assumed D&D games couldn't dissapoint me, but Daggerdale entirely disabused me of that kind of thinking. A shallow intro sequence foreshadows an even shallower story. The well known AD&D rules system was flattened to the ground and the flame of motivation was doused when i saw myself confronted with 4 bound by class and race characters. Movement felt kind of clumsy, while simple graphics with no love for details made me reconsider my buying decision.			",53,5,0,30,3,0,30

												Not a very good D&D game in my opinion. Reminds me of two games; DDO and Diablo 2. It seems to try to be a DDO game, but fails a bit. It has some Diablo elements, but doesn't seem to use it to improve the gameplay. Also, it has some glitches, bad dialog structure at some points of the game, and it breaks continuity by wretching the control of the camera while doing something else. For me, it was while battling enemies, and the game deciding to take my character away from the battle and focus on the story character. I assume it would be a much more fun experience if you played it with friends. It's an alright game, but not enough to thumbs it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is extremely buggy, and you can tell that the developers did not put a lot of effort into the creation of this game. Most of the armor sets look just like other sets. It was as if they could not spare the time nor effort to create other textures to make this game unique. This is just a minor issue; however, the greater issues lie in the bugs within this game. About 80% of the time, a player will see artifacting on their armor textures, plus the end of the game is bugged really bad as well. I could not complete this game due to this bug. To add to these current horrific issues, the game faces yet another major let down; this is the fact that the game is extremely short. The game was pretty much over when I was just getting into it, and that was a major let down. All in all, this is a pretty pathetic game, and I really frown upon Atari for even publishing a piece of garbage such as this! Save your money, your time, and your sanity, and do not buy this game.

												This game feels like it fell out of the 90s. Character creation is limited to selection of 4 different preset race/class combinations. The UI is not very intuitive (scroll bars that only allow the top and bottom arrows to be clicked?) and the game's maximum resolution is hard-coded, instead of being able to match your monitor (1920x1080p? Not happening)You'd have to really be a fan of 4th edition DND to make this worth $15. Fanbois only.			",420,128,7,103,75,3,85

												The graphics are decent and the game play style is not frustrating, but that is about all this game has going for it.  There are only four characters you can be, and they are already built for you, allowing for extremely limited customization (simply put, you choose your spells/abilities and that is it).  The story is also less than enthralling, which is one of the biggest reasons this gets my thumbs down.  Any game based off of the world of Dongeons and Dragons, be it the Forgotten Realms or some other D&D world, should have much more thought put into the story.  All together this title is one I would recommend against buying at all.  If it is ever free to play, then perhaps it will be worth the money.			",43,10,0,7,1,0,0

It has DX11 but the engine won't go beyond 720p or at the most 1600x900 and even then I'm not convinced it doesn't revert because when I go into options it shows that its reverted. The graphics were mediocre at best and the camera angles were mostly useless. Definitely one to skip.			",41,7,4,12,3,0,2

												I think I need to wash my keyboard after playing this game.If you are a D&D 3.5 fan, imagine every criticism you ever lobbed at 4E about it being ""too much like a video game"".Now imagine a video game based on 4E that removed all the redeeming factors. You have no party. Your at-wills are on the hotbar, as are your encounter powers and daily powers, which are now keyed exclusively to real-time cooldowns themselves.And it's all buggy as hell.They could have made a wonderful, even FUNCTIONAL version of the D&D Tactics PSP game using the 4E ruleset. They decided to do precisely the opposite, creating a buggy hack-and-slash PC game based loosely on the 4E ruleset.WOTC was on to something when they made the GBA Eye of the Beholder and the PSP D&D Tactics. They missed the target, but they got somewhere close. A proper D&D TRPG is just waiting to be made, but now it's looking it will never come to pass. A pity.			",430,235,2,96,59,4,102

												Don't bother with this game.  For something released in 2011, it sure feels and looks like the early 2000s.  I guess the DnD license can just be used by anyone to create terrible games nowadays.The graphics are horrible, the music is awful, and the gameplay is mediocre.  Instead of actually having voiced lines, someone decided to just give all the conversing characters grunts instead of actual words.  Textures in the game kept failing on me and the only reason I bothered beating it was... well I don't know.  Random loot drops is the *only* thing the game had going for it.  Nothing else.  This is definitely one of those ""play and uninstall as quickly as possible"" types of games.  Don't even bother looking back.Rating: 2/5 (Just barely)			",182,21,0,31,7,0,19

												Not even Close to a proper D&D Title. Though i didnt mind the action hack n slash implement, it was not fluid enough to maintain the role play aspect of what D&D has been about all these years. Ive seen 1 patch for the game come up and it still didnt fix the Large GFX issues; i.e. broken armor textures, or even the save and exit while in the middle of a quest. Doing so does not save your quest progress but instead saves everything else and makes you start the quest from the begininning. I do not wish to bash a D&D series over one mishap child in the series, but i do would like to call out a Development team that really needs to gather background information on a Series before they start their own off-series title.

The UI is not very intuitive (scroll bars that only allow the top and bottom arrows to be clicked?) and the game's maximum resolution is hard-coded, instead of being able to match your monitor (1920x1080p? Not happening)You'd have to really be a fan of 4th edition DND to make this worth $15. Fanbois only.			",420,128,7,103,75,3,85

												Not a very good D&D game in my opinion. Reminds me of two games; DDO and Diablo 2. It seems to try to be a DDO game, but fails a bit. It has some Diablo elements, but doesn't seem to use it to improve the gameplay. Also, it has some glitches, bad dialog structure at some points of the game, and it breaks continuity by wretching the control of the camera while doing something else. For me, it was while battling enemies, and the game deciding to take my character away from the battle and focus on the story character. I assume it would be a much more fun experience if you played it with friends. It's an alright game, but not enough to thumbs it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally, I feel this game seems like it was a rush job when I've played it. No options for voice chat when they have voice chat in the game. Saw a post on the forums and apparently it's powered by GameSpy Arcade? Something that seems non-existent? Some of the armor does not have proper graphics, so as the dwarf, one could say I look like a Smurf. Yup, a blue and white character model.If one truely wants this game, I would only buy it if it was dirt cheap. Friend of mine got it to me for free, played it with him, felt like it was a waste of my two hours.It does have potential if they would actually fix all the crap within it, but considering when it was released (June '11) and when I posted this (Jan '12), I doubt any progress has been made.

												I did not enjoy this game much at all.  It is based on the 4th edition of Dungeons and Dragons and really lacks alot of variety.  I would say its worth the money, but I think I'd rather have the cash.			",5,3,0,9,0,0,0

												Wow what can I say.  I'm ashamed of my self for buying this.  I can't believe how terrible and monotonous this game is.  How far can you get away from what D&D is and still call it D&D.  Tts so linear it down right insulting to say that I'm plaing D&D when I play this.  All I can say is watch the game play on youtube and you will understand how truly terrible this instalment of D&D games really is.			",48,0,0,10,21,0,31

												Save your money, this is one of the worst adaptations of the beloved pen and paper game I have ever seen. If you do decide to purchase this and invest any amount of time into it, prepare to smash more barels than donkey kong.			",70,5,0,13,4,0,14

												I assumed D&D games couldn't dissapoint me, but Daggerdale entirely disabused me of that kind of thinking. A shallow intro sequence foreshadows an even shallower story. The well known AD&D rules system was flattened to the ground and the flame of motivation was doused when i saw myself confronted with 4 bound by class and race characters. Movement felt kind of clumsy, while simple graphics with no love for details made me reconsider my buying decision.			",53,5,0,30,3,0,30

												Do NOT buy this game!!!!  It is underwhelming... a total console port done the most craptastic way possible.  There are plenty of other dungeon crawlers out there... this game is a huge underwhelming pile of poop!			",116,7,0,29,8,2,16
