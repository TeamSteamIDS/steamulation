AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: FPS; Stealth; Sniper; Linear My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a narrow-pathed, story-driven FPS with minor stealth elements.  The campaign is highly story driven and will escort you from scene to scene as you progress; don’t expect an open world, or much freedom to explore in the main game.  (The DLC expansion, however, does provide a more open-world experience).  There is also a multiplayer mode which did have a small number of active players at the time I played this.What I found most enjoyable about Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 was the main campaign.  I really enjoyed the simple storyline, the pacing of the game, and the landscapes which you explore.  The graphics may not be the absolute best, but I really found the levels to be attractive and interesting.  The story wasn’t earth-shatteringly good but it kept me interested throughout my playthrough.  The story guides you through narrow-pathed levels as events unfold.  Don’t expect to be able to do much exploration or anything; although, there are some hidden collectibles to search for (even then: scarcely off the main path).You are a sniper, so most of the gameplay revolves around moving (stealthily) from one sniper spot to the next, picking off enemies as effectively as possible.  There are stance, breathing, gravity, and wind mechanics that are taken into consideration when you snipe.  And you are supposed to snipe… you won’t be able to ""Rambo"" through the game, even on easy.  That said, the game is pretty forgiving and has decently placed checkpoints, so even on hard it shouldn’t be overwhelming.  In fact, some people may actually find the game too easy— as the AI is pretty predictable and most scenarios can be swiftly dealt with before they even are aware of your presence.There is also a multiplayer mode.  There were a few dozen people playing at a time on the occasions that I checked it out.  It certainly can have its moments, but when you have a 5 on 5 (or less) of all snipers, it can get pretty dull.  It was a little too slow for my personal tastes, but I am sure it can be quite enjoyable for those who would appreciate the style of PVP gameplay.Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 offers a fun campaign that will take you on a ride and offer a brief FPS experience focused on stealth and sniping.  If that sounds like fun, you will probably enjoy what this has to offer.  I wouldn’t, however, expect much from the multiplayer experience.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I would give this game something between a thumbs up and a thumbs down because I do like some aspects of the game.  However, they force me to make a black & white choice and I choose ""No Way"".  The graphics are pretty good, the basic gameplay is OK but there are a lot of issues:1.  There are places on the maps you can get stuck and not be able to get out of AND you cannot kill yourself to continue playing the game!  You have to leave the game altogether and rejoin (if you can).2.  There is no way to kick or ban a player on your own server DURING the game ...you have to wait for the game to be over!  This is the ONLY thing you can do to protect yourself and it isn't even in-the-moment or real-time!3.  Rampant cheating via engineered hacking/aimbot/God-mode programs ruin any opportunity for the expectation of fair play.  I feel as though I have left more games than I have finished because of these jerks.  I wish them all a horrible painful death in the real world.  They have collectively stolen the money we have invested in this game and Steam does nothing to stop it.  Indeed, the cheaters occasionally talk about such things and defend their own actions on the Discussion channels and you never see a Steam moderator step in and take any action.  They have left us to the wolves.4.  The ""game-view"" or ""sight-view"" (what you see vs. what the enemy sees) is really screwed up.  I can be inside a tunnel with no view of the enemy yet he can see me and kill me.  How is that fair?  My arms and legs aren't hanging out, I am OUT OF SIGHT and even this is no defense.  Being out-of-sight is not even considered stealthy in a game that is BUILT on concept of stealth?5.  There is no way to configure your own server for ""Pistols-Only"", ""No Pistols"" or anything else that would allow different styles of play or game modes for variety.  Every server and every map is largely identical with few deviations.  It quickly  becomes boring.6.  Character movement and control is full of inconsistencies... in some places you cannot go prone for no aparent reason.  Where you can go prone, while you are crawling on your belly you may encounter a flat board or step in the ground.  Crawling across this change in terrain causes you to STAND UP!  Instant death in many circumstances.  Other places with boards or terrain changes this doesn't happen and you pass right through them.  In some places you cannot go prone, but if you hit ""Crouch"" it instantly goes prone instead.  VERY inconsistent on a portion of the game that SHOULD be rock-solid in its second version.7.  Cheaters/hackers/banned players can just make up a new name and continue playing.  How does this help the integrity of the game?  There is no way to stop them and the game LETS them get away with it for as long as they want.The game was fun when I first started but now is only occasionally fun and the more I play the more frustrated I get.  There are far too many problems, not enough players, too many cheaters and there is NO support from the developer or this provider so I have decided to stop buying ANY more games like this.  Little quality control or standards seem to be applied and the user pays the price.			",44,0,2,0,4,0,4

												An “ok” non-AAA game that provides a mainstream stealth and sniping experience.Presentation and writing are mediocre and clichéd, but I was already expecting this. Otherwise, the story is not bad, and slightly more down-to-earth than most Call of Duty games of late. Levels are very linear and heavily scripted. You are guided by your spotter who stays at your side most of the time. This provides good immersion and manages to convey the sense of working as a team, but his AI is a bit unreliable when in open combat.The scripting is fairly basic and lacks some polish. There were various issues, like dialogue getting cut off, or checkpoints not reloading correctly. A few times my character would confirm over radio that I had the target in my crosshair, but the target was no where to be seen on my screen. The checkpoint save system has the usual irritations associated with such a system. It is also a pity the difficulty settings offer no more options beyond “easy, medium, hard” - I wanted to play “medium”, but without the “red dot” aim assist that ruins the sniping challenge. Also, once you have started, there is no option to change the difficulty later. I had a few crashes to desktop. All these issues were very annoying, but did not ruin the experience.The graphics are decent (as you would expect from the CryEngine) but do not quite have the same visual quality as the Crysis games. Some areas look really nice, but others less so. The standard quality setting are poorly optimised. I achieved much better fps after careful tweaking (tip: put “object detail” on low for massive fps boost and next to no quality loss).Controls are ok, but feel a bit clunky and are unresponsive in some contexts. Fortunately there is no mouse lag or acceleration. Weapon handling and ballistics are ok, but not simulator grade. The game lacks a detailed tutorial and you cannot “zero” the sights to various ranges like you can in ARMA and Red Orchestra 2. The simulation of wind on bullets feels artificial because the wind speed is not effectively reflected in the environment - vegetation does not respond accordingly and there are no other indicators like the sound of wind or moving dust etc. The displayed distances seem to be fake - an ingame distance of 400m is actually closer to 200m (a sin many mainstream games commit one way or another to be more accessible to console peasants). Compared to Far Cry 3, this game was clearly made on a smaller budget, with less content, freedom and polish, but in the end I still liked the single player campaign more here. It is more cohesive and serious, while Far Cry 3 was a theme park of absurd sensationalist violence.Overall this is a decent second-rate game I mildly enjoyed. I had very modest expectations, and it satisfied them. Get it when on sale.			",54,7,0,5,1,0,2

												This game is fun and relaxing while being pretty immersive for the most part. The sniping is enjoyable and the developers manage to keep things fairly entertaining. It looks pretty good using the Crysis engine and it runs fine for me on a GTX 980 with Windows 10. I just have to do a trick to get the vsync working. It’s necessary to enable windowed mode and then switch back to fullscreen mode, everytime I boot up the game. Once I do this, I get a solid 60FPS, with no screen tearing.The campaign checkpoints are poorly implemented, which can force you to sit through the same sequence, multiple times after dying. This is particularly frustrating on the expert difficulty which can be extremely challenging. I found the multiplayer component to be very unique and fun, as it’s a relatively new concept for me. It mainly involves stalking other players with your rifle scope, while not giving your position away. Only problem is that not so many people are playing multiplayer. The DLC maps, which are fairly impressive, had no one playing at all when I tried to find a game.Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is also surreal and ridiculous in a way that I really enjoy. I mean I don’t know if the developers intended for the voice acting to be so funny. The game appears to be a great example of ‘funny without meaning to be’. As I think they might of been trying to create a serious and realistic tone. However the Commander Wheeler character in particular sounds like a Thunderbird and his dialogue is ridiculous. The voice acting and dialogue, among other things, is pretty hilarious, throughout the whole single player experience.This game is kind of an entertaining mix between guilty pleasure nonsense and genuinely engaging gameplay. Some of the areas can feel a bit empty and under developed at times. However, the focus here is primarily on the sniping mechanics, which are implemented quite well. I also played through the DLC campaign called Siberian Strike and I enjoyed that too.  I had a good time with this one overall and I would certainly recommend that you give it a try.

												CI games, oh, those guys.Is this a good game? Yeah.If you liked the sneaking missions from CoD4 and others, you will enjoy this.Good stuff:-Again, since it's made by Polish people, you experience much different locations than you would in American games. Instea d of generic Middle Eastern country, you get Tibet. Instead of Russia, you get Bosnia, and shoot Serbs.-Fun gameplay, you sneak around and stuff, shoot people and stuff.-Good graphics and design. Sarajevo looks pretty damn good.-Solid story for such a game.Bad stuff:-Although it runs on the Cryengine, it might not be as optimised, it's common for Polish games not to be nicely optimised.*Cough Hatred cough*-The pistol has the wost viewmodel in a game I've seen soo far. -Guards are too dumb, not hearing some sounds, alway keeping their backs turned to wherever an enemy could be hiding. It should have been more challenging than that.I reccomend getting it on sale, or somewhere cheap.			",188,29,2,10,13,1,4

												The game sucks.If you are not in the area that is exactly marked with borders you get slain. ""OMG, YOU SET YOUR FOOT OVER THE BORDER"" *sudden hearth attack*Everything is made with scripts so you can't try an own way to play the game because there is only 1 way to activate the scripts. ""Shoot the grenades that soldier is carrying on his belt to kill all 3 soldiers!"" Me: Nope. *Takes ou pistol and shots all 3 soldiers"" ""OMG, YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT WE TOLD YOU TO!   ""Y O U   S H A L L   N O T   P A S S!!!""Also you don't have to think or do anything except shooting because the enemies are ""kindly"" marked and they tell you exactly what to do. ""Sneak around the rock and hide between the trees, then the soldiers will not see you. Then shoot the sniper going around on the roof. Shoot him on the north side so the other enemies don't see him dieing.""Where is the fun in a game when you don't even have to think because everything you have to do is following the exact orders.Why don't they also tell you every hour ""Hey, don't you have to go on the toilet?"" ""You should really go to drink something now!"" ""Hey, aren't you hungry? ",103,6,0,14,6,1,9

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a superior shooter when compared to its predecessor. Granted, that isn't saying much.City Interactive has addressed virtually all of the sore points that made the earlier game miss as often as it hit. This is an accomplished stealthy shooter, with smarter enemy AI, more-realistic sniper physics, and scaled-down difficulty that provide a challenging, not maddening, sniping experience. Only miscues like the spread-out save checkpoints and throwaway multiplayer keep it from achieving greatness.Most of your time with Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 will be spent with the three-part campaign. You play as Cole, a special-ops sniper helping out assault teams in hot zones ranging from the Philippines to Sarajevo to Nepal.A well-written, well-acted script give the game a great action-movie vibe, as do authentic-looking visuals and animations powered by the CryEngine 3. Excellent sound effects do a wonderful job of pulling you in. Weapon noises, the shouts of enemy voices, the far-off rattle of weapon fire and various atmospheric sounds like the background are all handled extremely well and enhance the tension as you line up each careful shot.Shooting is also much more enjoyable, whether you're using a mouse-and-keyboard setup or a gamepad. In the earlier game, bullet drops were extreme, slight winds significantly affected shots, and your heart rate caused the scope to carom all over the place. Here, the physics here are just right.Gameplay is now more focused on stealth than shooting. All of the pure action episodes of the last game have been ditched for a more intense sniping approach where you stay hidden as much as possible, only popping out for quick headshots and silent knife kills. That said, there are some shortcomings. The biggest is the checkpoint system, which saves your progress too infrequently.  The joys of stealth are also occasionally dampened by level linearity.Also you occasionally need to play through particularly tricky parts of levels once or twice before learning enemy patrol patterns which is sometimes frustrating.Multiplayer is pretty much an afterthought. All you get is team deathmatch and a pair of maps. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2's story and stealth make for a satisfying and entertaining single-player campaign. The frustratingly few-and-far-between checkpoints and MIA multiplayer are disappointments, but this is a worthy sniping experience, especially given the game's budget price. Overall 7/10.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a first person shooter that focuses on stealth and sniping and presents itself with quite a couple of improvements over the 2011-released prequel.The story is stereotypical modern first person shooter bla bla. Terrorists try to obtain a weapon of mass destruction and you have to stop them before they get the chance to use it... so, really exciting stuff there. While the story is as generic as it can be, the storytelling and the dialogues, combined with the actual gameplay, work out surprisingly well and keep things going without every really boring you to death.S:GW2 is based on the CryEngine 3 (the same engine used for Crysis 3) and while the original game already looked fairly decent, S:GW2 made an even bigger step forward towards visual quality. The texture detail, lighting and level design of the different locations made me stand still and just look around for a bit more than once.Along with the enhanced visuals, the gameplay mechanics also greatly improved. The AI in the prequel was a horrible pain as enemies would spot you through walls or over a distance of hundreds of meters. Thankfully, the AI was completely re-done for S:GW2, so enemies behave like they should and also show some actual intelligence as, depending on the area, they will try to flank you from all sides or hide behind cover. Additionally, if you break the line of sight or hide in foliage, they will start searching for you.Each of the 'hotspot' areas in the levels provide you with one or more overwatch spots from which you can safely identify your targets and take them out either one by one, 2 with one bullet if they stand in line or even an entire group if you shoot a grenade on one of the enemy's belts. Alternatively, you can also get closer and take them out either with your knife or your silenced sidearm and if you want to be a real Ghost, you just sneak past them so they will never know you were there.As the enviroments change, you will have to utilize your thermal or night vision to progress safely and spot your enemies. While this is a nice gimmick and the night vision is often required in really dark areas, I barely used the thermal vision, though it can help spot enemies that blend into the enviroment or are covered by obstacles. The visions are also pretty much the only gadgets you have and while you get C4 charges during certain key points in the game, it feels somewhat lame to not be able to place Claymore mines and lure enemies into them. Or just blow them up with frag grenades.While the prequel had some action-heavy levels where you actually went head-on towards your enemies and mowed them down with your combat rifles, S:GW2 doesn't feature something like that at all. You have to stick with your sniper rifle as your primary weapon at all times and while the game actually is called 'Sniper', I feel like this strict sniper rifle-only thing killed a bit of the gameplay dynamic and possible replayability of the game as it eliminates the option for the player to replay a level and, instead of silently sniping the enemies, just going nuts with an assault rifle and pumping bullets into everything that moves.I tried to be as stealthy as possible, so the base campaign took me around 6.5 hours to beat. The Siberian Strike DLC, which consists of 3 fairly lengthy levels, added another 2.5 hours on top of it. While a couple people seem to be still playing the multiplayer mode, I can't comment on that as I was never able to join a server and gave up after dozens of tries and a couple attempts to fix it.All in all, S:GW2 is a huge improvement over the sequel and seeing what turds City Interactive has produced in the past (prior to S:GW), it's good to see that they can do something decent for a change. If they keep up this level of quality, I might eventually start looking forward to their upcoming games again.If you're looking for a decent and good-looking sniper experience, make sure to give S:GW 2 a shot (A shot - get it? Because it's a sniper game... hahahaha. Ah, nevermind).			",865,363,47,90,97,13,143

 UPDATE:  I'm not one for giving up on anything, and I REALLY liked the first ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior"", so I kept at it and eventually found a way that I could play the game all the way through:  ""Cole AndersonWe are sorry that you have encountered problems with our latest update. For those who have critical issues with our latest update, please follow steps written below:1. Run regedit.exe2. Choose HKEY_CURRENT_USER3. Select Software>City Interactive>Sniper Ghost Warrior 24. Double click on r-Driver5. Set ""Value data"" to DX9We are currently working on a solution to this problem. The issue will be fixed as soon as possible.Regards,CI Games support""   Now this was NOT a fix, as I still had several issues with crashes, and the occasional graphical glitch, but I was able to play and complete the game.And so based on that, I'll say that I did enjoy the game overall, and found it to be very much like it's predecessor in just about every way.  Graphics are updated, but other than that the mechanics are exactly the same, gameplay is the same, and I'd say given that the story is pretty much the only thing that has changed, this is more like a continuation of the original ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior"" than a new sequel.  But, considering how much I liked the first one, that's not necessarily a bad thing.As for the DLC ""Siberian Strike"", the best part about it was that there was alot less hand-holding than in the main game, and you got to do things pretty much your own way which is certainly a plus.  However, the DLC was barely an update much less an add-on, with only maybe an hour of new story content, and... well, multiplayer isn't even a thought here.  But still, it was more of the same as the main game, so that's not a bad thing.Overall, given the MANY and SEVERE technical issues, I still can't necessarily recommend this game (seriously, NOBODY should have to edit their registry just to get a freshly installed game to work).  However, if you're willing to fight like hell to get it to work, then it is a fun play through that should temporarily scratch your itch for some snipey goodness.  Just make sure you get it during one of the 80% off sales.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: Well, I guess it serves me right.I read all the reviews... mostly good, but some bad.  And the ones that were bad were really pretty bad.  Some examples are:- Bad optimization, so gameplay is laggy- MAJOR crash issues for a significant number of people- Severe graphical glitches that make the game completely unplayable- Big time cheating and client sync issues in multiplayerBut, I really digs me some sniper action, so I went ahead & disregarded those warnings because I thought ""Hell, I got a kickass pc that blows the recommended specs outta the water!  Maybe I wont be one of those guys that has those issues"".Riiiight.<sigh>Soon as I booted it up for the first time, I found out exactly what that whole ""graphical glitch"" thing looked like.  Just as everyone described; invisible characters, floating guns, and giant artifacts that take up most of the screen.  Surprisingly, I found a ""workaround"" for the problem.  Notice I didn't say a FIX for the problem.  No, it wont fix the issue, but I found out that if you cheat the video settings a bit, you can get the glitch to MOSTLY go away (still pops up here & there).Alright, so now that's outta the way, should be good to go, right?Riiiight.<sigh>About 2 mins into the game, right about the time you juuust start to finish that whole hand-holding ""tutorial"" kinda part at the beginning of the first mission....  ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 has stopped working"".OK, that's weird..  well lets boot 'er back up & get back into this thing!Riiight.<sigh>Needless to say, I got to experience first hand the same crash issues that everyone else had talked about.  Happens randomly,  generally right when an insignificant action has taken place... like when you shoot a guy.  Cause, you know, you only do THAT once or twice a game, right?Well, in my stubbornness, I continued to try & power through it, hoping that it would eventually go away & I would somehow get to enjoy me some good 'ol snipey action....  and I looked for solutions all over the place and tried different things, until finally I simply couldn't take it any more.  TWO HOURS I tried.  Loading the game OVER & OVER & OVER.  And every time I got going, for no reason (other than... you know... shooting a guy) it crashed every time.SO, all I can hope at this point is that you will not be the stubborn dupe that I was, and you'll resist the urge to disregard the warnings as I did.  And that you will look elsewhere to satisfy that itch in your finger for some sniper action.  Cause let me tell you... the only itch that this game covers is the itch to bash your face into your keyboard.			",714,74,45,65,47,6,84

												My thoughts on Sniper - Ghost Warrior 2:Singleplayer:A linear action-shooting game (duh), where most of the time you either crouch behind bushes/cars/walls/trees, trying to get the perfect shot on an enemy, or walk from one hideout to the next. For someone like me who likes a good Sniper shot from miles away, waiting several seconds up to a minute just for one good shot is okay, everyone else can stop reading here and leave.The game is called Sniper for a reason - because that is what makes 85% of the game. The rest is either running or the occasional kill with a gun or knife. The story is average, nothing big to be expected, but enough to keep the game interesting. I liked the parts where you had to fight your way along a (linear) path, and the game does a good job of giving you the feeling that you're a ♥♥♥♥ing sniper and every shot has to be a killing one. There are some challenging parts but you never feel like there is no way you can make it further unless you really suck at using a sniper rifle or feel the need to blast everything away, because you can't.Multiplayer:Avoid like ♥♥♥♥ing hell. You'll feel like there is a huge♥♥♥♥♥blinking sign above your head while your opponents don't even have a visual model. The game comes with an impressively good soundtrack and nice graphics. If using sniper rifles is what you enjoy most in other shooters this game may be yours, but if you're looking for a fast-paced action game like CoD or CS you're wrong here.Can recommend the basic game, especially when on sale, but not the expansions and the multiplayer mode.

 About Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 does the sniping aspect very well. There aren’t too many FPS games out there that focus on sniping, or at least, there aren’t any out there that have this much depth to sniping. The developers have done a superb job at creating a realistic sniping experience. Various measurements need to be taken before lining up the perfect shot and different locations mean different adjustments. Distance, wind, and even the curve of the bullet need to be taken into consideration. This makes sniping enemies very enjoyable and varied, depending on conditions.Before starting to play Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, my expectations were very high. I was expecting it to at least match the original game in terms of gameplay features. Unfortunately it failed to do this, and ultimately failed to meet the standards of the Cry Engine 3 (one of the most powerful engines currently available).Similar to the way I felt before and after I started playing the game, I’ll start with the good things and move on to the bad things and finish with the best part.The developer, City Interactive seemed to have focused perhaps too much on the sniping aspects of the game, because that’s about all that’s good about it :/ I’ve noticed a lack of gameplay features that were present in the previous game such as, grapple hooking your way to high places, picking up enemy firearms, using throwing knives to take out enemies. The gameplay revolves completely around using your sniper rifle to well……..snipe, and using your P220 pistol if things get up close and personal. The P220 features in all three of the chapters as a sidearm, but the primary sniper rifle changes depending on what chapter you’re playing. Apart from finding the occasional enemy Dragunov rifle, you have no other weapons to find or interact with. This seriously upset me. Release Date: 15 Mar, 2013The Level design Level design is another issue with Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. The levels are detailed, but I feel this is just a way of disguising how painstakingly linear they are. Each chapter has you following a set path with a few open vistas to shoot enemies from a far. The vistas do offer fairly detailed locations to find and shoot enemies, but ultimately they just serve as complex shooting galleries and you never actually get to explore them. The levels are also too small. I find myself disappointed whenever I round a corner, only to realise that I’m in an even smaller house than the last one I was in. I was really hoping for a more open ended level design, but City Interactive has decided to play it safe and keep things way too simple. The Multiplayer	Lastly, I’ll talk about the multiplayer. This is the most surprising part about Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. It’s actually a decent addition to the game. I was highly expecting an equally lack luster experience online as I did with my campaign experience, but it turned out better than expected. Sniping is really the only feature in multiplayer, but it’s easier to enjoy due to the lack of a forced story or other cheesy scripted events. The multiplayer levels are really well designed, plenty of places to hide, plenty of choices for rifles to use, and plenty of intensity that should have been more common in the single player. Looking around the maps for enemies is a long and tiring process, but once you find one and line up the perfect shot, it’s all worth it. Hearing the bullet whizz past your head as another sniper takes shots at you, forcing you to relocate before it’s too late, that’s an awesome feeling too. It’s a nice break from the normal run and gun shooters out there, where the SMG class is king. In this case, less is more.All in All Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a good Action Game!8/10 From MeSweep	 ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is a stealth action game with focus, as the name of the game hints, on sniper rifles. Single player story offers about 5 hours of entertainment, which actually felt long enough - If the game had more playtime with current features, it would get repetitive.In 10 levels you can expect a lot of linear gameplay, with exceptions like parts where you can choose if you want to go through with stealth or shoot everybody (and somehow survive). But expect most parts being based on stealth, as your only weapons are sniper rifle, silenced pistol and knife - all the time.This action game is one of the most newbie-friendly action games I've seen lately. Even on normal difficulty the game felt easy, it's hinting you every 100 meters where you should move next. And most of the time you will be on action with your partner (invincible NPC who doesn't do much damage) who will be signalling exactly what you should do - shoot this bad guy, move there, beware of the spotlight etc.I was actually surprised that for a lower priced action game, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 felt good and had a great atmosphere, made thanks to surprisingly good visuals and well done voice acting. Even the story, though it's not something complex, was interesting and made the game into something more than just another corridor shooter with optional stealth.Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, unlike the previous part, deserves full recommendation if you don't mind the linear gameplay and shorter length. Even those looking for multiplayer might have get some fun there, as I've seen few active deathmatch servers with players. So, what are you waiting for? Take your sniper rifle and go to war!

												The game feels like a Call of Duty knock-off, but even more linear if you can believe that. When you're not moving from shooting position to shooting position in rail-shooter fashion, you're probably in the middle of the incredibly anti-climactic ""boss fights."" The end of the game comes just as swiftly as it did in Sniper: Ghost Warrior; one second you're shooting some bad guys and the next thing you know the credits come up leaving you unsatisfied and annoyed.As for the sniping aspect of the game, it's ridiculously easy on the the easiest and medium difficulties. When I first noticed this I had attempted to switch to expert difficulty and I was initially happy with it. At normal distances the kills were challenging and I couldn't pop off 10 perfect headshots without breaking a sweat like I could on medium difficulty. But as soon as I was faced with the task of picking off targets from 1000 meters away (some requiring quick action with as little as a 3 second notice) the game became borderline impossible.So in conclusion: the game is incredibly linear and unsatisfying. If the game had a more open feel like that of the original Sniper Elite and allowed for some actual drama in the plot I'd be more than comfortable giving it a positive vote, but sadly that is not the case.

												This game is far to short to be called a full game. The campaign can be finished in under 5 hours and feels more like a point and click adventure then an actual sniping or stealth game. While some of the maps offers an interesting kills all 7 enemies without getting detected challenge, after a while even this becomes routine.I'm sorry to say that I will not recommend this game to anyone. The game does nothing new and preforms fairly average on what it does do.			",263,21,13,26,51,1,70

												so I bought this game on holiday sale, finally got around to playing it, discover many character models(including enemies) are invisible, think its odd, try figiting some setting around, doesnt help, look on steam forum, discover a large number of people have run into this or similar game breaking bugs, there is no fix, if you run into one of these game breakig bugs you're screwed. now not everyone ran into them, some people can play it fine, but do you wanna roll those dice? I cant in good conscience reccomend a game that is broken and will never get fixed for some people, if it had been a different kind of game, invisible enemies might not be so bad, but in a sniping game...a game where the entire point is looking ahead and using precision... no, just no			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming into this game from Sniper Ghost Warrior 1, I wasn't expecting much. I gave that a negative review even though I tried very hard to like it, but comparing this game to its predecessor blew my mind.Let's start listing some things. I'll be combining Pros with Cons since some things offset each other.+The graphics are BEAUTIFUL. This game running on Cryengine puts its predecessor on the Chrome engine in the dust. +The story in this is slow to start going, but once you get into it you just want to keep going. It's very immersive and intriguing and I wish it was longer.-The point of 'longer' is true. I beat this game's campaign in 4 hours. Hardly enough time to enjoy everything the game had to offer.+But what else did it have to offer? Well the general gameplay mechanics are much better. The mission flow is much smoother. There are much less gameplay bugs to be found in this game. It makes it predecessor look half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in comparison.-However, the game does suffer from a severe lack of optimizations. For one, the V-Sync does not work. For two, the game suffered so many graphical glitches on DX9 that it was rendered unplayable. DX-11 ran correctly, but not as smoothly. With my beast of a rig I was only able to mantain an average of 50 fps (Meanwhile I can run games like Arma 3 with well over 120 fps). Lastly, I experienced one CTD while playing the second mission of the first act. Not sure if its a common thing or a one-off, but I feel obliged to mention it.- The multiplayer is eh. It's just two teams staring at each other across the map, taking shots at each other, while one guy on each team is running around rambo as if this is call of duty, and at least one person is smack-talking every other person in the match. It doesn't do much to extend the life of the game. A co-op mode would have really helped this game.Overall this game blows its predecessor out of the water. I'll give this an 8/10 for what it is. If it was properly optimized, if the story was a bit longer, or if the multiplayer was really worth playing, it may have earned a higher score. This is still twice the rating I gave to its predecessor, and so I would definitely recommend picking this title up whenever you get the chance.			",179,24,2,40,36,1,42

												Ok so there is a lot wrong with this game, but also a lot that's good. Here is a pro-con list:Pros:-Graphics are beautiful -The gameplay is definitely unique. It takes patience and planning, but manages to be smooth no matter how many mistakes you make-This is probably the only shooter I have ever played that forces you to rely on an A.I. as a teammate, while actually programming it to never get in your way or get you killed. Cons:-The voice acting and story-line are BEYOND bad. It's almost as if the devs were trying to make it as cheesy and un-original as possible. Kind of like Bood Dragon, except it's not meant to be a joke.-Campaign is extremely short. -The player has NO freedom of choice. You won't find a game more linear than this one unless you play a side-scroller. Most of the time it feels as though the game is playing itself, and you're just there to click the mouse button a few times. Even when you are left without your spotter, you are still told who to shoot and when by a voice in your helmet. -The multiplayer is a joke. Don't even bother. Conclusion: This game was worth the $4.50 I spent on it while it was on sale, but I wouldn't pay a penny more. The campaign will keep you entertained for about 4 hours until you beat it. After that, just uninstall. It's not worth the hard drive space.			",66,5,1,8,6,1,7

												This shooter got very weak notes. I don' t honestly know why. Campaign is nice but a bit too short. Graphics - not too bad, but it could have been better because the game works on cry engine 3. Anyway. I enjoyed campaign and when i passed it i turned on multiplayer.,, It is the worst part of the game. In multiplayer two sniper teams fight from to hills/castles. Time limit is !30! minutes. In my opinion people from CI thought that it would be realistic... But when does it only get snipers in the battle? Actually, it's hard to say if I reccomend this game. I chose yes, because single player is really nice. If you like having fun in campaign, buy this game and pass campaign on hard or normal (easy will be too easy even for newbies). If you want to ""fight in reallistic sniper battles"", it' s a waste of time. PS.I have CD metal case edition i got with 4 multiplayer figures we know from campaign, book ""One shot One kill"", soundtrack and artbook (book with weapons and figures illustrations). Hope you enjoy my text. Please, leave a like if you think it's good. Likes motivate me			",53,6,1,2,3,0,3

I don't need to hear how some idiot got sold fake watches 20 times.Aside from needing to wait long periods of time after dying most of the time, it's pretty fun. Very stealth oriented.

												If you're going to buy this game, make sure it's heavily discounted, because the campaign is really short. I also recommend starting on expert right away, because medium is way too easy. Some missions are less linear, but otherwise it's totally on rails and it's hard to miss shots. The graphics are bizarre. If you just look at the scenery they are fine, but up close environment and characters look strangely outdated for a 2013 game. The story isn't worth mentioning.I'm going to not recommend Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, because it just feels too cheap. One of those games that can be summed up with a simple 'meh'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasn't expecting much from this game since the first one was horrible, but I was wrong. I only played the Single Player and didn't care much about the multiplayer so this review will be based off of the campaign. The story itself wasn't great, but wasn't bad either and the campaign consists of 3 acts. I beat it on 2 seatings and I actually enjoyed this game more than Sniper Elite V2. The game did frustrate me at times since there are noticable bugs especially during the last parts of the game where no matter what I did, the enemies were triggered. Overall, great game if you are a sniper fan, but wait for it to go on sale as the original price is too much.			",154,21,5,16,12,0,1

												A mediocre realistic FPS game, with some minor graphic bugs, glitches and very short singleplayer campaign. Only buy it when it goes on sale.My Rating: 6/10The graphics are actually good enough to not hurt your eyes playing it, but compared to the popular Sniper Elite series, this game is a no-go. My first time getting into this game led me into some weird bugs, there were black textures around the character's POV and the enemies were invisible, that I could only see their guns floating around. though I've found a fix by changing the DirectX option to the newer one (DirectX 11). I also had to play it with 15fps (sad) and I'm not really sure what caused it since my graphic card isn't that old... I'll just blame my pc for that. Overall, this game's graphics are on par with some other sniper games, considering its release date.The story plot is great, although the campaign is too short that it only took me around 5 hours to complete it. The AI is somewhat badly programmed, I even got an alarm raised because of the AI failing to take down a single enemy at a medium range. Some of the enemies only stand behind a cover not shooting you until you peek far enough to let them notice. Other than that, the realistic sniping effects are great, the controls are easy to learn, the sounds are realistic, the smoke puff needs a bit improvement, and I honestly think that the pistol is too accurate to even be a 'pistol', it's a 1-hit to the chest and very accurate at long distance, if you aim correctly on the target. I even think you can even finish this game with just pistol. Overall, this game mechanics are good enough but still needs improvement.My comment on this game? I crashed 2 times on this game, so please do not buy this game until it goes on sale cuz it's probably not going to worth the big price for the bugs and glitches this game has. Only buy it if you have nothing else to play and you want to buy and play this just for fun.ps: the kill-cam is epic ",224,63,5,17,16,4,26

												3 years after the somewhat mediocre first episode, City Interactive completed its job on the sequel. Was it for the better or for the worse? Well, let's see it!---Graphics: This certainly is an improvement! The game looks stunning with the CryEngine. I still think the first episode's graphics were decent but City definitely made a good choice by licensing the 3rd iteration of the CryEngine. Water effects and the jungles / lush forests look simply stunning.---Campaign: Unfortunately, no changes here. The story is still very, very shallow; sections are quite repetitive and the campaign is overall very short. SMG / rifle sequences are now completely eliminated - this is now good as they were very irritating and made the game very difficult. Finally, emphasis is really on the titular sniper shooting and nothing else! There is now an urban (Sarajevo) and mountain (Tibet) area to make the story more interesting. This is all good but as mentioned the new campaign is also very short. Also, you can easily see how heavily the story mode is scripted: you can only go where the designers intended for you to do so.---Multiplayer: Very few levels available for you to practice sniping on. Also, I am not a camper so lying on the ground for extremely long minutes to see something happen is not my cup of tea. It is overall very slow-paced; once you have found the best hiding - / vantage points on the levels available there is nothing else to see. I still do not know where to put Ghost Warrior. The 2nd episode is better but still a very short, mediocre experience for gamers out there regardless of their affection towards sniping. Good sniping can be found in the Sniper Elite franchise which does offer much, much more.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

Throughout a substantial part of the game, you will be escorted a la COD  style by an unkillable AI teammate that literally tells who how to clear a particular section.- Forgettable story.

												Impressive start, but ultimately fails miserably for a sniper game.The Good:- Immersion is amazing- Embiance is great- Rifles are cool- Graphics are good- Bullet ballistic is allrightThe Bad:- Game constantly pits you against numerous enemies- When pitted against numerous enemies, your spotter will not support you, you have to take on them all alone (unless it's a scripted sequence)- The noise factor is completely ignored          ex 1. On a night mission, you ""silently"" anihilate an entire garnison with the loudest caliber available, a .50... So long as you don't miss, no enemy seem to hear the roar of the rifle          ex 2. On a mission in an active warzone, multiple AA guns firing non stop, you can barely hear your spotter. The you shoot a guy and suddently all the neighboring enemies know exactly where you are.          ex 3. Despite example 2, on most mission, you can essentially headshot an enemy and his friend 5 feet away will be none the wiser...Sorry, but the mechanica simply don't work... I'm still looking for a new ""Sniper Elite Berlin 1945"". That was a real sniper game...			",114,9,0,26,11,1,25

												Game's pretty decent. The critics need to understand that this is not another modern military shooter like any other out there. It indeed is designed around sniping and sniping only. You won't pick up an assault rifle from someone you just shot and then enter the occupied mansion heads-on. You. Simply. Won't. Because that's not what snipers do. As for the sniping itself, it's actually quite good. Supporting your entry team (you know, the one with the assault rifles that enters the occupied mansion) is fun, killing two dudes at once as soon as they line up is fun and slicing up an enemy sniper to take his Dragunov is fun. Get this game if you're into sniping and sniping only.			",756,209,23,77,41,6,92

												I really can't whole-hartedly recommend this game. It is an enjoyable enough sniper game, especially if you're looking for a cheap alternative to Sniper Elite or the like, but damn does it have its flaws. Get ready to hear every one I can remember.First off, you might as well ignore the story. Spoiler alert: every character they focus on besides the player is a back-stabbing traitor. There are literally 3 traitors in this one game. The guy giving orders before/during the missions is your typical ""Dammit man, get it done at all costs! I don't care about your emotions!"" obnoxious military general. Just to drag it out, on multiple ocassions you have your finger on the trigger about to do the deed and captain-impatient tells you there's no time and you have to do something more important.The cutscenes are full of bad voice-acting, worse motion-capture, and half are entirely useless. At one point you're knocked out and taken hostage during a cutscene. You wait for a second cutscene to load and play  immediately  afterwards, wherein you wake up and get punched in the face and knocked out again. Riveting stuff. All in glorious 480p resolution. Oh, and when you wake up from capture and free yourself, you immediately find a handgun which your character specifically comments has 4 rounds in the magazine, you kill an enemy right outside the door, he drops his assault rifle right on the ground and you can't pick it up. Just brilliant.The gameplay and AI is just horrendous. During one mission, your first target is a sniper who's standing (yeah, standing) in a bell tower, totally motionless. I take the shot, bullet passes right through his head, no damage, suddenly everyone in the whole town knows my GPS coordinates. Eff this, reload last checkpoint. Try again, this time the bullet goes THROUGH HIS FACE, blood splatter and everything, he falls out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bell tower AND LIVES. My character comments something to the effect of ""Dang, I missed and now he knows I'm here."" 'KAY. Reload checkpoint, try again, exact same outcome. No idea what's wrong with this game.And for a sniper game that involves a lot of crouching and prone, they sure as hell made it impossible to do that. Let's say Z is crouch and X is prone, right? If you're crouching and hit the prone key, nothing happens and nothing indicates that your posture has changed. But when you hit the crouch button again, you go prone. Press crouch again, you stand up. Crouch again, you crouch. Press prone twice while crouched, you stand up. You wind up just pressing Z and X in random patterns to eventually wind up in the position you were looking for. It makes no sense at all.As for the missions, for more than half you are hand-held by an ally as you follow them needlessly-close to enemies and have no choice or challenge in taking a different route or finding your own way. It's just bad. Let me sum up how the game plays: During one mission, you go through a parking garage packed with hostiles. You are tasked with shutting down the lights and sneaking out using your night vision while the enemies are blind. You have one route to take to the fuse box, thereby forcing you to perform a scripted knife kill along the way. Stab enemy (the stealth kill animations are also atrocious btw), look to the right, remember the lights are still on at this point, there's another hostile not 25 feet away looking right at you with no visual obstructions, and he doesn't notice. Alright then. Proceed to the fuse box, RIP THE WIRES OUT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW FUSE BOXES WORK, and head for the exit. All the way to the exit, you can pass 5 feet in front of enemies and they can't see you because it's pitch black. At one point I thought ""There's no way I can get past this guy, I'll be 2 feet from his face, I'll just kill him instead"". Wait for the area to be clear of other enemies, stealthy knife kill from behind in the inky black darkness, suddenly EVERY ENEMY KNOWS I'M THERE AND CAN MAGICALLY SEE ME, I get lit up and die next to a rusty old car.That's this game.4/10			",128,21,4,7,10,1,3

												Heyyo, it's a pretty decent game tbh. It's not a AAA Game like Sniper Elite series (The WWII sniper game by Rebellion) but it definitely holds its own. :)The sniping? Well, since this is a sniper game? I guess that should be discussed first heh. The game takes into account bullet drop, wind direction, stance, elevation and stamina (how many beats per minute your heart is doing) so the mechanics are all there ok. The bullet cam is very much like Sniper Elite, but no model damage on the enemies. They just flop over. There's also the hold shift to slow down time and make it feel more movie-like and make it easier to hit moving targets. If you sit in sniper/scope mode long enough? The game gives you a little red circle to show where the bullet will hit and highlight when ontop of an enemy... so as a sniper game? It's good... but Sniper Elite feels more rewarding when you land a shot since you see what kind of damage you're doing.It has a decent enough storyline... Quite generic tbh but it was good enough for me to want to finish the game.The voice acting is also nothing flattering but works good enough to make me want to finish the game.The Gameplay? Eh, after playing Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2? Gameplay isn't as good as those games. There's no disguises and trying to sneak around... the campaign is extremely scripted where you spend most of it doing exactly what your spotter tells you to do or you die.. speaking of which? Once enemies start hunting for you? The AI will definitely 360 no-scope you at close range. Super annoying when I try to ambush them and as soon as they rush through a doorway? Bullets hit me before their character turns around and I'm dead... so that's seriously annoying lol.The graphics? They're pretty darn good, definitely not the best on Cryengine but I'd say a step above State of Decay (another good game built on Cryengine).The music? Eh, I think there's only three or four songs for the complete game as most maps feature the same songs... They're ok I guess.Sound effects? Well? Since most of the game you're only using about three different guns (silenced pistol, silenced sniper rifle and a long range silenced sniper rifle) for the whole game? There isn't that much variety in sound effects. The sounds that are there are pretty good though.My Steam account says I beat the campaign in 5.2 hours and the asking price is $21.99 CAD... so that equates to $4.22 per hour. I don't plan on playing multiplayer since I'm not much of a multiplayer FPS guy these days I guess. So do I feel like it was worth $4.22 an hour? Kinda I guess. It was fun enough... but there's some older games with a longer campaign for the same asking price that'll give you more entertainment. I'd say get the first Sniper Elite game and see what you think of that game before buying this one tbh. Maybe the same with the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior game.. but of course I don't own that so I can't directly give my opinon on that game, but this one is ok so I'm guessing the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior is also ok.

												I have bought the game on sale and did not regret. I would have regretted it if I had paid full price though.Pros:- Good story- Nice graphics (CryEngine 3)- Great vibe, the weapons are cool- Some missions are quite difficult to solve and the Sarajevo campaign is really good.Cons:- No real choices, you basically do what you are ordered to do. OK, sometimes you can kill with a knife instead of your gun.- Absolutely corridor game, even though the environment begs for exploration. Literally, if you leave the designated area you will be warned and if you do not return you die.- Checkpoint are painfully rare.- Motion blur that cannot be disabled. Even you look around you get this dramatic ""whoosh"" effect - just too much.I have completed the game on Beginner and since there are so few options to choose from (basically none) as you advance I did not bother replaying it on Medium or Advanced. To summarize it, SGW2 is a nice-looking but forgettable title.			",23,0,0,0,0,0,2

												Good enough game. Excelled at nothing, but it was fun to play.Given the fact that it runs on Cry Engine 3, the visuals (especially character models and textures) could look better.Voice acting is decent and does not break immersion.Story is ok, but short.Locations are varied and nice to look at. But levels could be wider, corridors are too tight for a sniper game.There are occasional glitches, bugs and invisible walls which break immersion.I hate the fact that you can't pick up enemy weapons (even when you're escaping from captivity).It has multiplayer, that may be a plus for some. I have not tried it yet and probably never will.If you like shooters, buy it in sale.			",144,46,3,17,8,0,10

												I don't know which one has been the worst game i played through so far in my life but this is pretty damn bad, even on my standards.First of all the game liked to crash while launching every single time approx 4-7 times before launching. When i first actually launched the game i saw message stating follow another characted called Diaz and Diaz was a floating gun in midair and nothing more, enemies were invisible as well which (i don't think i need to even say this) was pretty damn difficult to get the game actually started... I checked some forums and found out that the game needs to run as DX11 so i started the game once more and checked the optionmenu and the game had DX9 as default. Well this fixed the graphical problems luckily for now. If DX9 causes so much problems, maybe the game should run a DX11 as default, or after several complaints they could've fixed the problems with DX9.Anyhow.... I played through Act 1 and thought i'd give it a rest for the day and get some sleep. Next day i started up the game once more and continue on Act 2, only to notice the complete lack on audio, except on the cutscenes. (Also apparently a very common problem which you might be able to fix or then you can't... People have asked for patch to fix this from the beginning, no answer or patch/fix from the developers so far.)For some reason the game itself likes to swap between windowed and fullscreen mode whenever it wants and throw the ingame menu-cursor in the game making the game unplayable (Only way to get rid of this problem is to reboot the game, and if you're in a place where you haven't yet reached the next checkpoint and you're playing on expert, you're going to hate these situations.One last gamebreaking/pantsripping/ragequitting situation in the game itself was on Act 3 when you were supposed to snipe out the helicopter pilot. The game itself ran perfectly on maxed out graphics (Was also on default) before this point. When you were supposed to take out the copter the FPS drops to unbearable levels. Well then it's onto options, changing the settings, reboot and take out the helicopter pilot.Finally i think i can talk about the game itself. The graphics look quite nice actually, eventhough you are looking everything through the sniperscore mostly.  Audio.. well i can't say too much about it since they didn't work after first act. In Act 1 they we're quite pleasant eventhought the guns were far from realistic.Story is pretty generic for a FPS and especially for the sniper series. You have a baddie, and your job is to end his life. I was playing the game on expert and i have to say one other thing i actually liked about the game is the ""realistic"" sniping system where you have to take notice to the wind and distance if you want to hit anything. What i wasn't extremely keen on though was the A.I, (If you're in a ghillie suit 3 km/2 mile away from the enemy, lying in a bushes and take a shot towards an enemy who is facing his back towards you and can't even see any gunflash or whatever its called, you happen to make a miss, he will absolutely screw you over by turning around, kill you in oneshot with a pistol or any gun he's having. It's just ridiculously difficult from time to time to continue in this game especially with some maps and huge distances between checkpoints.That's all said and done, I really can't suggest this particular game to anyone before it has been patched and fixed.

												As the sequel to Sniper: Ghost Warrior, this game had a lot to live up to and raise the bar over. I feel it did so very well. The game made use of the Cry Engine 3 instead of the Chrome Engine they had used previously, which did the game massive justice. I am quite enthralled by the storyline, which weaves a tale of deceit, and fast paced gameplay. I find the dialogue hilarious, with various one liners and crude insults thrown at the characters, making them seem more human. The Sniper gameplay has vastly improved. And I am glad I no longer have to do fire fight levels. I definitely prefer this game over its predecessor so congrats to City Interactive.			",406,29,4,48,17,0,24

												Even if I found the game disappointing, I must recognize that the environments are beautifully rendered, the look and feel of the sniper rifle satisfying and having a supporting character quite enjoyable sometimes.Unfortunately, S:GW2 is an ""execution"" game : most of the time you follow a predefined path in the maps, and you're told which targets to kill, in what ordre. So you don't really have to worry about recon, strategy or tactic that much. It's very different from Sniper Elite where you have a lot of agency in that matter. On top of that, the game is pretty short and the storyline not that exciting.So, in solo play, it's more a ""filler"" in between more consistent games.			",216,35,0,31,6,0,20

												Pros: Graphics (CryEngine), Sniping MechanicsCons: Repetitive Levels, Poor Animations and Cinematics, StorylineI think this is probably the best game in the Sniper series to date. This is the 5th one I’ve played and while they are getting better and better slowly, and although I love the idea and the concept, I cannot really “recommend” this game nor can I score it very highly. The game fails to really hook you as an FPS and every level consists of the same repetitive structure, with the story being uninteresting and cliché. I enjoyed the game, but I felt like I “forced” myself too because I loved Sniper Elite when I played it years ago and have since dragged myself through all the Sniper series games since – but realistically speaking they are sub-par games.

												I got this game for under a dollar. If I complained it would be kind of sad.This game is pretty cool in the fact that they tried to make a realistic sniper game, however they fell short on a few things for me.1. You can't adjust your scope for distance. I think a zeroing feature would be very nice.2. Pretty much the same thing as the first.  I wish you could adjust for windage.  Although you are moving around a lot more than in real life and this would be kind of useless it would still be fun to see implimented.That is pretty much nitpicking at this point, I mean for a dollar game? It pretty much just has to bring more enjoyment than a gumball, and it definitely did!			",45,4,6,5,2,1,4

												This game just gets worse and worse. You cant talk to friends on steam while using single player because it steals your mic. Why? I have no idea. The support just says ""Sorry, nothing we can do."" There are ridiculous texture glitches, and the storyline is terrible. You shoot someone in the chest, they magically come back to life. knife someone, then ""silently"" kick them over a cliff into a river, which makes the loudest splash ever, and no one bats an eye. Your head barely pops up over some sandbags? an enemy 750m away, talking to a friend and smoking a cigarette notices within a second. Your spotter sudenly runs off. No reason, and doesnt come back. Your spotter calls out ""man on the balcony, take him out."" WHICH FREAKING BALCONY?! THERES A MILLION! after an hour of searching you find him and kill him. Then he says (about a different enemy)""Come on! We have to work together, shoot him already!"" WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!It's terrible. They could have made a much MUCH better game.

												I absolutely loved this game! The graphics looked dated since I took a break from it for 2 years before picking it up again and trying to 100% it. The achievements aren't too hard to get except for the multiplayer ones which can be a challenge if there is no one online. But you can get those achievements if you have a friend to play with and you guys work together. When the game was active online the games were a lot of fun and it was a challenge to kill the enemy because you can play in 2 ways, you can run and gun or you can camp it out patiently. Some people played this like a Call of Duty and got killed fast. There is a lot of strategy and great satisfaction when killing the enemy for the first time online. Really intense moments were had with this game. This is a great story of betrayal and revenge. I enjoyed the story and the sniper fights in singleplayer. You can play singleplayer with guns firing away and see what happens or take each mission as a stealth mission. Either way it is a good campaign. I love sniper games and highly recommend this one, it is a great successor to the first Sniper Ghost Warrior game.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

Nor can I move (example: Act1, mission 2)v I might forgotten something but oh well... ^• Multiplayer • (Yet to try it out)*Possitive*- The maps are well designed, but could've been bigger- Being able to choose character and wepon- Not having silencer on every wepon.- Steady aim, and not slowmotion*Negative*- I don't know if it is a glitch, but I've experianced where people are proning places where they cannot be hit..- Tactical assistance is on...- Some snipers has silencer- Gives away the killer's position- No binocular- To obvious name tags, if you point your crosshair at the player.

												This game is a-ok if you like and/or want to add more Sniper games to your list. It's worth the price and the time spent. I just hope that in the near future or, by the next release, they add Co-Op to the game of which will make it more enjoyable to be able to play with a freind. I do think that it needs dedicated or, more dedicated servers than just an option to run a server of your own. Connections to these servers in that manner aren't the best and depending on location, connections get dropped a lot. Other than that minor issue, the game is worth the time to play. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More of a laid back shooter didnt take long to go from start to finish. Was enjoyable not difficult at all didn't die very much maybe 5-10 times the whole playthrough despite being ""easy"" the game didn't feel boring. Probably because the missions followed diverse environments and different ways of handling things. However the game didn't force me to do it there way kinda seemed like if you wanted you could walk through half of the game. And the other half you find a spot and kill everybody with a .50 but either way the game was very enjoyable but theres basically no replayability in my opinion I wouldn't recomment picking it up unless its on sale. Unless you like to play a slower paced shooter once in a while then I guess this game would come to mind first.That being said it seems thats its either heavily optimized for NVidia or maybe it doesnt have great support for newer hardware? When I swapped from my 780ti to my RX480 (780ti was dying) I lost a sizeable amount of frames don't get me wrong it was still smooth and stayed above 60fps almost always except for random frame drops here and there that are just AMDs drivers. Averaged at about 65-80 where as my 780ti stayed above 100 everywhere no big deal for me with a 60hz monitor but for you people with a higher refresh rate and AMD/Newer cards might be something to note.

												City Interactive Has botched yet another game. Graphicaly this game looks pretty good, and the positives stop there. This game suffers from MAJOR graphical issues especialy on computers running Directx 9 that really void the aforementioned graphics. The Gameplay effectively boils down to you only being able to follow the instructions of your poorly acted spotter, only kill who he says, only move where he says, when he says. Choose to deviate from his instructions and you will imediately be engaged in a firefight with enemies who will go from not being able to hit a aircraft carrier at point blank to being able to shoot the head off a moving spider. Your spotter is only one of a small number of poorly developed and cringe worthy characters that only make the sub-standard story even less bearable. The overall campaign is EXTREMELY short (Took me around 4 Hours on normal) and has no replay value.I initialy thought that this game could be the turning point  for city interactive but had those hopes squashed about 30 mins in. If you are looking for a similar game Sniper Elite V2 is the same price.1.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is quite good game. The 5 hour story is great. It gets a bit repeatitive after first playthrough but the change of difficulty covers that bit. Great sequel to the first game.What bad I have to say about this is the actual shooting. In  hardest difficulty the red reticle is taken away and you have to judge the correct shootingpoint yourself. This, however, is not easy. The red reticle shows where to aim and it takes the wind and distance in account. However when you don't have it, things get tricky. I spent an hour in shooting range trying to figure out the measurements in the scope and they don't make sense. For example: The distance to target is 800 meters and wind is 6 m/s to the left. I aim to point where these conditions are matched perfectly. And when I fire, I miss the target. The bullet goes way over the target and is pointed too much to left. In this case, the correct aiming point was 400 meter distance and 2 m/s wind to left. So the indicators in the scope are for nothing. You just have to guess. Besides that shooting thing, this is great game. And if you never play with hardest difficulty, you never have to think about that detail. I still recommend this game. The game is true to its name and is fun to play. But if there was anything else wrong, I wouldn't recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2"" is one of those games that gets a few basic mechanics very right, but also sometimes trips over its own feet.All by themselves, the stealth and marksmanship bits are well executed. When you're given the maximum possible opportunity for those two elements to have free-reign, your patience and cunning will be rewarded.The problem, though, is that you don't get the maximum opportunity that often. ""Sniper,"" rather like other CryTek-based offerings I've experienced, has this tendency to just herd you along from tactical problem to tactical problem. When you get right down to it, a title that should land heavily on the side of ""wide open area"" seems to get choked down to what amounts to ""room-corridor-room-corridor-room...""It's just that the rooms are a bit bigger than average, and the corridors might not have a roof over them.There's also an overarching issue of mild to moderate identity crisis. A full-blown sniper game, in my view, demands a very freeform experience. However, ""Ghost Warrior 2"" seems to try to do the tightrope walk between that and a scripted, ""Call of Duty-esque"" ride. What this does is subvert the overall experience, in both subtle and more troubling ways.An example of the subtle variety is knife kills. Sneak up behind a crouching enemy, get in range, and...guess what? There's only one animation for ""backstabs,"" and that animation requires the enemy to be standing. So, somewhat hilariously, triggering the kill results in the opponent helpfully standing up so that the animation can run.Something like that is mostly funny, but you can also end up being aggravated by the more serious problems. I once got set up for one of the ""shooting gallery"" sections such that one of the must-hit enemies was obscured by the platform the player character was occupying. There was no way to move, so I was stuck with the scripted position. I made three blind shots before one of them connected. A more regularly experienced issue was the pickiness of the level geometry. Something about the crouched and prone collision models seems to get a little weird, with your character ""hanging"" on invisible obstructions for no apparent reason. More than once, I would be trying to crawl past some enemies, only for my character to claw helplessly at the ground because there was some debris on the ground no more than 1 inch high.There's also the metagame issue of there being no player-driven save. ""Sniper"" is all based on checkpoints, and there aren't  quite enough of them. They also have an alarming propensity to occur just before some tedious dialogue that precedes a touchy bit of action. Make a mistake, get killed, sit through the exposition, make a mistake, get killed, sit through the exposition, rinse, repeat.A game like this is all about solving combat puzzles that take time and patience. The appropriate save system for that is one that's player directed. A checkpoint progress system is for run-n-guns, where a setback is likely to be measured in seconds rather than minutes. It doesn't get too terrible, but it's still the wrong mechanic for the game type.But! But, but, but...The game is definitely good fun, and I do recommend it. It just has some rough edges, which you can learn to forgive pretty easily.			",116,11,0,16,5,0,15

												This game is   well---ok if you like a babysitter to guide you around and tell you what to do and when to do it.  It´s a non-thinker game.   For me, not worth what I payed for it.I thought it would give you the freedom to choose a target and allow you to get there and do the job as you thought best.  Tried that and the game stops you and won´t allow you to stray from its babysitter.After playing Farcry 2 and Sniper Elite, with the freedom they give you to choose and do as you like, Sniper 2 is very boring to say the leastRecommend this game?   Well, If all you want to do is  follow the babysitter around and fire when they say, where they say, ect, ect. This game is for you!

												Get this in sale, i bought it for 1 $ I have seen no other game with so much potential. They really try to get the sniper experience going and it show promise but the singleplayer and multiplayer is too linear. You don't have freedom to choose on how to complete the objective, with a sniper game you need giant open maps where you have to make tactical descisions where to move and when. Multiplayer has the option to select hardcore mode where you don't have any huds , names or aiming help which in my opinion should be the base game instead of just another mode. The maps are good looking ( i mean really really good looking ) but very mediocre regarding gameplay. There are not enough open areas where you can hide in vegetation and even if you do it won't be difficult for anyone to spot you ( there isn't really dense vegetation in this game) the game largely revolves using hardcover ( structures like concrete ) instead of merging with flora . They should have done more on customization ( camouflage, ghillesuits etc) , maps and above all objectives.The addons maps are rarely hosted in multiplayer and the community seem somewhat semi-dead. According to everyone siberian strike is a must have and should have been the base game. I give this thumbs because i got this for 1 $ and the devs showed potential and dedication.  regarding ghost warrior 3 i hope they add more tactical value, realism and wide open maps for single and multiplayer.  i would not recommend sniper ghost warrior 2  for full price.

												If you want an experience that makes you think on your feet, adapt, improvise, and overcome, DO NOT play Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. I had hopes that they would have improved from the first game, I was wrong. I played the game on hard difficulty right off the bat. The game was easy since they held your hand all the way through. So, really there was no tension within the gameplay to keep you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention, the story isn't even worth reading in a book, much less have it play out for you within the game. Basically, the gameplay consisted of sniping from a fixed position, and then moving on to the next position, then repeat. The most challenging sniping segment comes in the first act of the game, which consisted of 3 acts. The gameplay involved in moving on to the next position is very boring, since again, they hold your hand the entire time. It tries to be a mini game of stealth during these segments but fails miserably. Think of those goofy shooting gallery games at a carnival where you just stand there and try to hit as many targets as possible, combine that with amazing graphics from Cryengine 3, and that's pretty much the game in a nutshell. In my opinion, a sniper game needs to be non-linear mostly where tactics play a large role in how well the mission turns out. I have played Sniper Elite (love it), Sniper Elite V2 (could've been 100x better), and Sniper: Ghost Warrior 1. Out of all of them, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 would have to be my least favorite. However, it does have the best eye candy. If this game used the non-linear style of Sniper Elite combined with the Cryengine 3 graphics, it would've been an amazing experience. I did play the DLC Siberian Strike, however, it was only a minimal improvement over the main campaign's gameplay. I didn't even touch the multiplayer, I had no desire to do so. I apologize to the game designers and production team for a bad review, but you deserved it. Games are to be active experiences, they are not to be passive experiences where the option of choice is a minimal factor. Obviously, this game was made just to serve as a way to make some money by cashing in on the masses playing other shooters or possibly to give some new people a chance at making a game with a great engine to design it from. The graphics were upgraded very well compared to the first SGW, but the gameplay was worse than the first in the series. 2 annoying oranges out of 5			",235,19,2,7,4,0,8

												I advise not expecting too much from this game.(The following review is only about the single player campaign.)As its name suggest, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is mostly around sniping, and all about infiltrating.Sniping is quite challenging since distance, gravity and wind affect your shots. Luckily, out of Expert difficulty, a red dot appears on your crosshairs indicating where the bullet will land. Your best shots can even be seen from a bullet traveling perspective, which makes this quite entertaining.Sadly, there are still many improvements to do.Stealth is not very reliable, since plants sometimes hide you and sometimes not, like with some hard obstacles. Unless with a teammate AI guiding you, it's often better to eliminate all enemies before crossing the area.AI is pretty simplistic, your teammate often not covering you, enemies staying hidden while they can't locate you or run towards you when they spot you, not caring about your allies.Some gameplay is pretty frustrating, like not being able to switch between crouch and prone (you must be standing first), nor to switch weapons when aiming down sights. Maps are fairly long and decently detailed, but also show some problems, like some obstacle close just enough to block your way or preventing you from advancing while prone. Including corpses.The story is quite cliché and not detailed. The many cutscenes don't help it and are here mostly trying to give an epic feeling, but pretty much fail to do so. It's also disappointing said cutscenes are pre-rendered videos, at low quality, and sometimes laggy (not joking).Overall, it's decent game if you want some sniping experience, if you have some time to spare waiting for something else.

I had fun playing this game for about 5 hours until I ran into a game breaking bug.  Given the overall quality of the game and a lack of any fix for the problem, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.The Problem: After about 5 hours of playing the sound breaks.  The cutscenes and menu still have sound, but the actual game does not.   Online some gamers said that switching their audio between 44000hz and 48000hz fixes the problem, but not for me.  Validating the game cache also did not help.  Restarting of course, didn’t help.ProsFun gameplayConsDumb storyGame breaking bugUnskippable commercials every time you launch the game.

												So, i think the only people that made a good job during development are 3D graphic designer and the voice actors.Story is boring, gameplay is boring (you just go from point to point shooting enemies).And what's most annoying the hardest difficulty level gives you no information at all. I know it should be limited but i spent half of the game looking for enemies which my 'observer' just ignored or just said 'on a left'.Otherwise the graphics is quite good and i have to say the dialogues (not it's content) sound really natural, so big props for voice actors.And i have to be honest, the only reason i clicked that i recommend that game is becouse it's Polish studio and i hope they will do better.

The more issues I find, the more I remember all the ones in the first one perfectly matching the ones I have now (Completely different PC at that).Tips if you're going to play: Change graphics to low if all you see is floating guns and it looks like there's a cone over half the screen.Also if you ever alt + tab out, don't expect when you come back that graphics will be the same. It will look so degraded and color saturated it's just a joke.I'm hoping I can somehow adjust the settings so I can play without having to worry every two seconds of it messing up.I've played about 30 minutes, probably less and I really don't feel like playing at this point.

												This game is just okay, For the single campaign it's good but the first one is better as far as I can remember but still decent to have some fun.  It's very linear story campaign ang gameplay also which either can be good or bad to some.  Not much freedom to rome around. But the DLC campaign is much better than main campaign so if you get this game be sure to get the Siberian Strike DLC.The multiplayer can be either fun or frustrating at all. There is a dedicated server, or host your own and server browser too which I seems to always see around averagely 5 or more active games always. So playing with public is guaranteed at this time of writing. Sniping on single player seems pretty straight and simple that you will sure say it's fun snipping but on multiplayer it's all very different 'coz it's frustrating sometimes because everyone hides so well and comes to the point so hard to find your opponents especially the pros. Multiplayer surely needs a lot of patience and passion to play or else frustration will kill you in always getting killed by your opponents. Some get mad and annoyed then go crazy cross over to other other side and just kill them all with handgun.Overall, It's Average, okay and 65/100 in general view. But might be 85/100 for snipper enthusiast. Buy it on sale to make it worth having.			",1556,595,69,163,173,12,208

												I have only played single player and the SEVERELY scripted gameplay is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are good, but the AI is CRAP for being CryEngine (as great AI is already built in). I get spotted while prone in the brush unless I am in the EXACT position the scripted event allows.  Also, the tutorial controls are for console/controller ONLY and I can't go prone while crouching and visaversa.  It is broken.  Total console port for PC.  Please make a better effort for PC and for CryEngine.  I'm glad a didn't pay full price (Christmas sale).  You ruined CryEngine.			",232,26,4,15,4,2,11

												This game suffers from numerous problems, from random crashes, bugs, terrible controls, take your pick.  There is a button like most games to hold your breath, sadly this is located on the left thumbstick, this game has no deadzones for controllers, everytime you go to hold your breath your character may start sliding around making the entire world an ice rink.  Normally fighting controls is left to platformer games, but here its difficult to make a clean shot when everytime you are fighting the terrible game design. This game renders using Cryengine 3, which is capable of creating amazing visuals.  These game designers somehow are using the engine but you wont notice it in game, the devs are using dirextx 9, the game cant run directx 10 or directx 11.  For some reason they payed alot of money for a great engine then decided not to use any of its features at all.  The devs do not participate in the steam community, so it seems there will never be any patches or support for this title.Rating:  1/10  Value:  1.00			",2654,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												Very Linear (you run from A to B, execute the objective en move to the next point), uninteresting story, decent graphics. Some locations can look very pretty but most of the game doesn't look that good. The looks different from what's is shown on the story page. Sniping is very satisfying although it's more like a shooting gallery. But a good a shooting gallery. I don't really recommend this one unless it's VERY cheap and you like a short linear shooter. I recommend getting Sniper Elite or the upcoming Ghost Warrior 3 which is open world.			",59,8,2,2,1,0,9

												Do not buy this game.Literally it's a serious waste of money.A game with quite a few bugs among single player (came across a few while doing the campaign).Major bugs,lag and start up issues on his dlc ""Siberian Strike"".(memory allocation problem).The game generally is not optimized for DirectX above 9 so most of us had shaders issues on every game mode.NO SUPPORT or updating procedures from the developers.A multiplayer mode with bugs no official servers and most seriously HACKERS,map glitches,(let you travel out side the map and behind rocks,buildings etc and get easy kills).Well the multiplayer is the biggest fail of this game,no support,no admins or tools like vote admin or kick a player like hackers,so untill the round ends you have to play with em.No support from an anticheat engine even from vac.Seriously now if you aiming to get this game for multiplayer you will waste your money and get frustrated,but if you plan only for single player then i'm about 80% positive since its the only worthing to that game and for another and only good reason that is based on the cryengine 3.

												The singleplayer contains bugs where your companion literally stops and and doesn't do anything, as well as sometimes refuses to do the takedown it promised. Enemy AI will spot you easily and the only thing to really avoid that is going prone. Yet somehow your companion doesn't need to do that. I didn't got that much into the story, but as far as I can tell it's not really interesting either.The main reason why I bought this game however was the multiplayer, it looked interesting and I always wanted to try a full on sniper vs sniper team battles taken place in a game actually optimized for sniping and stealth.Yet even the multiplayer is poorly executed. You only have 4 multiplayer maps (without DLC) who all contain glitches. You only have 2 gamemodes: Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. The different sniper rifles don't feel much different from eachother. Sure diferent scope/look/sound but somehow a lot of 'm feel the same. Multiplayer has only 2 zoom toggles. (singleplayer has 3 btw). The multiplayer characters are just characters from the singleplayer but still look poorly, and only 1 of those has the sniper feel ghillie suit on. Sometimes the server disconnects online and you'll be send back to the main menu or the game will completely crash.The graphics are OK, and actually some grass and plants actually move when you touch them which is nice.But the overall feel to the game is just meh. If they ever decide to make a Sniper: Ghost warrior 3, I atleast expect:- High end graphics- Customisable characters and snipers- More gamemodes- Improved maps and more variety- Stable servers- An actual interesting storyBut hey, atleast no one is 360 no-scoping in this.  Cause that's absolute bs			",149,35,5,14,18,2,21

												CI Games are slowly getting better at putting together a sniper game.  Art of Victory was a dogs dinner, Ghost Warrior 1 had it's problems that held it back firmly in the realm of average, and this one is just crossing the threshold into ""worth your money"".  Not full price money mind, but on heavy discount it's worth it.They have thankfully gotten rid of the terrible non-sniping parts of GW1 (you can't even use an assault rifle in this game) and this is a purely snipe oriented game - as it should be.  There have been improvements to the AI and there is now an indicator for when you are alerting enemies.  The gameplay is purely linear, there are no options to go off the beaten path, and some sections fell very hand-holdy with your spotter telling you exactly what to do and when when it is painfully obvious what you ned to do anyway.  Enemies are fairly ruthless if you let them get anywhere near you, and avoiding alerts is certainly the way the game is meant to be played.There are a few annoyances, the cutscenes are in a really crappy resolution and don't look good, stealth killing enemies with your knife can leave you unable to move as if stuck due to a clipping issue for a few seconds, and there are a few points where dialogue will be delivered twice, or too early for the set piece it's attributed to.  The game also remains a short one, shorter than GW1 clocking in at around 4-4.5 hours.  The story is of course nonsense as well.If CI Games continues to improve, who knows, maybe a GW3 will actually make the cut at above heavy discount prices.			",252,64,6,39,33,1,39

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 isn’t bereft of good ideas or mechanics, it’s just that they’re all trapped in a short series of levels that rarely give you anything all that interesting to do with them. Combine that with some graphical glitches and the slow and ultimately forgettable multiplayer, and you have a mediocre game that all but the hardest of the hardcore sniper-wannabes should pass on.

												For $0.50 I recommend this game. It was one of the WORST sniping games i ever played it is so linear and you have NO freedom at all. Story: typical unrelated scenarios and it isn't worth your time!Gameplay: There is no actual gameplay it is only ""wait, move hey head back now go forward and go back WAIT enemy"" from your spotter radio and you have to obey it.Multiplayer: I would say stick to sniper elite if you have that one. Multiplayer is linear and only has Deathmatch nothing else.Performance: Ultra horrible, my GPU wanted to explode even on lowest settings and this is a 2013 game which has 2002 graphics.Overall not recommended at all at full price the only reason i marked it as recommended is beacuse i bought it for $0.50 and for that price it is not bad for wasting time.

++ SEMI SPOILER ++This game is Honestly the worst i ever played, my points are :  Dump AI! Spotter Calls  The game Crashes a lot!   A lot of other Bugs are in there let me explain it a bit.. I've watched a dump guy running against his truck, i was forced to let him pass to stay stealth. Only reload the savegame solved it.The spotter made sometime calls they just confusing like ""first the guy on the right side "" i killed him "" now the sniper on top!"" but there was no sniper on top i reloaded the point like 6 times and killed guys in different orders but it failed every time.The game crashed a lot it just froze and windows pops up with not responding .. I tried to set it to DX11 but it feels it made it worse so i stay with DX9 other changes on graphics had no impact. Heh Bugs, i don't know if it was the ending of the game but i can't finish it. At the point where i have to shoot in the cockpit i was to dump and died at the first try, after loading the savegame i don't have a weapon anymore and i am with that guy on the cliff and can just let me kill from the helicopter.i like stealth Games, and i liked the way how it worked in this game but i can not recommend it.

												If you liked the first you will like the second. If you didn’t then there is little here that will likely change your mind. The formula is almost the same but the pacing and level design are much improved. In fact, level design, graphic style and the locations for each act are extremely well done. Each has a different atmosphere and feel that helps build tension and excitement. It is a shame that SGW2 is actually so short a game. Given time and resources you can only wonder at just what City Interactive might have achieved. Whilst there are limited choices in terms of level exploration it is painfully evident you are playing an on rails shooter. You never really shake the corridor shooter feel and the ever present way point indicator only serves as a reminder of just how much you are being funnelled through the game. The stealth elements of the game are not infuriatingly complex or overly sensitive to the slightest misstep. However, the few times stealth becomes the play style of choice it is more often than not because it might serve as an easier alternative to simply running in guns blazing. Once again, the lack of a more open world with multiple paths to your objective is more the culprit than the actual mechanics for stealth which are generally pretty good. You just never really have the space to truly explore options to avoid more of the combat.The AI is largely there to be killed with minimal fuss and will provide token gestures of resistance whilst being as accommodating as possible to someone armed with a sniper rifle. This is, however, a relative blessing. Were it more proficient in trying to kill you it would only prove just how mind-blowingly useless your spotter is at trying to aid and protect you.Hidden secret items make a return and each act will have a different item to look out for and collect. That said, I’m not at all certain what bonus or benefit you gain from spending time looking for them beyond satisfying any OCD tendencies you might have. The single player campaign offers up about 4 hours worth of entertainment so this isn't a game you'll be with for long unless you're planning on spending time with the multiplayer. The multiplayer is entertaining and certainly, so far as I was concerned, offered far more for my money. Whilst I enjoyed playing through Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 I also felt cheated out of my money. The game is just too short, offers to little in the way of gameplay and left me simultaneously wanting more and glad I gotten it out of the way. Wait for it to appear in a 50% off or better sale before picking up. At full price there are better sniper games and certainly better FPS games available. As a cheap title picked up in a sale to enjoy as a multiplayer game amongst friends between more time consuming or in-depth games, it's a game I'd strongly consider. With the right people SGW2 could potentially be a lot of fun though ultimately it will only ever be a game that you play every now and then. ",460,51,28,44,33,3,95

												It is not a bad game, but the singleplayer campaing is kinda short. There have been some improvements since the 1st Sniper Ghost Warrior game, but not sure what exactly, because I've played the original game only 1 hour most, it really sucked. The second Ghost Warrior has amazing graphics, the gameplay is nice, but the story is short as hell.Multiplayer is not as much fun as I thought. 2 of 3 maps have places where you can't even see your enemy, on kill cam you know approximately the spot where he's hiding, but can't rlly find him. (hiding in the rocks on the resort map and in some dark places in sarajevo) The Chinese/Tibet Temple is fun. They should have made a capture the point mod, because tdm and dm get boring quickly, especially when there are these strange places and ppl camping only in there... Have not found out if there is a voice chat in multiplayer, but maybe it depends on the ""lobby leader"" if he enables it I guess.For the price of 30€ I would rate this game: 50/100 scorebut because I've bought it on sale, I can give it: 70/100 scoreps. rlly not worth the 30€			",106,16,7,11,4,0,5

												It seems the developers expect people to go on easy or normal difficulty on the SP campaign so that you know what targets the people talk about. I stopped playing this when I came to the second lookout point. It was really furious looking and looking for the target through the night vision while the guys over the radio are saying ""What are you waiting for!"". They're talking about one dude they've spotted and expect you to see him and take him out in 5 seconds. It's like they expect you to know where they are.While running with your spotter, he does really stupid decisions like almost running into the enemy before noticing them. It's like he only can see for about 30 m. But other times, he sees through bushes and walls in 0.5 seconds and spots every detail about the enemy. They say ""contact"" even though the enemy hasn't spotted us yet and are firing for us. In this game, ""contact"" means ""shoot those guys quick"". ",238,66,10,38,54,0,72

												Ehhhhh...where to start...Ill start with good points first.Sometimes good gameplay e.g. long range good sniping, nice layout to get stealth kills.Good cinematic kill cams.Good graphics, except for the cut scenes they just didnt look as nice and the characters eyes...THE EYES!!!! (you will see what i mean if you buy it).Now for the baaad.Story was super uber lame.The AI was so annoying and inconsistant. 1 minute you will be hiding in the shadow right in front of them and they wont spot you then the next minute some guy 1000 meters away starts shooting at you. However this keeps changing sometimes you get a sniper aiming down the sight at you from 400 meters and they wont spot you but some guy will spot you behind the next wall. The AI on a good note though is they weren't super stupid just buggy aaand they just reacted waaay to quickly to their friends being shot in the head. The cutscenes. The EYES...THE EYES MAAAN!!!!! YOU WERENT THERE!!!!! trust me if u buy the game just skip the cutscenes theyre♥♥♥♥♥♥graphically and its a♥♥♥♥♥♥story.The multiplayer. ""♥♥♥♥ OF YOU CAMPING NOOBS!"" Ok so it would be fine if it was just camping I guess but what makes it so annoying is half the people glitch out the map. It takes no skill if you see a non glitcher because the red ballistic circle is there and your name pops up in massive letters if they aim close to you.The missions are inconsistant difficulty. Ok so was playing the first few levels, playing on the brightness that was the most realistic, didnt go well kept walking into walls, I was think well shiit this is hard. This is the first level whats the next one gunna be like...it was simple, waaay to easy, then the next one got difficult again and that just went on and on. They kinda decided to mix it up in the middle and throw in a ""you cant use stealth here"" mission where you had to kill AAA guns. THE GAME IS CALLED GHOST WARRIOR!!!! WTF!!!! WERE!!!! YOU!!!! THINKING!!!!!The objectives were buggy. Sometimes the objectives didnt show up, sometimes they did and they would lead you to exit the mission area. Sometimes the commands given were stupid and unclear ""target those sniper on the building to the east"" *finds one sniper kills**cant find second sniper because he is chilling to the west*.Final point. The wind meter was sometimes hard figure out what side the wind was blowing.OK so rant over. Personally I did enjoy this game but I wouldnt recommend it. It is so clunky and dodgy that I doubt you would enjoy unless you like the sniping.			",280,41,6,47,54,1,50

												It is not a bad game, but the singleplayer campaing is kinda short. There have been some improvements since the 1st Sniper Ghost Warrior game, but not sure what exactly, because I've played the original game only 1 hour most, it really sucked. The second Ghost Warrior has amazing graphics, the gameplay is nice, but the story is short as hell.Multiplayer is not as much fun as I thought. 2 of 3 maps have places where you can't even see your enemy, on kill cam you know approximately the spot where he's hiding, but can't rlly find him. (hiding in the rocks on the resort map and in some dark places in sarajevo) The Chinese/Tibet Temple is fun. They should have made a capture the point mod, because tdm and dm get boring quickly, especially when there are these strange places and ppl camping only in there... Have not found out if there is a voice chat in multiplayer, but maybe it depends on the ""lobby leader"" if he enables it I guess.For the price of 30€ I would rate this game: 50/100 scorebut because I've bought it on sale, I can give it: 70/100 scoreps. rlly not worth the 30€			",106,16,7,11,4,0,5

Story, 4/10 - It's kinda boring and unexciting.Cutscenes, 3/10 - They're made very poorly.Gameplay, 6/10 - It's a very fun game but gets a bit repetetive, I would give this a 7 but the stealth isn't that hard because the AI is very bad.2 extra points for the Bullet cam, would give it 4 but it's not as good as the one in Sniper Elite :PHas a cliché ending...Overall rating, 5/10Although this game isn't the best and that I didn't enjoy it as much towards the end as I did throughtout the first bit to the middle of the game, I do think it's worth at least one playthrough, I recommend this game.

												I was trying to finish this game, at least once for the single player mode, but too bad, it just had randomly frozen several times.The game uses Cryengine 3 to build the whole world, yet it is apparently not what you may think about, which is totally a waste of the physics engine.The frozen screen just happens especially during briefing and even cutscenes, and it is pretty annoying. You may think the game crashed, but mostly it is still running in the background, which frustrates you anyway.Unless being stealthy to snipe around is what you are really fond of, It is not recommended if you enjoy playing other real triple-A FPS games.

Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a great game, however is notorious throughout the community for having a whole lot of bugs and graphical glitches. I'm pretty sure that at least half of the guides in the Community Guides section for this game are about how to fix the many variations of the infamous ""Black Screen Bug"".There are two versions of this bug that I have come across personally, and in this review/guide I will be explaining how to fix both of these - or at least the method I used.Bug 1) Invisible NPC's + Black Walls/Objects Around the GunThis first bug is caused simply by the version of DirectX the game is using. This can be easily fixed by, once in-game, going to Options > Video > Basic and changing the DirectX version from DirectX9 to DirectX11 from the main menu. If this method does not work for you, then I'm sorry, as this worked for me and I am using a AMD Radeon R7 260X graphics card which isn't exactly the worst graphics card out there, but certainly isn't the best.Bug 2) Black Screen After StartupThis second bug is much more common, but is slightly harder to fix. To fix this bug, go to the place where your Steam folder is located (commonly found in Program Files x86, but if not then it will most likely be in Program Files). Then, go to Steam > steamapps > common > SniperGhostWarrior2 > Game and either delete, rename, or move the ""_FastLoad"" folder. After completing these steps, you may want to restart Steam just to be safe. The game should no longer provide a black screen at startup.If you found this review/guide helpful, then please vote up, so others can easily find and use this guide. ",143,20,3,12,14,1,5

 This game is worth more than 0.99$Pros:-Fun, relaxing gameplay.-Not too difficult for the casual gamer-Great gunplay and good physics-Fun slow motion bullet animation -Beautiful scenery-Runs very smoothCons-Can't run on amd -Cheesy voice comms-Annoying background general-A bug here and there (i personally experienced only 1 which was a checkpoint that wouldn't dissapear-Bad AI alert-Short storyMission ReportThis game is definitely worth 99 cents, i would have personally paid 15 dollars for this game but the fact that you can catch it for only 99 cents is amazing. A very fun and enjoyable experience, definitely worth my money and time.			",66,19,0,4,4,0,0

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is one of those games with a lame plot, but managed to keep you playing nonetheless because the play mechanics are quite solid and the satisfaction of having that bullet meet the bad guy is just so... satisfying. Now using CryEngine 3, S2 has improved visuals which really shows in the jungle levels. There's a lot of shooting to do, as you've been sent to go after lots of objectives, multiple locations, and you'll have to do plenty of stealth work as well, as you sneak past guards, silent kill sentries, make your way past sniper alley, and much more. Multiplayer can be a lot of fun too as you try to sneak your way to flags and whatnot. It It's a bargain for the amount of satisfaction it brings.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												After playing the Demo a few times i thought this game was cool and decided to give it a try.45 minutes into the game.First mission done currently at the second mission.Already experienced numerous bugs and the first crash. (i've never gotten a crash in a single-player game before)I wanted to try out this game, see if the sniping was fun etc. so I might buy Ghost Warrior 3 in the future. (I know that Ghost Warrior 3 is open world and stuff but I wanted to try it out).After the first mission I can already see that this game isn't well polished and that the devs probably don't give a dong.Now I know that I definitly won't buy Ghost Warrior 3 and support the devs.btw, the sniping is ok.Can't say much about the story right now.

												For me, this game was definitely worth what I paid, although I did purchase it from Bundle Stars for around $3, still a great game. There were only two things that really irritated me about the game; one being that sometimes the matchmaking either didn't work or was dead, even though it was an active part of the day, and what annoyed me the most was the poorly designed hitboxes that activate cutscenes. This hitbox issue even occured on the final kill of the game that is the most 'climactic' kill of the entire game, even I could see that my bullet missed yet the cutscene still went on to where the target died. Whilst multiplayer matches were sometimes difficult to find, once gameplay inside of them initiated, I always found it very unique as the game, at first look, has a very similar genre to the Call of Duty series, yet the multiplayer is so different from any other game I've ever played...it's snipers only. So yeah sure, it is basically 'Campers v Campers' but it still works without being majorly irritating, even though some people are CRAZY good at it.TLDR: The game can of course go with having some work done on it, but for a quick and unique game to play, it was definitely worth my $3 and could be worth your $20 if you don't like saving money, although I personaly wouldn't have paid $20 myself because I do like saving.

												Excellent game that took me completely by surprise. It requires strategy, unlike a lot of other campain driven games. For instance, you take down the enemies that are not in line of sight of each other to remain hidden. If you are spotted you are in trouble and things become a lot more difficult, but you do not automatically fail. You can also choose to sneak around enemies and leave them alive, or take them out from close quarters. This game is absorbing and highly entertaining. Don't expect a story like Call of Duty, or an insane graphical masterpiece.Want a true challenge? Harder difficulties remove the aim dot. You need to check the wind strength and range, and then align your shot accordingly. This game mode immerses you even more.The serbian strike DLC was great, but shorter than the main campain (as expected). I have not played much of the multiplayer yet. There are a couple of servers that are active. Proper sniper battles.  I will buy the sequel, if there ever is one.			",390,91,23,35,36,2,58

Doesn't give you much freedom to choose except for the 2:> Follow the stealth> Screw it allGot some secrets here and there to do some replays if you wanna go 100%.But if you wanna go 100% with the Steam achievements? I heard the multiplayer's dead, so no comments on that.But for the 90% price cut on the time I bought this game, I'd say it's a well spent.			",144,16,4,6,7,1,10

												-SINGLEPLAYER-This might turn out to be a review for the awesome parts of the first game because, let's be honest, the first game was so much better than this. What were they thinking?! Let's talk about the story first - one word: Lame. It was so short and there was no obvious point to everything you were doing. It was so hard to follow. Oh, and just so you know, I review a game on it's gameplay, not on its graphical quality, although, I gotta say, the graphics were absolutely outstanding! However, that was really the only good thing about the game. The feel of the game with the sniper rifle and running around felt very clunky, even for a PC game - and where I would get around 60 - 80 FPS on high settings, I would still get this really irritating stutter glitch/bug (Had an FPS counter in top left corner of screen).There was no sence of freedom to make your own decisions about infiltrating this place or killing these people. It was far too easy because you had that really annoying spotter sitting next to you the whole time telling you how to do it. No thinking is required. Also, it is without a shadow of a doubt THE MOST LINEAR GAME IN THE HISTORY OF GAMES. No exaggeration. You couldn't make the decision to go left or right to get to your location, no open-world aspects, all you could do was follow your spotter. I felt like a baby learning how to walk whilst playing this game. I could often guess what was going to happen next half the time. WHERE IS THE FUN IN ANY OF THAT?!The story all felt very cliché and hollywood movie esque. By that I mean it had three very American protagonists, played by, what sounded to be, low budget - somewhat amatuer voice actors. And so on, blah blah blah. You could finish they campaign in just under 4 hours if you rushed it, which to be honest, I did because it was so boring I just wanted to get it over with.-MULTIPLAYER-The multiplayer for Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 was all round extremely dull. There was nothing good to say about it to be honest. It's what you would expect from a sniper-based game: lots of camping, spending an age to find a target to shoot at, and when you eventually do find a target, they either move before you can get a shot, or you are shot first.-OVERALL VERDICT-Pros-Stunning Graphics-(Reasonably) Clever AICons-Short Story-Boring Story-Cliché Story-Same-old Story-Clunky feel when playing-Repetetive-Dull Multiplayer (full of little kids squealing on the mic)-NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE FIRST GAME-ADVICE-Don't buy this game - spend your money on a better game, for example: The first one!Thanks for reading.

												The shooting range is the best part of this game, although it is not a standard shooting range. The shooting range is in of itself a single map that one selects a gun (and can swap them out) and then gets in position and snipes the actual targets... they are not cardboard cutout but actual 3d characters that are mobile. Wind is a factor in the game as is distance (gravity).The campain for this game feels rushed. The gemetry/maps are built well (only had one instance that what diisplayed and what was got me... which was nice (every game has at least one if you explore as I do). The thing that makes it feel rushed is that there are many isntances where it says shoot X and I have no idea where X is, and they jsut keep repeating shoot X... which is especially difficult to look for when you are being shot at. Sometimes they effectively say what to target and where, most of the time they do not, however sometimes they are marked for you... Finally there is one instance where you have less than a second or 2 to snipe a very mobile target that if you don't hit you must retry it again, and again, and again... by the time I got it I think I quick scoped without any expectation of hitting the danged target... and in no way could effectively repeat the success.It is not a bad campain or game, just can just lack its entertainment value at times. If you can get this game for real cheap then go for it, otherwise I would not go out of your way for it. Cheap for me would be a buck or two... or grab it in a bundle of some sort if that is more economical for oneself.			",1242,390,49,153,140,13,215

												I have played the whole singleplayer campaign on casual and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The singleplayer is split into three parts called acts the first act is set a couple of months/weeks ago the second is in 1993 and the third in the current day. Through the first act you and your partner 'Diaz' are picking off men and guiding your soldiers through enemy territory. The second act you and your partner Gomez do the same sort of thing (later theres a twist), in the third act 'Diaz' is back and you take down a double-crosser in an amazing finish.The games graphics are better then average considering it came out in 2013. It has a more then decent story and even on casual difficulty its certainly isn't a walk in the park. The animations are farely good but you won't get to see many of them in the demo (which I recommend playing before purchasing the full game). There are barely any cutscenes in the first act but in the third act they take up easily 30% of the gameplay. There are a number of negatives but most people over exaggerate on how bad they are. For example if you are walking through a forest path you might get stuck on an invisable object for a second. One thing i found interesting was in different scenes 'Diaz' was voiced by different people. Last issue I have is that they didn't sync the character's mouth animations with the words they were saying which looks odd. I haven't played the multiplayer much at all and I'm not a big fan of what I played but I never had high expectations for it. I suggest playing the demo before purchasing it. Now the price; I bought this through the Sniper Ghost Trilogy pack for $2.99 US at the christmas sale (without sale it is priced at $19.99 US). I don't recommend that package because the older Sniper Ghost games aren't nearly as good as this one and plus the new one is coming out this year. By its self this game costs $9.99 US which might be a little pricey but if its on sale its a great pick up (it will probably go on sale soon because of Sniper Ghost: Warrior 3 coming this year). I want to point out that its not a complete copy of sniper elite thats a little worst for a cheaper price. I think people got this idea because of the slow-motion bullet cam that are very similar in both games. The system requirements definitely aren't crazy considering you don't even need a single gb of ram to run it. A tip of advise, when following Diaz or Gomez to dodge enemies they might walk into an area where you would think they would get spotted. Don't then take another path around the area because it looks safer because you will get spotted somehow so just always follow them whereever they go in those parts of the missions.Lastly the singleplayer will last you a few hours with the great highlights and the multiplayer is average. I was disappointed that it only took about four hours to finish singleplayer I really wanted to continue playing more missions (e.g. don't expect plenty of hours of gameplay). I rate it 8/10, I would of rated it higher if there were less bugs and glitchs but I rated it this high because it keeps you on your toes the whole time.			",32,1,0,1,1,0,0

												Really, this is an awful game. Your spotter spots out everything for you so there is no question on where enemies are, and if there is no spotter, then you die by the first mistake that you make. There is no option to get rid of the assist dot in the scope, so you are forced to play a pretty boring campaign that makes sniping seem like the easiest job in the world. Even the dialogue was pretty terrible, with soldiers arguing with their superiors, and some pretty forced jokes. I honestly felt like this game could have succeeded as it employs some interesting gameplay mechanics, but the campaign is boring, the story is uninteresting, the AI are so stupid yet can charge you and kill you easily if discovered, the characters are dull and have very forced personalities, the sniping gets old and mechanical very quickly, the dialogue seems like it was written in a middle-school 6th grade english class, there were too many times when I died not knowing why...etc. I only played 99cents for the game, so I'm not asking for my money back. It's important to understand that I'm usually willing to give sniper games a try, but this one fails on many levels.			",69,13,1,1,1,2,4

												finished the game 4 times already and still cant get enough of it , the devs took everything good from the first game and made them even better unlike the first game you wont spend the hole game in an island but you will have different locations like the Philippines, Sarajevo, Siberian (in the dlc) ...ect and its made with cryengine so if you played crysis you will know how  good the graphics are , the sound effects are perfect and the thing i really loved in the game is the voice acting for the enemies like arabs, really well done, the gameplay is great with some new features like Motion Sense Trigger System for controllers , Realistic Ballistics ( the effects are better on hard mod) and New Gear like Night and Thermal vision goggles and final Bullet Penetration ( did work great online in deathmatch) but sadly the Bullet-Cam (my fav in any sniper game) dont work much unlike sniper v2 :/ didnt face any problems, bugs or glitches but people said that inst not working great on windows 8 and 10the multi is still live unlike the first sniper and the thing that you will maybe dislike is the fact that you're not very free with your action in the game cause you will be most of the time with the spotter (you do what he say or game over for you) but good thing that the devs took that in mind and updated the games with a nice dlc that i highly recommend (freedom 100%) .this game is for any camper that love sniping or gamer that love a good stealth game, grab it on sale + the siberian strike dlc and no need for the other dlcs (only for multi).8/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												Before starting to play Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, my expectations were very high. I was expecting it to at least match the original game in terms of gameplay features. Unfortunately it failed to do this, and ultimately failed to meet the standards of the Cry Engine 3 (one of the most powerful engines currently available).Similar to the way I felt before and after I started playing the game, I’ll start with the good things and move on to the bad things and finish with the best part.Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 does the sniping aspect very well.  There aren’t too many FPS games out there that focus on sniping, or at least, there aren’t any out there that have this much depth to sniping. The developers have done a superb job at creating a realistic sniping experience. Various measurements need to be taken before lining up the perfect shot and different locations mean different adjustments. Distance, wind, and even the curve of the bullet need to be taken into consideration. This makes sniping enemies very enjoyable and varied, depending on conditions.The developer, City Interactive seemed to have focused perhaps too much on the sniping aspects of the game, because that’s about all that’s good about it :/ I’ve noticed a lack of gameplay features that were present in the previous game such as, grapple hooking your way to high places, picking up enemy firearms, using throwing knives to take out enemies. The gameplay revolves completely around using your sniper rifle to well……..snipe, and using your P220 pistol if things get up close and personal. The P220 features in all three of the chapters as a sidearm, but the primary sniper rifle changes depending on what chapter you’re playing. Apart from finding the occasional enemy Dragunov rifle, you have no other weapons to find or interact with.  This seriously upset me.Level design is another issue with Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. The levels are detailed, but I feel this is just a way of disguising how painstakingly linear they are. Each chapter has you following a set path with a few open vistas to shoot enemies from a far. The vistas do offer fairly detailed locations to find and shoot enemies, but ultimately they just serve as complex shooting galleries and you never actually get to explore them. The levels are also too small. I find myself disappointed whenever I round a corner, only to realise that I’m in an even smaller house than the last one I was in. I was really hoping for a more open ended level design, but City Interactive has decided to play it safe and keep things way too simple. Lastly, I’ll talk about the multiplayer. This is the most surprising part about Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. It’s actually a decent addition to the game. I was highly expecting an equally lack luster experience online as I did with my campaign experience, but it turned out better than expected. Sniping is really the only feature in multiplayer, but it’s easier to enjoy due to the lack of a forced story or other cheesy scripted events. The multiplayer levels are really well designed, plenty of places to hide, plenty of choices for rifles to use, and plenty of intensity that should have been more common in the single player. Looking around the maps for enemies is a long and tiring process, but once you find one and line up the perfect shot, it’s all worth it. Hearing the bullet whizz past your head as another sniper takes shots at you, forcing you to relocate before it’s too late, that’s an awesome feeling too. It’s a nice break from the normal run and gun shooters out there, where the SMG class is king. In this case, less is more.Overall I did enjoy Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. While it didn’t meet my expectations, it still does sniping better than any other game I’ve played. I can see myself continuing to play the multiplayer, while waiting for the DirectX 11 patch to be released. I might get 10 more hours out of it if I’m lucky. If you’re a sucker for FPS games like me, this will be worth your time. If not, then you won’t be missing much. 6/10			",672,117,7,51,43,6,74

												One thing is certain: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is certainly more enjoyable than its predecessor. But is it that much better if you look closer ? No, but there are a few things that have been improved. First of all, the game now runs on the CryEngine 3. It's definitely visible as the game looks more vibrant and detailed, but faces are still a bit low poly. And the environments, while they look frequently beautiful, are still not open. The game lets you walk in only one direction, so, like the first one, it's still linear. Not a big deal at all, but it would've been cooler if you had the chance to kill people from more than one location.Another improvement is that it's more stealthy. In the first one there were a few moments where you had to kill (waves of) enemies using regular weapons, which was a bit odd considering the fact that it's a sniper game and it's called Sniper Ghost Warrior. SGW2 fixes that problem. You still get to switch to your handgun, but there are no other weapons besides that one and your trusty sniper rifle. Firefights are more intense because of that. Now, intense might not be the right word for it, because they aren't really, but you get the feeling you're playing as a real sniper. And while kills aren't as satisfying as sniping someone in Sniper Elite V2 it still does a good job of mixing up the action with some slow motion bullet kills. Even if they're not that spectacular.The game consists of three acts, with several missions in each act. Missions will take somewhere between 10-30 minutes, and most of us will finish the game within 5,5 hours. It's not overly long and therefore stays enjoyable all the way through.If you're into sniper games, like me, SGW2 might be worth your time and money. It all depends on how much of a fan you are. Still, if I had to choose between this game and Sniper Elite V2, Sniper Elite would win without a doubt. That doesn't mean it's bad, but it does mean there's still room for improvement.[Rating: 70/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												REVIEW OF ONLY THE SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN---------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked the first Ghost Warrior, and desperately... desperately want more of that, this fits the bill.  It felt a little more like a slog than the first, but that could be just simply that the first was short and that's all the gig is good for.  I finished this one, but only because it was a short game I could then add to my ""finished"" folder.  Does that make it worth my time?  Probably not.Pros:-Runs fine.-Decent PC options.-Controls well.Cons:-5 hr poorly done version of the sniping mission from MW4.-Doesn't hold up well graphically.-VERY forgettable story and phoned in sounding voice acting.-3 Weapons (pistol, 2 sniper rifles)-Pistol is a one shot kill from any distance even to the foot, and dead accurate (no weapon sway on the pistol, yet always on the rifles... weird)  Game breaker in a way.-After seeing Sniper Elite 3 bullet cams, these just don't impress anymore.-Gets boring quick.If I had to score it:  4 / 10			",287,65,32,25,29,3,42

												The game is simply boring. Hard to accomplish 2-3 hours playing. The plot is something you forget the next day you restart the game. The visuals are nice yet the game leads you through a corridor where moving more than 20 meters left or right is impossible. The weapons to use are just the two you carry not fitting close combat when necessary. Environment interaction limited to medical packages picking. There are no alternate ways to solve each piece of level. Move, mark target, aim, shoot. Thousand times with brain off and no satisfaction from playing at all.			",48,3,0,3,1,0,2

												I would like to give it a thumbs up, but this has more glitches than an ""Early Access Game""Enemies can see you when you are in complete cover, especially in foliage.Multiplayer would be fun, but there are so many cheaters ie, War Hack, No Breath, Perfect Aim.....I know people can be good, but nobody is perfect...not to mention more glitches. for Example;Enemy is in your sight, line up your shot...Boom, nothing.....its hit an INVISIBLE WALL, 1 second laterm he shoots you!WANT A GOOD SNIPER GAME, SNIPER ELITE V2, V3 & AOMBOE TRILOGY.....much better than the Ghost Sniper Series			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Greetings, from the first game to this one. I would say City Interactive does improve on their products. this game is a fantastic game. single play is nice because of the realism. The single player beats the multiplayer because of mass cheaters online.. Multiplayer is just about joining randomly matched with alot of cheating; lacks organization for groups. passwords cannot be set with ranked matches etc. though i give this game 4 of 5 stars.

												Personally,I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an in-depth action/stealth game.my reason for doing so is that this game puts you in the snipers atmosphere.This makes you think,feel and believe you are this highly trained sniper opperative on a mission to stop any enemies in your crosshairs.This game creates such a realistic affect as the graphics and the storyline are so imensly comprehensive because of this you are more aware of your surrounding and choose shooting spots ,timing and staying between the shadows to stay hidden from your enemiesmore carefully.The one thing i did not like about this game is that it had a very anti climactic ending as the campaign was much shorter then expected for this i would give the game a 6.5/10.

												So, I'm familiar good shooters. Nothing beats these mechanics. I'm a LEM in Matchmaking for CSGO, and was once in high-ish rankings in TAM ladders for ut2k4. I've played a crap ton of SP and MP games from BF3, back to UT99.  I got this game in a bundle, and didn't expect to actually play it. I was quite surprised. It's very linear and the story is meh. The gameplay otherwise is quite awesome,The shooting mechanics (physics) are pretty awesome though. I recommend the game solely on that. Everything matters from heart rate, to holding a breath, to when's the last time you held your breath, to distance from target, gravity.. caliber of bullet.. It just takes so much patience and understanding. I played it one time through campaign on the hardest difficulty, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a very nice change of pace from the other shooter games I've ever played. A little slow and the linear aspect was not fantastic, but I hear the next iteration in their series is supposed to be open world, so definitely count me in for that.Would recommend to friends.

												Not that anyone cares about my opinion, but I've decided to start reviewing all my games, I figure it will force me to work my way through my backlog.  This is the first game I picked.I really enjoyed this game, I played on Normal difficulty and found it a bit too easy and forgiving, will probably restart it on hard at some pont in the future.  As is common with many single player campaigns I felt the game was too short overall, I think it took me around 3 hours to complete.  The story however was compelling, and I liked the one shot one kill sniper style of play, versus the normal pray and spray, shoot everything that moves, and then shoot the stuff that doesnt move fps style of game.My one and only complaint (SPOILER) when you shoot Maddox, they took the time to make the animation for shooting through his scope, but his eye stays intact through the entire thing.  Last I checked a .50 cal round through a scope and into your head, takes your eye with it.

												The single-player campaign is much too short for my taste,some textures are really bad-looking for the CryEngine 3 based game and there's only a few firearms in the missions(more in the multiplayer),but whatever! It's still a good game.Not an excellent one,but worthy playing if you like to slaughter the enemies unconscious of your presence. It's surely worthy mentioning that the game has really good optimisation(between 150 and 200 fps on my hardware on the hightest settings).Except the length of the story there's one more bigger disadvantage - the AI,which is stupid as hell.Also the multiplayer server list was empty almost everytime I tried to play online and when I finally joined a match I met a hacker :/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is still much left to be desired; City Interactive fails to take full advantage of Cryengine 3, and is still trying too hard to be like the modern Call of Duty games (Something I think we all can agree is a poor idea for what should be a more tactical game), but they've generally succeeded in shaping a sniper experience that is solid in both graphics and gameplay.

												In short: A good game but do not buy full priced.Pro's-Nice gameplay if you like sneaking and sniping. Defenitely better real 'sniping' experience than for example Sniper Elite. It tries to be somewhat of a sniper simulator but can't really deliver there like ARMA does. However in the context of this game it is enough to make gameplay very interesting and even challenging. -Pretty decent graphics and nice environments.-Story not very good but interesting enough.Con's-Badly optimised. Although my computer is absolutely fine (can run all games i know at high/very high) this game did not feel fluid. Especially when running it felt weird, a kind of stuttering or something. -Bugs. This game has its share of bugs. Usually nothing game-breaking but i once could not pick up my gun and the keys to change stance seem to randomly make you crouch, stand or go prone which is very annoying.-VERY VERY Linear. you don't have any choice to do anything. You can complete the objective in one way and no other.-Voice acting is a little dull sometimes-That red dot. The only thing making this game a challenge is aiming. With the red dot enabled (when looking through your scope it gives the exact place you are going to hit) there is absolutely no challenge. There really should be a way of disabling it without having to play on the hardest difficulty. The same goes for the hints and everything. -Companion AI is bad. When following a companion they always run. I could barely catch up with them and usually i just played my own style and they would just stand and wait out in the open until i catched up. ConclusionIt is a decent game for a few hours of fun. It gives a pretty good sniping experience where your skill will matter (if you play on hard so disable aim assist). It defenitely immerses you in the role of a sniper. Get it when it is in the sale and you will not regret your purchase			",27,2,0,0,0,0,1

												I got the game for 1€, considering that price it was okay... but for anything above 5€ that I'd say you would do yourself a favor by passing this and getting something else. It's trying hard to feel like an AA game, but it's B-classiness is so obvious everywhere. AI is horrendously dumb even on expert levels, game has some very weird design choices and is very, very linear.My ""favorite"" design choice is that in certain levels you just can't sneak through - you have to run around map looking for that one final enemy to kill before you can progress... that's a big NOPE in a game that's supposedly all about that stealth gameplay. Not being able to pick up enemies guns is very immersion breaking, as is their extreme ability to see you through the foliage at times, and not at others.Story is predictable, cringy and despite all that dramatic feeling you won't really care about any of that stuff that is happening. Voice acting is poor and very out-of-sync mouth movements don't help either. Besides character models and cutscene animations game looks good though, it better should considering it's running on CryEngine.This is the first City Interactive game I managed to finish and somewhat enjoy myself at certain times. That alon is a huge achievement. Maybe Ghost Warrior 3 will be actually good. Right now it's just... a 5/10 territory.			",93,12,4,6,4,1,9

												well... its better than S:GW1 the engine change from Chrome to CryEngine did some really good things for this game however the level design has a ton of flaw and the stealth is still not perfect. The v-sync apears to be badly broken and the screen tearing is is almost award worthy (a file cabinet that existed in 3 different places on my screen) the action movies between playable sections are extreamly low quality to the point where i almost wish they were actually QTEs. The main campain really holds your hand in a very annoying way even in the end of the game telling you what to do and who to shoot first all the time. The story is... ok nothing ground breaking. The save points can be very very far apart where you have to reapeat long sections over and over again in frustration and they can also but out for a number of reasons I still recommend because i wanted to shoot people in the head and i got to shoot people in the headgrab it on sale if its your thing but make SURE you get the DLC mission pack its sooooo much better than the main game in every way. in ""siberian strike"" you dont get anything holding your hand and its just a massive improvment over everything in the main game. hopfully the devs get it together for S:GW3 because there is a fun game in here somewhere hidden in a pile of frustraiting bugs...

												I enjoyed this sniper game, and I think you'll like it if you generally enjoy this type of game.  It took me 8 hours or so to complete the single player mode on easy difficulty.  Since I'm not a great player, it took some time and retries to clear the missions,  Having checkpoints to avoid starting over each time I died was good, but sometimes I wished there were a few more checkpoints, because there were a few times where I had to replay the same tedious or annoying parts over and over because I kept dying before reaching the next checkpoint.The story here is broken up into three acts, each made up of a few missions, and you're working as part of a team even in single player mode.  I think the story developed well, and even though game play can be a little slow at times (e.g., sneaking into areas means crouch-walking for a long-ish time), I think that helps get you immersed in the story.  I think your only weapons here are a sniper rifle, a pistol (I think), and a knife.  While the knife is useful for doing silent kills, I don't think I ever really used the pistol.  The game kind of seems designed to keep you using the sniper rifle, which makes sense.  At a few points you have to set up on a sniping point from which you cannot move at all, which makes things a little more difficult if you get spotted and shot at, since you can't slide over at all to try to keep the enemies from guessing exactly where you are.  There are multiple difficulty levels, though I haven't tried any but the easy one, and a multiplayer mode, which I also haven't tried.  But the multiple modes and difficulties should make this game accessible to all sorts of players.A few notes on this game (SGW2) compared to Sniper Elite V2 (SE2), which I played before this:  easy mode in SGW2 doesn't mean line up the enemies directly in the center of the cross-hairs like it does in SE2; there is bullet drop and wind effects, but there's a kind of aim-assist mechanism where a small red dot appears showing you where the bullet will go -- you line that dot up with where you want to shoot.  As noted above, although the game play in SGW2 is a little slower, I think I got into the story more.  You don't have as many weapons/tools here as in SE2, but then again, you're in a team here and solo there.  Also, it seems easier to stick with the sniper rifle here; a number of times in SE2, enemies would get close enough that I had to switch to another gun, but that didn't happen very much in SGW2.  Both games are good, but operate a little differently (as expected).			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

												I got this very cheap, which is great.. but unfortunately this game is pretty bad. The only things I actually enjoy are the moments when you get to find a vantage point and pick away at enemies, while adjusting for wind and gravity etc. That element is kind of fun. Pretty much everything else is not.Graphics aren't great, but I don't even care about that. The real pain in this game is movement, everything feels very clunky and slow. Apparently there are things to find, judging by achievements.. but the game seems to actively discourage you from exploring. It's so straightforward in what you have to do, and the checkpoints are either needlessly close together or stretched oddly far apart. This forces you to replay some pretty boring areas again and again if you fail. Nobody wants to crawl on their belly along one side of the map again. That's pretty much what passes for stealth in this game. It gets old fast.There is also very little variety in options and gear, it's just your rifle and pistol. You can pick up ammo (which you won't need) and medkits (which you'll rarely use - maybe more useful on hardest difficulty?), but can't pick up enemy weapons or have any real variation in your combat. If any enemy is face to face with you, you're pretty much dead in a second. You are so slow and gimped it's a bummer.Granted I'm only on Act 2, but I'm pretty much done with this game. It's just too annoying to play, and the good parts don't make up for the bad.			",129,31,1,22,9,1,12

												Just the ♥♥♥♥♥iest most generic game I've ever played. It's so generic I feel like this is the foundation every other shooter ever made is based on. Every time I start the game I'm overcome with a feeling of dread because I don't want to listen to the two main characters ♥♥♥♥♥ing to eachother in their generic military voices. During the entire first mission you're givin absolutely no freedom whatsoever. You can't shoot when you want to, you can't move when you want to, you can't play at your own pace. You have this other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that tells you what to do and when to do it. I'm surprised the game even lets you aim.			",352,77,5,40,25,0,42

												I bought it on the winter sale, and I just have to say, that it is much better than I expected. The gameplay is fluid, and with the Cryengine 3 Graphics engine, the game looks beautiful. With that said, I feel as if the game suffers from a very linear story and overall gameplay (even though the excecution of this play style is great). Nevertheless, I'd give the game a 8/10. I enjoyed it, I would however, reccomend you buy the game on a sale.			",43,1,1,4,5,0,2

												Though it is not as good as the sniper elite, it is still a game worth the money. I recommend get this game when it is 75% off. I just finished the single mission in normal difficulty. It's a pretty easy and casual game at least for me in this difficulty. So i think most of the people can handle this game and get started easily. The single mission is pretty short, there are three  acts. Each acts contains three parts. In total, there are nine parts. For me, each part cost me around 15-20 minutes to finish. That is to say, 3-4 hours will be enough for most new players to finish the single mission. The disappointing thing is that when i try to play multi player mode, the game just kept saying that U lost the connection. That really frustrated me. After trying three times, i deleted this game from my Pc.Overall, still a fine game to buy if it is on discount. The single mission is interesting and the scenery in the mission looks pretty cool so i got several screenshots. BTW, there are some glitches in this game, if you meet some of them, just restart the game or relaod the checkpoint, it will be ok. Thats the only thing i feel very bad when i play this game.

												Pros: +GraphicCons: -Bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb AI-enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted-godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior.-terrible checkpoints and saves.-boring story that i couldn't care less aboutWill not recommend it unless its 90% offEven then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end.			",220,28,5,21,16,0,29

												okay first of all before you read this review: I enjoy the game but why Im saying no is for a few reastons that I will tell later on.okay so the game is amazing it looks fantastic even on medium settings.Its very realistic because you have to shoot long distances and with those long distances there is always wind involved and that will effect your bullet. Im a few hours into the game and I like it so far, you have to like slow paced games if you play this.now I will say you why I dont like the game.1.for some reason the first time when you start the game it glitches out because the directX version is set to directX 9, you have to change that to directX11 if you want to play the game.2.  maybe its just my hardware but the loadscreen/introscene of a mission glitches out whole the time so I have to alt+tab out of the game and alt+tab back into the game to let it work.3. again maybe this is a hardware issue but for some reason the ''targets'' spawn in with only a head and a gun. so no body etc etc.  so I have to restart my game to let them spawn in.I got this game for 3,47 euros with 2 other sniper: ghost warrior games so its a good deal but those 3 things that I told you above are just things that really bother me in this game and they prevent me from playing this game normalgreetz :D			",72,4,2,6,4,1,0

												Since I saw the reviews doing such a dishonor, I thought I need to put in my opinion. This game is AMAZING. It's a bit older and so the CPU can react a bit odd, and have super aim (it seems) but it doesn't spoil the game. I see that alot of people had issues with the specs, and it's probbably because the graphics KICK♥♥♥♥♥ I had to run them on low at times, and they still looked...dare I say it... MAGESTIC. This would bring up issues with laptops or any desktop that doesn't have a special graphics card because even in the lowest setting it has a pretty high standard. Really fun, cool campaign, get it if it's under 10$, for sure!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a rather controversial game. In my opinion, it's far better, than its only rival, the SniperElite v2, but it doesn't make it good. The graphics are okay, the story is ridiculously simple (and bad), but the athmosphere of the game is more or less good.The creators learned from their earlier mistakes. Not learned enough, but learned. The game finally more good than bad, and I find this improvement promising. Finally enemies can't see you from 200 meters while you crawl under a bush, and most of the times they act like a human being... No, that was a little strong word for it, so let's just say they smarter than the CoD enemies.And why it isn't an especially good game? First of all, sometimes it's anoying as hell. There are many times, where the save point is before some unskippable scripted event, and we have to watch it over and over again if we couldn't be succeded at the first time. And there are situations where we have to try a section for a several times, because it's literally almost impossible to find who do we need to shot. The levels are bigger, than they were in the first game, yet they still too linear, and too much part of the game we have to follow our spotter, who (by the way) doesn't worth anything when it comes to fight. If there are two enemies, he helps us to kill one of them, but other than that, he almost never shoot, and doesn't even cover our back. Luckily the enemies see that he's such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so they don't shoot at him, even if he runs past them. And the last problem is that the game is rather frustrating sometimes. The best example for it is the final ""bossfight"" if we can call that this way. We have to fight with our nemesis, a traitor, an other US sniper, which is literally means the following: we are proning at a lookout, and searching the area to find him. That's all. Sometimes he shoots at us, so we have about 30-45 seconds to find him, before we die. The tricky part is, the area is FRAKIN' huge (imagine an area which is about 250-270 degrees wide, and there are buildings between 300 to 1100 meters), and the boss shows himself only when he shoots. Of course we can't move to an other spot where he don't know exactly where we are. The game doesn't even let us to let go the riffle and take a look without the scope to see the glimpse of sunlight of the enemy's scope. So the final bossfight is only about luck. If you don't watch exactly the same spot, exactly the same time when the boss shoots at you, you won't find him. If you are lucky, you find him at the first occasion, if you are not, you'll try a hundred times, and you still won't see him.They put multiplayer in the game, because nowdays even a frakin' SIMulator of a CITY can't live without multiplayer, so how an FPS could be? It was just a waste of the precious worktime, because doesn't worth a damn. Snipers against snipers, so it's boring-boring-boring. A co-operative multiplayer might work, but the competitive one isn't a good choice for this game. You literally watch the area, looking for enemy snipers, and you are happy when... no, not when you kill someone, you are happy even when you finally see a player from the enemy team.Since there aren't many competitors for SGW2, I recommend it but not for everybody. If you are a usual FPS player, then you won't like it. It's for sniper fanatics only, and even they won't be satisfied with it, but as I said: there aren't many games with this theme :/			",21,1,3,5,1,0,3

												I got this in a bundle for $3, and it was totally worth that price. The singleplayer campaign is really unpolished, but there are some parts where it gives you a bit of freedom and these are often quite enjoyable. The game is also reasonably comitted to the sniper angle, and does it fairly well. You only ever get a sniper rifle and pistol, so you have to be stealthy. Occasionally, you actually have to think about the best way to accomplish that, and these sections are generally pretty good and evoke the patience and planning of a skilled sniper. At other times the game forces you into gunfights, and these suck. Enemies can kill you very easily, which is good for a stealth game but frustrating in an action game in which you have very little short-to-medium range firepower, since your pistol is crap and your rifle is always scoped and bolt-action. Still, a cautious and skillful player can avoid the great majority of these, so it's not a huge problem. About the plot, not much can be said. Dull military bros shoot a bunch of dudes, and somebody's evil, and more dudes are shot. One level is set in Bosnia, which is pretty cool. I have no idea how historically accurate it is but it's nice to see some new settings being explored.The game looks okay. It's got some nice CryEngine-y effects, but a lot of the assets are kinda fugly. Ultimately it gets the job done. Some of the level design is well-done, but checkpoint spacing is often poor, and manual saves are not allowed. Bugs crop up from time to time, everything from bullets passing harmlessly through enemies to your companion's AI simply not triggering, but it's not completely game-ruining.Ultimately this is only for people who really like single-player shooters. It lacks the polish and bombast of stuff like Call of Duty, but it also lacks the flexibility and openness of games like Crysis or Far Cry 3. Still, for a budget developer it's a pretty solid release, and bodes well for a third game. I wouldn't recommend it at $20, as it's just not polished enough, but for $10 or less it's worth a shot.

												I bought Ghoset Warrior 2 in the STEAM winter cell and its quite a good game considering what I paid for it.  However there is not a lot of content to it in the single player campaign so it only gives you a few hours of play time.  The missions are very linear, which is fine for a game from 10 years ago but the majority of games have moved away from this.  Its also very prescriptive - your spotter tells you which guys to take down in which order.  The main difficulty is to account for distance, windage and your own body shake, This all leads to a very realistic sniper simulation but it does not work so wel IMHO in terms of stimulating game play.  I did not mind the fact that the enemies are also deadly accurate and you die very quickly if you loose control of the combat area by missing too often.  For me the main downfall is that its not a game where you have to think - once you get the rifle dynamics the game is too simple.			",72,5,1,6,1,0,2

												Pros: +GraphicCons: -Bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb AI-enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted-godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior.-terrible checkpoints and saves.-boring story that i couldn't care less aboutWill not recommend it unless its 90% offEven then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end.			",220,28,5,21,16,0,29

												okay first of all before you read this review: I enjoy the game but why Im saying no is for a few reastons that I will tell later on.okay so the game is amazing it looks fantastic even on medium settings.Its very realistic because you have to shoot long distances and with those long distances there is always wind involved and that will effect your bullet. Im a few hours into the game and I like it so far, you have to like slow paced games if you play this.now I will say you why I dont like the game.1.for some reason the first time when you start the game it glitches out because the directX version is set to directX 9, you have to change that to directX11 if you want to play the game.2.  maybe its just my hardware but the loadscreen/introscene of a mission glitches out whole the time so I have to alt+tab out of the game and alt+tab back into the game to let it work.3. again maybe this is a hardware issue but for some reason the ''targets'' spawn in with only a head and a gun. so no body etc etc.  so I have to restart my game to let them spawn in.I got this game for 3,47 euros with 2 other sniper: ghost warrior games so its a good deal but those 3 things that I told you above are just things that really bother me in this game and they prevent me from playing this game normalgreetz :D			",72,4,2,6,4,1,0

												Just the ♥♥♥♥♥iest most generic game I've ever played. It's so generic I feel like this is the foundation every other shooter ever made is based on. Every time I start the game I'm overcome with a feeling of dread because I don't want to listen to the two main characters ♥♥♥♥♥ing to eachother in their generic military voices. During the entire first mission you're givin absolutely no freedom whatsoever. You can't shoot when you want to, you can't move when you want to, you can't play at your own pace. You have this other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that tells you what to do and when to do it. I'm surprised the game even lets you aim.			",352,77,5,40,25,0,42

												I got this very cheap, which is great.. but unfortunately this game is pretty bad. The only things I actually enjoy are the moments when you get to find a vantage point and pick away at enemies, while adjusting for wind and gravity etc. That element is kind of fun. Pretty much everything else is not.Graphics aren't great, but I don't even care about that. The real pain in this game is movement, everything feels very clunky and slow. Apparently there are things to find, judging by achievements.. but the game seems to actively discourage you from exploring. It's so straightforward in what you have to do, and the checkpoints are either needlessly close together or stretched oddly far apart. This forces you to replay some pretty boring areas again and again if you fail. Nobody wants to crawl on their belly along one side of the map again. That's pretty much what passes for stealth in this game. It gets old fast.There is also very little variety in options and gear, it's just your rifle and pistol. You can pick up ammo (which you won't need) and medkits (which you'll rarely use - maybe more useful on hardest difficulty?), but can't pick up enemy weapons or have any real variation in your combat. If any enemy is face to face with you, you're pretty much dead in a second. You are so slow and gimped it's a bummer.Granted I'm only on Act 2, but I'm pretty much done with this game. It's just too annoying to play, and the good parts don't make up for the bad.			",129,31,1,22,9,1,12

												I got this game on sale, and must say I'm happy I did.The single player is simply okay, not the best story though. I encountered a few bugs and glitches in my one run-through of the campaign, and the game crashed once. The kind of glitches/bugs I encountered surprised me for being a finnished product: Once I got stuck between a bush and some branches which required me to load to last checkpoint, another time I got stationed with a heavy sniper rifle, but the ""professional sniper"" decided to station himself too far from the ledge, so my view was blocked by the ground I was lying on. That can prove problematic for aquiring targets as I'm sure most will understand.I haven't tested the multiplayer since there were no servers online that I could see in my browser. But it worries me that someone has managed to achieve 150k kills, with 100 % accuracy and all of the kills have been headshots (source: Scoreboards in-game). That gives me reason to believe the game is badly protected against hacking/cheating.I won't reccomend this game unless you get it on a good sale or for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is fun but purchase it if you are getting it on discount on steam as it has a lot of bugs. The bugs are funny like on one level I shot a guy but he didnt die , he started running but the eye in the sky says good kill move to the next..I am like WTF let me take him down first so I try to shoot him while he is hiding behind a crate , I see a motor boat beside him is doing loops in the sky . A flying motor boat . Lol . Oh well if you can forgive all that its not a bad game..some places the maps look really pretty like the Sarajevo map. Oh one thing though it has pretty bad save points. You will shoot through a horde of enemies thinking oh cool i am done with that then die...to start 20 minutes back.			",71,3,3,4,1,0,0

												Tool up, dumbos! Here's the deal... We're Americans, so we're the good guys. They (any other nation, but heavy accents obligatory) are clearly the bad dudes. So, camo on, scope lids up.  Let the banalities begin!Maybe I'm alone in this, but I like games to have at least made some attempt at a moral issue, where the sanctity of life presents at least a crumb of doubt in what you are doing. Shooting peoples' brains out is simply less fun when you start thinking, 'well what did he ever do to deserve that? How is it helping this imagined world if I stick an unapologetic slug through two brains at once? He's just a guard, probably on a zero hours contract, trying to get by, and I'm going to knife him in the neck. Bummer.'The other thing is, if you play a character who is already highly trained, a 'special ops' uber-killer, there's no way up from that. Gordon Freeman was a gentle scientist who expanded his skill-base. If you start at the top, where can you go, narratively speaking?Sniper Elite at least has that WW2 setting, so even though Karl Fairburne is a one-note macho dullard with all the wit and wisdom of a folding trench shovel, you still feel you're fighting evil. Anything based in the 21st Century, especially involving US forces, you feel sort of faintly sick, being part of some over-funded bullying world police.Why can't the hero be Swedish? Or from Belgium?   These problems would be solved by not being so goddam Tom Clancy about everything. Or by maybe having a level where you merely have to serve Halal lunch through the slots in the doors at Guantanamo, just for some perspective on your life choices. Instead of an end of level boss, you could meet Henry Kissinger and get lectured on why covert, illegal military operations in other peoples' countries are actually good for the world.

												1. game keeps crashing2. since i have played a lot of ArmA 2/3 i can handle bullet drop, mildots and zeroing of a scope. this game can't handle it itself. yes they have windage but every distance between 50 meters and 2'000 meters will be shot aiming within the first mildot.3. this game seems like an advancement for CoD players who don't know that bullets don't travel at lightspeed. if you're not one of those people and are coming for the sniping mechanics, don't buy this game..4. seriously ArmA is weird and clonky but the gunplay is magnificent. rather buy any of them. or try sniper elite (wich seems to use everything this game does but does the zeroing right).

I was gifted this game by a friend on steam, as he had got a code for this from somewhere. I was suprised upon starting the game at how good it was. It really is quite a fun game and the stealth concept is great. Criticisms : The campaign is quite short, I finished it in about 5 hours. I feel that there should have been more player based control, especially during the missions where you just simply pick off the targets that have been selected. Multiplayer isn't very active - I did manage to get onto one game and it was alright, but i feel the concept was not advanced enough.Your team AI not always that briliant when you are in combat (Fully detected) Came across a few problems, including what appeared to be an invisable barrier at the top of a ladder, aswell as some of the dialoge being cut off. Pros: Good graphicsRuns fine, although probably wont do great on low spec systemsImmersive campaign - Such a shame it was so short.There is a multiplayer option, so could be fun if you play with friends. The AI you play with really does make it feel so much more Co-op rather than being lonely10/10 Would reccomend when on sale.7/10 Would reccomend at current price.			",18,1,1,0,1,0,1

It has some realistic elements in it and it makes you feel like a real sniper.There are some minor bugs in the game but they are not serious.I wish there was a tutorial in the game on how to use the values in your scope  to decide where the hit indicator should be when your in expert mode. I also wish the guy you are playing would do more cardio so that he wouldnt breathe heavy when running :)Overall its a really great game and i definitly recommend playing it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why have I only played 2 hours of the game to write this review? Because with all the hand-holding and narrow pathing, I was litterally bored to tears and just started to sprint around.In those 2 hours, i was bombarded with countless pet-peeves: Obscenely narrow pathed, more narrow than the sight of your scope.Missions are all hand holding, guide you through (shoot guy A, then guy B, then guy C).AI is moronic with clusters of enemies, or rather zones where you kill everyone over by this house, then sneak through the jungle a little more, kill everyone at the next zone. AI does not communicate between zones and all AI uses their indoor voices when you've been spotted. No stealthy ""oh where'd that shot come from lets coordinate and look around, while alerting our teammates to a potential threat"", it's ""you blew your cover, we, the AI in this zone (and only this zone, never mind the guys just around the corner), know EXACTLY where you are instantly"". Zero challenge. Be it in stealth, shooting, or decision making, there's no challenge to be had. Bullet mode, randomly the game will think you've made a good shot, and will swap your view to follow the bullet and give you a close up of the crappy sprite blood splatters (the first sniper game had better effects) Plays more like a movie (or a shooter-arcade game)  than a stealth game (lots of cinematic, or scripted sequences, like melee stealth kills: ""oh let's pause your control while you watch your character do some fancy melee stealth kill for 15 seconds).  Movement is EXTREMELY clunky. Countless times when I am trying to sneak around the jungle and have gotten my toe stuck poorly formed terrain. Or press <action> to climb things, but rarely displays when you need it. ... Was this even play tested?Graphics are appalling on ultra settings, everything within the narrow path is fine but if you step an inch out of that path (and I do mean litterally on the other side of that bush, near your foot), it's N64 perfect dark- style graphics.Motion blur that can only be disabled through config file editsIf there are any redeeming factors in this game, I'd did not see enough (if any) to keep playing past the two hours I put in (3-4 missions in, POST tutorial).

Plusów według mnie jest wystarczająco dużo aby zabrać się za ten tytuł np. grywalność , dość ładna grafika, cena,  bycie snajperem,lokacje i inne. Niestety minusy są takie: gra jest bardzo liniowa , kampania jest dosyć krótka, kiepski multipalyer i panowie z City Interactive nie wycisnęli wszystkiego z silnika Cryengine 3 . Według mnie nawet te minusy nie zniszczą dobrej zabawy z gry. Jeżeli jesteś fanem serii na pewno zagrasz w tą część. Nie jest to zła gra i nie jest to najlepsza gra.Jest ona poprostu dobra. Moja ocena do gry to 6,5/10. Życzę wam miłego grania, pozdrawiam Reksiko Games !  ;)Podsumowanie  minusy:- Zepsuty Cryengine 3- Kiepski multiplayer- Krótka kampania- Liniowość   Plusy:- Samo bycie snajperem- Grywalność- Lokacje- Grafika- Cena Ocena końcowa6/10________________________________________________________________			",57,1,1,3,3,0,1

												This game is ok, if you like endless running, little to no skill required, and just a few seconds of a real sniper experience at the end of each mission. Despite my 2 hours in the game, I didn't even get through Act 1. Each mission takes about 40 minutes-1 hour. If there was more actual shooting to do, it would be better, but it is mainly run run run, take one shot, run some more, crouch and hide until this group passes, run more. You have a silenced rifle, there is no real need to try to wait for sounds to shoot due to the silencer on both your sniper rifle and your pistol. You pick up an enemy's rifle? Oh, it has a silencer too, and it is an auto-sniper. Hit boxes are insanely easy to hit. You shoot the guy in the knee? He dies and flips back 3 feet. You shoot 2 guys with 1 bullet, through one's shoulder and into the next guy's groin? Nice job, they both hit the ground silent. Sniper Elite is harder, the original one, not even counting the sequels. If you have hours to waste, and are only mediocre at the genre, get the game and give it a playthrough. If you are accustomed to bullet drop and wind having large factors, and not having a silencer at all times, then you might want to look for a different game. Whichever you choose, just remember to have fun with what you are playing. This game just wasn't fun for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a medium-good sniper game with above average graphics but also some contras which pull down the character of the game... __________________________Mentionable points+ Above average graphics+ Nice and realistic guns and shot-physics- Multiplayer works but many bugs- different guns depending on version bought__________________________Graphics - 8/10 graphics and weather, enviroment, sunset, water-reflection... all really nice made. Works good thanks cry-engine 3Sound - 7/10Sound is very nice. specially the gun sound - surround. only 7/10 because the sound sometimescrashes and you have to restart the game to get sounds and noises back (reported by several gamers). AI - 7/10The single-player AI ist also well done. Some very rare bugs / senceless movements but overall good made.Ingame enviroment possibilities - 6/10The enviroment is seems nearly most of the time just basicly done. there is no additional door to open or another path to go. no other guns or equipement to pick up. sad.complexity - 9/10The game is easy to understand and after you made a few training shots in the training mode (takes really just few minutes) you are ready for the game.Single Player - 7/10The storyline is okay. nothing with a real ""wow"" effect but also not boring.Multiplayer 4/10Well the multiplayer is really something that could have done better. First: LAN doesnt work. So no matches via LAN or Tunngle-LAN.Then there are some cheaters/wallhackers. not too many, but you will find some on the servers. the possibility to kick them from the server is weak: you can only kick them in the end of the round (for 5 seconds), and even this possibility took months until the developers involved it after huge (!) complaints in the forums.The normal internet connection game works very well and you will still find always few people online- dont be confused if you dont see servers or see very less servers online. The reason is: Full servers are NOT shown in the server list, because you cant join them anyway - Last: there are much too less maps. basicly there were 3, then there came 2 more and with the dlc another 3-4 more. but after short time, you find out that less than 10 maps is really a weak service.The rest of the MP works great. Also weapons with different characteristics (look up my guide in the SGW2 Forum) and sounds are nice.Price 3/10 Price is definetly much to high. I wouldnt pay 40 EUR again for this. The game is not that ""cheap"", but 20 EUR for this, including all dlc's would be a good deal.			",83,2,0,3,8,4,7

												I don't like making negative reviews but this game was just boring. Played for 1 hour and felt like going to sleep. Bad graphics, poor story and boring gameplay. It's completely absurd that your character runs out of breath after jogging 10 yards. I served in the Marines and I wasn't a sniper or anything special, but even I am in better shape than this. He has the endurance of an elderly smoker or a fat lazy teenager.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game plays itself, no need for a player. First let me start off by saying I got this game for $2 so I had pretty low expectations , but that being said it still managed to dissapoint. As I mentioned before there is no sense of control or choice, you simply pull the trigger when told to do so. Everything about it screams mobile game, including the graphics. That being said I would not reccomend this game to anyone even if it were a free to play, as it checks no boxes of a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game and worth the purchase if it's on offer. Would have been hard to recommend for full price.Note: I've only played single player and only on hardest difficulty.Some minor gripes but otherwise an enjoyable sniping experience.A bit too heavily scripted, forces you to play exactly as it wants you to in parts.Checkpoints are regularly prior to a long run (or long stealth section), or before cutscenes, gets tiresome on the harder difficulty.On the harder difficulty, a lot of what your allies tell you doesn't happen. Your map doesn't get updated with hostile locations, enemy snipers scopes dont flash, you can't use binoculars to update your map. Why all the voice over remains to tell you to do things you can't do is beyond me.			",148,17,3,12,9,2,30

												I got exactly what I wanted: ""first person sniping"" game with beautiful graphics, locations and of course atmosphere. You can really feel here as a sniper wandering in the darkness, hunting its targets alone or with observer who navigates you and tags enemies in order of efficiency. The plot was fine for me (although it could have been longer); it had plot twists or stories that quite intriguied me and fitted to beautiful locations mentioned by me earlier. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 of course has some cons, like minor technical or graphical bugs, but they definitely don't make the experience you get any lower. It'd be awesome if our hero could pick up some carabines or different pistols, because there is not huge choice among pistols or not-sniper rifle weapons.In conclusion, I recommend Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. I really had a lot of fun with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												wow, most reviewers were a bit pretentious and wrong about this fine game. I think the issue of it coming from underdog team CI unfairly tarnished it before it even came out. A prime example of a plucky and talented development team working their socks off to produce a really solid, fun and playable game and then being hung out to dry by frankly lazy reviewers giving a clearly 7/8 out of ten game way less than it's worth.... sure it's not very open, largely over scripted, rough in places in regards textures and blocky assets and the checkpoint system needs work but hell i had more fun in this game regardless than with any call of duty or battlefield game and i'm no hater of those either. As of today, reviewers go f&%k yourselves and review that instead. Glad to see the public appreciate it with a current 'mostly positive' review. Quality wins out in the end.			",448,83,34,33,21,5,43

												Decent game when on sale. Constant 60fps with high settings and never crashed. Storyline was amusingly shallow but otherwise fun to play, and the mechanics, although a little clunky, are enough to keep playing. The pistol in particular was really satisfying because it was a one-shot kill on any enemy. Levels are very linear and that was fine. Also, the multiplayer wasn't really that fun but its not a deal-breaker. Good game.			",68,5,1,4,4,1,2

												The game itself is absolutely great. I really enjoy this type of thing, the whole stealthy sniper type game and I'd give it a solid 9/10 for the actual gameplay, but ever since I bought this game, all I've had is problems. The first time I start it, I have to reload the game 5 times to actually get it to work as it either froze or just had 0 responce during a mission, and now I've played a few hours through the campaign, there's absolutely no sound except for cinematics. I mean, either I've got corrupt game files (possiblly) or something about the game is just not right. I would not recommend buying on the sole purpose that it has a lot of running problems.

												This game had Super potentiel. Theres a lot of gorgeos level design, many nice details and of course sniping. However, if you play on any but the hardest diffultcy theres a lot of help- too much with a small red circle revealing bullet impact, and threat indicators. The stealth mecanics suck- if you sneak when you should shoot you basicly loose. The game has A LOT of scriptet content and FAR FAR too much rushing about. The first game did way better in allowing you time to paciently pick off targets. In this game you only get to engage fairly few at the time and they are always bunched up. Theres far too much running behing some NPC and rushing through pretty levels with only ever ONE path. I had high hopes, but they were quickly dashed. Go for Sniper elite 3 for a better sniper game.The total lack of custemisation of guns, bullet grain and no time or good tools to really calculate windtage or bullet drop ..well sigh.Last but not least I compelated this game on hard in just 5.1 hours - far to quickly for a sniper game.Get this on sale if you like the ""action sniper"" genre.

												Rubbish. I thought it'd be ok, an improvement on the original. But it's not, it's utter crap, and it is definitely not worth a single dollar. Buy ""Sniper Elite 3"" instead.Here's a list of why you shouldn't buy this:-Ugly as sin. The effects suck, and the textures are repetitive. -Feels awful. You'll think the game is lagging. No, that's the movement speed, the laggy mouse input.-Worst of the Call of Duty clones. You'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pseudo military dialogue, walk from location to location. Just running down corridors. Then shoot some enemies with♥♥♥♥♥♥AI, but they're not even interesting or convincingly bad, they're just poorly pathed, stand still.-Enemies can however see through foliage, which sucks.-Stealth system relies on hiding in foliage and hoping the enemies will pretend you're not there. -Checkpoints are miles apart. -Slow mow kills aren't even nice to look at, come on, it's Cryengine, you can do better.-You won't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the story.-Encounters are boring.-Enemies will psychically know their mate is dead.-The bullets do NOT use a proper physics object, which means that leading targets can be useless.Basically, there is one reason you want to play this. Long range sniping of enemies running from place to place with the killcam, and decent spatter effects, and entertaining locales. Instead, you have protracted ""stealth"" sections which fail to do the All Ghillied up bit, they're slow, they're boring, you have no real creativity, and it's linear and again, boring as hell. This is most of the game. You could cut it and it would be better.Most of the levels are clearly unfinished, you'll blast the couple of lazy enemies in a second, and you'll run on to the next area, it's rubbish. You'll get to a location for a proper bit of shooting, then back to square one. And the rego will still suck and you'll feel like you have cancer using it.Don't pick this one up. Pick up ""Sniper Elite 3"" instead, it's not a perfect game, but it's better than this.			",265,19,1,14,12,0,19

												Generally, i enjoyed this game.Pros:- Nice graphics- Runs well on older PCs (e.g. with Win XP and 3 GB RAM only)- Very ease on the lowest difficulty setting (didn't have played on the higher levels as a play for relaxing and not for challenging)- Athmosphere (especially in the last chapter)- Slow pace (unlike the run-and-gun Call of Duty games)- Good simulation of ballistics and wind- High tension- No machinegun sections like in the first Sniper Ghost Warrior game- No complete auto heal systemCons:- No free saving and amount of checkpoints is too low, so sometimes you loose a lot of progress when you die- Horrible quality of ingame video sequences, they look like they are taken from a Playstation 1 game- No free weapon selection in single player- Short for the high price (6 hours on lowest difficulty without looking for secrects)- Multiplayer boring (well, camping in MP is annoying, but a sniper is usually camping in order to wait for enemys ...)- No Xray Cam like in Sniper Elite			",35,2,2,3,1,0,1

												tl,dr: Shooting feels good, but the other gameplay elements are♥♥♥♥♥♥and the game is buggy and inconsistent.So I kind of liked the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior, the only bad taste I remember was the ending which was a little underwhelming, gameplay wise.I am strictly going to talk about gameplay because the story is just some Modern Military shooter garbage.The actual shooting is alright, the pistol (your secondary is able to kill in one shot, unless you are in combat then it sometiems takes two) and the sniper's rifle oneshots aswell, unless you shoot people in their hands. It feels pretty good to line up a shot with a decent range and some wind and just place a bullet in centermass.However, the game is quite buggy and the checkpoints are odd and inconsistent.In one of the earlier missions you are placed in a high advantage point with a very high powered sniper's rifle like a .50 cal or something. Not only do people not hear the shots even though it is only 300 meters away, but I was actually placed slightly below the surface on which I was supposed to lie on.The stealth is weird and inconsistent sometimes you can just hide in some slightly shadowy area and you are completely invisible to the enemy whereas other times they can see through planks and bushes. It may have something to do with playing on the hardest difficulty I am not entirely sure.The point that made me uninstall the game, was when I was supposed to shoot a pilot (inside a helicopter) from a decent  range and good amount of wind, but I only had like 4 seconds to do so giving me time for like 2 or 3 shots. I failed and had to do a bunch of stuff again, failed again and now the checkpoint was right next to the pilot-sniping, however I had no weapon so I couldn't even try it.			",217,9,1,23,16,0,31

												I avoided this game for some time because of the poor early review scores.  I can't comment on whether the inital reviews were justified or the extent of any bugs which were subsequently fixed.  What I can say is that this is not a bad game.  I've played through the single-player campaign (about 7 hours) and the Siberian Strike DLC (about 2.5 hours) and had a fair amount of fun doing it.  Overall, I thought it offered a nice, if over the top, narrative and reasonable stealth / sniper mechanics.  Much of the criticism of the game centers on its linear nature.  On that count, it's guilty as charged.  You will never confuse this game with Far Cry 3 in terms of open world mechanics.  That said, there are plenty of games that offer a fun experience in a linear fashion.  While the encounters are essentially all set-piece they are nicely designed.  I'm still not sure what the campaign was doing in Tibet, but it was terrifically rendered.I'd define the highs and lows as follows:Highs:Solid graphics (better than average PC options for a port)Good sniper gameplayReasonable level of player decisioning (no penalties if you decide to alert the enemy rather than being stealthy)Logical controlsGood range of difficulty levelsEssentially bug-free as far as I could tellLows:A little shortA wonky checkpoint or two (nothing game breaking)Occasional unaware enemies (walking past bodies with no reaction)Overall, I had a good time playing through the campaign and DLC and will probably do so again.  If you are looking for a sniper game specifically, I would probably recommended Sniper Elite: V2 over this one but only by a small margin.  If you catch this one on a periodic Steam sale for less than $10, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up along with the Siberian Strike DLC. ",388,99,26,75,74,1,71

												Hand holding: The Video Game. Really glad I refunded it.It's a point and click game. You're at the whim of your 'spotter' as you have to wait around until he gives you the word to shoot. After that you point, click, enemy down. Rinse and repeat.The game performs awfully despite my counter saying it's at 150+ frames, it feels more like 30. The game looks nothing like the screenshots provided. Lighting and textures are worse than Crysis, and this game runs on a newer version of Cryengine!!It also crashes in the same damn spot over and over, hence the refund. You can grab Sniper Elite 3 for dirt cheap alongside it's DLC and Sniper Elite 4 just came out. Just saying...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 had very good sniping segments at the start of this 12 hour first person shooter, however the rest of the game is filled with close-quarters pistol combat wich is very inconsistant because of the extremely unrealistic pistol mechanics. There are absolutely no ways to pick up an assault rifle and to rather use that.The CGI cutscenes are absolutely unnesessary and doesn't even look that good.The game looks quite impressive running on CryEngine 3 and the optimization is on point. The story isn't very interesting and didn't motivate me to go on.I haven't played the multiplayer because i've heard from friends (that have alot of expierience with the FPS genre) that the multiplayer is boring and uninteresting. Simply put, I would not recommend buying this game because of the countless other FPS games that provide a better expierience.If you want a better sniping expierience then buy Sniper Elite 3 or 4.... because number 4 is out in case you don't know.

												BUGGY!!!!! I have to say I'm SO TIRED of having to say this about games. Sniper 2 is yet another game that has a lot of potential but its let down by technical problems.From the get go I had to solve graphical issues. Having done that I did enjoy a couple of reasonable hours of play before issues started showing up. Specifically:(1) Jumping sights. An infrequent problem that appears and is not solved by kneeling or going prone. (2)The disappearing red dot. Even when on target the red dot designed to guide your shots is not always present making sniping a guessing game.(3)Shooting on target enemies and not having them die. The scene where you engage with Marinov's snipers and men from a derlict building is particularly bad. I have to wonder if this game was beta tested before release? These are not small issues. Suffice to say this will be my first and last purchse from this franchise. I believe a thrid game is on the way soon? If its anything like this one they can keep it.			",17,0,0,1,1,0,1

												While sniper games arn't really my cup of tea too often, I will still keep an open mind with this review. I've played through the storyline, and TBH, it is actually quite fun at some parts. The game can get stale at some missions and the gameplay does get a bit repetitive; but if you are going for a really nicely made sniping game, give this one a try. The mechanics in this game are so realistic compared to some other games out there (*cough* cod) and the multiplayer is a blast. There really isn't too much to say about this game other than this; If you don't like sniper games, this game wont be any better for you, but if you do like sniper games as a genre, than go ahead and give this a buy. 7.5/10			",55,5,0,5,4,1,8

												Just started to play. Selected medium difficulty and game is very, very heavily scripted. By ""scripted"" I mean the game tells you where to look, what to shoot at. It even goes up to locking your view so you cannot stray aside too much when aiming or using binnoculars. I hope on maximum difficulty this is not present, because it's so scripted it's starting to disgust me. Graphics are okay, since it's Crytech engine. Tried on both an old and more powerful PC, and it works nicely on the old PC. Voice acting is good, sniper support role is not bad, but the amount of scripting and linear action is very heavy. Unless MP is good, I dont really see much replayability on this game.If you come from harder sniper games like the Sniper Elites series, this games adds a more modern view of sniping but you _must_ play on hardest difficulty level. Otherwise, it feels way too scripted, with almost no choice of targets and how you approach them. On maximum difficulty level, it's ok.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. This game is just horrible. The story is bland cut and paste junk, but that's pretty much every war game, so that alone would be forgivable. The real problem is the graphics and the horrific glitchiness that arises from them. I have a nearly brand new top of the line graphics card and when I do several ridiculous option changes to stop the most game breaking bugs, the game bogs down to a measly 10=15 fps immediately if its anything higher than the lowest graphics setting. Go buy sniper elite instead of wasting your money here, its a much, MUCH better sniper simulator.			",90,7,7,18,6,1,10

												Where to start. This game is a great example that amazing engine and technology does not make game great. CryEngine 3 maybe good looking, specially during Act III in the game but sometimes it's just weak and I couldn't see the difference between CE3 and, for example, Unreal Engine 3. About the game, it's nothing that stunned me, it's a solid, sniper game. In my opinion, it's not as good as Sniper Elite series, specially the first one but it's okay. On hard difficulty level it can be entertaining on some levels, but I really suggest you to play Siberian Strike DLC, it gives more ""open"" gameplay.			",572,113,49,72,43,5,96

												Dispite the harsh critics I tried this game. People were complaining about the graphics. I got to say I like the graphics in this game. Perhaps they haven't maxed all out but the gameplay is what counts for me so It's good enough. The sounds and music fits the game. I love sniping and being a marksman in first person shooter games. This game has it all. Slow pace stealthy gameplay is what I love doing. This game simulated a ""sniper team"" with a spotter and a sniper. The weapons caches are all focused on sniper rifles. There are a few sniper rifles to choose from and there is just a limited number of rifles to choose from.  There is a simple story but that is not why I bought this game in the first place. If I want a good story there are multiple quantity of books and movies that suit my needs for that. The maps in the campaigne seem a little linear compared to for instance roleplaying games. But remember this game has been made with a far less budget then for instance ""the big"" companies like EA (of the blockbuster Battlefield games) or Activision (Of the blockbuster Call Of Duty games) can use. You will still get a few hours of insteresting piece of action with this game. If you are into the sniping gameplay this is a must have. If you want to have a game simular to the blockbuster games you should stay away from it. I have it and enjoy it.			",234,2,7,4,27,0,42

												TL;DR It's broken, don't buy it. A friend bought me this on the Christmas Sale, it really wasn't expensive, after installing it in the New Year and playing the starting mission, I learnt why. For some reason the sound cuts out during the briefing. I spent around an hour trying to fix the sound problem, as I like sniper games (even linear ones) and it looks good, I even played through the first mission with no sound whatsoever, to see if it was that mission that was bugged, but it's not. Couldn't find a fix, tried about 6 different ways, even resorted to the old compatibility and run as admin, no sound. Stay away from this game I have to say.			",83,4,0,8,8,0,12

												Sweet game! Definitely a slower pace than the faster FPS games. Basically, two main sides and you snipe back and forth. However, in the middle of the map, there is a tiny bridge you can cross to get to the other side and pull out your supressor to take people out up close. It was my first time playing tonight and it was a lot of fun, but the only server banned me (JDW14) because I was creeping behind enemy lines and pwned big time. Sneaking behind is a huge part of the game. Very lame that JDW14 was such a poor sport and banned me from his server after my very first two rounds of playing the game ever. Apart from this, great game, but not many servers.			",7,0,0,0,0,0,1

												from all the other reviews, i started playing this game thinking it wouldnt be that good! however, it proved me wrong!! This is an FPS, but unlike most FPSs, this one is a slow paced one. You are a sniper, and have to be very stealthy. of course you have to follow comands, but still i find this game amazing! it has beautiful graphics, the controls are very easy, although the jump could be a little better..up until now im enjoying the story, the voice actors, and souundtracks. the multiplayer is really fun, however there is only one server with about 8 people online! it would be great to see many more people, and more servers.All in all, i think this game is really good, however, i can see why many people dislike it (the fact that it is a slow paced fps)I would rate 75/100			",57,6,2,3,3,2,5

												Surprisingly good. Although a short game (only three mission arcs that are all relatively quick), it does provide what's written on the box - A game focussed around being a sniper. It has a good mix of sneaking and shooting, and the levels where you don't have a spotter are suitably challenging. Playing it on anything less than Expert is a waste, since the bullet impact indicator makes long range sniping far too easy. Pulling off a 1,400 metre headshot on Expert mode is, however, suitably satisfying.The graphics are absolutely astounding. The third mission arc is set in a Nepalese monastery, and the scenery looks straight out of a travel book. That said, I'd not expect anything short of gorgeous on the Crysis 2 engine.

												Solid sniping mechanics and great graphics brought down by bland protagonists and an extremely linear experience.  You play as several different characters and use a variety of rifles, but there was no difference between any of them (well, OK, the rifles each held a different number of bullets.  Which is at least more variety than the main characters had to tell them apart.)With a few exceptions, every mission has you being led by an AI spotter who will tell you when/where to move and when/whom to shoot.  Fall behind and the spotter will yell at you to catch up, speed ahead and the game will stonewall you.  Either with a dead end where you can only proceed once your spotter catches up and tells you what door to open (yes, really), all enemies suddenly on high alert (even if you're in the same place your spotter would tell you to stand 3 seconds later), or a straight up ""mission failed for no reason"" screen.Shooting targets out of order would have a similar effect.  All enemies would suddenly go on high alert (even when shooting lone targets out of sight of anyone else) or enemies would be straight up invulnerable until you went back and shot everyone in the order the game wanted you to.The few sections where you are separated from your spotter really show how much this game could have shined as a stealth-sniping-action-shooter hybrid.  There's one part where your spotter gets captured and you set off alone to rescue him.  You run through several arenas where you can engage multiple enemies at your own pace.  It really really underscored how good the game could have been, if only they'd given the player some freedom.Ultimately, there is too little player input required and the game is too linear to recommend to anyone outside of the ""sniping mechanics in a rail shooter"" niche.Disclaimer:  My only play through was on Medium difficulty and I did not try the multiplayer.

												Fun game but very short. Would recommend on sale price. Not very difficult, you just need to learn to be paitent. Your spotter is really useless. Been killed plenty of times as enemies approach your position. Limited ways of tackling mission targets. The out of bounds area is too close. Wanted to try flanking shots at times and would be stopped. Slightly above average game. Only because there are very few sniper games out there. Sniper Elite is much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reviewers said that missions are monotonous, repeating the same chain of actions again and again; that is true. They said it gives no freedom of action, like in corridor-type shooter; that is true. They said that singleplayer campaign is short; that is true. Well, maybe that's authentic sniping experience, I do not really know; but my recommendation is: if you are looking for a high-end man-hunting shooter, buy Crysis and play it as a stealth action. I dare say - the game is trivial; I've just finished it, and I'm not excited at all.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												This game is bugged as hell and even tho i enjoyed playing it because of how satisfying shooting on hard difficulty is I just can't play forward because in one of the missions (act III) after death i am respawning without weapon in the mission where you are supposed to take down helicopter before it blows you out. Before that i was able to stuck on few occasions where my character just stuck between models and i couldn't get out which meant restarting from checkpoint, also in one of the missions where you are supposed to counter snipe some bad guys i almost rage quit - i was keep dying to one of the snipers since i couldn't find where he was shooting from - I just sacrificed myself by going to the window to see where the shoot is going from and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was far away behind the wall wallbanging me with 100% accuracy. Other than that there was many little bugs that even tho not game braking shouldn't be there.Oh yeah - I almost forgot to mention crashes - yes, i had a lot of them...The only good thing i can tell about this game is that its shooting mechanics are really satisfying, but other than that it's just lower than average very, very linear fps shooter with boring story and I just Can't recommend it to anybody.

												For me really entertaining game. Nice graphic (CryEngine 3), but textures and shadows are overdate, good optimization and gameplay. Game is a lot of better than Sniper Ghost Warrior 1. Developers doesn't have budget like Call of Duty or Battlefield, but game is cheaper. Easy, linear, but entertaining. For me 81/100.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The amount of hours I have is the amount of gameplay that is in this game (3 hours), I did skip all of the cut scenes in the game and I was playing on the lowest difficulty. Mostly this game is you running around with your spotter while he holds your hand and spots out all of the targets for you. Now I don't know if it's different on the other difficulties. The graphics are nice and are good for the time that it came out but now adays it does show its age. I wish they added more weapons for the player to have, the game is 95% using your sniper rifle and the other 5% using your pistol. Now it is a sniper game, but you only use 4 sniper rifles that are availible throughout the whole game. I've tried playing multiplayer but couldn't find a game within 8 mins. So it's obviously a dead game with mulitplayer... buy this game if it comes on sale, don't spend it for the original price. This game gets a 6.5/10 for me.			",47,0,1,3,1,0,0

												Booring game!  Better graphics that the first Ghost Warrior but that's about it.  Extremely linear, being directed from spot to the...yawn....next.  A little less linear that the first one but you are still being funnelled in one direction.  When aiming the Sniper rifle moves around so much (even with holding your breath) that it almost seems like your character has Parkinson or some other degenerating motor skill disease.  I've got a digital camera with a 35mm telephoto lens that I can hold steadier than the character can.  Regardless the game was repetitive and plain boring with a minimal story similar to the first Ghost Warrior that really didn’t matter.  The voice acting was mediocre also.  As with the first Ghost Warrior they did little with the background scenery.  I always try to explore the background in games and particular this game because you can tell that a lot of time was put into creating the good-looking jungle backgrounds.  However, even the buildings in this game were basically just boxes as they had very little inside them.  In most shooter games you would explore everything looking for loot, ammo or whatever was available in that particular game.  In this game there was little reason to explore as there was not much to find, the odd ammo here and there and the odd Health pack and some in game items.  I never came close to running out of ammo and didn't have to worry too much about my health.  The AI is pretty blind as you snipe an enemy next to another one and he doesn't notice.  For the most part I found this game way to boring and would snipe enemies to make them come to me so I could have a gun battle.  I also notice that in some in some situations that if you didn’t snipe the enemies in the order that the game wanted your compatriots on the ground somehow ended up getting compromised and you had repeat that scenario.  I also got stuck in a couple of places and had to restart that section.  That's the problem when creating linear, corridor shooter game with great backgrounds that aren't exploitable.  At one point I got stuck between the side of a building and a fence that I probably wasn't supposed to be able to explore and therefore could not get out and had to restart that section.Like the first Ghost Warrior couldn't finish it because I got bored with the linear gameplay, invisible walls and the very limited exploration of the environment usually necessary in most other FPS games.   Similar to the first Ghost Warrior I would give the graphics a 4/5 because you can tell that the artists put a lot of work into creating the jungle and other backgrounds.  It’s a pity they weren't better utilized.As for its boring and excruciating linearity gameplay I would give it 2/5.  Thank goodness I got both Ghost Warrior games on a Steam sale so I don’t feel so bad not finishing them.  That’s one of the better things about Steam; wait long enough for a really good game sale and if you didn’t like the game it’s not that big of a loss. ",46,1,1,0,1,0,2

												CI Games are amazing. This studio deserves way more recognition than it has. Hopefully Ghost Warrior 3, with its AAA billing, will help there.As for this game, great single player campaign. It's linear and that's great, I like that for single player shooters. Gorgeous graphics, very pretty. Good voice acting like in all CI games I've seen. Pretty good range of sniper rifles and a pistol for the short range. Has a detection system similar to Assassins Creed, so can be played very stealthily or openly aggressive. Story is very interesting, and the Serbian enemies in Act 2 are a breath of fresh air... but of course it has Russians and Jihadists too :) 10/10 from me, and very much looking forward to Ghost Warrior 3.

												Un FPS en primera persona de acción y sigilo, que metiendote en la piel de un francotirador, en mi opinión, está más cerca de lo arcade y ""fácil de digerir"" que de la simulación y fidelidad, Si has jugado a Call of Duty, es como si todas las misiones fueran del estilo de las de infiltración, observación y eliminación de dos operadores infiltrados, un francotirador y su observador.En máxima dificultad y sin haberlo jugado antes, ni a su predecesor, me han enganchado y se me han pasado volando, lo he jugado ""del tirón"". Lo recomiendo aunque no seas amante del género de los juegos basados en sigilo, es entretenido, rápido, ""fácil de digerir"" para su género y se aleja de los FPS de gatillo fácil.

												Fun game but very short. Would recommend on sale price. Not very difficult, you just need to learn to be paitent. Your spotter is really useless. Been killed plenty of times as enemies approach your position. Limited ways of tackling mission targets. The out of bounds area is too close. Wanted to try flanking shots at times and would be stopped. Slightly above average game. Only because there are very few sniper games out there. Sniper Elite is much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reviewers said that missions are monotonous, repeating the same chain of actions again and again; that is true. They said it gives no freedom of action, like in corridor-type shooter; that is true. They said that singleplayer campaign is short; that is true. Well, maybe that's authentic sniping experience, I do not really know; but my recommendation is: if you are looking for a high-end man-hunting shooter, buy Crysis and play it as a stealth action. I dare say - the game is trivial; I've just finished it, and I'm not excited at all.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												STAY AWAY from this game. You may expect a clone of FarCry or Crysis but this one looks like one of the Delta Force series but feels older. Gameplay is totally about pushing buttons only when told to. Railroad gameplay! You cannot do anything but what the game wants you to do at a given time. Stealth missions at night are kind of dark even with night vision goggles.So, I give it 2 out of 10. Wasted money.			",113,5,3,19,10,0,17

The graphics are nice and are good for the time that it came out but now adays it does show its age. I wish they added more weapons for the player to have, the game is 95% using your sniper rifle and the other 5% using your pistol. Now it is a sniper game, but you only use 4 sniper rifles that are availible throughout the whole game. I've tried playing multiplayer but couldn't find a game within 8 mins. So it's obviously a dead game with mulitplayer... buy this game if it comes on sale, don't spend it for the original price. This game gets a 6.5/10 for me.			",47,0,1,3,1,0,0

												If you're into stealth and sniping, this is definitely the game for you. Good/great graphics, good game play, and in a sense teaches you about how a sharp shooter does it in real life. With ballistics etc. All in all a good game!			",104,5,4,7,23,0,11

												First things first, I bought this game solely for the multiplayer.This game is a great improvement over the first, but my singleplayer experience was ruined by various bugs and glitches.They started off small in the beginning of the game, small graphics glitches, floating objects, getting stuck on terrain, etc.Near the end of the game I ran into something awful. The game literally crashed my computer during one of the cutscenes. My pc can max this game without breaking a sweat, and this wasn't a crash to desktop, the computer completely turned off. When I powered back up my save file was corrupt. This is why I haven't even finished the single player yet, even though it is so short.Was I devasted? Not really, multiplayer was unaffected in any way. The multiplayer experience in Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is an enjoyable one, if you enjoy sniping. Matches are around 20 minutes long and often never score higher than 15 or so kills. The sniping mechanics are really great in this game.Pros+Good mechanics+AR/SMG sections of first game are gone+Multiplayer is fun+Environments are very nice lookingCons-Poor story-Very buggy-Lack of a multiplayer community, theres hardly ever more than one server-Crashes for unknown reasons-Character models look horrendousAs I bought this game for the multiplayer, I would reccomend the multiplayer portion to a friend. As far as the single player experience goes, try out any of the Sniper Elite titles.			",64,5,0,13,3,0,6

												Review: Este juego es un First Person Shooter, Principalmente controlando un rifle de Francotirador (Obviamente ya se han dado cuenta por el titulo) No es un juego con demasiadas variantes, se ponen aprueba tus reflejos, punteria e incluso la inteligencia. La campaña deja algo que desear, pero la verdad si me dan la opción de comprarlo o no, lo compraria sin lugar a duda. En fin, Para los amantes de estos modo de juegos es super recomendable. Esperero que te haya servido mi análisis.			",109,20,2,9,7,3,5

												Review: Este juego es un First Person Shooter, Principalmente controlando un rifle de Francotirador (Obviamente ya se han dado cuenta por el titulo) No es un juego con demasiadas variantes, se ponen aprueba tus reflejos, punteria e incluso la inteligencia. La campaña deja algo que desear, pero la verdad si me dan la opción de comprarlo o no, lo compraria sin lugar a duda. En fin, Para los amantes de estos modo de juegos es super recomendable. Esperero que te haya servido mi análisis.			",109,20,2,9,7,3,5

												Booring game!  Better graphics that the first Ghost Warrior but that's about it.  Extremely linear, being directed from spot to the...yawn....next.  A little less linear that the first one but you are still being funnelled in one direction.  When aiming the Sniper rifle moves around so much (even with holding your breath) that it almost seems like your character has Parkinson or some other degenerating motor skill disease.  I've got a digital camera with a 35mm telephoto lens that I can hold steadier than the character can.  Regardless the game was repetitive and plain boring with a minimal story similar to the first Ghost Warrior that really didn’t matter.  The voice acting was mediocre also.  As with the first Ghost Warrior they did little with the background scenery.  I always try to explore the background in games and particular this game because you can tell that a lot of time was put into creating the good-looking jungle backgrounds.  However, even the buildings in this game were basically just boxes as they had very little inside them.  In most shooter games you would explore everything looking for loot, ammo or whatever was available in that particular game.  In this game there was little reason to explore as there was not much to find, the odd ammo here and there and the odd Health pack and some in game items.  I never came close to running out of ammo and didn't have to worry too much about my health.  The AI is pretty blind as you snipe an enemy next to another one and he doesn't notice.  For the most part I found this game way to boring and would snipe enemies to make them come to me so I could have a gun battle.  I also notice that in some in some situations that if you didn’t snipe the enemies in the order that the game wanted your compatriots on the ground somehow ended up getting compromised and you had repeat that scenario.  I also got stuck in a couple of places and had to restart that section.  That's the problem when creating linear, corridor shooter game with great backgrounds that aren't exploitable.  At one point I got stuck between the side of a building and a fence that I probably wasn't supposed to be able to explore and therefore could not get out and had to restart that section.Like the first Ghost Warrior couldn't finish it because I got bored with the linear gameplay, invisible walls and the very limited exploration of the environment usually necessary in most other FPS games.   Similar to the first Ghost Warrior I would give the graphics a 4/5 because you can tell that the artists put a lot of work into creating the jungle and other backgrounds.  It’s a pity they weren't better utilized.As for its boring and excruciating linearity gameplay I would give it 2/5.  Thank goodness I got both Ghost Warrior games on a Steam sale so I don’t feel so bad not finishing them.  That’s one of the better things about Steam; wait long enough for a really good game sale and if you didn’t like the game it’s not that big of a loss. ",46,1,1,0,1,0,2

Ufak ayrıntılar çok düşünülmemiş. Mesela bomba kurma efekti gibi. Genel olarak hikaye çok abartılı. Tek başına gidip ortalığın amına koyuyosun ama oyun yani deyip geçebilirsin.

												Right, I may not have the best of computers, but even on the lowest settings, the game still looks nice, but is running AT 20 FPS. I mean, I know the game is trying to look nice for a non-triple A game, but come on. Also, the friendly AI (Atleast from the starting mission) moves painfully slow and stops every 3 seconds if you are walking, making for a really boring combo. The enemy AI is no better, they look around the general area you are coincidentally and some how make out (Even though you are wearing a stealth outfit in folliage) where EXACTLY you are. I played this game for the first hour and got extremely tired of it due to these reasons. I do NOT reccomend this game in any shape or form, unless you enjoy moving too slowly and pretty graphics.

												You are a sniper in tight linear corridors with barely no health and absolutely no freedom. The game is holding your hand the entire trip. They say its a tactical shooter but there is no tactics involved because there is only one way you can confront the enemies. Its also very scripted, the enemies have no free will unless you raise their awareness.For a cryengine game the graphics is terrible. Its even worse than Ghost Warrior 1. You cant pick weapons or play around with them before entering a mission which is a shame, they didnt improve from Ghost Warrior 1 at all. Its very boring because there are only a fiew good sniping opportunities in the game, the rest is bushsneaking in tight corridors. The autosave system is bad too. If you die, (you will die fast) you have to do the same boring, scripted scenario again which will involve waiting, waiting and more waiting.			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

They just forgot to put any effort in the shooitn effects with the pistol becuase the pistol does the same amount if not more damage than any rifle in the game so there is almost no point in using the rifle. The develeper for this game have absultly no idea what they are doing and should find a new career in any oither field.

												Most broken and poorly written game I've ever played. There's so many things wrong with this game, I don't even know where to start. The game is more linear than the first Super Mario. Even on the hardest settings, this game takes your hand and walks you through the game, points out where most of the enemies are and there's even a radar system with a timer that tells you for how long you can be visible (almost in plain sight) to the enemy before he discovers you. Furthermore, the AI is non-existent and the enemies will often stand idle like nothing happened (despite you just killed several people in their vicinity) and wait for you to kill them. The story is very predictable all the way through and all the ""surprises"" in the story is not really surprising at all.Slight spoiler alert:I came to a point late in the game (act III, bad karma) where I am, after a cut scene, suddenly left without any weapons (which I just had before the cut scene), and I'm supposed to shoot down a helicopter within 5 seconds (which is kinda hard with no weapons.) I searched all over the area (it's a small area) and no weapons are to be found anywhere. So I guess my journey with this game ends here. I am unable to finish the story, which just adds to the disappointment this entire game experience has been.No price is low enough to make this game worthwhile your time. Go throw rocks in the nearest lake instead, that's gonna bring you much more entertainment than this game.			",65,12,3,3,1,0,2

												Back pain finally settled down, only to then be revamped by the stress that this game causes me having a v-sync option that doesn't work.Skyrocketting my fps so high up to a point where my freaking graphics card coil whines, then luckily the framerate lowers in-game (as it should) but tearing is clearly noticeable, my alternative would be to enable vsync in the nvidia control panel in order to stop tearing and mantain the framerate at a stable level.But i'm stubborn like that, Why should I enable vsync in control panel simply because this game vsync option is broken?No...That's not something I can recommend.I mean the game is really not bad, it's kinda of a decent game, I frankly bought it because I have some nice memories of me playing the xbox 360 version of the game, but this port is just not that good to be honest. Think of it as a game that took some nice cues from other games, and simply produced something of a ""popcorn game"" to play from time to time just to have a little bit of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst fricking game of all time, DO NOT BUY, SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY and IGNORE. It has terrible performance, and a cruddy multiplayer. Can't even switch your pistol for an assault rifle, just in case! Also, the guy must wear like a frickin t-shirt because you die in like 1 hit, even on full health. The companion's AI is terrible, they do literally nothing for the player, or the game. The most common companion I've seen is Diaz and he gets an assault rifle, but goes for the least threatening guy when your cought. Checkpoints are few and far between at points where they are the most necessary, but every other hallway you encounter in the least necessary situations. You will find that even though your guy is a sniper and must have a strong arm, you cannot hold your rifle still even while crouching, which is when you are generally using it, and going prone generally leads to a tiny ledge in the way from bad level design, so you have to crouch and end up missing. I found myself often missing an easy target because a wooden plank is preventing me from going prone to be steadier. The graphics are acceptible, and in fact probably better than Call of Duty, and it has an interesting story, with a great sense of actually sniping, except for the stability. The best part is how your bullet drops with distance and is very affected by the wind, though I wish the little circle showing where the bullet will land would always be visible, as I often find myself looking around a target trying to find the dot. I've had frequent crashes, once caausing my entire computer to crash, so that is upsetting. Then after restarting your computer / the game, you need to sit through 4 different company thingies that you get at the beginning of most games that tell you who sponsored / help made the game and what engine it runs which are all unskippable. If they were skippable or only one or two, it would be OK, but there's four. FOUR! Thats over 20 seconds just waiting to get to the main menu!!! UNACCEPTABLE! So, to recap, I buy a game, have it not work, and have a serious game breaking graphical bug that gets fixed (without changing a thing) a few days later, only to have it crash, then sit through the company ad things all over again. I bought this game in the Bundle Stars Sniper Ghost Warrior Pack for $2.99, and now I know why it was priced that way. I can't believe they make you pay extra for DLC for one of the worst multiplayers ever!! 2 out of 10 stars.			",69,13,3,14,14,0,7

												Single player game fun and semi-short 4-5h on normal mode. I liked it alot.what comes to multiplayer, its prolly the cancer. played 5 minutes and saw 2 different hackers on the enemyteam, one flying around, second was running too fast to be able to shoot him. I dont really suggest this for multiplayer at all. seemed like a cancer.			",45,2,0,3,5,0,1

												Sniper Ghost Warrior 1 is so much more fun then Ghost Warrior 2. In Ghost Warrior 2. Im just simply following instructions. When and where to run. When and who to shoot. I have to make alot more decisions in Sniper Ghost Warrior. But overall its still an enjoyable game.			",164,11,0,21,7,1,12

												Back pain finally settled down, only to then be revamped by the stress that this game causes me having a v-sync option that doesn't work.Skyrocketting my fps so high up to a point where my freaking graphics card coil whines, then luckily the framerate lowers in-game (as it should) but tearing is clearly noticeable, my alternative would be to enable vsync in the nvidia control panel in order to stop tearing and mantain the framerate at a stable level.But i'm stubborn like that, Why should I enable vsync in control panel simply because this game vsync option is broken?No...That's not something I can recommend.I mean the game is really not bad, it's kinda of a decent game, I frankly bought it because I have some nice memories of me playing the xbox 360 version of the game, but this port is just not that good to be honest. Think of it as a game that took some nice cues from other games, and simply produced something of a ""popcorn game"" to play from time to time just to have a little bit of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Couldn't drag bodies, and everything was mandatory as in you HAD to kill this guy first (Atleast at the beginning)   I'd say it might've been worth 4$ for the bundle I bought when it was on sale, but I'mma refund it anyway.   After all I can always play Ghost Recon: Future Soldier that has a lot more elements than this.			",55,13,0,9,12,0,8

												One of the best sniping experience in gaming. Multiplayer is a lot of fun also. Too bad it got underrated by people who wanted a open world sandbox game instead of a scripted mission type of game. For best experience go on hardest settings and try to avoid getting detected at all costs. If you want to perform as a ghost sniper, you will feel rewarded. If you try to shoot your way through with several reloads of the game, i am not saying you will not succeed, you will just miss the whole experience. Enjoy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awful game, first off it doesn't load properly, you need to remove files in order to even get the game to load.  Then once you do that you can't continue if you've been killed because the game will go no responding.  Then if you happen to deal with all that the sound will go out.  Absolute garbage, I will avoid any games by this developer going forward.			",21,0,3,0,1,0,0

												So, saw the new Sniper (3) comign out, decided maybe this game would be playable after, what? 3 years. To see would I maybe buy the new game. Sadly, the same bug with audio stopped me from even playing one mission. Tried all the solutions I could find in the net (theres plenty at least). None worked for me, and seeing that those were back from 2013. So, in 3 years, after few dlc's and what not, the bug is still there. I dont think it would be hard to fix, but if you cant even see that much trouble to fix it... So over all, okay game, with okay missions (didn't get far). But the glitches and bugs this game has makes it pretty much unplayable. So I dont think you should buy this or the new one, at least not right away, to see if it has same kind of problems. I hope it doesn't and maybe the developers have actually paid attention to the game.  ",98,8,5,12,13,0,13

												I don't understand all of the gripe about this game.  For the money, you get to play a very impressive single player game. I wouldn't have recommended spending the $29.95 when it first came out, but on my rig the graphics are pretty solid and I have enjoyed the story.  If you get this during a steam sale, enjoy the game on the hardest difficulty. I feel like a badass sniper when I play the game.  If you're looking for multi-player, stick with BF4 CS: Go or Arma 3. Otherwise, just enjoy being a badass sniper.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Un-ducking-playable. If I don't spawn underwater to drown, I get stuck because a boat won't move because the stript is bugged to hell. Maybe it works on high-end PCs, but my Laptop meets the recommended and it won't work on any day of the week. So glad I didn't pay full price for this. Save your money and buy Sniper Elite V2. Already have it? Then buy it again. Still less of a waste then buying this.			",126,17,0,27,22,0,34

												In the society we live in, as a result of the works of many kind-hearted individuals we have realized that certain people don't function the same as other people. When people function in specific ways that deviate far enough from the norm, we can say that they have a mental illness, something that makes the brain not work quite right. We used to shrug them off as just being ""a little different upstairs,"" and exclude them from society. We eventually figured that it wouldn't hurt to include these people in society. We were wrong. This game is a prime example of why exclusion is the vastly superior method of handling the mentally handicapped. It was well worth the 2 dollars I payed for it however.			",71,9,0,14,2,0,4

												Here in my garage, just bought this new TOP SNIPER IN THE ENTIRE US ARMED FORCES here. It’s fun to KILL YOU IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED WAYS up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than THE NAVY SEALS? GORILLA WARFARE. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these NUMEROUS SECRET RAIDS ON AL-QUAEDA that I had to get installed to hold OVER 300 CONFIRMED KILLS that I bought. It’s like the TOP SNIPER Warren Buffett says, “the more you PREPARE FOR THE STORM, the more you DROWN IN IT.”Now maybe you’ve seen my SECRET RAID ON AL-QUAEDA where I talk about how I WIPE OUT a TARGET a day. You know, I WIPE OUT a TARGET a day not to show off it’s again about the UNHOLY RETRIBUTION. In fact, the real reason I keep this TOP SNIPER here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME BUT JUST ANOTHER TARGET, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IDIOT sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven CONFIRMED KILLS in my NETWORK OF SPIES. I didn’t have ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE ARSENAL OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS, I had no opportunities.But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a CONFIRMED KILL. And another CONFIRMED KILL. And a few more CONFIRMED KILLS. I found five CONFIRMED KILLS. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; GORILLA WARFARE, THE NAVY SEALS, UNARMED COMBAT and CONFIRMED KILLS. And so I record a little SECRET RAID, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three WAYS TO KILL WITH MY BARE HANDS that they taught me. Three COMBAT TACTICS that you can implement today no matter where you are, KIDDO.Now, this isn’t a “get CONFIRMED KILLS quick” scheme. You know, like they say if KILLS sound too good to be true they are too good to be CONFIRMED. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to BECOME THE TOP SNIPER IN THE ENTIRE US ARMED FORCES. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven TACTICS. So, I record a little two minute SECRET RAID on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my ENTIRE ARSENAL OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my CONFORMED KILL. And I’m going to give you the three most important KILLS you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in your KILLS. Always be curious. Don’t be a MAGGOT. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.”Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the TOP SNIPER who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he GOT HIS FIRST CONFIRMED KILL, and that changed his life. CONFIRMED KILLS can change your life. And in that SECRET RAID, Helen Keller said ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FURY” so if you’re a MAGGOT, if you’re a LITTLE♥♥♥♥♥♥you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to MAGGOTS. But if you’re somebody who knows GORILLA WARFARE, cause the KILLS are possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a TOP SNIPER, maybe it’s a SECRET RAID ON AL-QUAEDA, a new CONFIRMED KILL, starting your own NETWORK OF SPIES.Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, GRADUATING TOP OF YOUR CLASS IN THE NAVY SEALS, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can't do those unless you understand GORILLA WARFARE. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it CONFIRMED KILLS. You must have enough KILLS to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free.So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share these COMBAT TACTICS. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from SNIPERS many years ahead of me. Not just in SECRET RAIDS ON AL-QUAEDA like these, although I love CONFIRMED KILLS but also real in-person TOP SNIPERS. So let me share with you these three COMBAT TACTICS that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.			",245,25,1,15,11,0,26

I liked SGW more TBH. but this isnt bad. graphics are HQ the engine is solid i dont think it crashed once. overall its good. just lacking something. oh. I know. more cliches. I didnt hear stay frosty enough. or tangos. and hmm what else. its almost like it should say Tom Clancy's Ghost Warrior. if you enjoyed GRFS you will like this, there isnt coop BUT as a solo campaign its about the same. 7.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												if you are a person who has played and enjoyed the sniper series, then this game will let you down. unlike the first ghost warrior there is no throwing knifes, you cant even really stealth. the controls are also very poor and the story line sucks. now i have played alot of these games. sniper ghost warrior and sniper ghost warrior 2 and sniper elite v2 and sniper elite nazi zombies 1 and 2, and those game excluding ghost warrior 2 are great games. but they should have stopped and ghost warrior 1			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was expecting a great looking, open-worldish, sniper shooter. Instead I got a linear restricted and buggy experience.  The fact that it was made in cryengine seems to mean nothing as its textures remind me of early cod. However as a casual shooter with no care for deep story or customisability, it isn't too bad.  The sniping is realistic, bullet drop and wind correction are amazingly accurate and the constant changing of vantage points give you motivation to take down as many targets as possible so you are clear to move.  It also has a slight crysis 1 / far cry 3 feel at times which can create a sense of comfort every now and then.			",107,3,4,7,6,0,6

												Remember how awesome Call Of Duty 4 was? Remember that level where you run through Pripyat as a sniper and take out the bad guy with your .50? Basically that. An entire game of that. Just that.With a bug list that rivals Goat Simulator and a story so easy to predict it left me wincing, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is back.The original Sniper: Ghost Warrior game was terrible. You can argue that all you want but having played it myself and not gotten a refund, I won't listen. The shooting mechanics offer some variety on the higher difficulty settings but overall the lack of challenging shots leaves a lot to be desired. The positioning aspect of the game amounts to walking along a predetermined path to painfully obvious hides. You take out a few waves of enemies with your high powered rifle. You move on to the next level.While this is no-punches-pulled for what the game advertises, I find it hard to justify the price when a much more competent competitor lets you enjoy shooting Hitler between the legs. If you want a ballistics simulation get either Sniper Elite v2 or Arma 3. If you want that Pripyat level of Call of Duty for an entire game, look no further.			",197,27,7,23,48,3,20

												Serious bugs prevented me from getting anywhere in this game. Search online and you'll see many others reporting the same thing: Enemies and certain environmental objects are sometimes completely invisible. They're not supposed to be invisible; this is a bug. I tried DX9 and DX11 and other settings, and I could not work around this bug.I also had an issue with the NPC I was supposed to be following simply coming to a complete stop, which prevented the game from progressing. There was no way for me to get it going again other than to lose progress, reload, and hope it didn't happen again. But it kept happening again and again, at different points in the game.Both bugs were infuriating. This game was worse than a complete waste of money: I essentially paid to get angry.

												Despite my dislike of modern military shooters and my added mental handicap when it comes to stealth gameplay - I really suck at stealth - I have a soft spot for any game that provides me with a good sniping experience. I mean the sniper is my favorite TF2 class and there's basically no realism about that, but I still enjoy it a lot.So I obviously picked up the original ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior"", despite what I've heard. Thankfully I only paid €1 for it because it really wasn't all that good. It had to much faffing about in between the actual sniping and seemed to want to thrust in more close-combat sections way to often, so I never finished it. Because in addition to that, the enemy AI was terribly unforgiving and could spot me from ludicrous distances. Likewise, I picked up ""Sniper Elite V2"" when it was offered for free on Steam a couple of days ago. And similar to the first ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior"" it seemed way to concerned with having me get more into the action and as such, I lost interest really quickly. It didn't help that it looked terrible, even for the time, with shoddy textures, horrible animation quality, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aesthetic, etc. The sniping was fun yes, but at the cost of having an empty world that failed to engage me, so I stopped playing a couple of hours in.After that, I saw that Bundle Stars had ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2"" in a bundle over there, and even if it were the only game that piqued my interest in that particular bundle - which it wasn't - I could justify buying it for €3.66 instead of the full price of €20. Let me begin with saying that this game isn't worth €20, for multiple reasons. For one, the single-player campaign is criminally short. It took me 5.2 hours according to Steam to get through the story, including my personal ham-handedness when it comes to stealth, so I assume better gamers will finish it even quicker than that. The story is really disjointed and makes the world feel really small. I mean it takes place in the Philippines, Sarajevo and Tibet and yet the main players are all the same 5 guys all the time, it's like this was conceived as a James Bond game instead of a realistic depiction of arms dealing. It's also one of those tired old military bravado revenge stories, because we always need something personal about it to justify going off protocol. And while the graphics aren't bad per se (and I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥), I've seen better, especially out of the CryEngine 3. Worth noting is that the graphics in the pre-rendered cut-scenes are substantially worse than the in-game graphics, which is quite a feat. However, despite all those criticisms, I had fun playing it. Yes, it's horribly linear and bares little resemblance to what actual snipers have to do in real life, but here's the thing: I don't want my games to be recreations of life. I want my games to be escapism, and this provided me with what I sought for in a sniping game. It holds your hands a lot on the lower difficulties, but you can find a challenge here if you're looking for it. And for what it's worth, it really is committed to its theme of sniping and sneaking around. You can't absorb damage like in most other shooters and there isn't regenerating health. This is kind of an ambivalent point because for one it takes actual skill to get through the game, but on the other hand, it leads to a very tight level design that basically railroads you through if you need to use stealth. And with the aggressive linearity comes the heavy scripting of scenes that kill my immersion somewhat. I mean, there's an entire section where a cave system is collapsing around you and I never felt threatened, because a) I know it's a scripted sequence and b) my running speed is faster than the running speed of my AI partner.Speaking of that AI partner, it really adds a lot to the game. Especially in comparison to ""Sniper Elite V2"" where you were just this lone wolf going around Berlin. Even if the dialogue is just terrible, it just makes the game more appealing to me and opens up some characterization. I mean it's not very realistic to have a spotter armed with a regular assault rifle being able to take out targets at the same distance and accuracy as me with my sniper rifle, but I'll gladly overlook that in favor of having a bit of dialogue in there, regardless of its quality.The game doesn't seem to be too taxing, at least not on my machine. I cranked up all the settings to max and found that the game ran at 80-110 fps depending on locations, and this is with the CryEngine 3 so at least it's not badly optimized.My final verdict on this one is that I can recommend it to fans of sniping gameplay, but only if you can find it at a heavy discount, because 20 bucks for 5 hours is way too much. I paid less than a dollar for it when I bought the bundle, and for that it's great value.			",613,220,13,74,41,6,67

												I was expecting a great looking, open-worldish, sniper shooter. Instead I got a linear restricted and buggy experience.  The fact that it was made in cryengine seems to mean nothing as its textures remind me of early cod. However as a casual shooter with no care for deep story or customisability, it isn't too bad.  The sniping is realistic, bullet drop and wind correction are amazingly accurate and the constant changing of vantage points give you motivation to take down as many targets as possible so you are clear to move.  It also has a slight crysis 1 / far cry 3 feel at times which can create a sense of comfort every now and then.			",107,3,4,7,6,0,6

												Remember how awesome Call Of Duty 4 was? Remember that level where you run through Pripyat as a sniper and take out the bad guy with your .50? Basically that. An entire game of that. Just that.With a bug list that rivals Goat Simulator and a story so easy to predict it left me wincing, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is back.The original Sniper: Ghost Warrior game was terrible. You can argue that all you want but having played it myself and not gotten a refund, I won't listen. The shooting mechanics offer some variety on the higher difficulty settings but overall the lack of challenging shots leaves a lot to be desired. The positioning aspect of the game amounts to walking along a predetermined path to painfully obvious hides. You take out a few waves of enemies with your high powered rifle. You move on to the next level.While this is no-punches-pulled for what the game advertises, I find it hard to justify the price when a much more competent competitor lets you enjoy shooting Hitler between the legs. If you want a ballistics simulation get either Sniper Elite v2 or Arma 3. If you want that Pripyat level of Call of Duty for an entire game, look no further.			",197,27,7,23,48,3,20

												I bought this game primarily for the single player, with multiplayer being secondary.The single player was interesting, giving you a variety of options for dealing with a varying number of enemies in different scenarios.  Whether it be the sniper bullet blowing up a hand grenade on an enemy's belt, or just a good ol' fashioned melee from behind, you have to choose not only your manner of killing, but the timing, very carefully.  After playing through most of the campaign once on Normal, I can definitely see the replay value for this game on hard, or just for fun on easy.Multiplayer wise I only needed a few matches to see what this game is.  Sniping, camping, and painfully slow-paced.  It's a sniper game where you only get snipers essentially... if you've played enough CoD or Battlefield, you know exactly what that means.All in all, if you want this game for the campaign/single player content, definitely worth a few playthroughs.  If you're looking for an obscure multiplayer FPS for some reason.... keep looking.  Fortunately, I bought this for the former of those two, and was not disappointed.			",45,0,0,7,0,0,1

												The game appears to be more balanced and less hardcore than the first part.I liked the first part's gameplay, but it became quite boring down to the middle of the campaign. The second part features lots of action, but scripted ""COD-like"" scenes appear a bit too often. The playtime is quite short (5 to 6 hours of gameplay), but there is a great DLC ""Siberian strike"" which features 2 more hours of gameplay. I liked it even more thanthe main campaign.Graphics are superb, but the game is not hardware-heavy (Nvidia 420 @ Maximum quality @ FullHD give out stable 50fps). ",86,5,7,5,9,0,1

												52 / 100 ? What. If you 're reading this , look pass the score. it doesnt make much sence, I even saw people gave it '0' in metacritic.com Don't hate it , try it first. Sniper : Ghost warrior 1 is a crap. And i concured on that. But This one is something you should try. The singleplayer campaign can deliver you more fun than Battlefield 3 (singleplayer) 's.There 're some of the 'Call of Duty moments too , lots of Hollywood - driven scenes' Some people might think 'Hey if this game is as fun as those others good FPS (+ Sniping / Stealth) , then what's new in it?' My answer is Beside the fact that you have more chance to snipe and sneaking / crawling than other FPS games , No. Nothing new here. But Why not ? Why not get it if you saw the price drop to 7$ , 4.99$ ? Like i did. And I have to say that it's FUN.Pros :-Beautiful graphic (Thanks to CryEngine3) in ACT 1 - forest , it's kinda dark and too greenish there but after that in Bosnia and Tibet (ACT 2 - 3) The graphic will start to shine. As good as - better than Battlefield 3 / Medal of Honor 2012. I really like Bosnia and Tibet. The level designing , the buildings and those decorations are an art , espacially Tibet , VERY stunning.-Bulletcam made a comeback.-Storyline is ok , nothing special but not bad either.-You always carry either Thermal cam or Night Vision one , Which are very useful to use in nearly every chapters. Good + fun tool.-Improved AI , they 're way smarter than the previous one , when you start shooting , they will duck and get to the nearest cover. and try to swarm you from multiple directions if they have a chance.-Realistic bulletdrop-Good voice acting.-A lot of Cut scene.-Realistic HP , even in medium difficulty you can still die easily within 2 sec. if you got spray'd by enemy rifles.-Sniping + play like a Hitman is fun and satisfying.Cons :-Length , it's short. Singleplaye clocked around 5 hours and 1.5 hours for the DLC (Based on my Medium difficulty gameplay)-Multiplayer is kinda empty.-Unrealistic enemies at some chapters e.g. You are about to engage large group of enemies from Hilltop with Unsuppressed Barette XM500 Sniper rifle. You followed what AI told you to do. When you shot an Ememy he told u to. Another enemies who stood around 20 m. next to there still acted the same (stay on  their course like nothing happen). even your gun is unsuppressed O_O-You will never have a chance to use some cool sniper rifles (VSS Vintorez , DSR-50 , Accuracy International Arctic warfare 50) because they saved it for the multiplayer and yet multiplayer is deserted and empty , so. you lost that chance eventually.*PS. The Singleplayer DLC 'Siberian Strike' have more things to offer. Huge map , Good post - soviet vibe of Siberia , because of the size of the map you can create your own strategy of killing.7.4 / 10 'Don't hate it , It's actually FUN'   and remember , one shot one kill , people :) ",107,6,2,4,2,2,8

												Warning: Possible spoilers. For 20 bucks? Hahaha. No. Lets start with the singleplayer. Let me just start by saying this game is no where near ""story driven"". The story is generic mess, with unbelievable hard to remember characters. The game really fails to draw you into the enviornment and really does a poor job of character development. If there is any. Most of the in game dialogue is just ""good shot partner"" and ""nice kill"". The rest of it is just you being scolded by your commander. The animations are incredibly janky and so is the voice acting..oh god the voice acting. Player models are compressed messes as well, and every enemy pretty much looks exactly the same. There is no more than two different player models for each type of enemy you face. The game also tries to dish (And I am assuming) heart wrenching drama by showing you the acts of genocide comitted in the Balkans in the 90s. To be honest, it was so generic it was very hard to take it seriously. The main villian is dull, and quiet weird. (Not in the good way) I saw myself constantly skipping the cutscenes, and just trying to get the missions over with. The ""bossfight"" is just some dude with aimbot. The game really is not challenging, and the detection system can be quite laggy at some points. You could be crawling on your belly in the bushes and be detected or crouching in the middle of a road and pretty much be a ninja. Overall I would give the story a 5/10. At some points it can be quite fun, but most of the time it is just dull, and feels more like a mini game or challenge instead of an actual story mission.The multiplayer is a bit of a different story, that is if you can find a server. I found that getting kills was quite satisfying, but lag and poor hit detection seemed to ruin it alot. Customization is probably the most disappointing thing about the MP. All you can do is choose a gun out of like 5-7 max, and a random player model from the story. There is alot of problems with connection and hacking, and the guess what the only guns are: thats right. Sniper rifles...instead of actually mixing it up and perhaps having just one sniper on one team and the rest regulars who the sniper must support, the decided to make everyone snipers, and just have them kill each other. Quite a disappointment. Overall I would give the game a 5/10. And I would recommend only picking it up when its on sale for a dirt cheap price for around 6 bucks like I did. Thats the only way you will get your moneys worth.			",70,7,0,5,6,0,3

												Serious bugs prevented me from getting anywhere in this game. Search online and you'll see many others reporting the same thing: Enemies and certain environmental objects are sometimes completely invisible. They're not supposed to be invisible; this is a bug. I tried DX9 and DX11 and other settings, and I could not work around this bug.I also had an issue with the NPC I was supposed to be following simply coming to a complete stop, which prevented the game from progressing. There was no way for me to get it going again other than to lose progress, reload, and hope it didn't happen again. But it kept happening again and again, at different points in the game.Both bugs were infuriating. This game was worse than a complete waste of money: I essentially paid to get angry.

Likewise, I picked up ""Sniper Elite V2"" when it was offered for free on Steam a couple of days ago. And similar to the first ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior"" it seemed way to concerned with having me get more into the action and as such, I lost interest really quickly. It didn't help that it looked terrible, even for the time, with shoddy textures, horrible animation quality, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aesthetic, etc. The sniping was fun yes, but at the cost of having an empty world that failed to engage me, so I stopped playing a couple of hours in.After that, I saw that Bundle Stars had ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2"" in a bundle over there, and even if it were the only game that piqued my interest in that particular bundle - which it wasn't - I could justify buying it for €3.66 instead of the full price of €20. Let me begin with saying that this game isn't worth €20, for multiple reasons. For one, the single-player campaign is criminally short. It took me 5.2 hours according to Steam to get through the story, including my personal ham-handedness when it comes to stealth, so I assume better gamers will finish it even quicker than that. The story is really disjointed and makes the world feel really small. I mean it takes place in the Philippines, Sarajevo and Tibet and yet the main players are all the same 5 guys all the time, it's like this was conceived as a James Bond game instead of a realistic depiction of arms dealing. It's also one of those tired old military bravado revenge stories, because we always need something personal about it to justify going off protocol. And while the graphics aren't bad per se (and I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥), I've seen better, especially out of the CryEngine 3. Worth noting is that the graphics in the pre-rendered cut-scenes are substantially worse than the in-game graphics, which is quite a feat. However, despite all those criticisms, I had fun playing it. Yes, it's horribly linear and bares little resemblance to what actual snipers have to do in real life, but here's the thing: I don't want my games to be recreations of life. I want my games to be escapism, and this provided me with what I sought for in a sniping game. It holds your hands a lot on the lower difficulties, but you can find a challenge here if you're looking for it. And for what it's worth, it really is committed to its theme of sniping and sneaking around. You can't absorb damage like in most other shooters and there isn't regenerating health. This is kind of an ambivalent point because for one it takes actual skill to get through the game, but on the other hand, it leads to a very tight level design that basically railroads you through if you need to use stealth. And with the aggressive linearity comes the heavy scripting of scenes that kill my immersion somewhat. I mean, there's an entire section where a cave system is collapsing around you and I never felt threatened, because a) I know it's a scripted sequence and b) my running speed is faster than the running speed of my AI partner.Speaking of that AI partner, it really adds a lot to the game. Especially in comparison to ""Sniper Elite V2"" where you were just this lone wolf going around Berlin. Even if the dialogue is just terrible, it just makes the game more appealing to me and opens up some characterization. I mean it's not very realistic to have a spotter armed with a regular assault rifle being able to take out targets at the same distance and accuracy as me with my sniper rifle, but I'll gladly overlook that in favor of having a bit of dialogue in there, regardless of its quality.The game doesn't seem to be too taxing, at least not on my machine. I cranked up all the settings to max and found that the game ran at 80-110 fps depending on locations, and this is with the CryEngine 3 so at least it's not badly optimized.My final verdict on this one is that I can recommend it to fans of sniping gameplay, but only if you can find it at a heavy discount, because 20 bucks for 5 hours is way too much. I paid less than a dollar for it when I bought the bundle, and for that it's great value.			",613,220,13,74,41,6,67

												This was actually a pretty awesome game. It's a FPS with an awesome storyline, and it will bring the challenge out of any player. I personally have no experiences of the game glitching or any bugs. This was just an awesome game to play overall. The only downside I had with the game was the quality of the graphics and the motion of the characters. The slight lag of the character movement made me sick to my stomach after extended play. I rate this at a 7/10.			",297,94,6,63,26,0,52

Bullet drop brings a sense of realimism, and a chalenge when you try to get headshots from a distance, most satisfactory.But if you are into Call of duty type of games this is not for you, because this game needs focus, time and accurasy.

I've always enjoyed playing the sniper, and in this game, the role is fulfilled well. I can't say a whole lot about the game yet, but so far its one of the better games I have picked up.

												This game is definitely one of the best games i've ever played. I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoyes making trully epic sniper kills.With the improved AI and stunning visuals on the CryEngine3 this game is worth every penny.The realism is breathtaking and the experience is amazing.

												A good ""brain-off-trigger-on"" military shooter with some cool backgrounds. The playthrough is heavily scripted and railed; voice actor play is lacking. However, the game can still help kill some time if you just want to relax and virtually shoot something at the end of a hard day.			",85,6,3,5,15,0,39

												The single player campaign was short (I finished it in 6.5 hours WITH searching for hidden secrets). However, the graphics are improved from the first game. Grass sways as you move through it, there are much, much fewer invisible walls. It's still annoying that if you miss a shot, every single enemy IMMEDIATELY knows exactly where the silenced shot came from, and charge your position. That said, it was still a good, intense sniper game, well worth the $4.99 price.			",272,57,4,49,41,6,75

												Ya know all those cool game reveal videos, where you carefully scan the beautiful environments for enemies while plotting your course to the next position, creeping from cover to cover through dazzling shafts of light and well-crafted, polished locations. You then emerge to engage the enemy with surgical precision after careful panning, ammo seems precious and every shot is quite special... Well this game is it! Unleash your inner creep with Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2.Not sure if this is a 'pro' or 'con', but the cut scenes and animations are worse than the actual game.			",112,12,0,6,3,1,0

												Pretty fun action game focused on sniping. Poorly optimized. Cheesy story, obviously not as well written as the AAA titles, but it is sufficient. No QTEs, which is good. I liked the various sniping mechanics, although I did play on medium which gives you the bullet prediction reticle which of course, makes it a bit easy. AI is not very smart although they are much more lethal if you're exposed.			",83,10,2,10,24,1,15

												Good game. Absolutely the best sniper game i've played. However i think the single campaign was too short. Finished the entire game plus DLC in about 12 hours. That's not too much considering the price for the game.I also tried some multiplayer but that was just too lame.I don't blame the lameness on the developers though, but on the community.Most of the people just wanted to spawn, find a good spot and then lie there staring at the building with the enemies on the other side of the map until they eventually spotted an enemey and fired or got fired upon and died without noticing where it came from.To add another dimension to this, and perhaps to counter this kind of boring gameplay, the developers have added the possibility to cross an open field and get to the enemies house on the other side.That was a good thing i thought. That would add a risk of camping and just staring down a scope, or hiding too well so you cant get a good overview - for ex to spot an enemy crossing.Crossing the field to the enemys would indeed be risky, but if you manage you would get an advantage on people staring blindly down their scopes. This could also be a benefit for your own team, as you would 'stir things up' in the enemies building, causing them to move and thereby opening up shots for your team.However, this interesting aspect of the game was utterly crushed by the people who just want to find a cozy corner, camp it out and hope to get a lucky shot.The crushing consisted of public yelling in chat ""No crossing! No crossing! No crossing!"".If their will was not obliged, they whent to the length of killing their own team if they reached the enemies building.So, if you're feeling bored and want to become even more bored. Go play Ghost Warrior 2 Multiplayer, cause boredom is all you'll get out of it.Splendid single campaign though. Well made sniper game well worth trying out. But abit low on play hours for the price.			",42,4,2,7,10,0,4

												If you're a fan of these types of games, then I think you'll be pleased with this one.  I sure was!Ever since I was a kid, snipers and their trade have always piqued my interest.  When I was old enough to get my first Airsoft Gun, I chose one modeled after the M24 Sniper Rifle used by Marine Corps Scout Snipers.  So, when I discovered the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior, I played and loved it.  When this sequel came out, I played, and also loved it.From a gameplay standpoint, it's what you'd expect out of this type of game; low, slow and stealthy.  At times you run into a few ""WTF Moments,"" where you crawl past an enemy who clearly should've seen you and didn't, but that comes down to AI more than anything else.  It's still very enjoyable though; especially on higher difficulties.Graphically and auditorily, I found myself very, very pleased.  On full ultra settings the game looks beautiful, and the sound effects are incredibly immersing as well.  The two combine to make a very involving atmosphere in my opinion.The storyline is pretty typical, but, I imagine it's hard to come up with one for this type of game that HASN'T been done before, LOL.  That didn't stop me from enjoying it though, or putting myself in the shoes of the main character you play.All in all, I think fans of this type of game will enjoy it.			",37,1,1,5,0,0,0

You must go to the contries and snipe some fools, to stop bad things happening.Pros:-Good Graphics-Good Story-Amazing Voice Acting-Bullet Cam-And loads more!Cons:-Short Story (3 acts, each act has 3 missions, exept for the last one)-Aim up 2 people but hits 1Would I reccomend?

												First of all: I overall liked the gameAlthough i would definitly recommend to play it on its highest difficulty. Without the minimap and the highlighten of enemies the game gets a lot more challenging. Sometimes it is annoying if you have to search for the target for a while as the game doesn't do the best job to precisely layout where the taget is without those features. Bullet physics feelt good and realistic. At no point I felt a lack of ammo so I could use the gun that felt best at any given momentyou can get through the game in probably 4-5 hours on max difficulty ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10I got this game on Wendesday (todays Saturaday) and I have finished it already. I have enjoyed this game so much, ok story.You are a sniper called Cole Anderson and you go to differnt plases like the Philippenes, Bosnia, Tibet and if you have the DLCs Serbia. You must go to the contries and snipe some fools, to stop bad things happening.Pros:-Good Graphics-Good Story-Amazing Voice Acting-Bullet Cam-And loads more!Cons:-Short Story (3 acts, each act has 3 missions, exept for the last one)-Aim up 2 people but hits 1Would I reccomend? Yes, definatly.			",99,10,2,11,17,0,5

												The single player campaign was short (I finished it in 6.5 hours WITH searching for hidden secrets). However, the graphics are improved from the first game. Grass sways as you move through it, there are much, much fewer invisible walls. It's still annoying that if you miss a shot, every single enemy IMMEDIATELY knows exactly where the silenced shot came from, and charge your position. That said, it was still a good, intense sniper game, well worth the $4.99 price.			",272,57,4,49,41,6,75

												Playing the game for a long time now and I love this game. Best sniper game money can buy. Campaign is pretty quick to do on easier levels. The hardest level switches off all the help making aiming a really hard job. You have to measure the bullet drop on your own, no red indicator to help You. Multiplayer is a ♥♥♥♥♥ at the beginning. It takes time and patience to figure out how to survive and get few kills but it's worth it. Playing against other players is a true test of your skills and because there are no dedicated servers this game will live as long as there will be people playing.			",79,8,8,9,12,0,20

You can shoot everyone everywhere without getting detected even when its really obvious and part of the storyline.You can't choose or pickup weapons, the graphics are like some game of 2003rd, in my opinion its just developed by unexperienced workers.I don't recommend this game for purchase, but if you have a HUGE discount maybe you can.Even if the developper worked hard, it is a game that requires preety strong requirements and the graphics and especially physics are very low for this game's release date.

You then emerge to engage the enemy with surgical precision after careful panning, ammo seems precious and every shot is quite special... Well this game is it!

												Ten single player missions which are highly funneled into narrow corridors with little choice but to engage just about everyone you see. There are a few parts of sneaking but altogether not enough. Glad I bought this when it was on sale and not full price.

												For the most part a decent game, that they always know where you are the moment you are out of hidden places is a design failure. If they care at all about sniper, then pay attention to sound, NPC's ability to hear and see things (a.k.a get rid of the superman hearing, and the x-ray vision) fix that then this will be better. The invisible walls are annoying, but not game breaking. Also, not having such linear maps would help. After all, being a sniper is all about location. But the saving system... oh boy.. what a disaster that is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll probably be writing the only 100% positive review for this game, but I'm sick of seeing people slate it so I felt the need. This is based on never having played Sniper : Ghost Warrior, and from my current experience of that game I'm no more inclined to agree with all the people slating this sequel. I can perhaps see why it's been slated - no awkward fiddly grappling hook that you struggle to remember the rather unintuitive controls for (yes plural - you first have to select it, then you have to activate it, then you have to press yet more keys to use it). But hello, you really enjoy being a sniper, you see a game called ""Sniper 2 : Ghost Warrior"", you just want to go sniping! Or am I missing the point somewhere. The game does feel a little on rails, but that's still fine with me - it still lets you explore a bit but if you wander too far you get a 5 second countdown to get back to the mission area. The level of detail within the game is really quite something. The locations are very varied and I felt like James Bond going all over the world on my missions - if not always to the most glamorous of locales. Also the developer has made a far better use of the Far Cry 3 engine than the developers of Far Cry 3 itself have. One rather nice difference between this game and Far Cry 3 are the lack of bullet proof leaves.If you want an all action title with a sandbox feature, go to Just Cause 2. If you really, really enjoy picking people off from afar, get this game. It is not that long, but in this case it's definitely quality not quantity. The game feels polished and finished. How many games can you really honestly say that for in this day and age?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Game is very mediocre and just basically makes me wish that there was a modern day equivalent of Sniper Elite. Graphics are great and shooting is servicable but that's all that this game really has going for it. Granted I only payed $2 for it and the campaign is short so it gives me that itch I had for sniping AI enemies. Campaign is very short clocking in about 4 to 6 hours so that can be a good or bad thing if you want to burn through this quickly just for a quick fix or if you're expecting more.

												Basically a decent arcade shooter with a strong console feel to it. Visually, it's quite decent, the audio is fairly immersive although the weapon sounds are so-so.The missions are extremely linear but well designed, alternating stealth and action.Compared to the ""big"" titles of the same genre like COD, the difference mostly shows in the way the player character is managed. Here you never feel like you have a choice. It's basically a number of different levels to beat as they were designed to be beaten. Stray from the path and you'll get killed. Games with a larger budget like COD manage to hide this fact much more effectively. Supposedly you can shoot enemies behind cover but in practice you can't (most military bullets will pass through wood, not in this game). Except for glass.All in all a decent entry in a fairly crowded genre.			",143,22,3,10,12,0,23

												Buy it on sale and it's worth the play through... I'm not sure what all the hate is about wiht this game.  IF it's on sale, I think it's a really fun game.  Is it Borederlands 2, Farcry 3 or any other number of ""breakthrough games""??? No, it's really linear and it's very limited (not many/any ""upgrades"" and litteraly NO deviation from the set path to explore the environment) and it's fairly short, but that said it's FUN when, if like me, you want to play a decent sniper game.  I prefer the better SNiper games too (Sniper Elite III), very much so, but I wouldn't discount this game solely because of it's faults.  It's not a ""must have"" but for ME, I find it to be a realy fun game when I'm just feeling like playing a shooter cause I can't go out to the range that day.  It serves my needs and I'm glad I bought the game.  PLus even on low graphic settings when I'm on my Lap-Top traveling it still looks better then a lot of games.  YMMV.			",78,0,0,9,1,0,0

												Too frustrating to play as game crashes a lot for me. Gameplay is pretty much like CoD etc. sniper levels, so if you enjoyed those it's worth playing. Story is pretty cheesy and mostly incomprehensible, but that's par for the course with these titles. It could be my setup that it doesn't like but other reviews mention crashes too, so if that's something you aren't prepared to risk you should avoid this game.			",122,51,10,19,24,1,29

There are 3 different difficulty levels, 1 - red point, 2 - transparent red point, 3 - without help, where red point gives correct end coordinate of your bullet.

												so finally, 3 years after its release i get around to playing this game, overall it's a good stealth shooter, still in two minds on whether or not it's better than the first though, but i just got done with its campaign in just over 8 hours so figured i'd do a reviewpros: beautiful scenery, nice weapon models (minus the handgun, not sure what it was but something about it rubbed me the wrong way) fairly challenging even on medium, missions aren't really repetivecons: AI is a bit rubbish (example, my spotter told me it was time to run past a spotlight, told me exactly as the spotlight came back on to us as he ran right through it) some shots don't always register as hits which in turn gets you spotted, if you are spotted it gets a bit ridiculous as you seem to have about as much protection as a wet paper bag would give you, a bit on the short side, limited weapons options.conclusion: Sniper ghost warrior 2 is a good, challenging and fun game, despite its 'issues' i will certainly be playing through this again on a harder difficulty and will gladly recommend it to others, however, i can't recommend people buy it at full price, either get it on sale or check external sites, i picked up the trilogy collection on humblebundle for less than £4  ",146,14,2,19,23,0,35

												There are more bugs, crashes, black screens, fragments, sound problems, FPS drops, than I have ever had ever.  Well, assasin creed games are usually pretty poorly optimized, but this still takes the cake.  I unplugged my second monitor as online suggestions said, i re instaled my nvidia drivers, i ran as administrator. I switched it to DX11 and DX9, nada, nothing helped.  I tried clicking some disable something crap in properties of the .exe file, but there was no option they told me to uncheck.  Terrible terrible game, and i loved the other sniper games.  I just asked for a refund.  No im not waiting for a super short crappy game to come out with patches.  To be fair, if there were not all these issues, im sure I would enjoy it some.  Although you have to constantly catch your breath in this game which is annoying.			",42,8,0,2,0,0,0

												This is a glitched filled, unfair enemy advantaged, let down. It's got great potential and the 'Sneaky Beaky Like' is rather fun at times when choosing to sneak around and take the set paths rather than killing them all and compromising your presences, but their is multiple parts straight from the very first mission that are just glitched; I.E Partner's not moving and having to either restart the last check point, or move on by yourself which can prove challenging because the mission is led out too follow him, mission objectives not disappearing as if uncompleted, enemys not dying although are dead (meaning they're still moving about but not shooting nor do bullets hit them (ghosts) ) and the graphics, i mean the graphics are abysmal, with scopes and oval shapes having sharp edges like a octagon, pixelated walls and textures and no difference betwen A.I faces, there is like three or four different faces for all A.I bar special characters, the graphics look like something you would expect from a game that came out the same time the Xbox 360 was released, so something from 2006...okay maybe thats a bit harsh, 2008 graphics. I am a big fan of the Sniper Franchise, and knowing what they're capable of with their Sniper Elite line you just wonder what went wrong because in my opinion the Sniper Elites esepcially Sniper Elite 2 is so much better, for instance why doesn't this have X-Ray bullet Cam like Elite, i mean we know they can do it; furthermore why doesn't this game have a more greater range of weapons, for instance #MINI UNIMPORTANT SPOILER ALERT'. you go back in time at one point and have the same secondary. 'END OF SPOILER' It all feels lazy like why couldn't they have of just mixed that up for us, i know it's small but it's the small things that are nice in games. It's like the makers and designers just couldn't be bothered. You get spotted at stupid times like the enemys are god and see all, you can get spotted to where as your partner won't, even though you are following his orders and doing what he's doing. Bullet Cam is Scarse and pointless (due to no X-Ray). In all truth i only bought this game because it was so cheap (£3.99) in the sales. Now the Multiplayer, having just come from multiplayer i would like to say it's better than the campaign BUT that doesn't mean it is good, it is seriously hard too find people and well find people in a match, i had to make my own server which was easy as lemons and thankfully people still joined but still. Also just like the campaign it is seriously broke, i only played one match and one guy was out the map killing, another was shooting through sandbags so you couldn't see him but he could see you. I know it is meant to be a sneaky game but unless you get close or have a massive understanding of the maps and good places of where people will hide it is mere impossible to find someone at range. There is more guns in multplayer, there is 5 in the campaign i think as far as i can remeber and there is like 3 maybe 4 extra in multiplayer, no choice of secondary still this is merely primarys, and there is no damage difference #MINI UNIMPORTANT SPOILER' A VSS which is a small built in silenced sniper rifle has the same power as a 50. Cal 'END OF SPOILER' So if you're going to play it just use that as you're silenced. Maps are, small but I'll give them this, they were rather nicely detailed and layed out, basically what they did was mirrow the map to either side with a mini risky bridge in the middle that you can cross but got to be lucky due to over exposure, no specials like grenades or smokes, you dont have binoculars and night vision like in campaign. It is like you have been sent into battle on budget, and well that the games been made on a budget having all the issues it's got, and they have obviously done nothing about it with the glitches and brakes seeming it has been out for years now.I know it was a glitch filled game from playing the demo on Xbox when it was going on release; a part of me did think (well it was a demo so maybe they've fixed it) no, they have not and as I'v said it's great potential is let down by the lazy makers. Knowing what such potential they have from past games this is just disappointing and i shake my head at them. SO in all if you dont mind glitches and out dated 7 year old graphics and lazy game making then have at it, otherwise i'd openly recommend buying it STRICTLY at good price on the sales as it is not worth it or if you've got a couple bucks left and want a Sneaky game. Or just don't do it. DissapointingSPOILERS FROM NOW ON (mini ones)3 Acts.3 Missions in Act 1 & 2.4 In Act Three.Me being sneaky cause i do play these games properly, took me about 4-5 hours on medium, probably do it in 2-3 on easy and 6-7 on hard.There is collectables, two different types being Gold Statue's and Tape Reels, think 4 of each on each mission but I did not bother with going round collecting them though as i knew i wasn't going to heavily bother with this game once completed.

												This game is pretty good/fun especially considering the pricetag. Although my opinion is biased because stealth games are my forte. The only cons I'd mention for this game is that my game crashed 3 times during my campaign playthrough and that the game is pretty easy. It has a good story and the graphics/voice narration is good as well. This is a game you can kind of lay back and enjoy casually.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is nothing too special but it's good. The storyline is pretty good. The music is great, but is often forgettable. Gameplay, it plays well. For the cry engine 3, it sure is good. For my pc, i had to turn down the graphics to make the game run good. However, the only sacrifice from that is seeing horrible faces and somewhat muddy textures.Overall, it's a 7/10			",93,7,9,3,7,1,0

												If you get this game on sale - great. If you pay anything over $10 however you'll be greatly disappointed.I honestly thought that City Interactive was going to use this oppotunity at a sequel to address the issues and lukewarm reactions to the first game. Unfortunately it appears that most of the game's budget was siphoned into using the CryEngine 3 graphics engine (Crysis 2) but despite having such a proven utility at their disposal they only managed to create an alright looking game that still encounters consistent technical issues ranging from texture pop, to visual anomolies, and textures just not loading properly.Beyond this the gameplay has remained much the same save for the exclusion of multiple player characters and sections devouted to being traditional first person shooters. This is a good thing though as the first game executed these things terribly.The characters are bland, the voice acting is crap, the story is standard military-thriller fare and isn't original or groundbreaking, and the whole thing might take you three or four hours to complete...overall Ghost Warrior 2 is just a mediocre experience.  As previously stated. If you get it for under $10 it'll probably serve as a nice distraction but don't expect to be blown away.			",207,25,3,32,24,2,56

												It's an all around decent game.  Sometimes it gets a bit dry, but sometimes you feel as though you might actually care about the characters.  Essentially it's just a modern hash out of Sniper Elite without the bullet cams.  Perhaps the best part is that the enemies actually react appropriately to being shot with a high cailbre rifle; they die.  This is unlike Sniper Elite where many enemies will walk off one, two, and even three center of mass shots.My favorite aspect is that it takes the player to a warzone that has never been explored by the world of gaming, and that is the break-up of Yugoslavia.  That alone breathed enough life into the game to make it seem decent enough to play through.			",58,6,0,9,5,0,8

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a 4-6 hour embodiment of Call of Duty Modern Warfare's ""All Ghillied Up"" mission. Moving along linear paths from one designated sniping position to another is a fairly mindless task. The actual shooting is entertaining and getting a headshot at 1300 meters is immensely satisfying but hardly makes up for the dull ""stealth"" movement sections in between. Not a bad pickup for $10 or less.			",92,9,7,13,20,0,18

Or, OR!  they talk in your ear till you find the guy. This maybe only be when you play on the hardest difficulty. BUT THATS THE ONLY DIFFICULTY THAT IS FUN! the other ones (diffifulties) are ♥♥♥♥ing easy! they tell you where to shoot, and how to shoot. I want WANT WANT! SO BADLY TO LIKE THIS GAME! IT LOOKS AWESOME, IT PLAYS SMOOTH, AND SHOOTING FEELS GOOD. THEY JUST FAIL AT THE most simply mechanic of giving context and commentary. Your character spouts out where everysingle enemy is even if you can only see two. It just.........its bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												its an ok sniper game. very linear and fast paced. there are sections where you need to stealth. the tics need some getting used to. im used to each one 100m not 200m, and the wind was meh. I liked SGW more TBH. but this isnt bad. graphics are HQ the engine is solid i dont think it crashed once. overall its good. just lacking something. oh. I know. more cliches. I didnt hear stay frosty enough. or tangos. and hmm what else. its almost like it should say Tom Clancy's Ghost Warrior. if you enjoyed GRFS you will like this, there isnt coop BUT as a solo campaign its about the same. 7.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you want to feel like a sniper, shoot your enemy from a distance, but you want to feel like it's a gun not a laser rifle witch has no bullet drop. Bullet drop brings a sense of realimism, and a chalenge when you try to get headshots from a distance, most satisfactory.But if you are into Call of duty type of games this is not for you, because this game needs focus, time and accurasy.

												Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Man................ Again, another failed sound game. But seriously, when are you guys EVER going to get a patch out to fix the sound bug. As soon as I bought this game because it looked pretty good, it runs perfect on my computer but only 1 problem. There is no sound. Even on the desktop there's no sound while running Sniper: Ghost warrior 2. I have searched the net EVERYWHERE for a solution, but none of them worked. I even heard some had troubles with the first one. I got bored of the first mission straight away as I couldn't hear ANYTHING. Nothing, Not even during the cutscene. I hope this will be fixed once I come back from overseas in a few weeks :)			",29,0,0,0,4,0,8

												good game not bad. does what it is supposed to do. stealth and sniping is well emphasized but the single player is horribly optimized. My pc well exceeds the system requirements. but I have to play it on low to get playable frame rates. Yet in multiplayer i max out the game and get consistent 80-90 fps. If i max it out in single player i get around 25-30 fps which is horrible. I have a six core amd cpu 3.7 ghz. AMD HD7770 1GB GDDR5 and 8GB of ram. it is just the game. btw around this time barely anyone plays it online. i never wanted this game but i got it in a bundle so why not review it			",35,0,4,4,0,0,2

												This game is a ""rail shooter"" for one part and a FPS Sniping exclusive on another. Yes you move yourself with the movement keys, but the path is always directed to you. Even the targets. You CAN take the targets you want, but habitually, ennemies will know you are there from that moment and start shooting at you. Playing only as sniper was new to me, son I don't have any comparison to make with another game from this genre. I recommend it only to guys who only like to play as sniper and ONLY if you like beign told what to do. If you're searching for a COD experience or a sandbox world, don't get this title, you'll be disapointed!7/10.			",292,46,6,26,26,2,41

												Single player is REALLY good but waay too short. Personally I mostly like the multiplayer best, but in the game it's so boring. It's literally the same gameplay over and over again. In general I like the idea and details but there is not much differences between the guns and in lenght the game gets pretty boring as well, because in the campaign there is only 1 specific way to go, so completing it again will not gain you anything else, than your pleasure of shooting and silently murdering people for good, satisfied. As you might see here, I have only played for 8 hrs. It took me 5 hrs to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty, then I jumped onto the multiplayer section for about 30 minutes until it got boring. I have multiple times started the game up again ever since, but when I played the singleplayer for ~30 minutes I got bored again and closed it. To be honest there was some of the campaign missions where I got stuck, since the checkpoint system made me spawn in a spot where all the enemies could spot me instantly, so the only way to progress was to quick spot all the enemies and start spraying with my pistol or other offhand weapon... Not so much silence and sniper game anymore...On a scale from 1-10 I would rate it about 6.5.It needs something in the content to make it seems like worth the money; it just doesn't right now. My advice to a potential buyer: Only buy it if you save a lot of money, or if it's money that you don't need ;) and ofcourse if you like FPS games, where you are sniping and love the silence kill-streak. I mean, just considering the amount of money for a 5 hrs game.			",118,6,4,7,7,1,6

												This game is not a really good multiplayer game if you're looking for that. The single player campaign is fun and challenging though. The graphics can be a bit bad at default, but the difference is huge when you change the settings to very high or ultra. You can play this game on low end gaming pc's and medium end normal pc's and with the right settings you can maintain a fps between 45 and 60. I like that because I don't have the best pc.

												Good game over all.  Seems too fast paced, unrealistic at times.  The first job of a sniper is observation, the next is the kill.  Graphics are great and I didn't experience any of the bugs that others have mentioned.  There are too few servers to play online.  It would also be nice to be able to use an assult rifle once in awhile for close engagements.   Bots might be helpful for multiplayer to help fill the teams, or even just for training.   I would definatly buy another DLC or sniper 3 if the price point is $20 or less.			",74,1,5,2,3,0,0

Posted: November 10, 2014
												I don't know why I've overlooked the review of this game for so far, but here it goes. This game is good, semi-realistic sniper shooter, FPS-experience with awsome graphics and without any major flaws. It is very pleasant and enjoyable game that has extremely low learning curve (even on hardest difficulty) offering something new to the usual FPS-games. I don't want to say that it gives totally new perspectives since there are many good snipers shooters out there already, sniper elite for one. It requires a gamer which veers of from mainstream games. It isn't fast paced or loaded with xp and leveling systems that unlock new shitey after few kills.The combat mechanic is pretty basic and keyboard mapping is simple and easy to use. This makes the gameplay very solid and control of your character is responsive and the game doesn't feel sluqqish. Although sometimes I think devs lost a part of their imagination and this game got trambled by major FPS-shooters. Most of the maps are actually simple ""hallway""-runs consisting of boring tasks: "" get to point A to B "". Additional points for doing this undetected. In small doses that is ok. The game has nice, actually ""posible"" stealth elements, not like in cod in which you can sneak pass of platoon of infantry and tanks in ghillie-suit without being noticed whilst communicating with your partner (which I think was ridiciolous). In the hardest difficuly you will get spotted very easily. I would like to think that is realistic, and when that happens you are in really bad situation. But you are given a choice, you can go stealth or you can go guns blazin'. The sniping experience itself is done nicely and is semi-realistic. Wind and gravity affecting bullet trajectory are nice touches that you don't see in todays FPS-games. Mostly the circumstances are one or two clicks left or right and  two and a half clic down. This is when the game loses some of its reality and leaves room for improvement. There could have been more variety to this. I do remember one mission high in some Nepal-mountains and my first thought was that the wind is going to be faster, but no. Same as in the city streets and other various environments. The ""spotter"" in objective in easier difficulties makes it easy for new players to be introduced to this game. The single player campaing is decent with basic storyline. Graphics are intense and I think they are a real land-mark to gaming but have gone unnoticed unfortunately. The multiplayer is another story. If you get to a server which is free of hackers, glitchers or passers you can enjoy the MP. It totally changes expectations of MP, no running and jumping aimlessly, ammo conservation etc. No stupid, overkill killstreak rewards or unlocks of new guns. There are plenty of guns to choose from. I think that every guns has its specs even though they are not listed in any way. Scopes vary in style and maginification, mil-dot and others. Weapons ROF varies from semi-automatic to single shot rifles. Calibres from .50 to smaller and I think this has an effect to a bullet penetration at least in some form. Matches vary in length. I have played many 2+ hour matches and then again many 30 min matches. Both as fun as it gets. Hardcore mode is a cherry on top of everything. If you manage to get into a clean hardcore game it is pure fun. Every shot counts and you really need to count for bullet drop and winds. It is too bad that even this game is ruined with hackers and cheaters. Granted, this game especially the MP asks for nerves and patience which most of the players don't have. I don't think that kids like this game since it doesn't flash and make sounds every 5 seconds and give you xp or leves every two minutes.In all this is a good game that has a lot of potential. It doesn't suffer from any major flaws and it was not released as broken as many games do today. Few parts are repetitive and some things seem to come in circles, but I don't see this as minus since EVERY game today has a LOT of repetition already. This game isn't any different. If this game makes to a sale, buy it. It also has few DLCs that give few extra hours of gameplay, but they are not essential in anyway. The main game is easy to jump in and you can easily pick up from where you left of even after longer period of time. If you are into mp but have short attention span then this game isn't for you. It really requires thought and patience. TL;DR: Good, underestimated game with great graphics. SP consits of 6-24 hours of gameplay and if the starts ar aligned correctly a great MP. But if you are into mainstream shooters, think twice. I want to say that this game isn't for 80% of today's gamers but that is just my two cents.			",72,1,0,4,3,0,0

												well the forums tell us that the game is practically unplayable due to errors and glitches, i played the entire game through with only 1 glitch that resolved itself after reloading the check point. Mechanically this game is sound, it is fun to play and a blast when you get a headshot with a bullet cam at 1000m on expert. The story is okay, its good enough to get you through the title and make yo uwant to kill the bad guys. not hit up multiplayer yet but it also looks fun			",403,50,10,49,23,1,47

												I bought this game primarily for the single player, with multiplayer being secondary.The single player was interesting, giving you a variety of options for dealing with a varying number of enemies in different scenarios.  Whether it be the sniper bullet blowing up a hand grenade on an enemy's belt, or just a good ol' fashioned melee from behind, you have to choose not only your manner of killing, but the timing, very carefully.  After playing through most of the campaign once on Normal, I can definitely see the replay value for this game on hard, or just for fun on easy.Multiplayer wise I only needed a few matches to see what this game is.  Sniping, camping, and painfully slow-paced.  It's a sniper game where you only get snipers essentially... if you've played enough CoD or Battlefield, you know exactly what that means.All in all, if you want this game for the campaign/single player content, definitely worth a few playthroughs.  If you're looking for an obscure multiplayer FPS for some reason.... keep looking.  Fortunately, I bought this for the former of those two, and was not disappointed.			",45,0,0,7,0,0,1

												Great game right up until everything went haywire. Everything appears as though you are in a barrel, parts of the rifle appear and disappear, and the scope may or may not work. Here is a video I took and sent to the devs to which I got only once response on possible fixes, and when I emailed them back to say that the problem was still there I received no further contact.

												Sorry to say it lacks that real sniper feeling that you want.How awesome would it not be if it was an open world to choose your own path from, not to be told what to do or where to go.The choises that you make in the game are rarely your own. Too much running....too little sneaking. Its a sniper game and you should be crawling through the whole game.....well almost at least. And I thouht that snipers where suppose to be almost invisible, but strangely enough they get spotted way too easy.The sniper parts in the game are nice....but its like the developers want to mix in other parts too that should not belong in a sniper game.I kind of have to lean towards not recommend....but with some work in the future too make the ultimate sniper game, hopefully with Ghost Warrior 3 (if it will bee a third), then it will be all thumbs up from me.

												The game looks, plays, and feels like Call of Duty, except the only weapon you get to use is a sniper rifle. There are several different kinds of sniper rifles (MSR, M24, M82A1, etc.), but the only other weapon you have to use is a suppressed pistol, firing which feels like shooting a BB gun. The voice acting is horribly bad, and I do mean BAD. The game is almost played for you unless you are playing on the hardest difficulty. Everything is spelled out for you almost exactly, including where to go, who to kill and in what order, and where every last enemy is. On that note, enemies are lifeless. You might as well be shooting at mannequins. They will randomly spew out different phrases in Russian(?), from, I believe, a pool of set quotes. This being an FPS I'm not too surprised. The game also 'borrows' tricks and gimmicks from Call of Duty 4 rather frequently... I won't give any spoilers though.Despite all this, environments are verdant and, though linear, well-designed as far as visuals go. The sniper aspect is, though somewhat inaccurate, challenging enough; firing a shot at the wrong time will have several automatic rifles firing in your direction, a bit pulse-pounding, but this is easily avoided, because, even though bullets can fly straight through enemies and hit a piece of metal behind them, resulting in a loud 'pang' sound, this will still not alert them. In fact I'm sure the only way to get detected is to stand in their direct line of sight, and even then it takes a few seconds for them to notice you. It's also apparent that you are playing as a perfectly weightless man, because you cannot hear your footsteps at all - I'm serious, they are completely silent. Because of this, you can sprint up behing an enemy and stab him with no difficulty at all.Definitely one of my less enjoyed shooters, but at least the sniping is a bit (and I do mean a VERY SMALL BIT) more realistic than Call of Duty.

												I really enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to SGW2. After repeated launch delays I finally got it and it is such a disappointment. This incredibly short game didn't add to the first game but went backwards. Always had to follow and do exactly what my spotter wanted was my first big disappointment. Talk about leading one by the nose. I get captured, lose my weapons was OK, but after taking down an enemy, I can't pick up the gun laying on the ground???? Oh that seemed realistic. Don't know what you were thinking with coming out with such a clueless game. You could have taken the first game cut it in half and it would have been better and you wouldn't have spent years developing. I strongly advise others NOT to waste their money on this game.

												   Well, if they ever make a 3rd one, this one will at least give me incentive to play it. The sequel to the horrible first sniper ghost warrior game, Sniper 2 is in fact a much better incarnation.   As a sniper, the action was very good. You are refularly forced to sit down, look at the area, and plan your shots and kills, something the first one didn't give you as much (in so far as I played into it anyways). There is some action here and there to keep things interesting, including a few forced alerts you have to deal with which helps break the monotony of sneaking and sniping. Story and graphics were good, though the story itself was nothing special, but did keep things interesting overall.   As for complaints, not really much. As a sniping game, it set out what it intended to do very well, much better then the first game. My only complaint would be maybe the adding an assault level or two to keep things more interesting (assuming the assault rifles can be fired without jumping around like a kid with a mother of a sugar rush). However, that's a small thing, and doesn't really detract from the game itself.   Overall, I would definetely recommend this game. Though perhaps not on par with sniper elite, it is still a good sniping game, and one worth definetely trying (unlike its predecessor which you should avoid with a 10-foot pole).

												Great game absolutely love it but can't recommend it as the friendly AI has some of the worst programming I have ever seen. While the enemy AI have no trouble finding and shooting you any friendly AI will just stand around doing nothing most of the time even when there are enemies in fromt of them. Not to mention that a lot of movement scripts fail to execute during parts where you have to follow the AI. Meaning you have to run ahead to the next area to get the AI moving again.

												A solid sniping game - the best I've found amongst the more current offerings. I tried to like the Sniper Elite's, but the terrain and movement were too awkward. This game uses the CryEngine, so movement and terrain are much better in comparison (though still not perfect). The actual sniping is great though, very enjoyable, and at times, really intense.

												First of all, CI games did many weird things these years. They own CryEngine and develop Ghost Warrior 2 with it. But they switched to UE 3 to develop Alien Rage, and when they cooperated with Deck 13, all of sudden, they had an in-house engine to develop Lords of the Fallen. I still cannot figure out why they don't have consistency in development cycles. Aside from that, here is my review.1. Graphics looks terrible. It is not about DX9 or the CryEngine. I don't know, but it looks bad.2. sound effects are pretty good I have to admit, and the voice acting is good as well.3. Too many bugs and glitches. Sometimes, bugs happened just before the checkpoint, when that happens, every time you reload to last checkpoint, the bugs will take effects making it unplayable and you can only start the entire level again.4. Gameplay is ok, using sniper rifle is fun. But this is not a good sniper or stealth game. 5. There must be something wrong with this game. It really feels like playing COD. The level intro looks like MW 1&2.I know this is a military game, but Splinter Cell Blacklist has the level intro which feels different, and BF's level intro is different either. In conclusion, this game is not bad but not good, just average to play, maybe you can find something you like in this game, and when it is on sale, maybe a good purchase. 5.5/10			",230,54,2,24,23,2,58

												I am very close to beating this game but I can't because the game keeps crashing on me. I'm getting literally 2-5 crashes per checkpoint, and I have to avoid seeing the kill cam because it causes the most crashes for me. Due to how unstable this game has been for me, I'd recommend people to get any of the Sniper Elite games or Spec Ops: The Line instead of this game, since they were made well and have superior gameplay and stories.

												Single player is REALLY good but waay too short. Personally I mostly like the multiplayer best, but in the game it's so boring. It's literally the same gameplay over and over again. In general I like the idea and details but there is not much differences between the guns and in lenght the game gets pretty boring as well, because in the campaign there is only 1 specific way to go, so completing it again will not gain you anything else, than your pleasure of shooting and silently murdering people for good, satisfied. As you might see here, I have only played for 8 hrs. It took me 5 hrs to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty, then I jumped onto the multiplayer section for about 30 minutes until it got boring. I have multiple times started the game up again ever since, but when I played the singleplayer for ~30 minutes I got bored again and closed it. To be honest there was some of the campaign missions where I got stuck, since the checkpoint system made me spawn in a spot where all the enemies could spot me instantly, so the only way to progress was to quick spot all the enemies and start spraying with my pistol or other offhand weapon... Not so much silence and sniper game anymore...On a scale from 1-10 I would rate it about 6.5.It needs something in the content to make it seems like worth the money; it just doesn't right now. My advice to a potential buyer: Only buy it if you save a lot of money, or if it's money that you don't need ;) and ofcourse if you like FPS games, where you are sniping and love the silence kill-streak. I mean, just considering the amount of money for a 5 hrs game.			",118,6,4,7,7,1,6

												Great sniper game, both fun and challenging. The story isn't noteworthy, but the gameplay is terrific. I recommend playing on Veteran difficulty, as anything lower provides a small red circle to indicate where the bullet will hit due to gravity and wind speed, which completely removes the challenge and satisfaction of lining up a long distance headshot. The Metacritic rating does this game no justice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not a really good multiplayer game if you're looking for that. The single player campaign is fun and challenging though. The graphics can be a bit bad at default, but the difference is huge when you change the settings to very high or ultra. You can play this game on low end gaming pc's and medium end normal pc's and with the right settings you can maintain a fps between 45 and 60. I like that because I don't have the best pc.

I bought this and played it for an hour. Enjoyed it a lot. Then suddenly, all sound in the game was gone and it was unplayable. I stopped thinking about the game and left it alone.Four years later, today. Decide to launch the game. Still doesn't have sound. Google the problem, nothing works. No patch has been released to fix this problem. A lot of people seem to have this sound problem so it's not just something wrong with my computer. Not recomended.			",184,14,2,14,23,2,17

												This is a fun Sniper game. The graphics are superb. The bullet mechanics are very good. The only down side to this game is that you don't have a lot of freedom to shoot the targets you want in the order you want in the main parts. Going from place to place yeah you can shoot who ever you want. Luckily the guys at CI listened, and came out with Siberian Strike DLC that does give you the freedom most of us want. If your new to Sniper games this is a very good first one to start with as it does babysit you for the most part. If your a seasoned Sniper game player then you may not like the original campaign, but you will love the Siberian Strike DLC.			",86,13,0,14,17,0,16

												I really like the game, however the sound quit about 3/4 way thru the game and I have now reloaded it for the third time and still not sound.  All of my other games sounds work fine. I also bought and loaded Siberan whatever as a adder to this game and it also has not sound!!!!WTF...I would prefer to have the sound working vs. getting refund!!!!!!There are a lot of sound problems with this game, so it seems and no apparent fix or reason!!!!I have Alienware gaming computer, Radeon 7900 series sound card...all great hardware and again all of my other games work fine!!!!

												good game not bad. does what it is supposed to do. stealth and sniping is well emphasized but the single player is horribly optimized. My pc well exceeds the system requirements. but I have to play it on low to get playable frame rates. Yet in multiplayer i max out the game and get consistent 80-90 fps. If i max it out in single player i get around 25-30 fps which is horrible. I have a six core amd cpu 3.7 ghz. AMD HD7770 1GB GDDR5 and 8GB of ram. it is just the game. btw around this time barely anyone plays it online. i never wanted this game but i got it in a bundle so why not review it			",35,0,4,4,0,0,2

												I DID NOT LIKE THE GAME BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY IT. EVERY TIME I STARTED TO PLAY THIS GAME IN THE FIRST MISSION/COMMUNICATION (TWO PARTS), IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU ARRIVE AND DIAZ IS AT THE DOCK WAITING TO CUT THE ENEMYS NECK AND PULL HIM OVER, ANDERSON COMES UP FROM UNDER THE WATER, AND THEN HE RESUBMERGES CAUSING HIM TO DIE, ALMOST LIKE THE GAME FREEZES. THEN THE SECOND PART IS WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND YOU STOP TO LET THE BOAT PASS, MY PROBLEM IS THAT IT DOES NOT PASS, IT SHUTS DOWN AND THE GUYS ON BOARD LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN KILLED, SO AT THE NEXT POINT THE BOAT CANT PASS BECAUSE OF THIS GLICHE.

												Sniper GW 2 story is suprisingly shorter than expected. About 7 hours gameplay. But it's worth every penny. The game's physics are good and chalenging & if you like stealth killing, this would probably be the game for you. The real gold in this game would be the multiplayer. The map's are large and with plenty of hiding spots. It makes it tough, so if you have no patience.. your not a sniper., and you should stick with COD.Overall, good game.			",231,32,5,34,23,4,28

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a great game - if you look aside from the bugs... This game has amazing graphics, but because of that it wont play on low end computers. The campaign mode you play as a marine sniper. Multiplayer is fun, but you have to have patience just like any sniper should. There must not be a hack blocker though because sometimes you get a guy that comes into your match and gets 20 kills in 2 minutes... This game has pretty simple gameplay, there is no leveling, no upgrading, and you cant chat anywhere but durig gameplay. But it does have very clean gameplay, and its all about the sniping!

												The game is okay. I mean it has really good gameplay, but as soon as I feel like the story is gonna take of and truly begin, the game just ends. At a measily 14 hour long campaign this is not worth buying for the singleplayer alone. I was not interested in multiplayer so I did not play that even once. This review goes purely to the singleplayer campaign which was good, but shorthanded and didn't leave me with a feeling of gratification.recomendation: buy it if you really really want it, but skip it if you are unsure.6/10 needs to be longer, but if it costs under 30 euros, let's say 15 euros, then we can boost this to 6.5/10			",148,15,4,24,7,2,22

												First of all, CI games did many weird things these years. They own CryEngine and develop Ghost Warrior 2 with it. But they switched to UE 3 to develop Alien Rage, and when they cooperated with Deck 13, all of sudden, they had an in-house engine to develop Lords of the Fallen. I still cannot figure out why they don't have consistency in development cycles. Aside from that, here is my review.1. Graphics looks terrible. It is not about DX9 or the CryEngine. I don't know, but it looks bad.2. sound effects are pretty good I have to admit, and the voice acting is good as well.3. Too many bugs and glitches. Sometimes, bugs happened just before the checkpoint, when that happens, every time you reload to last checkpoint, the bugs will take effects making it unplayable and you can only start the entire level again.4. Gameplay is ok, using sniper rifle is fun. But this is not a good sniper or stealth game. 5. There must be something wrong with this game. It really feels like playing COD. The level intro looks like MW 1&2.I know this is a military game, but Splinter Cell Blacklist has the level intro which feels different, and BF's level intro is different either. In conclusion, this game is not bad but not good, just average to play, maybe you can find something you like in this game, and when it is on sale, maybe a good purchase. 5.5/10			",230,54,2,24,23,2,58

												A solid sniping game - the best I've found amongst the more current offerings. I tried to like the Sniper Elite's, but the terrain and movement were too awkward. This game uses the CryEngine, so movement and terrain are much better in comparison (though still not perfect). The actual sniping is great though, very enjoyable, and at times, really intense.

												This game is pretty good/fun especially considering the pricetag. Although my opinion is biased because stealth games are my forte. The only cons I'd mention for this game is that my game crashed 3 times during my campaign playthrough and that the game is pretty easy. It has a good story and the graphics/voice narration is good as well. This is a game you can kind of lay back and enjoy casually.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had this game in my library for a year and a half. I just started playing it today, and I am glad I did. The story is keeping me interested as I snipe the fools that are my enemies. I've always enjoyed playing the sniper, and in this game, the role is fulfilled well. I can't say a whole lot about the game yet, but so far its one of the better games I have picked up. I would recommend picking it up if you have a chance to, especially if you can get it cheap.			",528,153,25,63,46,7,78

You're constantly locked in one way or another, with the game setting borders for what you can and can't do, or what gear you can or can't use. There's very little room for your own choises.

												As my first sniping game, I found the sniping to be alot of fun especially when having to manually compensate in expert mode. Although the scopes differs with the guns and is sometimes a little hard to judge, especially since they was no tutorial on scope reading (which likely would have been helpful). Some glitches around but nothing too serious.			",48,2,2,1,1,0,3

												Great game EXCEPT for technical issues getting it running and trying to avoid it crashing every few minutes (after the demo ran perfectly at higher detail levels).Best advice, check the system spec and be prepared to fiddle with things a bit as well as maybe run it at the minimum low detail level HOWEVER it still looked pretty good and played pretty well once that was sorted out.Would I recomment it with the problems and issues I had? Yes. Even with its issues, good game once you get it running!			",63,2,0,9,1,0,0

												I do not know why, but I played this game now for first time. I think this is one of the best sniper games. Yes, I found some negatives, but they are not seriously problems. AI could be better, but it is not so horrible, sometimes you can go next to soldier and you will start think ""Maybe...He is blind"" but really, it is just sometimes. I think, this game is very short..I know Sniper: Ghost Warrior has same game time. I recommand this game, but buy it when it will be in sale.			",134,18,4,16,30,1,16

												I had fun but it has some problems. I beat the game and the DLC on hard in 5-6 hours. There's some replayability to get acheivements or pick up all the secrets but if that's not your thing then you'll be done with it quickly. I would definitely play it on hard even if it's your first time. It isn't very diffiicult in the first place and the lower difficulties make the game trivial (the game gives you a lead indicator dot).Most levels are extremely linear and you'll constantly have to follow your spotter or follow directions around in the main game. There are a lot of scripted events and if you deviate from exactly where the game wants you to go you'll die. The DLC missions are far better when it comes to freedom since you're solo the entire time. You'll have some options in movement in the larger areas but most of the time it works to just start sniping as soon as you enter them rather than sneaking by or changing position. At times it feels like you're just going from one target range to the next as your traverse a level. The story is cliche and bad but the voice acting is mostly pretty good.The game really shines when you make it to ""over watch"" positions. When you're there you feel like a sniper and can survey large and detailed areas. A lot of fun can be had doing things stealthily and shooting enemies when they aren't in sight of their friends or by shooting their grenades and taking out a group with one shot. The rifles feel powerful and are fun to shoot. Enemies die in one hit to the chest or head and it's always satisfying making a tough shot.Only buy it when it's on sale.			",213,13,2,22,13,0,32

												Sequel to the worst sniping game I've ever played. There's more sniping in this game, practically the whole game is sniping only and it's still not so great, it's progress compared to the last game. Crytek allowed CI to use CryEngine 3, and it's still even worse looking than the original Crysis -- and Crysis used CryEngine 2 -- and quite honestly, the rest of the game -- while better than the original title -- is bad. The only plus side is that it has Troy Baker and his talent cannot save this game. It's just all around awful, unless you somehow enjoyed Sniper: Ghost Warrior, I recommend steering clear of this one, if you enjoyed the first game, go ahead and play this, by all means.+ Great sniping mechanics+ Good soundtrack+ Excellent voice-acting+ Bullet cam+ Kinda pretty+ Better story than the first Ghost Warrior- Sometimes stealth breaks way too easily- AI often feels dumb, despite seeing you incredibly easily- Glitchy physics- Bullet cam is kinda boring, with Sniper Elite as a competitor- Crashing- Awful multiplayer- Awful port			",422,26,5,57,7,2,20

												This is a solid game that improves on the original.The graphics are impressive, however, there are still a few bugs:1) if I alt-tab out, the screen flickers between sepia and normal until I quit the game2) the intro for each mission starts out fine but bugs out after 15-20 seconds... the audio stops and the graphics pause, preventing you from hearing the rest of the briefing and forcing you to wait up to 30 seconds before pressing enter to begin3) occassionally (4 times so far) the game will crash for no apparent reasonThese don't stop it being a very enjoyable game. The same sniper tactics are there from the first game and the story, while moderately short, is fairly engaging with a decent array of characters and plot twists.Overall, a game that I'd recommend to those interested in stepping off the beating track from the regular FPS rinse and repeat cycle.

												I'm starting to notice a trend with CI games.  They always seem to have some pretty good graphics but they always tend to go corny on the story.  Sniper 2 was quite a bit better than the previous ghost warrior or in other words, I  liked this one.  All the environments are really well done and you could actually pick people off without alerting the whole map every time(unlike the original where as soon as you shot somebody the entire map knew where you were and would come after you full force) .  The good:Very nice graphicsInteresting locationsBetter gameplay than previous gameThe bad:Story was corny, but I kind of expected thatOverall it was a pretty good game.

												Great game absolutely love it but can't recommend it as the friendly AI has some of the worst programming I have ever seen. While the enemy AI have no trouble finding and shooting you any friendly AI will just stand around doing nothing most of the time even when there are enemies in fromt of them. Not to mention that a lot of movement scripts fail to execute during parts where you have to follow the AI. Meaning you have to run ahead to the next area to get the AI moving again.

												This game makes a great attempt at a stealth shooter, but its just too generic. Often boring at times. This is not a terrible game, but its basically just do what the spotter says, point yout gun and shoot. There is no depth, no immersion, just a very rudimentary shooter.  If you want to enjoy an afternoon just shooting baddies, this is fine, just make sure you get it on sale.			",192,43,2,17,7,2,10

												Basically a decent arcade shooter with a strong console feel to it. Visually, it's quite decent, the audio is fairly immersive although the weapon sounds are so-so.The missions are extremely linear but well designed, alternating stealth and action.Compared to the ""big"" titles of the same genre like COD, the difference mostly shows in the way the player character is managed. Here you never feel like you have a choice. It's basically a number of different levels to beat as they were designed to be beaten. Stray from the path and you'll get killed. Games with a larger budget like COD manage to hide this fact much more effectively. Supposedly you can shoot enemies behind cover but in practice you can't (most military bullets will pass through wood, not in this game). Except for glass.All in all a decent entry in a fairly crowded genre.			",143,22,3,10,12,0,23

												Pierwszy Sniper: Ghost Warrior okazał się - mimo często krytycznych recenzji - całkiem sporym hitem na rynku gier. Przyzwoita jakość, niska cena i rzadko wykorzystywana tematyka sprawiły, że wielu graczy skusiło się na zakup. Nie powinno więc dziwić, że CI Games (dawniej City Interactive) poszło za ciosem, dość szybko zapowiadając kontynuację.Tym razem jednak firma postanowiła na dobre pozbyć się odium ""producenta gier z kiosku"" i zainwestowała w Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 znacznie więcej środków. Najlepszym przykładem była choćby decyzja o zakupieniu nowoczesnego silnika CryEngine 3. Czy udało się w ten sposób nowemu Snajperowi wśliznąć niepostrzeżenie do segmentu AAA? Otóż nie bardzo.Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 opowiada nam przez pięc do siedmiu godzin burzliwą i dramatyczną historię kapitana Cole'a Andersona, związaną z nielegalnym handlem bronią i terroryzmem. Większość akcji umieszczona została w czasach współczesnych, nie brakuje jednak modnych ostatnio retrospekcji, czyli powrotów do przeszłych wydarzeń. Całość jednego z trzech aktów pozwoli nam spojrzeć na historię Andersona z perspektywy czasu.			",50,1,0,6,2,0,2

												It's an okay sniper/stealth game mimicking Sniper Elite, but not nearly as immense content-wise/story-wise. It's hardly comparable though since both take place in different times, Ghost Warrior being modern-era type Iraq War Sniper. Sniper Elite being the lucrative and precedented WW2-Era sniper. Ghost Warrior campaign is pretty short, even at highest difficulty (took me something like 6 hours). Playing Higher difficulty just means you end up dying a lot in some areas because they force you into some close combat situations where you may be fighting 3-5 guys at once. It's mainly a strafe shooter at those points where if you're not handy with quick movements and simultaneous shooting than you will most likely never get past (on the highest difficulty might I re-iterate).It does offer a good look at to how snipers act, how spotting works (some of the time, not the whole campaign), and the intensity of some missions that probably closely relate to real life sorties and immerses you into their world for a few hours. I'd recommend it for cheap (I bought it at 29.99, it's now 3.99).			",61,0,3,7,2,0,11

 Overview Worst MP ever - just a bunch of people who camp the same spot over & over again where they can see everything, but you can only barely/can't see them. I love how people can shoot + see through that 1 sandbag into people. it's also literally only snipers & that's boring, and map designs are terrible[what a shocker]. Why would you ever only create only 1 pathway to the enemy? Cons - Bad MP- Only Snipers/Pistols despite team-members using XM8s- Why are you saving during mission briefing? It causes an un-natural pause.- Enemies see you far too well. I can understand how soldiers on a perch can see you from up top, but from below? What's the point of a ghillie suit if they can see you through the locale weeds?- Some parts cannot be done stealthily- Cannot pickup enemy weapons- What's the point of medkits if you naturally restore 80% of your hp even on the highest difficulty? Siberia Expansion Time total: 2hrs 40 minutes - multiple failures | attempted & successful stealth run.there are 3 chapters and approximately 3 parts to each chapter.There are 3 areas where it's impossible not to shoot: The beginning, overwatching Diaz & final part.My advice for the Sniper on the tanker that is approximately 1km away is to not overshoot it & don't rely on your markings.If you're going for stealth always take out the high snipers/overwatching & any soldiers directly in your way can be stealthily knifed.I was hitting the 1km sniper @ 6/7th Horizontal[supposedly 700m] | 2-3 Vertical w/ 3-5M W Wind.I excitely await Ghost Warrior 3			",776,376,33,104,77,6,159

												Only played the first mission so far. It's very much like the previous in the series. However because the game uses CryEngine 3 this time you can choose to play in any one of three 3D modes. I have some Anaglyph glasses for the occasional movie and although it washes out colours and is by no means perfect, the 3D effect is quite strong. It's nice to finally get a chance to play a game in 3D, although because it strains the eyes somewhat I will probably only play every other mission in 3D. I'm playing on a nVidia GTX 1060 and I get no FPS lag with highest settings, and no crashes so far. I got the game discounted, so if you like linear sniper games, then go for it. 6/10 for the game, 7/10 if you can play it in 3D.			",164,13,1,4,8,0,18

												I'll be honest i was shocked when they made a sequel but i was looking forward to this but is this better than the first well yes. The graphics are pretty good nothing amazing the animations are very good there is some med res textures but it doesn't kill it. Sound effects are well done and the music is pretty good .Gameplay is like the first except it is more stealth focused and it doesn't have run n gub sections making it better in my opinion. I had alot of fun with this game especially with the sniping and bullet cam however i had a few problems one is that god damn checkpoint system which is stupid since the firsr can allow you to save whenever you want. The 2nd is the multiplayer which has only 2 maps and 1 mode also boring. I can recommend to this to fans of stealth and sniping and for it's price it's worth it.9/10 fun time worth the price.

Game is very mediocre and just basically makes me wish that there was a modern day equivalent of Sniper Elite. Graphics are great and shooting is servicable but that's all that this game really has going for it. Granted I only payed $2 for it and the campaign is short so it gives me that itch I had for sniping AI enemies. Campaign is very short clocking in about 4 to 6 hours so that can be a good or bad thing if you want to burn through this quickly just for a quick fix or if you're expecting more.

												First of all. CRYENGINE 3 delivers! Well, most of the time. Sometimes it's hard to understand why I see details ""popup"" when I play on highest possible settings...Let's cut to the game. The story is not bad, has couple of twists, and most of the time it's really enjoyable.However, I have to warn you about couple things:- Checkpoints ... Sometimes they force you to replay large chunks of a level.- If you are not following the script the game will most likely get bugged. Enemies will not move. Your partners will stuck etc.- I know the goal of a sniping game is to stay undetected and eliminate your opposition from a cover, but from time to time (some times it's your fault, some times it's just the way the script works) enemies will get aware of your presence, and then EVERY FREAKING TIME they know exactly where you are, and will gang up on you completely ignoring your partner, D'oh...- Yes, your partner... Sometimes he is just useless, he shoots around ignoring enemies that shoot at you, gets stuck or even runs outside of mission area. Not funny!- Too many time It feels like an ""on rails"" shooter with invisible walls, and action zones that you can't leave... Really sad :(These problems are not always there, but when they happen, they most likley happen all at once :P and you will probably get frustrated. Other than that it was fun, and I have to recommend it. You can grab it for peanuts on a sale and it's a bargain for 7-8h of play. +1 if you can play it in 2160p60 on highest settings ;)			",113,52,1,11,3,1,21
