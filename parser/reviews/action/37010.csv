												This game isn't great. But that doesn't stop it from being hillariously crazy and in your face. The gameplay is bland and gets boring. However, this is made up for by how stupidly action-packed the cut-scenes/QTEs are. Annoyed by QTEs? That's fine, you can set the QTE difficulty separately to 'fool-proof' so you don't even have to do them. And you can customize your ninjas colours super thoroughly. Play as a plain grey boring guy for one level and then you can be a rainbow or a sweet neon pink messenger of badassery. I just finished this game today on live stream and can honestly say it's one Hell of a roller coaster ride.			",335,52,8,16,5,2,14

												I really seem to like this game. I had it sitting in my inventory until I saw some screenshots uploaded by( cheese:) I read a lot of comments that ts too over the top. Last time I played god of war and Devil may cry these games were also not very normal. I think a sci fi slasher should be as exagerated as can be. The graphics are decent , maybe showing there age but still great. The QTE in this game are really cool. You can actually skip them but why would you do that?I just played through the first chapter and it took me about an hour. I killed a spider that was 100 times bigger than me so thats a good start. Check some videos and maybe you will like it, we only have a few ninja games on steam. Its pretty goodWill rate it once I am done playing			",770,119,31,28,18,9,49

												Where to start with this game? ill keep this short and sweet, the action QTE's are REALLY fun to do, and the combat is standard for the most part, but when fighting against bosses, every hit feels DESTRUCTIVE when doing combosas for the story, its pretty generic for the most part, and there's only like one plot twist in the middle, however, in the second to last mission in game, you get a GODLY blade that drains your health if you use it too much, but deals A TON of damage to enemies, and after you beat it, you can replay missions, and use the ninja blade too!BUT, the game is VERY BUGGY and you will most likely clip through the ground or walls, the sound cuts off sometimes and the hit detection is BS when fighting the smaller enemies, and each time you progress in a level, it awkwardly pops in a new section of the level, and BTW the game is short, but the extended level makes up for the short story.despite its bugs, i would still recommend this game, because if you love ninja hack and slash games and can tolerate the glitches, go ahead, and get it.my final score is a 7.5/10 had it not been for the MANY bugs, maybe i would have given this a higher score, but i still like it because im a sucker for ninja hack and slashes			",62,2,0,1,1,0,0

												a mediocre hack and slash game with mediocre platforming here and there.the game tries to go over the top with the scenes and bosses but kinda falls flat and sometimes makes you cringe a bit.story is also mediocre and some of you can probably see the plot twist a mile away.game is also buggy in some parts here and there but nothing game breaking but there is one part when you are fighting a certain boss , you can stunlock him by spamming your heavy weapons and he will never be able to move.gameplay is pretty neat with different weapons to make combat not so stale but i wish they would try to make it so that changing weapons can make you go on and make different combos instead of giving you a weapon switch animation.the enemies are cannon fodder with dumb AI but some of them have unneccesarry big health just so you need to hit it a few times more. there is platforming but not very compelling, but they did put a few hidden stuff in each level so exploration is encouraged in this game. Ninja blade feels a bit like prince of persia with all the parkour/ninja like moves but not as fun as the latter.this game is also chock full of QTEs, its literally everywhere in almost every scene and in every bossfight which kinda makes the game feel shallow. i think they were trying to get the god of war feeling but its just not there since if you fail the qte it just rewinds you a few seconds back so you can never ♥♥♥♥ it up. it will only affect your end game rating and score.some levels also have a turret section which is pretty weird for a game called ninja blade. its not that fun and is pretty much an on-rail arcade shooter just made to prolong the game.soundtrack is forgettable but okay.graphics are decent for its time although still not that pretty and choppy kind of like a ps2 game.the ending is pretty bad and not really worth noting.i wouldnt say its a crappy game, its an okay hack and slash game with a few problems here and there, just not at full price. maybe get it at 50-75% discount if you are really interested.

												Really, really liked this game.  True, it doesn't have high levels of polish, superb-platforming-game-mechanics and the like, but it's fun, action packed and offers a lot of ways to kill the baddies.Fans of old-school action games will appreciate the simple console like interface/options and straightforward swords and stars gameplay.  Don't go in expecting an a-list game here: the gameplay in NInja Blade matches its own aesthetic of a Kick♥♥♥♥♥SF/Horror B-Movie.  It does that really well and playing through is a lot of fun. :)			",167,39,6,14,9,0,4

												The enemies sunk into the floor at one time. The game runs smoothly, but hangs awfully when cancelling cutscenes or going between menus. It's a generally shoddy port. I had to mash the ""A key"" on both my keyboard and gamepad to break down a wall. As in, mash them both at the same time.Yet it's hilariously over the top and some very, very, cheap fun. It's like watching an Italian B horror movie.			",426,93,8,42,13,1,34

												The controls during real fights are slightly unresponsive. Other than that, really, what can I say? It's a hefty slice of bonkers action which includes you destroying a worm which just vomited a bunch of vehicles at you by mounting a tumbling motorbike, driving all over the other vehicles, and then throwing the motorbike into its mouth and detonating its fuel tank. Asura's Wrath clearly drew some lessons from this game. I approve.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												I thought it was fun and cool, but not many people liked it.  I suppose it is because you need a 360 controller to play it and it is like Devil May Cry and other older games that are modeled on First Generation 3D combat-platform games.  Could have been bettter, but for a low budget action game: I liked it.  It is the cheap version of Ninja Gaiden.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Ninja Blade has some framerate and startup issues but it's a fun game and definitely worth having in your library if you can find a cheap key online. The game is pretty QTE heavy akin to Resident Evil 6 but the actual combat is a ton of fun albeit nowhere near as technical or complex as Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry. Overall a decent game with some port issues that will more than likely never be addressed but still worth owning. Beat the game on my 360 and plan on doing it again on PC before this year is over.

												Ninja Blade is like a cheap Resident Evil game, it's QTE city, the zombie/mutant thingies look alot like RE. It's just that instead of Chris Redfield it's a Ninja lol. It's a decent game with a cheesy story, rare to see these ninja games on PC. It is extremely buggy though, poorly made port, the textures are also very low.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												I purchased this game in April 2016 and run it on Windows 10.The game requirements are not high and you can play decentat 60 FPS on older configurations (AMD 7750).The game is a Ninja Gaiden clone infected with QTE all over theplace - you can not even finish a combo without being annoyedby QTE.The game is broken: you can not save your progress. At leastwith the current version on steam. Also the game is sometimescomplaining that the right memory slot is not selected andsome texts are directly from the console version.What kind of memory slots and cards shall I use on the PC?This is rediculos. Also, the game says that your save gameis successfuly complted. When you try to load it, you spawndirectly after the INTRO sequence from the beginning ofthe game at lavel 1.It is not so bad. You can pick the game for casual play andplay it through. It is not hard. Executing basic commandswill not invoke QTE. But any kind of combo attempt willfire the QTE imediately.The enemies are very stupid and can easily be killed.But - not everything is so easy. The enemies usecheap tricks, when surrounded by 3, they wait foryou to attack one and then another one will jumpinto you and damage you for sure.Boss fights are nice but get repeditive. You just haveto repeat one and the same thing over and overagain. Killing a boss is epic. The feeling is nice.The game mechanics are somewhat funny. Somemoves like wall run use an additional key for noreason. In ninja gaiden if you run against walland jump on it, it becomes a wall run. Here youhave to hold the RT for the wall run.You can play the game with the mouse. I find thisvery nice. A lot of movie sequences use the gameengine with a far too strong blur filter.Don't bother with the story. It has some flips buteverything feels so cheap.If you could at least save and restore properly,it would be a nice alternative weekend game.For sure in 2016, this is not worth the $10.

BUt, id igress NIJA BLADE, its a very good game its like in it, you play as ken from SUPER STREET FIGHTER 2 TURBO who is ryu hayabsa's brother, and maybe also shinobis.. strider hiro, unfortunately, does not make an apearance..anywaay, ken is a g is a very good coold protagonoist, & he fights big insecs, like spiders, and his dad kills him but then he isn't dead.... so wants revenge. which is, like, TOTALLY ♥♥♥♥iN HARDCORE MAN!!!!... but yea.., it is like.... then there are also quick times.. and you have to pres the buton, or else time will rewind and then you will have to press buttons again.. so yeah its, its very good.. and i think u you should buy it.. ok. thnk u, for reading my review.. it is was a very hward review to right.. my fingers, they do not presss keys wel.... they are, very big, and hard 2 cntrol..Oh and, also, the game doesnt run well, it is very badly optimized, and you must disable the 30FPS CAP every time you run the game but i do not feel this is a bad thing, in fact is a good thing, because sciencists like neel degrease tyson, dr Phil have prooven that the human eye canot see above the ""cinamtic level"" (24 frames per second) AND if they coud, it would look very bad.. actualy, i dont think they were the ones who said that, but my point stands, IMO....

												Don't buy this. Even on sale, just don't.The basic gameplay is decent enough: you hack at zombies of some kind with three different sword - a basic katana, a huge, slow, powerful monstrosity that breaks shiedls and a pair of small, fast daggers that help clear swarms of small enemies. There's actually not much of this basic combat, a lot of time you're hunting huge bosses and fight them with hack-and-slash combat and QTEs. Never before have I seen so many QTEs in one place. In addition, you have some wall-running acrobacy stunts and collectibles hunting.The problem is, neither part is actually really fun or rewarding. And there's a lot that's just wrong - half of the story animation / dialogs looks blurry or out of focus. This doesn't make sense, since it's all done in the game's engine and gameplay runs fine. For the most part. When I quit the game for the first time and played again the next day, all explosions were replaced by a black rectangle. And no amount of screwing around with graphic settings helped. Then there's the fact that you can't save in the middle of a mission. You've got to go to work or take part in some aspect of your real life? Sorry bro, the last hour of gameplay is wasted, you'll have to restart the mission.No, thanks. There's nothing in the game that would make me want to continue.			",155,57,1,32,18,0,37

												Ooooh my goood, where to start?This sums up everything that is wrong with Steam: it's a terrible console port with awful framerate, it's just unplayable!Anytime you change a setting, it goes ; ""Saving. Please don't turn off your console"", i mean what the hell?It's a chore to even navigate the different menus. Takes ages everytime you press ""accept"" or ""back"".As for the gameplay itself, it's ok when you are fighting but you are immediatelly thrown boss fights that are just redudantand boring, especially the spider boss, it's so repetitive, I only wanted it to end as fast as possible because i wasn't even afraid of dying cause it's mindblowingly easy.the QTE, i don't really mind them but seeing on screen both controller AND keyboard keys to push is another proof of the extreme lack of ♥♥♥♥s given and amateurism put into porting it to PC.And I am sick of this! The gaming industry is making fun of its consumers, feeding unfinished, unpolished gamesto a target audience that has such low standards they don't even realise they are being sold games that lack depth, innovation and basic quality, cause they dont know better.It's a shame Steam even allows this to be sold, don't they have people testing the games? don't they have quality standards?It's 2016!!Remember back in the 90's, you would buy a game and think: ""Wow it's so cool! I can't imagine what games will look like 20 years from now!!""Well, they look like♥♥♥♥♥♥I have to break it to you, it's going downhill instead of uphill because of the people working in th egaming industry and have no knowledge of what a good game is.It's 2016!!! and we still get the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥woefull console portsthe ♥♥♥♥ing steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥Unity engine made games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ assets we've seen over and over, people who know nothing about programming, coding, putting assets together and call it a GAME.it's wank is what it is!Anyway enough ranting, ♥♥♥♥♥es ♥♥♥♥ you and have  anice day!Game ain't worth a buy!

Simply unplayable.  If I could get a refund I would!  Sadly, I bought this game before Steam put that system into place to hold♥♥♥♥♥♥developers accountable for putting out garbage ports like this!!

												I am used to console ports having broken KBM controls. But this one has broken gamepad controls. I have to press A when the game expects X, I have to press B when the game expects Y and I have no idea what to press when the game expects LT. I can't finish the tutorial as the result of this.

												This is truly a sleeper action title!!  Great graphics and exciting gameplay.  But not worth even trying if you do not have a PS3 or xbox360 controller to play it with.  It plays pretty much like all the other 'God of War' type action games but as I've said before, I don't mind that.  As long as the story, gameplay, graphics, and excitement are all constant...and this game definitely provides that.  It's a steal for the prices that I've seen it go for when it's on sale!!

												I hate to have to not recommend this game, but I just have to.I am not able to play it and I think more than me will have that problem.First of all, it is not possible for me to change the language ingame or out of game.It uses my own countries language as voice and I can not change it.The selection in the menu where you see the selected language is disabled, I can not change it there.The keys which are shown for you to press are somtimes keyboard/mouse keys, but sometimes not.It is not possible for me to play a game where I have to press certain key combinations and have no idea which keys these are.IF you do not have the controlling problem, THEN the game could be great.The little I played was really fun.Running at walls, different swords, really great graphics and a good sound.You are really IN the game. Until you don't know which button to press and die again and again and again.Not funny then anymore.I think this is a great game, but if I can not control it, sorry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never mind the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥textures, the buggy audio and the mangled collision detection.  This game just isn't fun, and the port is utter trash.  You regularly clip through things.  The audio is buggy, when it's not just sounding like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's absolutely FULL of quick time events.  It's just an all around mess.What's really shocking is this tripe is from the same brilliant minds that brought us Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.  Guess they're really not good at arcade style hack'n'slash.Also amusingly enough, they actually removed the Japanese VO for certain segments that was in the original on 360 for no reason.Even if you're into that kind of campy content, the bugs will kill it for you.  Stay Away!			",224,33,4,15,8,4,5

												This game is in an absolutely unacceptable state for a commercial product.  There are various bugs ranging from audio not playing, animations looking like they are having siezures,the game freezing when trying to skip cut-scenes, and some of which are potentially game breaking bugs like being unable to break down walls to progress through levels.  It's also filled to the brim with quick-time events.   It quickly becomes tiring and tedious.  They don't difference in the outcome of any cut-scenes They are used in absolutely every possible opportunity, and if you mess up you are forced to replay it over and over until you get it right.  It was just too much.The weapons and combat mechanics are unimpressive.  They work, but the attacks don't feel like they carry much impact and timing to pull off some moves feels very loose.  Enemies don't convey their patterns or behavior very well either, so anticipating them is difficult.   None of the combat flows and it just feels lackluster.			",379,67,2,18,8,1,17

												I wouldn't reccommend it. It's not bad, persay. It's got okay voice acting. The action is alright. The weapon selection is okay.  The story is, well it's an action game. You are a super ninja, STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO STORY AND START KILLING THIS FREAKY♥♥♥♥♥♥ But in many places there is fake difficulty, the controls get squidgy and the number of QTE's can get downright annoying. It wouldn't be so bad if it was, say, Bayonetta like but the QTEs feel tacked in for the sake of adding extra game but not game. DOn't buy it unless it's 2 dollars and less.

												Well I wanted to play this game, it seemed interesting and I got it on the cheap.  Unfortunately it is definately a console port and as it was done poorly I have not even been able to get the game to load past the initial video showing the city scape, it gets stuck on it and CTD.  No fixes available on the web have rendered the game playable.  A pity really as it looked quite fun.			",628,135,22,96,75,4,168

												Honestly, this could have been a pretty fun game to kill time with....except the game is SO GLITCHY that I can't even get past Mission 1.  I've tried  going through the entire mission about 5-6 times and at that point I decided I'm not even going to touch this game for a very long time.   Seems like others are not having too many issues with the game, but for me, this really discouraged me from playing it.			",31,0,4,2,2,0,3

												AVOID THIS GAME!!!! For starters this game uses Quick Time Events which isn't a bad thing, the issue is the the sheer amount of QTE's. Segments that should be cutscene turn out to be a boat load of QTE (quick time event) sequences which if you progress through the game quickly will happen sometimes every 5 minutes or less. Or if you want to you can QTE every single enemy with no sucsse. If you are using a controller the Quick Time Event prompt fades in giving you less time to react where the keyboard prompt is an immediate thing. All around it feels like quick time events were something that was just tacked on at the last moment and it doesn't really fit. But don't despair, the QTE's have a difficulty setting; if you don't want to put up with them you can set it to the lowest setting and watch it as the cutscene it should be although the prompt will still pop up like you are still gonna give it a go. As for the story you will be completely lost as to what's going on unless you watch the prologue in the extras or on the store page. Gameplay wise it feels like its trying to be 3 different games in 1 and fails horribly.    1. The setting feels like its trying to be the Shinobi reboot for PS2 with the whole modern urban Tokyo ninja thing.   2. Your character looks like Ryu from Ninja Gaiden and tries to be just as cool and fails at it.    3. The combat system feels like it was based around not your first weapon but your second that feels a lot more natural for some reason and happens to be dual wield sword but it makes you use this super slow broad sword through MOST of the game. The upgrade system mimics that of God of War as well as some of the attacks that you unlock via upgrading. The Quick Time Events mimic God of War in the way of being activated in the same ways. Aside from the games it tries to be there are also poorly incorporated turret segments that completely break the flow of the game. There are moments that also happen quite often where you will have to go through your weapons just to continue through the game. And again this wouldn't be and issues if i was done less often but its over used. The gameplay looks and feels very broken as if the cosmetic things where more important the having a solid foundation for the cosmetic items to be built upon. Most of the main issues with this game could have easily been patched out after its release to PC. Graphically this game looks sub-par for its era at max settings and you will have to keep going back into the settings in order to have a descent frame rate due to the game insisting that your frame rate does not exceed 30 fps. Mind you this is a port to PC after debuting on Xbox 360 five months before. There is obvious clipping and at times the audio will just cut out, so if your not using subtitles you have no idea what's being said. The game could use more than it's fair share of optimization, because I get better framerate in crytek games with loads of particle effects with better framerates. Overall this game does not feel like it was made to be on PC at all and it needed another few months of development in order to work out its serious bugs or at least a patch to correct them after release. Only worth the cash it you want to see how not to make a game.			",168,7,0,16,5,2,7

												This game is epic in idea, just from the start it looks amazing.  This seems to be maybe the fatal flaw of any game that is a platformer, going way way back, they may look good but their impossible to play due to broken controls.  Must be what made Super Mario brothers one of the most iconic games ever made, because the controls work.  Seems like 99% of games that require any precision from this game to AC games just are terrible with controls.  What is worse is the game has strange features, under settings for visual quality it says low, medium, average.  Ummm ok so is medium or average better?  There is no actual data point given to us to know what ""average"" means.  This seems made for consoles not a bad thing, but when all the dialogs say please dont turn off your console, thats kinda weird on a computer.  The game defaults to locking at 30fps, thats a console thing, this is PC.  Im not sure if its even possible to disable if I disable it, not to mention the odd choice of not having 1920x1080 is kinda weird for a game. The gameplay is real bad, if you miss a QTE you need to do it over, not a bad thing, but it makes you press retry everytime.  Meaning it would be alot more fun and fast paced if It just started over since the only option is to retry anyways, or give up crawl in a hole and die there.  The game just doesnt work though, the character will warp around where he will suddenly appear on top of walls or other places.  The controls dont seem to work, as in there are prompts on the screen telling you what to do, but the game seems to randomly decide when it wants to work and when it doesnt.   This game relies on QTE events which are done pretty well, other times its confusing because there is so much information on the screen like in BIG text it will say HIT RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON with a little x button underneath if your on a controller, it will also say dodge, how much information is needed to hit a button?  Is it really an einstein project to just put an x on the screen?  Did they really think gamers would not know to hit that button without providing tons of on screen text to correspond with it making it hard to even see what button to press?  A great concept with awesome visuals, lack of working controls make the game unplayable.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.10			",2654,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												It was July 7th, 2011.While investigating reports of unlawful weapons trafficking, peacekeeping forces encountered an unclassified carnivorous species occupying a small village in Northern Africa. These rabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to conventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the region now referred to as ""Ground:ALPHA""... Only four were successfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were quarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims displayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated necrosis, similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses native to that region.But it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens. These parasites, we call them ""Alpha-worms"", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, stronger… and driven by hunger. Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put them down. Which brings us to the current situation in Tokyo...			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												Ninja Blade is ridiculous and over the top in nearly every way you could possibly imagine, and probably in some ways you have yet to imagine.The game plays like what the imagination of a very sheltered, hyper, anime-obsessed child would fantasize about. A human being taking on a creature many times larger than a skyscraper with just a sword? Sure, why not.The art direction is solid, as is the music. There is a return of Raikoh, from Otogi, if you so choose to use the costume.I miss the destruction and somewhat more grounded nature of Otogi.Ninja Blade appears to be a parody of all the stereotypes of Japanese games and entertainment, but sadly, I think it is a heartfelt homage and is taking itself seriously.Get it if you want something that is just... stupidly over the top. Oh, and if you love the hell out of Quick Time Events (QTE).			",381,110,19,5,9,2,12
