												This is an incredibly low budget time travel FPS game. If you're looking for polished setpieces, you won't find them here. But if you're looking for using cluster bombs on civil war battlefields to mess with history, this is your game. One mission (sorry for the mild spoiler here, but it'll help sell you on the game) involves you getting put in a POW camp, being broken out by a mysterious stranger... and then traveling back in time and being the mysterious strange who breaks yourself out of the POW camp. It's so absurd, but it's awesome. The part where future soldiers with automatic weapons show up at the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius is totally campy. The one rule of the game is that you can't mess with history... until the game tells you to mess with history.If you're in the mood for something that's very clunky with a lot of heart, I think you'll enjoy making your way through the game. It's a pity that surface-level complaints about the game caused reviews to miss how enjoyable it is.			",1395,655,53,165,188,14,205

												Intresting premise and intresting gameplay. Nice to play a game that isnt a bland modern shooty thing and actually has period correct weapons. Recomended, but only if you are willing to look past flaws in the graphics and A.I. A flawed but still enjoyable gem, in my humble opinion.			",80,37,2,12,44,0,32

												Great game idea which has been executed pretty well if you ask me. You travel through time and get the chance to shoot Indians with a modern shotgun! Yay!Also, the engine seems to be well-made since the fps do not drop even though there are hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same time. For all Germans: This version is completely uncut and includes all the gore effects as well as nazi symbols of the American version.			",1920,529,91,173,174,15,191

												*UPDATE*I finally managed to launch the game with my new gaming laptop since it has NVidia graphic card. The game is surprisingly made really well and I love it! So I decided to remove completely my old review and write a brand new one, a simple pros and cons.Pros:+ Completely unique and cool storyline. I don't think any other game has ever thought about stories like this. This kind of story has been my dream for a pretty long time and I never thought someone actually made a game like this+ Chosen war era is very unique. Other game developers rarely make any games about World War I, Civil War, and the American Indian war, since I know most people will hate sitting on trenches waiting for a head to pop up or having to reload for a long time after every shot while their enemies can hide in trees with bows. But I love it because it is different.+ Great storyline, not epic but it is really cool and people would be able to make a movie out of this game.+ Mediocre, but still acceptable graphics. Not much to expect from an old low-budget game. But it is still acceptable for me and I think it is pretty good.+ Challenging gameplay. Just don't play on the easiest difficulty. With increased difficulty you will receive more damage and it will feel much more tense. Imagine having to reload your musket with the enemy charging you with bayonets. + You can use modern assault rifle in civil war era. That's fun LOL.Cons:- Cannot run on computers with AMD graphic cards- Laser weapons, all weapons has 100% accuracy when you aim down the sight and 100% damage on all range. But it has no multiplayer so I don't care about OP weapons- Abandoned by developers- Invisible walls- Bad voice acting- Character dialogues tend to overlap- Random crashes, but not too often- Terrible soundtrack. Almost no soundtracks in-game- No stealth element. Enemies will easily see you from far away and you get no silenced weapons. You will also move way too slow when you crouch.Overall, you will easily notice this game is pretty crude since I heard it is a low budget game. Square-ish no expression face, bad voice acting, bad animation, no melee animation, etc. But the storyline is very unique and the war era is really not like other FPS games. There may be other FPS Civil War/American-Indian War/World War 1 game out there like Verdun, but as far as I know, people rarely make games in this war era and it makes this game worth buying and playing. The campaign itself isn't too long and it's just like finishing CoD and Battlefield's single player campaign. But I really like this game for its unique storyline and war era. However, I decided not to change my recommendation status since I personally think this game is overpriced. Wait for a discount or something. It's not worth the price for its short campaign and little to nothing replay value.			",194,25,9,11,23,1,19

												8/10I recommend this game highly. It is a great game for those interested in an FPS that goes to different points in history. Well, if you have an older Nvidia graphics card anyway. Running a GTX 970 the Physx features of this game wouldnt work, even with legacy drivers installed (fog, leaves, weapon smoke and other particles) - without these the game just isnt as good IMO. Therefore, i had to play on an old 9600GT to get PhysX working. Worse; It wouldnt run on my Radeon card at all. EDIT: Tested on Windows 10 Tech Preview 64bit. Its not the OS that's causing the issue for some people. You just need an older GPUTechnical problems aside, the actual game:PROS:- Fantastic idea - Travelling back to various periods including WW1 and the Civil war. These arent exactly common in other games and it was a refreshing change, and on the whole they did it well. They actually explain the time tavel part of it too, and the plot involves 2 opposing groups fighting to either preserve or change history.- Good levels - who doesnt want to form up in rank against the confederates at Antietam, or break out of a WW2 concentration camp?- Reload animation minigame - get it right and it speeds up the reload, get it wrong and it jams and takes longer. Great mechanic.- Weapon upgrade system- Fairly good voice acting, and chatter from other sodiers on the battlefield- Slight choice to pick the mission you want to do next- Feeling like a badass when you are wrecking Romans and Confederates with future weaponryCONS: - Maps arent as open as they appear, invisible walls and linear design- occassionally getting stuck to surfaces- A few turret sections that are only ok- you can bypass the necessity for reloading by switching to secondary and using it, by the time you go back to your primary weapon it has reloaded itself. This takes away from the feel of the game, especially in the civil war with muskets that should take a while to reload.- The ending leaves the game open a bit for a sequel thats likely never coming.In conclusion though, the negatives don't outweigh the positives for me and I think if you have an older nvidia card this game is definitely worth a shot. If you can get it working with PhysX the graphics hold up surprisingly well, and the game has a great concept and its a hell of a lot of fun.			",145,14,2,21,14,1,51

												A good solid FPS, great level design, interesting plot an attention to detail. Becoming one of the ranks, with a musket, marching through corn fields certainly brings these battles to life like nothing else.The only downside I feel is that AI doesn't respond as you imagine it might e.g. Running away en-mass in horror when a solider in the American Civil War uses a fully-auto weapon.

UNIQUE GAMEThe consept of this game is very interesting, time travel and historical battles. The bad reviews are understandable but I think this game is a bit underrated. I had a lot of fun playing it and the battles were awesome. The story was bit sloppy and the ending was♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPOILER ALERT!The ending is a huge cliffhanger and it does not look like it will be a sequel either, which I think is a shame because I think this game was original and unique. To be their first game they really showed a good game. Anyways, if you love war games and are interested in history this game might be for you, but be prepared for minor bugs and sloppy voice acting.			",163,10,4,8,13,1,22

												""Darkest of Days""is a really neat ,great looking ,game with a splendid  array of  period  weapons.It's fun banging away with a realistic looking 1860 Colt 44 army or an accurately modelled ""broom stick'' Mauser.There  is some very good,interesting hardware in this game and firing it is remarkably realistic for trajectories and ballistics.  10 out of 10 there....  How does it run? My PC is Win 7 64 bit with  Nvidia graphics  and it runs smoothly and looks much better than I expected.It looks really good. There have been no crashes,bugs,lockups.The acting is ok ,music fine , battles are wonderfully noisy  and confusing .Big Horn with Custer and the boys is a lot  of fun  plus the time travel to the  Russian front circa 1914  and the US civil  war  makes this a bit of a one of a kind. A very good game but do check to see  if your pc can run it.If it can  buy it now its never going to be cheaper...			",65,11,0,19,31,0,46

The story is great mixing time travel and massive wars is incredibly fun.  I loved going into the civil war seeing as how it's never portrayed well in first person shooters.  There are a few glitches and the game looks a bit outdated but it's still one of my favorite games.			",105,11,2,11,7,0,10

That's right!  The screen goes black and you can not play it.For those of you that can play it, you will enjoy being able to use futuristic weapons in a historical(Hysterical) evironment.  Like having a futuristic assault rifle in the civil war.  Or a microwave cannon against Roman soldiers.  But if you own an ATI video card, you will unfortunatley be unable to see any of this.

												It is rare to see games with the effect of time traveling in them, when I found out about Darkest of Days and how you get to ""time travel"" in it, I was totally into getting it, and I did and it is awesome.The game follows the story of a man named Alexander Morris, a soldier in General Custer's army. The game begins with the Battle of Little Big Horn (or Custer's Last Stand) going down in the dumps when all of the sudden Morris is injured and rescued by a man in futuristic armor who appears out of a bubble like portal. In the game you are assigned to ""Protect and Preserve History as it is"" by traveling through time into events and famous battles of World War 1, World War 2 and the American Civil War, rescuing certain individuals that play a key role in history.The shooter and story aspect of this game is awesome, because you get to use different weapons from the American Civil War, WW1, and WW2. The graphics of this game...not the best and you can tell there are some glitches in it, it is like the producers of this game wanted to make it quickly, and the ending is a cliff hanger (hence the four star rating). But all in all Darkest of Days is an action filled first person shooter that is exciting and fun to play. It is long and can be difficult if you are not careful but I like the time traveling, Characters, Story, and weapons in it. (Just a side note, there is a lot of swearing and cussing in this game just to give you a heads up).But Darkest of Days is a fun game and it is great to see a game with time traveling in it, I would recommend this for any time traveling/shooter fan. :)			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												This is actually OK, despite the really short campaign and the clunky animations. It runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, and that surprised me. So, like I said, the campaign was short. Yes, it is only between 6-8 hours, but it's one of those campaigns where you keep playing it until you can beat the entire game on the hardest difficulty with no trouble at all. It's indeed good, but animations are clunky, the story was a bit generic, and there was SO much potential thrown out the window, and there is no multiplayer. So, overall, this game is a 6/10 in my book, meaning it's good to play for a while, but you will eventually stop playing it. It wasn't worth the 20 bucks I payed for it, but more like 10 bucks.

												Good concept marred by merely servicable plot and execution. The rules about what affects time and what doesn't is really wonky as well. It does get points for using battles (Antienum and Tanneburg) that aren't used much in games.The section of the game in Pompeii feels horribly unbalanced and even nonsensicle. There is also the problem that you get a massive chunk of plot dopped on your head in a single ending cutscene with the vague promise of a sequel to resolve it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sadly, until they make a patch where the game can be ran without an NVIDIA graphics card, there is no point to buy this game as it wont work. Black Screen prevents you from playing.

												EDIT: Let's put up some standards here shall we?Darkest of Days? What is this? Simple.A first Person shooter. BUT that is not all. You are able to experience various events.Even though only digging at the top, you are able to learn history (Atleast i did).Example: What do you think is the darkest day of american history? 9/11? Well wrong.The battle of Antietam in the american civil war.This game captures time traveling, altering history and history itself.You are about to be killed when a mysterious agent, give you ""the choice"" to save your life.Why did he choose you? You are a ghost of time. You arrived to early, your papers from your transport got lost. You don't exist according to documents. So it's not so obvious, if you are missing and recruited to maintain time.Timelines where you will go:American Civil war.First World war.Second World war.-Secret-Let's keep it that short, because you will love the complex story of the game itself, if you cope with it.MOVING ON TO THE PRO'S AND CONSPro's - Interesting concept of the ghosts of time (no records of them, did they even exist at all?) - Various assets of weapons (Modern ones, First World war weapons, etc.) - Actually nice sound quality - Nice capturing of history (What happend, when? etc.) - complex story - Seperate Targets (Some can die and don't change the history, some need to be saved) - unexpected turn of events at certain points This game actually reached my interest in history, especially in the history of america.Let's be specific, my interest in the civil war.And because of that bit of interest which i got from this game, i actually started to study history. Neutral This is a section where i put the points which i can't judge about what you guys would feel. - Graphics are a bit old, but easy to overlook when you are in a fight. - Voice acting is a bit harsh and the movement of the mouth is badly captured, but the voices themself are pretty to be honest. Cons  - You can get distracted on pretty easy ways. - Instructions of the levels are rarely explained through talking -> Frustration rises because you overlooked a hint or a way. - complex story (some people like it, like me, but many can't cope with it) - Same Missions (find a historicly relevant person, secure them, while shooting the enemy) - no multiplayerIf you have trouble deciding whether you buy this game, feel free to contact me, i try to answer your questions, the best i can.Thank you for reading this.GreetingsKörnäl			",72,14,1,11,16,3,13

												AMD WARNING this game is amazing. int is my favorite game ever infeact. has so many twists and turns and you never know what will happen next. the story is far better than many AAA tittles today. But... sadly if u have an AMD graphics card like me you can not play this game. the card dose not suppor the physX and the game dose not alow you to turn it off. this just causes the game to run with a back screen. it realy pains me to see this happen to a game like this but they wont fix it anytime soon, if ever, so i can never play this truly wonderful work of art ever again.

												Oh boy, Darkest of Days. You sure were quite the attention nabber at the presentations in the eyes of many only to fall flat on your♥♥♥♥♥on release. Darkest of Days got nothing but poor ratings across the board and, in my honest opinion, I have to disagree. Sure, the story and abrupt ending was incredibly idiotic, but the game itself isn't really all too bad. The campaign was of decent length and I had fun mowing down people in the Civil War era with a full automatic SMG. While DoD only stays in the WWI and Civil War times, it still has pretty cool mission design in some places. And I guarentee you will love the last level of the game but hate it because you wish there was more levels like it. However, I recommend Darkest of Days.			",468,64,27,26,22,3,31

												OK had this game on Xbox before buying it on PC.... I know, hate if you want... This game is glichty as all Hell, runs like crap and looks like crap. but for some reason i still love it. I dont know why, maybe its the feeling of mowing down civil war soldiers with a future machine gun, or burning poor Romans with a flamethrower. This game says its about time travel but you'll be spending most of your time in the Civil War and WW1 with a few missions outside of those. For a FPS this game has Alot of actors on screen at one time, ~300, and the moments where you're standing in close order drill in the civil war is just loads of fun. For me the WW1 era missions are really hit and miss and the 3 or 4 other missions in the game are great. The story overall is Meh. This game has its moments so ill recommend, but really look into it if you want to buy it. Id get it on a sale if you're unsure. Its a bad game, but for me a lovable one. Some parts are pure magic, others are that one zepplin mission.... Seriously.... ♥♥♥♥ YOU ZEP.			",46,15,0,14,14,2,22

												Crashes more often than a leaked alpha build of a STALKER game. Tends to put you into positions where you are nearly killed while in a cutscene, then killed as soon as the cutscene ends. AI that is beyond pathetic, yet sometimes takes over half a magazine of rifle ammunition (confirmed shots, blood splatter and everything) to kill a single enemy. Voice quality so unprofessional you can hear the microphone clip in almost all of Dexter's lines.Complete mess of a story, ranging from ""let's bring this up then forget it 5 seconds later"" to ""the civil war-era guy can adapt to future tech immediately"" to ""guy from new york yells at a russian in english and they somehow understand each other"".You can adjust the (horrendously low, by default) FOV with ""set player.fov xx"" (which requires input every ♥♥♥♥ing time the game is started) , but prepare to watch your guy spontaneously grow a third arm when grenades are thrown.

And yes, that was PART of the war, not all of it. Although this game is not directly a WW1 game, it was what made be buy it. The time travel stuff is pretty interesting and the overall story is good. Though, some parts of the story I think was pretty lame. But overall, you should buy this game if you like history and a good ol' shoot everything you see.			",96,4,1,4,6,0,8

												I'm sad that there isn't a sale on this game anymore, but it's a pretty rediculous game. It's not the greatest game made in 2009, but it isn't the worst as to what X-play rated it as. The plot is like Timesplitters, except instead of going to multiple timelines you only go to four and that's it. Also the voice acting is that of the 90's video games just slightly better. The best part of the game is using future weapons in the Civil War and WW1. Even though the game can be janky as ♥♥♥♥ and it's kinda difficult later on in the game, it's still pretty fun.

												the concept is amazing, the story is great but some of the futuristic parts are awfully CGI'd. it's really fun and interesting and answers a lot of questions about warfaremy only gripe and its a game breaker was you have to complete the full game to access the interesting stuff. Like taking guns from other era's into battles. you are locked like a story until the end then you can take any load out into a battle.like an assault rifle from modern day into the civil war.there are parts in the story that allows this but its only for a limited amount of time. sometimes these people from the future come to get you and you have to kill them but they are so overpowered since you have a musket half the time and they have a rocket launcher. It makes the game so hard to complete. I ended up abandonning it because it got too farfetched in world war 1 and I just got save stuck before a huge fight with these future bosses and all I have was a pistol. There's no real point in buying this unless its super cheap or free.			",57,3,1,4,12,0,7

												 At long last, I know what it would be like to go into War tomorrow if I were Robert Downey JR. As I watched dozens of German WW1 troops spawn in, arms upraised, and drop onto a hill before charging our position, I manned the automatic gun. Streams of brilliant gunfire shot wildly, yet shocking accurately onto my foes, but there was no way to stem the tide! The huns breached the trenches and began firing at the fleeing men around me... Yet to a man, every German troop was looking straight at me! They shot with unnerving pin point precision, but never tore they eyes from me. This, my friends, is the Robert Downey JR war simulator. Enemies spew over the mud and blood, but despite aiming their guns at enemies, they all stare right at you in slack mouthed awe! I could almost hear the Germans whispering: ""Schauen Sie, Hände! Das ist Robert Downey JR! Nicht schießen, schauen Sie nur."" as they elbowed their friends in the ribs softly, not interrupting their gunfire as they smiled at me. Okay, okay, so there's more to this game then that... Here's some things to like: I got to kill toga clad civilians fleeing the Mt Vesuvius eruption with a flame thrower. That was a big'ol plus. I turned the tide of the American Civil War by introducing them to the automatic weapon. The game didn't give me a tumor of any kind, so that's pretty cool. Here are some things that weren't great: ""Mother""'s voice actor sounds like she's reading the news and weather. The levels, despite SEEMING to be large, open maps are, in reality, a series of straight lines with knee high fences keeping you from moving around enemy positions. The programming is a bit lack luster... For example, you can star reloading one weapon and switch to using another while it continues to reload on its own. This includes powder rifles that require powder, wadding, bullet and sabot all to be pounded down with a loading pole while your... Um... Other set of arms shoots your pistol? Stairs are sometimes only surmountable by jumping up them, which doesn't sound too bad, but when you're running backwards up them as you shoot at suicidal enemies that charge towards you and you suddenly stop in the open, letting round after round puncture your precious organs... Then you'll long for the days when stairs could be programmed correctly. Don't worry, though, your enemies have the same problem. Sadly, their solution is to phase halfway through the stairs themselves with only the tops of their heads showing and shower you in gunfire while they remain mostly unharmed by all but the luckiest attacks. In short, while being a time traveling Robert Downey JR, shooting Roman legionnaires with a machine gun SOUNDS awesome, you could instead take the $20 US asking price for this game, buy Iron Man and 300 on blu-ray, record footage from each and splice them together and watch that instead. ... Please leave a reply to this review with a link to the result if you've done that...			",96,14,0,25,5,2,23

												The worst possible game I've ever had the misfortune to play. The storyline was so bad it made my brain hurt. And from what I was told by one of the devs, they never got to put in what they wanted to. Alot of it was cut. Somehow I don't think it would have helped. Mowing down a bunch of Confederate soldiers with a future gun that auto locks on to targets is ridiculous. Avoid this like they avoided explaining how this was a good idea. Marty McFly did it better. 1/10			",146,8,1,22,21,0,36

												Once again, it's a cool game concept. Travelling through time, the possibility of playing through different eras of history and even pre-history, while occasionally bringing in weapons from a different time period to help you out, all within a first-person shooter seems like it would be hard to screw up.HOWEVER. This game doesn't capitalize enough on its own ideas. For example, in total there are only four points in history you visit: The American Civil War, both World Wars, and Pompeii at the end. Why can't we go visit the Roman Empire? Or see the Peloponnesian Wars? Hell, why not go investigate Ancient Egypt? Or if you really want to go nuts, take the player back to pre-historic times, like the Jurassic era. Running away from a T-Rex because you're armed with nothing but a tree branch and some rocks could make for an interesting chase sequence!On top of that, I noticed that a lot of the time, NPCs kept walking straight through walls, sometimes even getting stuck in them. Another time, an enemy was actually shooting me through a ROCK. And if THAT weren't enough, the game ends on a friggin' cliffhanger that is highly unlikely to ever be resolved, because I doubt the developers (if they're even still around) are going to release a sequel. Overall, it's a mediocre title that could have been fantastic, had they simply gave it a bit more effort and imagination.			",446,123,3,52,29,1,29

												This is a really cool game with a decent story. It is better than that of the average FPS. This game also has mod tools that you can download. Please give us a sequal, The civil war parts were awesome!			",301,27,0,37,25,0,34
