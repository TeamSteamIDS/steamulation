												I received Iron Grip: Warlord as a gift and it was such a fun surprise for me to play - I had no preconceptions, nor read any reviews or even the game synopsis. First recommendation: go into this game for the coop, with friends! The gameplay is smooth - no lagging no matter how many units or what manner of chaos and mayhem is going on on my screen (this alone is amazing to me as I have a less than desirable gaming setup at the moment). It is challenging non-stop, engaging action with clever AI, hilarious game messages, heroically brutal demises, great weaponry/ defenses/ upgrades, and beautiful scene design for its time - some of the detail is really impressive. It is one of the best blends of tower defense, FPS and action gameplay in one game I've encountered.Propaganda radio FTW   9/10			",257,121,0,66,43,2,56

												Iron Grip is another example of a game that is great, but multiplayer-focused with under-developed AI teammates to force people to jump into multiplayer (which is now, *drumroll*, dead). The reason why I would not recommend this game is because the multiplayer is dead (which is understandable since it is an old game) and playing singleplayer is a frustrating experience at medium and above difficulty because of lack of Team AI competence. Enemy AI is not bad, they work in groups and try to protect their Generals, but Team AI is way too under-developed, they totally ignore the RTS part of the game and they don't do teamwork at all (except when it comes to repairing player's buildings).Afterall the price isn't that high, so I would still encourage you to try this game out either solo or multiplayer, IF you have some friends who are willing to buy and play it that is.Many gamers nowadays somehow disagree with this, but the singleplayer is the main requisite for a finished and ever-lasting product. Shame a great game like Iron Grip with good potential didn't have a solid playerbase and AI improvements. I wish the devs would return and make another Iron Grip, or just update this one. That would make one hell of a comeback.EDIT: I tried playing multiplayer with a friend of mine, but it didn't go too well. The game has stability issues and ping jumps from 50 to 200 all the time.

												This game is amazing. When looking into the game and reasearching it I knew what I was buying. The basic premise is to hold out a stronghold and kill the enemy commander enough times to make their moral go down. From a first glance the graphics are not amazing and the AI is, lets say it, mentally handicaped... severly. But that was the intention. It is best to play with a group of friends, not alone in a basement. The RTS feature of placing manned guns and traps is awesome and the adrenaline felt ingame is equally amazing. There is also a decent variaty of weapons. The game is only 8$ so don't complain if you don't like it.Do not buy this game if you are expecting this to be 100% Cod or Battlefield grade awesome. It is fun, mindless shooter best played with good friends and a good drink.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly don't know why this game has such a seemingly low metascore, because I find it very fun. The bad part is no one really plays it, so unless you convince some friends to buy it you're going to be playing solo. Which is VERY hard (impossible, really) on anything but the easy difficulties.All in all, it's a very enjoyable game in my opinion and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS and tower defense games.

												Basically, this game is a mix of Tower Defense and FPS, with a button you can press to see in RTS mode, which you use to build towers and rebuild your stronghold. The main portion of the game is basically setting up your towers to defend yourselves from waves of enemies. Well it isn't the most unique thing to do, the inclusion of FPS elements keeps it fresh.Plus, with your friends, this game can be a LOT of fun.The graphics aren't that great, and the gameplay isn't too unique, it is a barrel of fun, even with bots.P.S. SCREW YOU METACRITIC! Always giving low scores to indie games and giving every triple A game a 100.			",102,13,13,15,7,2,11

												I used to play Iron Grip with my little brother quite a bit around 8 years ago.  Was a great time waster (turning on the xmas option made us both laugh til our stomachs hurt).First off this game is very not serious.  To make it plain as day, this game is almost like a cross between Quake 2 and TFC (engineer class only).  You earn money from shooshting (yes it's totally a word... Austin Powers 3 damnit!) bad guys who are trying to invade your... country?  You use that money to magically make yourself more and more like rambo... or instead building bunker style turrets that shoosht the badguys, kinda.Pretty much most of the game you run around using rather stiff guns to blow appart baddies, most of which run the gambit almost like a weird tower defence.  Your towers you can build are pretty 'bleh' as they are easy to destroy and have terribly firing arcs.  Depending on the map you will have random objectives that will annoyingly take you away from defending the base, and in most cases will cause you to die, alot.But, once you load the game up with a few friends it suddenly becomes a riot.  So if you plan to grab this game on a whim, grab a few more copies and share it with some friends.Otherwise the toy soldiers win.  And nobody likes that.			",225,45,3,57,54,5,59

												This game is surprisingly good. The only problem is that it is very outdated. If only its developers stopped focusing on other failed projects and promoted this game properly, they'd get somewhere. This is a gem of a game, as what they did was they took tower defense, threw in some FPS, sprinkled some RTS, and wrapped the whole in a deep game world (the rest of the games have disappeared; there was Marauders and Lords of War... they all tied in with each other and you could even earn benefits between games).In the end, if you've got some money to spare, buy this when it's on sale and just give it a single-player whirl. It's worth your time just to check it out for a few bucks. Otherwise, old maps and empty servers makes this co-op game not very co-op, unless you have a bunch of friends online with the game too.

												Set in a dieselpunk world, It is a first-person shooter combined with some real-time strategy elements, Gameplay is very unique, fun and enjoyable, It has artful diesel punk world and shivering atmosphere, Soundtracks & Gameplay with the graphics everything suits together very well.While playing in FPS mode you can go to RTS mode and there you can set turrets, anti-tanks and traps, and you can upgrade them if you want. Your main objective is defending your town from invading enemies so there will be many waves of enemies (depending on difficulty you have set).If you like something different especially a fast paced FPS with different unique elements you should definitely try it!One more thing though, i believe metascore isnt fair so dont let it fool you.

												ANGRY RANT BEFORE REVIEW STARTS HERE:Ignore all reviews complaining about graphics, as they have absolutely no understanding as to when this game was made. Also, ignore those reviews from people with less than an hour played. In it's time, they were the best graphics around. And really, if you need good graphics for you to enjoy a game, that's pathetic. Addressing those who have played less than an hour: Obviously you do not understand the game at all. Reading your reviews, I see you have absolutely zero understanding as to how the game works. It's not a mistake that the enemies are blue and your team red. And really, who cares?ANGRY RANT OVERSure, it's graphics aren't that great compared to modern times, but it's still a great game. I enjoy it both singleplayer and multiplayer, though multiplayer is obviously more fun. This is a game where you can try to beat it, or you can just go around through the tunnels on each map and collect resources, then build up a defense so the enemy can't destroy your stronghold (What you are protecting) and then just screw around. The enemies are large in number, but are very easy. One shot from your basic musket will almost always down them. Overall, it's pretty balanced and can at times provide for a hard gameplay. The different difficulty levels definitely can make it a challenge for even the most experienced of players. 9/10			",138,35,6,11,12,3,14

												Great game for playing with friends. We use it at a LAN a lot and for newer players to the PC gaming world it is fun and not as intimidating as vs games. For seasoned PC gamers, it offers a nice blend of RTS and FPS. Those who love RTS can spend all their money and time building turrets and those who just like to run and gun can get their fix. Best part is that they all help their team as much as each other so it's win-win all round. Graphics are a bit old, but fun gameplay accessible to all players makes it not that important.

												One of the most interesting games I've played in awhile.  Firstly, this is an FPS.  Secondly, it is also a simple strategy game.  Thirdly, it is around 800 mb of space.  Basically, you and your ""rebels"" fight off thousands of enemy imperial soldiers.  You must defend your rebel stronghold, while the enemy must kill it off.  The main game is in FPS mode.  Every player though, depending on how well they do, gains power.  With power you can buy traps, guns, bombs, support crates, turrets (both troop and vehicle), among other things.  The strategy mode isn't another main mode.  Rather every person has it with the press of a button.  You can still control your character's movement in this mode.  So if you want to plant a trap while running away from gunfire, you can do so.  The maps are set up so that attacks can come from any area, but you also have a good defense and each round is about 30 to 40 minutes of play.  You also have the option to repair anything, every character has molotovs, and every character has a knife, pistol, and rifle.  Buying weapons with ""power"" is what customizes your character.  Once you buy something in terms of weapons or bombs, you have it forever.  When you die, you respawn with those armaments.  Spawned turrets have unlimited ammo, and health that you can repair as well.It is really fun to play this game.  It isn't graphically advanced, but it doesn't need to be.  A very simple strategy/fps game with a tower defense like mechanic, that doesn't involve any towers.			",126,32,3,20,12,0,24

												Iron Grip: Warlord is a game built on cool concepts that could have used refinements, and a bit more variety. I assume you saw that it's an FPS/Tower Defense game. There's not a whole ton of these, so it's good to see another option. Iron Grip: Warlord is neither among the best FPSes nor the best TDs. In a number of ways it falls short. Sound design is nothing special. The sound and music isn't bad, but it's not memorable at all. However, the game has a cool aesthetic. The visuals aren't very unique or inspired, but at least seeing some airships and soldiers in suits of conquistador or gladiator armor and stuff like that strays from the norm and sets itself apart a bit.When it comes down to gameplay, I also have mixed feelings. It's tough and punishing, sometimes fun and sometimes bland. But at least it engages you. If you don't carefully plan, and then react on the fly (you get a bit of time before the first wave and then it's continuous), you will fail. The game allows you to rapidly switch between your FPS view (where you'll do all your combat) and your overhead build view (where you'll build one of a few buildings or traps), and it's kind of engrossing that the game doesn't give you any shortcuts around the map, or allow you to take breaks. The game plays at a rapid pace if you're on a small map. Enemies are good shots, and numerous. You need to choose your emplacements carefully, and your personal upgrades perhaps even more carefully. There's nothing worse than picking up a sniper rifle and shotgun and not being able to take down tanks, or any troops within long or close range. The build view is okay I suppose, it just takes a second to get used to. You'll understand if you try the game. My major complaint with building though is a slightly obvious one. There's not enough options. That really is dissapointing when you realize that there's essentially two towers-one for people, and one for vehicles- and two traps-one for people, and one for vehicles- and two assist buildings- a supply building, and a rebuild for your base. So it's very limited. You'll also find yourself counting on any member of your team to keep themselves upgraded and reinforced, because if a path even slightly starts to fall, you're screwed. Medium difficulty, is perhaps a little bit more than one might expect. You have to juggle a lot of problems at once. When it comes down to it, there's not a ton of enemy variety, but the ones that are in the game feel interesting enough(well except the cannonfodder), filling roles between being tanks, asassins, supports, and generally tough commanders. So, in summary, the game is not going to blow you away by any measure. That said, for the price it's pretty fair. $8 for a decent co-op game isn't a bad deal, even if you only play a little bit. Just make sure you play co-op, as bots can't compare and very few people play online. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RTS+FPS?  Somehow it works very well.  The game is a mixture of Steampunk FPS and Defense Tower RTS.  You upgrade your character and towers while battling it out with an army trying to crush your command center.  The game wins or loses with your morale, lose too much of it and you lose, take out enough of their commanders and soldiers and you win.  The game can get very repetitive, but it is good to load up again every couple months.  I hope they make a sequel sometime in the future, because this could use a nice facelift and some new features.			",577,144,16,64,42,7,116

												Iron Grip: Warlord does a good job of meshing FPS and RTS elements into an enjoyably hectic experience. FPS mode is simple enough to allow a focus on tactics and RTS mode is simplified enough to allow a player's skill to make a difference. Its upgrade system combines old-style models and weapons with modern weapons and structures that give it an intriguing steampunk-Russian sort of feel. Players become part of a resistance against a larger, invading force. Vastly outnumbered, they team up to defend strategic structures from various footsoldiers, tanks, and mechanical walkers while trying to hunt down enemy officers. There is a single resource (""power"") that is generated through any act that's beneficial for the resistance. Though the game features an individual score system the actual match outcome is determined by a kind of team score, referred to as ""morale"". When one team loses morale entirely the match is over.  If you've ever wondered about it, Warlord might be worth another look.			",349,50,5,41,19,1,32

												After many tries, me and two friends have managed to win all maps on God Difficulty (without multipliers). The core of the game is defending your base with towers, and the towers from defenses-eating tanks.We've loved this game due to the amounts of strategies and fine tunning you can make to win in what seemed to be impossible (3 on God). If you like a style of game where you can try again and again and again, making small changes each attempt  in order to find a winning strategy, Iron Grip might be a good try.Overall, the game is dead. No online players, only a few maps and no workshop integration. If you're not insane to try to beat each map at the highest difficulty you can, skip this game. You'll quickly see all the maps and the main features the game has to offer - and then, grow tired. Since there's no new updates and maps, and no workshop, that'll be all that there is to the game.

												The best steampunk/oilpunk rts/fps tower defense out there yet. Everyone who wants fast paced action with massive enemy waves of Conscripts, Minigunners, Suicude Bombers, Flamers, Rocket launchers and Officers should buy this game.			",206,7,2,21,15,0,47

												To be honest, this game is rather strange. It doesn't reall seem to have cover and you frequently randomly die. Some of the AI are really over powered and some are completely under. The graphics are completely outdated, but all in all I give this game a solid 9/10. It has fantastic coop and is really a fun game. I have oversaturated myself with the game. I can't think of many higher praises than that.			",296,61,12,50,27,4,72

												2/10. This is one of the first games I bought on Steam, probably around 2009 or 2010. It had problems with randomly crashing in the middle of a battle and erasing all progress. When I played it again in 2014, it still had problems with random crashes in single player campaign mode. The single overriding factor in rating a game is that the game can be played. If the game can't be played, it's a brick. For the twenty or so minutes that the game is available to play, it is fun. Kind of repetitive, and annoying to try to find the target you're supposed to kill in order to win a round, but fun nonetheless. There was an expansion pack called Scorched Earth that used to be available. It's no longer available in the Steam store or for purchase from anywhere else, which means that content is permanently inaccessible to people who didn't buy it when it was available.

												Great game had great time playing its fun after you learn to play. Graphics arent great but nicely done textures are cool and artful, It just suits for its kind. It reminds me of old good games and it has a dark atmosphere. Its just an awesome game who needs more players and community, Also it has singleplayer mode which means if you dont like online gaming you can play alone without internet. I rate this piece of art as excellent.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Pretty fun game after the first 15 plays. Gets boring especially without friends on. Only 8 maps makes this game a bit of a letdown, hopefully they add dlc or maps later on, otherwise it is an interesting concept of adding BOTH tower defense and FPS together in a switch and go game style.

												This is a surprisingly good game! A mixture of FPS and tower defense, you can spend your funds upgrading yourself, your weapons, or building and upgrading towers, or any combination thereof. This produces a more unique mobile and stationary set of strategies that I really enjoy. Plus the steampunky style is a nice big win. Get some friends together and defend yourselves!

												An interesting mix of tower defence and first-person shooter, Iron Grip doesn't excel at either but is decent overall. I got this as part of a bundle deal and didn't have high hopes for it. I initially wanted more tower defence and less manual shooting but I started to enjoy it once I grasped the basics. The multiplayer isn't completely dead yet either, I found a few people playing on one of the default servers.			",467,248,13,72,66,5,70

												Great concept ruined by a bad engine. The graphics often feel ""zoomed out"" making it hard to aim with many weapons. Although the devs have released some solid updates since launch (better grafix options, steam cheevos, etc.), there is a lack of diversity in maps. This plays out like Killing Floor but with defensive structures you can build. However, most of the maps have 2 main entry points to your base plus one underground/through buildings entrance in the back making the maps feel repetitive.If you have some friends who are interested there's a 4 pack available. It's a nice diversion with friends but don't expect to spend more than 1-2 hours on it at a time because of frustrating technical shortcomings and boring maps.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Played the same map for like 50 minutes before finally beating the enemy back far enough to win, one of the longest tower defence style matches I've ever dealt with and enjoyed every moment of it. The AI is relatively smart and each has their own personality on what they do, however they hardly ever build anything so you'll have to cover that front. They will repair it though if damaged. Overall the game matches are extremely fun alone, and even moreso with friends. There's a lot of strategy involved in where placements of turrets and AT-Turrets should be making every choice vital to the success or failure of the match. Losing a stronghold is not something to take lightly as it will likely end the game for you. Highly recommended, much fun with friends and alone with it being far more challenging alone!

												Iron Grip Warlod is unique among FPS's. What i found the most interesting was the ability to create a turret defense while engaging in first person defense as well. Despite being severely dated in terms of all aspects, it is still a very fun game to play during free time, as the hordes of enemies are pleasing to watch as they get mowed down by machine gun fire.

Iron Grip: Warlord  Field Rating Review   Graphics 5 Iron Grip isn't the prettiest thing around. The graphics seem to be a secondary thought to the gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not a good thing either. They're not so bad that you won't want to play, but you definitely won't be saying to yourself ""Man this looks great!"" The interface is also a little bit clunky, and you'll likely struggle until you get the hang of it.   Gameplay 8 A very unique combination of Tower Defense/FPS is what makes Iron Grip really stand out and shine. With several weapons to choose from, you have plenty of ways to cut down the onslaught of soldiers marching towards your base. The selection of buildings you can create for your base however, leave a little to be desired. Some more diversity would be welcome here. That being said, you are able to upgrade some of the buildings you create, to really start cutting down the enemy. Some maps come across brutally hard, others feel strangely easy. Be sure to use the alternate routes to get behind the enemy and wreack havoc!   Story N/A Aside from a generic background (x vs y), there isn't much to be seen here.   Multiplayer 8 Hours and hours of fun with your friends as you try out the different maps and strategies to figure out how to survive massive numbers of troops and tanks being thrown your way.   Replayability 7 Iron Grip: Warlord suffers a little bit in replayabilty due to the lack of diversity in the buildings you can create. However, this being tower defense, that is to be mostly expected. It could also do with a few more maps.  Regardless of these facts however, Iron Grip certainly beckons you back into the fray with your friends, with lots of ways to defend and arm yourselves.   Overall 7.5/10 Iron Grip: Warlord does not disappoint. If you are a Tower Defense fan, you don't want to miss this one. For those of you that aren't Tower Defense fans, don't worry, I'm not either and this game was still a blast for me. At times it can feel frustratingly difficult, but the feeling of victory after you've spent time trying to figure out how to defend yourself negates any frustration you'll face on the way there.

												Graphics are terrible, looks like it was from 2002 not 2008. Also, there is no campaign, just playing the 9 maps against AI. One reviewer was right, easy mode is too easy and medium jumps up way too much and is too hard alone. The game misses in both first person and building aspects. In first person, you buy a guy but run out of bullets right away and then there is no infinite ammo or picked up ammo. The upgrades you spend a ton on yourself seem to make almost no difference, making for a lackluster system. You have to rebuy the gun, which seems like a waste and poorly made. As for building. It is the worst part. There are basically 2 towers total and then some traps. You can upgrade towers but the lack of variety makes for each level to be the same. You start with barely any money and make so little in game and its over soo quickly you have enough time to build and upgrade like 2 towers. Also, the waves never stop and the guys come in giant packs, giving you no time to rest and build and upgrade towers. For no apparent reason in some unobstructed parts of the map you cannot build a tower but then a little bit up you can. Some of the levels are soo terribly done I couldnt even build an antitank tower in the lane because there were no spots to (huh?). Also, in building mode you are not looking over the battlefield but are still controlling your person top down. That means you have to move along the path and can get stuck in buildings like him. It also means you move slowly around the level and cant pan it because you cant move over buildings. Also while trying to build in the battlefield your guy can die, which doesn't make sense since its building mode and thats not how TD games work. In some levels it only shows one specific clear path in blue but apparently their will suddenly be more and you're screwed and can never catch up. The pathing makes no sense as each level has little houses and stuff they can run through so you blocking off a way seems to do nothing. The ""eliminate the spy"" part is also stupid as you look and never see anyone on the map that doesnt move and you have no way to figure out where he is. You cant just run into their wave and spot him so it makes no sense. The levels are pretty boring and with the same guns, enemies, towers, and upgrades, it gets repetitive right away. Finally, the ""morale"" is poorly done. I would fight them off for 20 min and their morale wouldn't change. Yes killing commanders helps, but they would randomly gain morale even though they were just starting a wave and I had wiped out their last one. Some levels last 5 min, others 30, but for no specific reason other than their morale moves differently for an inexplicable reason. Nice idea, but failed execution.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												Tower defense with first person shooter elements. I think that's a good description for this game. You basically build towers, enemies will come and then it's your job to hold them off. You can switch between bird eye's view and first person. So the bird eye's view is for building the towers, the first person view is for actively killing enemies (alone or in co-op). It's a decent game, but it's very buggy and unpolished. Plus, there's no eye candy to be found here; the game uses, if I recall correctly, the first Unreal Tournament engine. It's an original idea though, but an idea is unfortunately not enough these days...[Rating: 62/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A tower defense game where you have a group of people, or officers as the game calls it, but it's an FPS so your basically fighting an entire army alongside your few allies. At the start of a level you can build about 1 tower because you start with low resources, well that tower will get decimated in about 5 seconds. Unless you can 360 no scope an entire army in a few seconds, I wouldn't recommend this xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When you are admitted to a hospital, they place on your wrist a white wristband with your name on it. But there are other different colored wristbands which symbolize other things. The red wristbands are placed on dead people.There was one surgeon who worked on night shift in a school hospital. He had just finished an operation and was on his way down to the basement. He entered the elevator and there was just one other person there. He casually chatted with the woman while the elevator descended. When the elevator door opened, another woman was about to enter when the doctor slammed the close button and punched the button to the highest floor. Surprised, the woman reprimanded the doctor for being rude and asked why he did not let the other woman in.The doctor said, ""That was the woman I just operated on. She died while I was doing the operation. Didn’t you see the red wristband she was wearing?""The woman smiled, raised her arm, and said, ""Something like this?"" ",141,30,1,5,4,1,5

												What if you took the tower defense and first person shooter genre and mixed in a little steampunk, what would you get?Answer: Iron Grip: Warlords.You and up to 8 other players must hold out against an ever increasingly army while making that armies moral go down to zero, thus causing them to bomb the city instead of capturing it.As insane as that sounds, it is actually how you are supposed to win, you force the enemies to bomb the city and deny them any form of resource that they could have gotten from the city if they had captured it.Teamwork is important here as the enemies will use any possible way to try and get to your base and destroy your HQ, so watch the open doorways.Lay out turrets to take care of infantry and tanks, but watch out for the spidertanks that have the ability to fire mortar shells at you and your buildings.

												This is actually a pretty fun game once you get the hang of it, but it does have a slight learning curve. FPS with weapon upgrades and the ability to build gun turrets & traps. The goal is to defend your stronghold by fighting off massive hordes of confederate armies (and massive is an understatement). The movement speed makes it a real nice run and gun game, reminding me of Serious Sam. A decent variety of non-permanent weapons and perks means you have to rebuy them each game. Up to 8 man coop makes a good number for a friends game. Add achievements and alcohol and it's a blast.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												The program is a little clunky, but in game its fine and I've had loads of fun with it. The structure of the company that made it is a little odd. It's because of that that I doubt it will ever get additional maps beyond the 6 or 7 that it comes with. If they or anyone else ever make some sort of sequal to this game, it'd be awesome.

												It is fun and very intuitive and very unique but the graphics are getting dated, In my opinion I don't like the game engine used, I would've prefered the Unreal engine or something that doesn't have a ""look at me I'm sonic"" physics,edit//after playing this some more I have changed my mind about recomendation, for its price you actually get a decent game, it is fun and fast paced, it isnt a game where you need to read a text book about what a tower does or what works best against what enemy, theres two main tower types, vehicle and infantry, it has an easy upgrade system where each tower can be upgraded with one click, it has a decent amount of weapons and a very small variety of enemys, all in all this game is worth a try			",127,15,2,13,16,3,22

												Based off the Q3 engine means that you can bunny hop like a crack fiend. That aside this game involves FPS with RTS. You can take control of one guy in your fps mode but you can also build structures like ammo depot, tanks, and bunkers. For an attempt of mixing FPS with RTS the outcome well played.

												What if you took the tower defense and first person shooter genre and mixed in a little steampunk, what would you get?Answer: Iron Grip: Warlords.You and up to 8 other players must hold out against an ever increasingly army while making that armies moral go down to zero, thus causing them to bomb the city instead of capturing it.As insane as that sounds, it is actually how you are supposed to win, you force the enemies to bomb the city and deny them any form of resource that they could have gotten from the city if they had captured it.Teamwork is important here as the enemies will use any possible way to try and get to your base and destroy your HQ, so watch the open doorways.Lay out turrets to take care of infantry and tanks, but watch out for the spidertanks that have the ability to fire mortar shells at you and your buildings.

												First impressions: Wow, this is pretty cool! Shootin' doods, building little defenses, upgrading machine gun nests. The graphics are dated, the interface is old and the animations are clunky, but it reminds me of Battlefield 1942, with big, complicated maps, a wide variety of weapons and upgrades, and even a little tower defense building thrown in. Altogether a fun game, as long as I don't run into any game-breaking bugs. Cooperative and competitive play mean it's a pretty good deal, all told. 4/5			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

												This game is a quaint little mix of the FPS with the Tower Defense genere.  The graphics are highly stylised, reminding me somewhat of the gothic overtones seen frequently in games like Warhammer 40K.  However, don't expect things to be Oblivion beautiful; the engine does look a little dated.  The game is surprisingly difficult, too.			",183,33,0,52,40,0,64

												An F Load of fun.For a game so simple, Iron Grip: Warlord is easily one of the most ... intriguing games I've played recently.It is best not to think of it as an FPS but as a tower defence game with FPS mechanics. You rn around the battlefield constructing defences to protect your base while gunning down the enemy waves with the AI or a number of friends.While the enemy AI is foolish and quite hapy to just walk over clearly visible traps this is expected as they are acting just as enemy waves do in a normal tower defence game. Though some will occasionally break off from the rest just to suprise you.Ally AI is not fantastic but it doesn't get in the way and this game IS meant to be played with friends as opposed to computer AI.There is a story but it really just exists to segway between maps and bears no real significance. Thankfully the game doesn't really need a story so the fact there is one is a bonus.I give this game a seal of approval (^_^) 9/10			",115,56,4,29,57,1,48
