												An amazing game slaughtered on the PC. It's basicaly a direct port of Earthworm jim on the PC and DOS. From that you can expect all the problems that come with a port like this. No controller support, complicated keyboard settings, audio issues, slow down and many other things. Personally, you are MUCH..MUCH better off playing the Super Nintendo and Genesis originals, or the Wii virtual console version.If you can't get those then I would suggest Earthworm jim HD for the Xbox live arcade and Playstation network.Even if you're a hardcore PC gamer, you deserve alot better ports for a game like Earthworm jim.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												Earthworm Jim is the amazing game (and series), no doubts, but there is one very important thing you need to know:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAMIt is a horrible port, seriously, its bad on so many levels-Horribly emulated and you will have problems with controls-Horribly cut comparing to the SEGA and NES versions - music and levels are missing, and there is NO info about that on the steam page.-20$ for 3 bad ports is a rip-offIf you want to play this game, simply get SEGA or NES emulator and ROMs, so you could actually enjoy the game.I wish I could refund this game, but I bought the pack years ago before that new refund system and support refused to return my money when I bought it. I wrote a money back ticket half an hour after I bought the game, and they closed the ticket like a month later with something like *bad port is not our problem - no refund*Join my curator grouphttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/garbage_games_challenge#curation ",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												As a fan of Earthworm Jim growing up this is an interesting case of nostalgia hitting up with what amounts to a lousy port.Back in the SNES days Earthworm Jim was considered a fun game due to it's unique charm. Excellent gameplay, responsive controls, outrageous humor, terrific song and music, and fair difficulty. It's everything you want in a game, something that doesn't take itself too seriously and if you screwed up it wasn't the game's fault it's because you weren't good enough.Some are present here, however the port wasn't a clean one.Hit detection can be dodgy, missing levels, sounds that just aren't plumb there. Even among the poor ports out there this is probably the worst of the bunch.If you want to get Earthworm Jim, I'd recommend the SNES/Sega/SegaCD ports. You're missing out by getting this even if you are a fan of Earthworm Jim.			",49,8,0,5,2,3,8

												Ever wonder what a terrible port looks like, but never (thankfully) had the chance to see one for yourself? Buy this game. You can barely control Jim. It's like a normal game, but you have chopped off several random fingers, and struggle to do even the easiest things by squirming and contorting your body in an attempt to do so. This was nothing but a cash grab. The smallest amount of time was put into this version. I'm not asking for a AAA effort, but you know, let me aim diagonal up right for Chrissakes.

												I bought this Collection a long time ago before the though of refunds even be a thing,this trilogy is a compilation from the worst EWJ ports for PC.The first 2 games are butchered and lack the most basic levels that appear on every single version on the consols (including some of them that are on the pics show case leading to false advertisement) and uses an ""outdated"" DOSBOX emulation to play   .And the third game is just the cherry on the bitter cake since it universally sucked on both platforms that released.If you want a modern port to EWJ look for EWJ HD on 360 or PS3 or just look for that Special Edition  released on Windows 95/Sega CD that is better than this ""thing"",			",101,7,1,13,8,0,11

												This isn't the Earthworm Jim Special Edition for the PC, but its darn near close to it. This version of EWJ is using the Dos port but that doesn't mean that its terrible sense its using an older port. Infact it has a bit of everything from many ports of the EWJ games! Heck its using Special Editions soundtrack and revamps the Dos version to something completely different. Sure it may sound like this game is a monstrosity to mankind but Its the best port of Earthworm Jim that is still being distributed. Be thankful that this game can still be purchased to this day!In conclusion this port isn't perfect but its probably the best you can get right now at the moment, until interplay/shiny desides to re-release the special edition in all of its glory. I'd suggest getting this game/collection its well worth your time and money.			",231,29,1,12,5,4,12

												One of the funniest and best platform series of the 90s.  Srriously?? What worm wouldn't want to be this guy?  Ne way ...... I didn't have issues running it on my Windows XP system.  It has CD-Quality music, and the controls and gameplay were responsive when I used keyboard or joystick and I completed several challenging levels.  Fullscreen is broken, however (I checked and I couldn't fix it with dosbox).  You will need to use an external zoom app to view it larger.  Also, I found one glitch: at the beginning of the game when you need to launch a cow, make sure the cow is on-screen when you do so, or you'll be stuck, requiring a game restart.  Also, I bought the EJ 1, 2, and 3D bundle.  Although Steam lists the games separately in the library, Interestlingly, when I installed the first game, Steam downloaded the files for all 3 games.  When I installed the others, Steam quickly did a ""discovering existing files.""			",452,179,24,75,44,5,81

												Um, why are there so many bad reviews?This might just be a regular dosbox port of the dos version, but the dos version was probably the best aside from the Super ninteno and the Sega genesis versions.Normally, with fps games, I canNOT STAND DOSBOX. they have the absolute worse performace and quality and if you change the resolutions to anything higher than something really low, they make the game run at terrible perfomace.But with this game, that's not the case. It's the exact same dos version. Game runs surprisingly smooth and fluid, controls are easy and responsive, graphics and animations look great.As for the actual game, this should be a no brainer. I have yet to ever meet someone that dislikes this game. if they havent heard of it, I show them it and they become instantly hooked. Simple, fun, addictive gameplay. Platforming 2D greatness at its finest.The music is also amazing.For me this game has a ton of nostalgia, it consumed most of my childhood along with Doom, Blood, Turok, Sonic, and Spiderman games.Give it a shot, if you can get it on a super nintendo or a sega genesis that would be a better bet. but this one isn't bad at all, and works perfectly fine. and again I have no clue why the reviews are bad. This one works better than the gog version even! which is rare bc usually gog has the better support.The gog version works the same but the controls get unresponsive if more than 1 button is pressed at a time, some of the animations chop off, and it has a lag that makes it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to control. So if you're trying to pick between the gog version and this one; I'd say give this one a go. ",292,13,2,22,2,0,1

												Earthworm Jim Review:I'll first of all start by saying this is the MSDOS version so it runs on DOSBOX and I can't find any source ports for it.I hate how Steam shows the screenshots because the screenshots seem to have been taken using the Mega Drive/Genesis release because in the DOS version the picture of the gun on the ammo count is different from the one in the screenshots and they shown the Intestinal Distress level which isn't in the DOS version.But overall I call this version Average it is a good version but if you are an Earthworm Jim Newbie I suggest getting the Sega Mega CD/Sega CD or Windows 95 versions.I would take the Mega CD or Windows 95 version over this anyday but let's face it it isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.Overall if you are new I wouldn't get this version but it is still ok.5/10GROOVY!!!!

												As a Doug TenNapel fan, I felt obligated to aquire this game eventually. Until the day this review was writen, I've never played an Earthworm Jim game and I haven't sat down to a full run of the cartoon (At least not yet), but for years, Jim here has been a major curiosity to me. It wasn't until recently when I finally decided to get the game. The game itself is great once you find a comfortable enough configuration of the keyboard. The only real nitpick I have with it is that there's no full screen feature! Other than that, the choice is yours if you want to listen to the Negative side of the reviews. I didn't, and if I DID, I wouldn't be here leaving this review, now would I? I may be years late to the party for Earthworm Jim Mania (Much like I was for Sam & Max Mania), but I would sooner spend my entire fortune on a laboratory in the wilderness, swap hands with a demon and call a giant space eel to Earth before I let another year go by without adding him to my growing list of fandoms!

												I would recommend it IF you can adjust the configuration files. Otherwise, stay away and/or prepare to get a Steam refund. I posted instructions here to adjust them for EWJ1 and EWJ2:http://steamcommunity.com/app/38480/discussions/0/541907867782189431/The game was choppy. The controls weren't responsible at all. Audio had gaps. After the tweaks, it ran like it was supposed to, outside the occasional music gapping. The game itself seems like the CD version, and DOSBox is emulating a CD-Rom with audio tracks. I wonder if the newer DOSBox version has that fixedThis version has a trade-off. The music is recorded, unlike the SNES and Genesis versions. The music is also done really well. The graphics look better as well. You lose around 2 levels though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
