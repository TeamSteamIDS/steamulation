												Just wanted to say I really enjoyed this game, takes some time to get into and it was only during the last chapter that I found myself being more in control of hordes. If you have it play with some friends and it'll be awesome. I admit I went into it with an ""oh I'm playing an indie game"" kind of cautiousness but I'm really glad to say I was really impressed by the graphics, music and gameplay. Only encountered bug happened when I was using the Santa DLC, but other than that everything was smooth from start to finish. Graphics: Really good for any game of this price.Music: Is really funky or rock 'n roll depending on the setting and fits the game 100%, only wished they had a few more songs (just for the sake of wanting to hear more songs of the same style). Does not sound like some cheap soundtracks out there at all.Gameplay: There's friendly fire, but if you've played games like Aliens Swarm or some other top-down shooter with it you'll know what to be careful, you just need to communicate with your co-op partner. I used Mumble the whole time, but the in-game voice chat seemed fine when I tested it. Personally I think the running/dodging is a bit slow, which is my own preference and didn't affect my experience that much. Another thing is that it was really hard to control waves at first, which lead to me and my partner dying a lot but after playing to the second half of the campaign I learned how to kill them more easily with the gun that you start off with - pick them off one by one while emptying your bullets with them.There are weapons you can pick up during every level - they drop in boxes scattered around the level and re-drop after a while, which is useful if you're holding an area. There's an interesting variety of them and you get an achievement for picking up all kinds at least once. Enemies are pretty varied too and I had a lot of fun with them. In short:Pleasing to the eye?: YesMusic?: The soundtrack just screams good quality, not something like the 'hastily tossed together' type that some games, even ones with a higher price range, do. Personally I wish they had some more songs cause there's never too much of good music!Addictive or not?: I played through it in a few days, but playing with a friend is strongly recommended! It's a game I'd be willing to play again, but never by myself.Playtime: Around 5.5 hours for the campaign and there's also some other modes with continued waves of monsters, etc. All in all pretty good length and provides good entertainment.

Omnipresent boredom.Bunch of Heroes does not offend some reprehensible fatal mistakes, but at the same time with also absolutely nothing positive isn't surprising. It's obvious that the Bunch of Heroes is a low-budget production and not seeking to become the hit. Stages are boring, goals are repeated, but the struggle of the masses opponents turns out to be quite demanding. One of the few elements worthy of recognition in this game is impressive and colorful graphics. On the screen usually happens very much thanks to the constant explosions and dozens of enemies attacking us. Pretty good sound design also presents itself. Shots sounds correctly, like explosions grenades and tear zombies. This does not change the fact that Bunch of Heroes is a game of poor, simple and rather not worth much attention. Theoretically everything is as straight as the structure of the flail.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												I was one of those fools who picked this game up during a christmas sale where they gave out free stuff for achieving things in games you owned.  I miss those days even if they were shameless reasons to make you buy games.This game has bad reviews for a reason.  I wasted hours trying to get that achievement and never did.  It was impossible to keep enough people together and my biggest issue was the exponetially increasing respawn rate.die once, 20 seconds, okay, 40 seconds, um, alright, 80 seconds, seriously, 160 second, what the, 320, ARE YOU KIDDING ME.trust me, after multiple attempt for one silly achievement it getss annoying.The game has little depth, boring combat and was barely worth playing even with good friends.  don't ever buy this crap.  Even if it's free.well, maybe if it's free and you want to punish yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PresentationGame is played in a third person perspective with cartoony animations. Makes the game humorous.GraphicsGraphics are cartoony and polished. The game doesn't look ugly so thats a good thing.GameplayIn BOH, you need to complete objectives in 3 campaigns by either rescueing girls and defend a house from away from a bunch of zombies. There also is a survival mode. BOH can be played with 3 other online players.OverallBunch of Heroes is another cheap indie title but it kills some time when your really bored. The game can get boring for the lack of content though. 7.5			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												This game is one of the worst top-down shooters of all time. The enemies are boring, the music is dull, and the action is dumb. It is lazy game design at its worst. I only got this for the steam badge thing that was going on at the time and hated playing the game that now, 2 years after that Christmas achievement was being given out, I am giving it a negative rating. Only buy this game if you are making a top-down shooter and want to see exactly what NOT to do. This isn't even funny-bad, it's just boring and a slog.Don't buy this game.			",241,40,2,31,20,5,29

The controls were not refined and we frequently experienced ""fatal"" bugs. The game would also randomly crash on multiple computers. Yeah....Can't in good conscience recommend this title.

												Oh my god this game is fu­cking unplayable pig­s­hit. Imagine Smash TV / Total Carnage / Robotron 2084 where you can be hurt by your own rockets' splash damage, and enemies have guns that fire relatively quick-moving bullets. Also imagine that your gun requires reloading. This game is f­ucking dogs­hit singleplayer, and I guess you can sorta play it multiplayer, except there are literally tons of games that are more fun so you might as well play those games. This game is so fu­cking awful. With game designers like this roaming the streets of Argentina it's hard not to root for another Dirty War.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/111400		

basic arcade top down shooter.the game is geared more for you and some friends  to play some co-op.you kill stuff, do objectives, grab weapons, blow some stuff up, and fight bosses.crates drop health or weapons with a set ammo that once used up you'll drop the gun and enemies drop health or energy for your special, you can also find turrets to help defend an area.you chose 1 of 4 character (with dlc its 5+a new outfits for each of the main 4) to play alone or with upto 4 friends and they each have a different special move.there are 3 areas with 3 maps each (9 maps in all) +1 survival map (2 with the free dlc).the 3rd level in each area will have a boss at the end.Missions consist of destroy object X, carry cheerleader to Y, & stand at a location for Z sec. also there is no real story outside the text on the loading screens.

												Fun things you can learn about Bunch of Heroes when played at 0.5x speed:- Your shots aren't missing, the hitboxes don't match up with the (incredibly ugly) models. The laser manages to go through things and not damage them at times. (The laser fires a single beam straight through everything in its path. This is p. egregious when a glowing trail is fading and enemies are unscathed in the middle)- The enemies get more invincibility frames than you do.- Even when given twice the time to trigger, achievements rarely pop properly.- Some of the enemies actually fire completely independent of the direction they face in. A few spawned pointing south, I'd run around them as they finished an animation, and BLAM shotgun from the eyes in the back of their head.- It's still not worth a) paying for b) playing at all or c) even trying when sites like Kongregate or Armor Games have 500 ♥♥♥♥ing games that play better than this in FLASH (probably with better art design) for free			",2446,961,90,309,287,27,386

I felt no desire to play through the single player campaign, and the multiplayer is just as stale. For the $2 I paid for it, it's not bad.

												brunch of herros is a game made by valve and published by ea. it's about 4 people finding out that indie games should accually be fun for once. at the end of the game, you uninstall the game to save your hard drive. crunch of negros a great game with a great ending. i wish there were more co-op games with 4 people, it's very primitive and rare in modern games.

												I purposely bought this for the Steam Holiday Achievement metagame, and so far it has annoyed me endlessly. I'm not going to review this because the way it handles keyboard and mouse camera movement literally makes me sick to my stomach via confusing and sudden top-down camera whiplash. So essentially, I spent $2.50 on digital ipecac. But I will say that the hour I spent playing survival mode for the achievement indicates that this game is not worth the nausea at all. Don't Buy This, Not Even For An Achievement.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												I could go on about how bland and poorly executed this game is, but I'd rather just share this story:At one point I died because I lost control of my character and he backed into a group of enemies.  While waiting for the respawn timer,  I left my house to go to the 7-11 down  the street for a loaf of bread, came back to my house, and used the bread to make a sandwich.  When I returned to my computer with my sandwich, I respawned.			",82,16,0,13,3,1,9

												Fun things you can learn about Bunch of Heroes when played at 0.5x speed:- Your shots aren't missing, the hitboxes don't match up with the (incredibly ugly) models. The laser manages to go through things and not damage them at times. (The laser fires a single beam straight through everything in its path. This is p. egregious when a glowing trail is fading and enemies are unscathed in the middle)- The enemies get more invincibility frames than you do.- Even when given twice the time to trigger, achievements rarely pop properly.- Some of the enemies actually fire completely independent of the direction they face in. A few spawned pointing south, I'd run around them as they finished an animation, and BLAM shotgun from the eyes in the back of their head.- It's still not worth a) paying for b) playing at all or c) even trying when sites like Kongregate or Armor Games have 500 ♥♥♥♥ing games that play better than this in FLASH (probably with better art design) for free			",2446,961,90,309,287,27,386

												Вся эта феерическая ахинея, усиленная бодрым хард-роком, напоминает лучшие образцы трэш-кинематографа — «Нападение помидоров-убийц» и «Нацисты-серфингисты должны умереть». Сам геймплей поначалу только усиливает это ощущение. И на Земле, и на негостеприимной Красной планете наши герои жгут, взрывают и всячески уничтожают толпы ходячей мертвечины и ее приспешников. Врагов много, на любой вкус: тут вам и радиоактивные зомби, и зомби со штыками, и особенно крупные нацистские генералы, и инопланетяне на летающих тарелках, и какие-то зомби-циклопы, и даже агрессивные курицы-убийцы.Конечно, игру здорово выручает кооператив, где, в отличие от сингла, плечом к плечу могут сражаться все четверо героев. Но и тут не все идеально. Нет краеугольного камня любой совместной драки — возможности прийти на помощь павшему или раненому товарищу. Герой лечится и возрождается сам, а когда умрет три раза, то просто покидает игру. Из-за таких вот недоработок и испарившейся на полпути фантазии Bunch of Heroes и превращается из потенциально феерической и дико увлекательной трэш-комедии в просто забавную аркаду на вечер-другой.

Also the amount of content in terms of levels/maps is a bit low even for the current (Oct, 4 2014) price of 5 usd. Might be worth alone, def worth with friends.			",642,169,18,57,56,10,122

												Rescue cheerleaders, destroy zombifiers, and protect areas at all costs! These are just some of the repetitious objectives you will find in Bunch of Heroes. It's an okay 4 person coop top view shooter that lacks a few key ingredients: 1) You better invite your own friends because no one plays this, 2) The weapons are underpowered (or the aliens are overpowered) so killing one alien takes a lot of bullets, 3) No weapon upgrades.There is a small assortment of guns, but they are really stingy on the ammo so most of the time you are left with the default weapon running away while you repeatedly reload. Health packs and power ups seem few and far between as well.The game could have been improved by offering a tiered difficulty system depending on the number of players in the game, much like Borderlands. It does have game controller support and achievements which is a plus, but in the end, I recommend avoiding this one.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												WTF is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ they let anyone make games these days? just another run of the mill zombie shooter with a top down view. The difference is the game feels very clunky and the objectives are the same over and over even the cheer leaders look exactly the same on the plus side the chinese chick can shoot a fireball as her ultra move which looks pretty neat....thats about the only cool feature of this game the music is incredibly annoying and the zombies are more of a joke than anythingAvoid unless you pick it up on sale which i unfortunatly did not :( 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bunch of Heroes is probably the latest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game to have graced the indie scene. This game literally has no balance between single player and multiplayer, the game will always assume that there are 4 people playing and therefore the game will always scale towards 4 people. This makes single player survival pretty much impossible, not only that, but the gameplay itself is monotonous and utterly trivial. The special ability of each character is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will get you killed almost every time. The entire game mechanics is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The only few useful guns in this entire game is the laser gun, rifle, chain gun, and one gun that shoot sparkly missiles. You don’t regenerate health, mob variety is ok, but their artificial intelligence is laughable at best. Save your money and don’t buy this disgrace of an indie game. It is very unlikely that my review of this game will change after I beat the campaign.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Pretty basic twin-stick style shooter. Apparently fails to grasp that people playing a shooter want to, y'know, shoot - so hobbles you with low ammo on the decent weapons and constant reloads on the basic pea-shooter. Tedious. The art design is nice enough but it's not worth buying, even heavily reduced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never touched this game because of 2011 Winter Sales. There was an achievement event those days and somehow i get this game and started to hunt an exact achievement. I formed a party with some unknown guys; i've literally wasted my time because getting this achievement wasn't so fun. And then, this silly game didn't count my achievement, even i did it properly.After a while, tried the game again but no... That wasn't fun at all. Then, uninstalled it... maybe forever.

												Do not waste your time with this game. This is one of the worst games I have ever played on Steam. The controls are clunky and the music, enemies and artstyle are all very uninspired. The difficulty ramp up is very slow and they don't introduce enough new gameplay elements to keep the game interesting.If you are looking for games of this ilk, you can do so much better than this. Alien Swarm, for example, is infinitely better than this, and it's a free game.			",382,100,10,53,21,3,52

												I'm not going to say that there is nothing redeeming about this game. It is fun to just kill zombies and aliens willy nilly. However this is completely lost in a horrible re-spawning system where every time you die, the wait to re-spawn doubles, friendly fire that is completely unavoidable and unable to turn off, half your weapons cause exploding damage that pretty much means you will hit one of your friends and a complete lack of healing. I played the game on easy and spent more time dead than alive because apparently difficulty doesn't matter in this game. You will die.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Isometric shooter, really nothing that makes it stand out.  It has four character classes which other than slight variations in the special attacks pretty much play exactly the same.  There is no leveling or skill building of any kind.  No local multiplayer, online multiplayer is nonexistent and I can't blame anyone for not playing this.  There are also several broken and unattainable achievements.  I doubt those will ever be fixed since the game has been out for 3 years now and the developer hasn't corrected them by now.  If it wasn't for the Holiday Sale of 2011 I would not own this game.  I highly recommend anyone even slightly thinking about buying this game to pass.			",115,25,2,17,25,0,17

												Another game where using the interface is about as pleasant for me as ramming a rusty nail through my palm. It looks fun and it probably also is - for those people who can use monkey controllers. For people like me, who require keyboard+mouse input, this game is unbearable. I tried jumping in to get the holiday achievement and failed miserably. Then I tried the campaign and failed even more miserably before getting anywhere. After about two minutes into each try I was frustrated and annoyed.It is not that the game fails absolutely - I just never got a chance to see if it is any good. The interface is simply keeping me out.			",180,23,4,34,12,1,71

												This may look like a fun and colorful arcade shooter but it's actually a poorly realized mess with frustrating gameplay mechanics. Also, the developers of this game haven't done a damn thing to support this game. Get 'Nation Red' instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks beautiful but plays horrible. Single or multiplayer it doesn't matter....it sucked.  The game was a cash grab by the dev/pub that fell short on promises.  Avoid this game.			",113,21,3,21,11,0,27

												No no no no no. Don't get it. Total garbage. Waste of money.2011 Christmas achievement was ""beat wave 20 on survival mode"" but getting past wave 4 on the easiest difficulty is ridiculously challenging enough.♥♥♥♥ this game, and ♥♥♥♥ the developers.			",354,90,10,43,20,4,51

												A fairly challenging game that doesn't take itself too seriously, but the missions are repetive in their nature, and most of the achievements requires a notable amount of grinding to accomplish (beat x enemy y 1000 times). Only buy if it's a discount.			",64,25,3,10,2,0,7
