												Midkine (MDK) also known as neurite growth-promoting factor 2 (NEGF2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MDK gene.Midkine is a basic heparin-binding growth factor of low molecular weight, and forms a family with pleiotrophin (NEGF1, 46% homologous with MDK). It is a nonglycosylated protein, composed of two domains held by disulfide bridges. It is a developmentally important retinoic acid-responsive gene product strongly induced during mid-gestation, hence the name midkine . Restricted mainly to certain tissues in the normal adult, it is strongly induced during oncogenesis, inflammation and tissue repair.MDK is pleiotropic, capable of exerting activities such as cell proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis. A molecular complex containing receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPζ), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), anaplastic leukemia kinase (ALK) and syndecans is considered to be its receptor.This is the sequel to that.

												MDK2 is one of the best games ever made. Now let's get to the details :PThis game is a TPP puzzle platformer. You take control (simultaneously) over 3 characters: Kurt, mechanical dog Max and genius doctor Hawkins. Each character has completely different playstyle and emphasis on certain mechanics (Kurt - sniper rifle, parachute, lots of platforming, Max - less platforming, but can handle 4 firearms (!), Doctor - solving puzzles using some of his weird, science gear (atomic toaster for example :P). The goal is the usual one - save the earth against aliens :PWhat else? Great humour, likable characters, goofy enemies, massive and colorful locations, kick♥♥♥♥♥music, epic boss battles, really funny cutscenes, unforgettable missions, cartoonish graphics that didn't age at all... But the best thing about MDK2 is that it feels really light and fun :)So if you haven't played this game yet, I would strongly recommend picking it up. Great stuff.9/10			",118,29,0,4,6,0,10

												Definitely a yes to recommend,I think I got the full version of this like right before they completely stopped vendoring Dreamcast games like in 2003 or 2004. (was gonna get Fur Fighters but that didn't happen) I actually beat this game growing up, maybe spending more than 20 hours playing it.Looking back now, and currently STRUGGLING to beat Kurts second level I don't see how I did it as a kid. The game does have it's difficult moments but nothing too hard. Literally probably only Kurt's second level (you'll see what part when you get to it)Because of crap like that I do miss the checkpoints instead of having to save my own my own when I find a safe area.Haven't played with keyboard yet but the Xbox controller having like an EXTREMELY similar mapping/design to the DC controller made it SUPER easy to adjust... just didn't like having to map things myself (but I'm just lazy)Sadly partial controller support I believe is a thing so (RB and LB) v (LT and RT) you'd have to go with buttons because If youre jumping and shooting with the triggers cancelling an action is going to happen... so its choosing one or the other. That seeming to be my only controller issue... sensitivity varies from player to player on analog.The game's story is wacky and comical, something I find enjoyable but probably a bit too wacky and corny even as I was growing up.A great ending to a great story with none of that twist crap but let me shut my mouth before i start spoiling4/5			",43,7,3,3,2,0,0

												I played this as a kid and it is still as entertaining as it was in the past.You get the 3 characters, the Janitor, the Dog and the Dr., And each is played in a completely different way (not like present shooter, where the characters only differ in lets say a weapon skin).The dialogs between them and other characters too are funny and sometimes take unexpected paths. Yeah MDK2 got its downsides too. I dont have to talk about graphics - its an old game so get over it (and I played some more recent games with even uglier graphics).The controls are sometimes a pain, especially in the jump-n-run parts of the Dr, but overall good.So if you liked it as a kid - buy it. If you like shooter with puzzles and mindblowing characters - buy it.			",203,96,1,35,26,1,34

												The unlikely hero janitor Kurt Hectic makes a return in this action-packed sequel to the 1997 classic MDK. Available for play are also Kurt's employer, Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and his dog Max. Max is a six-legged robotic dog that can quad-wield 4 guns at once. That alone should be enough to persuade you to buy this awesome game. The game has some great humorous moments as well, and did you know Jesper Kyd composed music for this game? Yes - that Jesper Kyd. So needless to say, the music is ♥♥♥♥ing great as well. Get the combo pack of MDK and MDK2 for $14.99 right now, here on Steam.			",306,44,6,27,24,3,25

												I wish to prefece this by saying this is a GREAT game, the controls are a tad difficult to map and figure out but once you do this game is very well made. However this is not what i expected from a sequal to MDK the focus on the two other characters is strange, and Dr. Hawkins has stupid platforming bits. The platforming in MDK2 is not NEARLY as tight as MDK's but it is serviceable. on the whole GREAT PHENOMINAL game but not as polished and focused  as it's predecessor. almost forgot to mention the spot on writing, and all that needs to be said about that is BIOWARE.

												MDK2, a far better take on the original game that everyone considers a classic. 2 is far better, far more interesting and makes quite a fun playthrough. The game is spiffy in graphics for its time, and has a decent gameplay style. Has some neat puzzles and varied things you need to do between different characters with different ways of being played.  3 diff characters capable of different things. They all make a whacky trio that you all play through. Its one of those odd PC 3rd person action / adventure / platformers / shooters  that has to be looked into one way or another. Its entertaining and silliness is abundent everywhere.			",148,5,1,10,4,0,15

												MDK 2, a third person shooter, action-adventure, developed by Bioware, and the sequel to MDK developed by Shiny entertainment. The game follows the adventures of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who uses a chaingun with a limitless supply of bullets and a sniper rifle, Max, a six legged dog who smokes cigars and wields four guns, and Dr. Fluke Hawkins who utilises his intelligence to make materials to fix his problems. The game makes you go through 10 levels of killing aliens, giants aliens, and puzzle solving.Positive/s: The combat system is excellentEach of the three characters play differently, requiring different strategies to get through each level.Kickass music.Entertaining aliens and bossesA silly but entertaining story.Overall a very fun and entertaining game.9 out of 10			",55,4,0,7,3,0,0

												A huge improvement to the original constructed by Bioware. Adds two new playable characters from the original, voice acting, a comic book style plot, between mission custcenes, and a plethora of new powerups. The devs really took advantage of the new character's skill sets to make you wrack your brain at every puzzle while still building on the main character's skills to provide him with a unique trip too. I recommend getting the double bundle but if you have to chose between them, this is the superior one and can stand on it's own merits as a great game despite being a sequel.

			HD Intro from the 2000 PC video game ""MDK 2."" The MDK series is currently being sold online for $5.99 (USD) each as DRM free downloads complete with bonus materials at ""Good Old Games"" (gog.com).		

It's one of the Most Zanniest TPS Game I've ever played since the days of Windows 2000/XP! MDK 2 is a hilarious game from 2000, where we follow janitor Kurt Hectic, robot dog Max and mad scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins in their struggle to save our planet! While celebrating their very recent victory over invading alien forces, the heroes of MDK 2 discovers that there are still lingering forces around.MDK2: The World's Spaciest Magazine!!!Comic Book Narrator: Kurt Hectic never wanted to be a hero. He was content with his life and wanted to live out his years in quiet dignified anonymity... Sadly, it was NOT to be. Kurt was Employed as a Janitor for Dr. Fluke Hawkins; Essentric man of Science. The Messes were large but the pay was good, so when Hawkins left, Kurt followed... Little did he know what was to become. The Doctor had wished for a place away from his detractors; away from those who thought him mad, with Janitor in tow he left the earth, vowing to return when his genius was proven. The Greatest of the Doctor's inventions in Exile was the 6-legged canine; Max. Max was the perfect assistant and his apprecation of firepower made him a fine watchdog as well.All was peaceful until the invasion; Aliens from a Strange dimension attacked the earth! Arriving on Energy Streams and landing Great Minecrawlers to destroy everything in their path! The forces of Earth were helpless before the onslaught!Dr. Hawkins had to act! Kurt was outfitted in an Untested Coil Suit & was sent to try and disable the machines. He was Reluctant but he had no choice; He was the Earth's last hope.Kurt faught valiantly, driving to the heart of the Invasion! There he challenged the Alien Leader, a grotesque creature named; Gunter Glutt! And with Max's aid, Kurt was Victorious!As their leader fell, the Invasion Crumbled & the Aliens Retreated, their tails between their legs. In their wake, they left the Earth; Better, Despoiled but not Beatten... No, NOT Beaten.Now with the Aliens routed & Order Restored, our heroes can return to their normal everyday lives... Or Can they?! Only time will tell!			",577,210,24,80,57,11,94

												Dear lord. I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this game. In the state that it's in, however, I really don't want anyone to do what I did and spend money on this pathetic, broken pile of crap. I loved MDK1 and, while it wasn't as good, MDK2 has only gotten good reviews. Hell, Bioware worked on this one so how terrible could it be? VERY terrible, as the case happens to be. The controls are easy to get used to even if you haven't played before, but the main issue with this game isn't the gameplay, the issue is with the multitude of game-breaking bugs. When I first started playing, everything seemed to be fine and dandy. Then the controls started to stick when I moved around. At first this wasn't an issue, but when I couldn't jump while running towards a cliff or my character just decided to run into an alien's crotch and run in place until I lost half of my health, I began to get rather cross. When I reached the first boss, the game shut my mouse off and I couldn't aim or shoot.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",217,37,1,39,9,1,17
