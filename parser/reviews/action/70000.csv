												Nazi Dinosaurs with Cannons and Machine Guns on their backs. What more do I have to say?Dino D-Day is a humorous WWII Multiplayer FPS about what would happen if not only did Adolf Hitler's science teams brought the dinosaurs back to life, but also gave them nerve controlled weapons, the intellegence to comprehend language, ideology, nationality, and not eat their masters? You get this silly game where Dinosaurs have cannons, machineguns, their own claws and abilities, and even suicide bombing mini dinos; I'm not kidding. The game got it's start as a single player mod for Half Life 2, but it was scrapped apparantly and it's assets turned towards a multiplayer game. There are two teams, The Allies, and the Axis. With some memebers of either having special abilities to use.The Allies are John Hardgrave (The Leader), who uses either the M1 Garand or the M1 Carbine. His ability is when he gets three kills, he can go into a Patriotic beserk spree! Punching facists with his super fists high into the air! Then there's Joe Spencer, he uses either a Tommy Gun or a Grease Gun, his specialty is calling in artillary strikes onto a part of the map, which is useful for either clearing a certain chokepoint of enemies, or dealing damage to critical targets. Up next is Nigel Blythe, English Gentleman with a Shotgun, and his choice of either a rocket launcher or a flame thrower to light those jerries up! Supporting from the rear is Ilona Vike, cute as a button but sharp as a razorblade. This Soviet Rose is the sniper of the team and utilizes her rifle, her revolver for back up, and a dead rabbit to distract certain dinos into losing control and eating, leaving them vulnerable to either Ilona herself, or her comrades. Supporting at the front is also Camille Brun the medic, she heals nearby teammates with her special or can chuck heal oozing medpacks for teammates to gather around. Finally, there's Trigger, the wonder dino! Liberated from the Nazi Army, Trigger is the only Dino the allies have, and he's as deadly as he is cute, getting revenge on the long long hunt from carnivores millenia ago, Trigger uses his nerve controlled, swivel mounted 30. Browning Machine Gun on Facists, wether beast or man.The Axis forces only have three humans, being mostly comprised of Facist dinosaurs!  Kurt Streicher is a simple soldier with no abilities to speak of, Armed with his rifle, his MP40, and some grenades, he does good on the front on his own.Karl Hissman is the more interesting German, being a falconer, he's trained explosive, suicide Pterosaurs to fall onto where ever he points at, killing anyone nearby (Did I mention you can, if lucky, lock the Pterosaur onto an enemy?). Aside from that, he serves as the team's sniper against Ilona.The final Human is Don Graff, the Medic and Vetrinarian for the Axis war machine. be wary that even though he is a simple medic, he is armed with an STG44.The Facist Dinos include the classic Velociraptor, who can use his speed to surprise and overwhelm enemies, and even pounce onto them to rip their throats out.The Dilophosaurus can pick up one of the many goats (did I mention there's goats in this game?) and lunge them at enemies for damage and laughs, as well as the ability  to knock down enemies, pick them up, and toss them for a double kill!The Desmatosuchus is a walking tank, armed with a medium but still powerful tank turrent, he can supress enemies and kill with splash damage. Be mindful that he and his spikes are big, so it's not easy to get through certain doorways.The Stygimoloch is the Desmatosuchus, but more mobile, agile, less bulkly, and has a MG34 Machine gun instead of a cannon. He is the German Trigger.The Microraptor can do it all! He can fly, claw people to death when they don't know it, and blind people with a deadly acid spit, while clawing them to death!The Compsognathus, or Compy for short, is a suicide bomber dino, though small and his bomb is just a stick grenade, he is still fanatical, and with three kills from his claws, turns his grenade from a weak firecracker, to a powerful bomb that can kill many, and set others aflame!Finally the grand daddy of them all, only avaliable on certain maps, The Tyrannosaurus Rex! You can't spawn as him, rather there's a ""waiting list"" on the Axis team where a random player gets selected to become the Rex until either the end of the round, or death where upon another player is randomly chosen. He is nasty, Armed with two MG42s on the sides of his head, able to pick up and toss airplane bombs, he also uses his might roar to knock down enemies and if they're unlucky enough, The T-Rex can pick them up and eat them for health! His only problem is his pure size and slowness, making him a target for everyone.The game comprises of three modes. Team Deathmatch (First team to 50 kills wins), King of the Hill (The side that controls the hill point for 3 minutes wins.), Control Points (First team to capture all points wins.), and Objective mode. Otherwise the game is your typical FPS combat, with the Allies being more for group tactics and shooting, while the Axis Dinos are more arena shooter.Overall this is a fun cheap game, I got this for $1.99 when it was on sale the other day, and it's worth the money if you can find a crowded server. The game is active with a couple of players, so no worries about finding a big game. I would indeed reccomend this game.Pros:-Fun Gameplay-Gunplay is good-Dinoplay is amazing-CheapCons:-Weird Control choices (Holding the aim button while in toggle mode won't let you fire your gun, this can be switched to hold down though.)

												The tide of World War II is about to change. Dinosaurs have been resurrected by the Axis to be the formidable foe against the Allies. I bought this game years ago and went in thinking it was a single player first person shooter. You vs dinosaurs! Maybe I should read descriptions. Dino D-Day is a multiplayer online first person shooter set in the 1940s. There are 9 maps to choose from and a server list to find a game. You can even play offline or alone with bots and its every bit as fun.The teams each have their own characters. I hesitate to say classes, because everyone feels unique. Sure both teams have a medic, but they're both different. Each of the 16 characters are different and relegated to humans and dinosaurs. The Axis has six dinosaur characters and three humans. The Allies have six humans and one dinosaur named Trigger. The dinosaurs have longer stamina to run around the map, so they don't run head on into gunfire from humans. Humans are weaker, but to balance it, they're smaller. The bigger the dinosaur, the more health it has. Changing between characters is easy like Team Fortress 2.The dinosaurs all play differently and it doesn't take that long to understand how they work. Maybe 10 minutes to be effective and efficient killers. Trigger, on the Allies side plays in 3rd per-dinosaur. He can jump and use a machine gun that needs to cool down. On the Axis, there's a Stygimoloch that plays similar with a cool down machine gun. Desmatosuchus is a slow tank that takes a lot of damage, fires very slowly and murders quickly. To balance him, he's a slow mover and so wide he can't fit through normal doorways. There is a raptor that is fast, plays in first per-dinosaur, melee kills quick, can leap, a high jump and pounce with the alt fire button in the air. A bigger dilophosaurus in 3rd person that can quickly run and head ram things to death. Not just that, it can pick up one of the goats found in most maps and heave them at the Allies. Compsognathus is the smallest third person dinosaur. Because of this, you're under the sight line of most humans. Your lack of health is gained in stealth. Plus, you can simply explode at will. Its beautiful. The final dinosaur is the Microraptor that plays in first dinosaur. It has wings and while it can't fly it can flap to keep it in the air to spit acid that blinds enemies. Not just that, but it can cling to walls and ceilings. Cling, but not wall run or anything like that.It is the gameplay diversity and the uniqueness of all characters that really set this game apart. The humans all have their own weapons that not only feel good to use, but effective too. Most of the weapons except the shotguns have iron sights with their alt fire button. On the Allies, you have Hardgrave, with a gun, a pistol, a grenade and his bare fists to box with dinosaurs. Spencer has his primary weapon, a pistol, his fists and a sticky bomb. Lob it out, stick it to an enemy and watch as they bring it home. Piat is the heaviest human, he uses a shotgun, a rocket launcher that only holds one rocket at a time to balance it out and smoke grenade. No fists, no melee, just big damage. Vike is a sniper, with a pistol and a rabbit. Why a rabbit? Its bait. If a carnivorous (or omnivorous) dinosaur finds the rabbit, they eat, disabling them, which gives Vike time to user her sniper rifle for one dead dino. Camille is the medic of the Allies, but in Dino D-Day the medic packs are different. She throws out the pack and when her team is near the pack, they regenerate health. So she can help her team with a machine gun, luger and fists if need be. Frank is the last member of the allies, he has a machine gun, a one shot shotgun, grenades, his fists and his devilishly good looks. Over on the Axis side, you have Streicher with a gun, machine gun, stick grenade and knife. Allies use fists, sissies like the Axis use knives. Hissman is the sniper who has a luger, stick grenade and knife. He can also summon a pterodactyl to dive bomb and explode. Wolfgang is the medic of the Axis with a machine gun, luger, knife and medi-pack.Dino D-Day has undergone a major graphics change and the artwork looks fantastic. It has an art style true to the 1940s propaganda. Ole time radio broadcasts on the main menu go a long way for making an immersive experience. The game has come a long way in three years. There are more maps and better graphics, even after all this time. The game also has taken out references to Hitler and swastikas. There are now black crosses in white circles on red banners. So it still feels like Nazi swastikas, but its not. That's still okay. It doesn't hinder the fun.In case you haven't heard, the game uses the Source engine. So there are a lot of comparisons between this game and other Source games like Counter-Strike: Global Offense and Day of Defeat. It plays as easily as those games with a lot of freedom to tailor the controls to what you want them to be. A lot of the maps feel like they could be in CS:GO. They feel like deserts and small villas, all while having elements of dinosaurs in them.The Axis is the red team with blue health and the Allies are the blue team with red health. It is a bit confusing in the game. I say red and blue, because of the color of their logos. There are no actual team colors. Characters have their own non team specific attire, which can make it confusing on the battle field. How does a new player know what team that player is on? If they're on your team, they have a logo floating above their head. Anything else should get shot and killed. The problem is seeing things. A lot of times the players blend in. The night maps make it difficult to see other players, which is good for a stealth advantage. Shorter dinosaurs can hide in grass.Each of the maps has three or four modes: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Control Points and a few maps have objectives. The objectives in those maps are pretty simple. The allies will pick up a bomb in their spawn room and set the bomb at a specific target. The bombs take a few moments to arm, then throw and then they explode after ten seconds or so. It doesn't feel like a game changer. Speaking of the spawn room, you can find unlimited health and ammo. Outside of the base, its tougher to find health. Enemies drop ammunition. Even if you're a raptor that doesn't need ammunition, by picking it up, you're denying the enemy from having it.Some maps are designed for T-rex deathmatches. These maps have the deadly giant under Axis control. A player from the Axis is randomly selected to be the tyranical beast. As T-rex you move slowly through the streets in a third person view, using a dual machine gun that needs to cool down. The T-rex can also belt out a roar that knocks the human Allies off their feet. Not your allies, I mean 'the Allies.' Once they're off their feet, you can slowly march over to them and eat them for extra health. You'll be lucky to eat someone, it doesn't happen that often. Playing as the T-rex is a lot of fun and even playing against it is a lot of fun. Sure the rex is only on the Axis team, but its balanced to the point where its so giant that all you need to do is run to a smaller area where it can't get you. Then its forced to waste time walking around buildings through giant openings to find where the action went to.In all, it might sound like a gimmick, but there is fun here. Not just the premise. The game feels balanced. There are a few ways to play to have your own fun. There are now dinosaurs on both teams so people don't flood to the Axis side saying, 'dinoz yay the new kittenz of the game world!' The developers have updated and upgraded the graphics. The Source engine is a great engine to play a first person shooter. The community is still playing the game. Give it a try again if its not your first time. It has been on sale for $1.

												When you first buy the game and start playing, you might be a bit lost. Nothing seems to fit in, you can't score any kills and seems like everybody is out to get only _you_. Then you start to learn the maps, game modes, classes and the speed of games. Kill-Death ratio starts to turn, as hours spent in game pass. No dinosaur, big or small, poses a threat to you. And every dinosaur you handle, reaps through the ranks of your enemies. You run, fly and pounce through fields where bullets, grenades and goats fly. This has become your another home.And after all this, you notice that the fun hasn't disappeared even for a moment. You just continue playing and make friends in the process. Then play some more.

If this review was an electoral voting system grapics would count for 1. All i'm saying: It doesn't matter. Don't be turned off by it!Controls: 8/10. Like TF2.Handling: 7/10. Advrage FPS game 'feel'.Story: 6/10. Not much but it does have somthing, and now with the past few updates has come more explamation.Game play: 10/10. This is what makes the game great.

Cant't stress this factor enough!!!Creativity: 2 part rating here: 8/10             a. FPS: Done before, nothing special.             b. Dinos: Over the top.

												I have only played this game alongside my good friend who was without a doubt the best player in the world. Its a shame the games devs can not see the difference between the best player and someone who is hacking. He gets called a hacker in every fps game we play together, hes too good for his own good apparently. A dev by the name of James Rossi banned my friend a few weeks ago. A friend who would never hack and who loves the game, who has been playing Dino D Day on and off since 2012, supporting the game, encouraging others to buy and come play with him. After my friends experience, i wouldnt recommend you dont play this game, cause its a great game, but i don't recommend becoming invested in it too much as they do not value your support.

												I got this game around release date and ever since then the game has just improved. Very few bugs now way better graphics and a lot of other stuff added. ‘’New Content Released since Launch, 5 new playable dinosaurs. 9 playable dinosaur classes in total., Moved to an updated version of the Source engine!, Awesome new game mode, 'Last Stand' now available!, 6 new maps shipped since release, Brand new game mode – Capture Point, Alternate weapon load outs now available, FULL, Steam-integrated stat tracking, Bot-support for offline play!’’Dino D Day has really come a long way and it is still fun, its jokes too you can pee on someone as a dino. This game is worth full price in my opinion. It really is an over all great game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Novel in concept, somewhat generic in practice // Recommended for fans of Team Fortress 2 who want to shake it up a bit**Due to limited player-base, this title is recommended if on sale+ The different dinosaur classes boast unique play-styles and are a refreshingly entertaining to play+ Most playable characters have a special ability, and these are fun without being game-breaking; definitely adds to the experience, rather than takes away+ For the most part, map design is excellent and encourages competitive play; there are a couple of exceptions, but they are not enough to detract from the game+ Movement and controls are all fairly responsive and straightforward+ Healthy stock of game-modes available for online play (and bots); nothing new or innovative, but everything works well and complements the fast pace- Generally below-average visuals, character models, and textures- Questionable balance between human and dinosaur lineup, and also between factions (Allies seem to have the upper hand in firepower, but almost no dinosaurs compared to the Axis powers)- Multiplayer is not dead, but it is dwindling; one is unlikely to find more than three active servers at a timeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												This is your usually WWII FPS, almost, but dinosaurs were necessary to add something new to themThe bad thing is, it doesn´t have a story mode or campaing (so don´t expect a scientific explanation for the dinosaur, axis just revived them, give weapons, and tried to change the world war course.Dead records are exactly the same of TF2....I whonder why Stalin appears on Allies winning if there aren´t a single russian there.America faction only have one dinosaur, but every class have their own weaponry (and nacionality).But don´t worry you still can fight for uncle SamInteresting facts:-Goats can be can be thrown-T-rex is not only in the game image, it can be used (and being OP of course) in 2 specific open maps (But no triceratops )-Press ""f"" as dinosaur to P-I-S-S.-I bet no ones notices the Zeppelins in the background-Bot names are from famous and real people (Henry Fonda, Audie Murphy, Charlie Chaplin....)

Dino D-Day is a multiplayer game where you can either fight against the overwhelming power of the Nazi army aided by Dinosaurs, or fight on behalf of the allied nations. You can play as human or dino in this interesting shooter. Visually its not a AAA Title, but it is still fun to play.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												It’s like Counterstrike with dinosaurs, DINOSAURS WHICH ARE NAZIS! It's pretty safe to say Dino D-Day is a different kind of World War II shooter, mostly because it features dinosaurs. This game has some kind of sarcastic humor and trys to show the people the worldwar-topic on a funny not serious way. Like WTF THE NAZIS ARE SO OVERPOWERED and have MAGICALLY POWER…!!! HAVE YOU HEARED THEY RESURRECTED THE DINOSAURS FOR A NOT STOPABLE DINOSAUR ARMY? Ehm… yes thats the game about. xDGenre: Multiplayer, first person shooterGraphic: 9/10 good graphic with funny detailsAudio: 10/10 realistic sound, historical soundTeams: Allied nations and NazisCharacters: 9 different humans, 7 dinosaur classes All with special abilities and weapons (26 classical weapons from WWII). Gameplay: 8/10 for the controls; primary it’s a bit confusing but when you are better with the controls and you have a better overview about the map ist pretty funny.Cons:I don’t know why but some controls don’t work for me: For example I looked for the keyboard controls and it said „F = weapon option“ but with a human nothing happens when I press F and when I press F with a dinosaur he pees. O: Really…. He pees!And the R for reload also doesn’t work for me… I have just played it for 2 hours but it’s still a bit confusing for me (so I would be really happy if someone of you can help me out ^^).An other negative aspect in my eyes that there are just a few people playing this game so there are a lot of server with no players and you don’t have much choice on which server you want to play. It’s also sad that there is just ONE Server with BOTS and I asked myself if this server is in china or where because first time I couldn’t connect and the second time I waited for 5 minutes till I connected with 900+ Ping and frozen pictures / teleport (you maybe know this feeling).However I still think its a good game because I was 2 hours on a good working server with uhm around 20-30 players the whole time and I had a lot of fun. You should make your own opinion from the facts but if you play it please let me know! (:			",224,60,10,20,8,0,13

												This game is absurd, and fun to play... usually. Pitting the Allies vs the Axis in an alternate history where Germany clones dinosaurs to fuel their war effort, the Axis forces have a near monopoly on the Dinos. This doesn't mean that the Allies are any less fun to play though. Trigger, the Allies sole dino is one of the better ones, with a charge ability, and a solid machine gun to use. Playing at the Allies is more a straightforward FPS, with relatively standard classes. There is an assault, a sniper, a medic, all the regulars, and they do quite well against the dinosaurs, to the point that with a competitive team, the Axis forces have a bit of a harder time of things. Shotguns end dinos, sniper rifles end dinos from a distance. The Allies have a clear advantage on range in general. With a female french resistance medic, and a female sniper, I am also happy to see that I can play as a woman for once in an FPS. One that isn't merely relegated to a healer or noncombat class. This is pretty rare, and most people won't care, but I think it is pretty cool. Also of note is that several classes have area of effect buffs, such as accuracy or healing, allowing small squads to become even more deadly. Where the Allies have an advantage in range and teamwork, the Axis have a huge advantage in variety. Want to be fast and do melee? Try the Velociraptor, which can pounce, and generally kill people (if they are not killed during the feast animation) or the Microraptor, who can glide about the battlefield and spit poison. Want to bring in the big guns? Play as a Stygimolochs with a heavy machinegun or as a Spinosaurus, who is a miniature, low slung tank. On some maps you can even play as the legendary T-Rex.Both teams are very asymmetrical, but when dealing with new players, it seems the Allies will always get the win. Learning how to move as a dino is difficult, and many of the more powerful ones are large to the point that missing them is harder than not. My favorite thing is that the Allies are not seen as a writeoff. With some games (Pirates Vikings and Knights II comes to mind) there is a clear preference for the ""cool"" team, which the Axis easily could have been. Gladly this is not the case, and both teams have excellent up and downsides, encouraging you to play on both sides.			",153,32,10,5,32,0,32

												This game is fun. No matter your skill, no matter your system, no matter the class you choose. This game embodies the ultimate dream of all young boys and I can assume many young girls. WW2 mixed with Dinos I mean it's magic! I awaited this game from the moment I heard of it. It's surprising a game like this took so long to come out. But the similarity to UT is what really makes this game fun for old school gamers. Let's be honest ever since Halo and CS ruined gaming forever people have been waiting for a game that isn't realistic. If I wanted to crouch and steady myself before every shot I'd go play paintball. I want to jump and flip like a jackass while some poor sap tries to shoot the ball of rubber I've become. It's simple the matrix was cool that's what I want from a game... any game. That said the graphics are ok at best but the gameplay more than makes up for it. The only real problem I have is getting hung up on walls and corners it's sort of the one button mouse of gaming. A nearly unforgivable sin since it was fixed in most games long ago. All things considered it's a great little number I'll be playing for years to come.   -SEF			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game of truly rough n' tumble skirmishes set in the second world war. Nazis alone don't make for an edgy enough plot anymore, and zombies are a garish pink vibrating strap-on of an angle that's been utterly exhausted. Despite this, it still remains on the throne, an idea selling like hot cakes much like that decayed ol' king from warhammer 40K. So, What's next on the list? Dinosaurs? Sure, why not.My first impressions are that the game plays rather nicely. Controlling dinosaurs and humans alike feels fairly fluid, though the 'runts' and humans are fixed in first person while the bigger dinosaurs take third. It would be nice to have the choice if there's variation to begin with. So You've got a mix of human and late cretatious characters to play as, and each team has a fairly unique roster to offer. Unfortunately, it's the Axis that are milking this historical re-jigging for it's worth, as they have around six or seven full dino variants to pick from. Allies only have the one, and the rest of your team is comprised of pink-♥♥♥♥♥ honkeys. This alone can sap the joy out of playing as an American, bar the fact the world hates you, but I wouldn't say it presents a significant disadvantage. I suppose there's just no satisfaction in beating on a dinosaur as a dinosaur, but rather playing Godzilla and crushing the fleeing people on a whim. This is presumably why teams are reversed each round.My main gripe with this game as it stands are the maps. They seem lackluster in design and rather sparse. Vantage points are obvious and don't really appear to be very thought out, and you can't even sling a few shells through glass windows. Overall, the game seems a tad shallow and lacking potential for interesting, engaging tactics. It's a pretty standard formula (often likened to Team Fortress 2) with nothing terribly new to offer.Nevertheless, I can't say it isn't satisfying to flatten a few yanks using a goat flung from your gargantuan jaws, or with another yank that you'd previously managed to keel over. There's fun to be had in this game for sure, but it's a quick, silly fix of entertainment and not one of any real lasting value. Would I recommend the game? Sure, for a happy drunken hootenanny or something. It's worth a chuckle or two at the least.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												This is not a game you play if you want an AAA first person shooter experience.  If you want that, go fire up the latest Battlefield of Duty or TF:GO.

Sometimes I just gotta watch some silly B-movie like Sharknado or The Room.

												This game is dead,for the most part but usually gets the players it needs through sales, So i wouldnt recommend buying it when its not on sale.In short:You can run it on an old toaster.Plenty of characters to choose from.Special maps for fighting T-rex's.Balance-wise i would say this game is a 6/10Games usually tend to be won by the humans and not the dinosuars.Sometimes the smaller dinosuars can exploit the larger maps and go into downright unreachable places and The larger dinosuars often dont last long becuase they are incredibly easy to hit. Humans for the most part, are based on what you would expect, shooting and killing.Dinosuars for the most part however, rely on close-range one-shot techniques, which can cause alot of problems and is the reason matches are usually won by the humans.And There are of course, has with any team-based game, Annoying one-shot snipers on both teams (only you dont need to headshot to one-shot).I feel neutral about this game, but for the most part, its a negative.

												This game is taking place in an alternate WW2 timeline in which the Nazis have managed to resurrect the dinosaurs and are using them as the means of gaining the upper hand at the ongoing war.Now before you even attempt to immerse yourself into the epic possibilities of single player experiences this opportunity offers let me assure you that this is a multiplayer-only game (minus the SP compatible survival DLC, but that's for another review of mine) this fact howewer doesn't degrade the game's quality itself, as the multiplayer gameplay is well polished and balanced also surprisingly enough even though that playing as the dinosaurs is almost strictly a Nazi thing in this game, you won't feel the human classes being inferior compared to them. I dare to say that they are so well done compared to the dinosaurs that you won't even feel the urge to play as a dinosaur despite the fact that the chance to use dinos is available on both sides (yes, the Allies are having a singular dino type as well just for da lolz).The game is just as fun to play as a human as it is as a dino and I'm really glad that they didn't screw this up. It is truly up to the player's skills that what he/she can accomplish as I found myself exterminating everything that moved all over the place once I got the hang of a certain class, let it be a dinosaur or a human.I, being a dinosaur and Wolfenstein appreciator instantly fell in love with the sheer concept of this thing.Aaaaand pretty much that's it. It's a well balanced Multiplayer based Wolfenstein-ish dinosaur game which is absolutely worth a try if you like any of those things.Oh, did I mention that you can use goats as a physical weapon and they're instakill if you throw them at another player?This game used goats for offensive measures 3 years before Goat Simulator made it cool.

												Your steam library is not complete until you have this game. I bought this game when it was a dollar. So be sure to get on sale or else you will spend 10$. I would pay 10 dollars if I had to. Very fun game. It's a cartoonish depiction of WWII pitting Allies, and Axis against eachother with an authentic WWII arsenal. There is a spin on the game however... The Nazis have dinosaurs at their disposal. The Nazi Dinosaur classes are hours of fun. Whether you are a goat throwing Dilophisaur, or a Dino-Snackbar self exploding compy. You will have plenty of fun with the Axis classes. I have to say the Nazi classes are my favorite in the game. The rifleman is my favorite class, but Sniper, and Medic are fun too. On some maps you can even be a T Rex! Equiped with machine guns. The Allies have only one dinosaur class, but have some fun rifleman, and machine gunner classes. I will say however that the rifleman class is extremely overpowered. (Hardgrave) and gets annoying really quick. You just have to use stealth, because the M1 Garand is extremly OP. The allies are not my favorite class, but fun none the less. The game is best known for it's online mulitplayer which is a few game modes. Ranging from Deathmatch to Capture the Flag. The DLC is okay if you have some friends, but is not as fun as the regular online multiplayer. There is my review. I highly encourage everyone to get a copy.  See you on the battlefield!600 plus hours into game, and counting.			",44,2,0,0,1,0,5

												Didn't do a lot of research when buying this game; it had positive reviews and was on-sale. I was initially disappointed in the lack of a campaihn mode, but it became apparent how silly that would be once I logged onto a server and started mauling goats as a velociraptor in WW2 Germany. If you have a hole in your gaming life that can only be filled with dinosaurs and World War 2 action, this game will fill it nicely. Also, I shot a goat in the head 12 times; it didn't die until I shot it in the stomach. 8/10 playability; 1/10 realistic goat-murder mechanics			",41,8,0,7,6,1,3

												They pretty much ruined the game with the new update (changed the version of the source engine). it has never been as unbalanced as it is now and it feels TERRIBLE to play. I got it for free, didn't expect much from it, but was quite surprised. Would have definetely paid for the old version. Not for the current one, though.Don't listen to the reviews of people that have sub 10 hours of gameplay on this game and/or bought it recently. They don't know anything about the game. It used to be completely solid and a couple tweaks away from being a very well balanced class based FPS. They basically threw it all away for a COD-like gameplay with better graphics, that is what the major update in the end of 2014 was. Everyone that buys it now gets the game because they sell it for sub 1$ dollar prices every 2 weeks and  they think ""dinosaurs and guns are funn4y, i must buy this cheap game XD"" and then play 2 hours and make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review with positive feedback and funny stupid comments, you know, the typical Steam reviews As someone who has 1800+ hours of gameplay on TF2 and 200+ hours on DDD with a couple different accounts, I really enjoy class based FPS games and DDD was for sure my favorite hipster game. Devs, please, roll back the update. Or at least allow us to play the old version too... Gifting everyone that already had the old version renaming it as ""Dino D-day 2014"" or something would have been a better idea.Or maybe just change the name of the game to COD: Dino D-day. Or... Call Of Dinosaurs: D-DayI will list a few of the problems with the update. I don't have the old version anymore, otherwise i would try and make a video comparison. - New branch of the source engine (same as Portal 2, i believe), which changed how the game works entirely (movemement, hitboxes, appearence). It is hard to explain exactly why and what exactly feels off, but they did a very bad job with this change. Imagine switching from CS:Source to CSGO-Undocumented change to status of weapons and health points. Now sniper rifles do A LOT more damage and can often 1 body hit kill human players (COD). Not to mention many bugs that allow you to shot extremely fast with unscoped sniper rifles, which basically allows you to use it as a shotgun and kill the T-rex and the other giant dinosaur (forgot the name, sorry) very fast.- Even more bugs with the game launcher/server browser. The game crashes a lot more often now... Principally while entering servers and switching maps. The game will go unresponsive and take several minutes to load a map and sometimes even the SERVER crashes. So yeah, when you have the luck to find a server with more than 10 people playing, eventually it will crash and people won't bother to find a new one, or spread to different servers making it impossible to find a consistently full server to play.-Changed the HUD to the top of the screen.... really? i would understand if they added an option for people that prefered it that way, but nope, they just randomly decided to force change that. Probably seems like a small thing, but it really affects the game. It is much harder to notice when you are low on health.------------------------- Default rates and interp are♥♥♥♥♥♥ as if the small dinosaurs weren't hard enough to hit. (rate 10000, cl_updaterate 20, cl_cmdrate 20, cl_interp 0.1, cl_interp_ratio 2)- No way to change the zoom sensitivity and scoped sensitivity of guns in a user friendly way, which  makes it hard for people that don't know the console commands to play the game. (scoped_sensitivity and zoom_ratio_sensitivity are the commands)-cl_fov is completely unlocked. you can easily make a script that allows you to have a sniper like zoom with any weapon.-viewmodel_fov and r_drawviewmodels locked. makes a lot of sense that they blocked these but not cl_fov... yeah.- Hardgrave is a broken class. By FAR the strongest weapon in the game, the M1 Garand clearly needs to be nerfed for this game to be playable, principally after the garbage 2014 update. It doesn't even make sense to play as any other class on the Allies, because none are as strong. The damage dealt by it and its fast firing rate make it almost like a semi-automatic kar98 (Streicher's main gun), which has a high damage for a reason, since it is so slow to fire and actually requires you to aim carefully and not just spam like a noob like the M1 garand.   - Oh yeah, and did i mention that after you get 3 kills as the hardgrave you get a ""power up"" that allows you to become pretty much invincible for 10ish seconds and 1 PUNCH KILL most of the classes? You can even kill the t-rex in 5 seconds with this. Completely not broken guys, cmon.			",258,54,8,25,19,1,31

												I'm pretty sure the majority of players will hate me by saying that, but I liked it more than TF2 ...Sadly this game doesn't have a single player campaing so I would feel rather betrayed if I had bought it but I got it for free so it's ok. But I must assume that most likely I won't be playing this much because of the lack of it.I think the graphics are ok in this game. I don't like most of the games based on Source engine because of it's look, this wasn't the case with this one. At least it's very fluid and there are many servers with people playing in my area so I didn't encounter any lag issues because of high ping.The gameplay itself is rather plain and I must say I like it that way.The setting and the overall feel of the game does have some funny momentum to it as the game doesn't take itself serious what makes it more enjoyable than many other games of the same genre. The sound are ok and it gets you laughing nearly every time you play. Wether this is good in a competitive online first person shooter you must decide for yourself.As this game seems to be on sale quite often I can easily recommend it to you if you are into this sort of game.I would have enjoyed it more if there weren't that damn dinosaurs in it ... but I guess then it would be another game ...For a few bucks you can get this game and have quite some fun with it. But remember: it's only online playing and there is no story mode included (heck it could have been such a great trash story with this setting ... what a lost opportunity!)@ngel			",275,66,8,23,21,3,37

Product received for free
												I remember the first time I played Dino D-Day. It was not long after the Christmas of 2015, or not too long after I got my Steam account. The game appeared as a reccomended game, and it seemed to combine two things I really like; Dinosaurs, and FPS games. So I gave it a go- it was free for a few days, so I figured ""Why not?"". When my trial was up, I went ""Hell yes I'm going to buy this game! It's awesome!""... And that's how I got to where I am now, as one of the better Dino D-Day players. You'll often find me at the top of the scoreboard.I'm getting a bit more involved in Dino D-Day- To be honest, if you're a good FPS player, then this game is full of the type of people you can just pick off and destroy. Each class is different, with different strengths, weaknesses, and counters. While it's not the biggest game ever, you can usually find a few servers with at least one big server (18-24+ people), and one smaller server (2-8+ people).There's also classes that suit every playstyle. If you want a solid all-rounder, there's classes that accomodate your playstyle. If you like to pick people off from the longest sightlines, there's sniper classes that can work for you. If you want to just anhillate everything up close, then there's a lot of options for you. Even if you're a third-person shooter player, most of the dinosaurs function like that- with and without guns.To sum it all up, yes. I do reccomend Dino D-Day.  This isn't just another boring World War 2 game, some unique and interesting elements are brought here and there, and you have yourself a game that you can almost always come back to and enjoy. There are bugs here and there, but truth be told, it's only really present in the DLC, which is still fun nonetheless.Farewell, newborn player. I eagerly await your competition, or better yet, support.			",17,2,0,1,0,1,1

												Dino D-Day is a multiplayer game made with source where in an alternative version of World War 2 the nazis have dinosaurs on they're side so you fight as either the Allied forces or the Axis.The game is very similar to Team Fortress 2 in style of gameplay. You have multiple classes and you duke it out on the battlefield, but the biggest differences are in the dinosaurs. The soldiers are pretty much all the same with guns and explosives as they're weaponry, while the dinosaurs have multiple different abilities, from explosive rounds and flying and acid and suicide bombers.The entire game while focusing on shooting is quite stiff. It took me quite some time to actually get used to the gun play and it's not that good.From what I played I had a lot of fun, but the game is not without it's faults. The game has tons of connection issues a lot of them are not even my fault. Lag is present almost all the time, but it's not that bad that it's unplayable.The texture pop ins happen way too often and are incredibly tiresome on the eyes, because the graphics aren't that good as well. The map layouts are confusing as hell and most of the times it's confusing to just find your objective, making capture the objective maps a massive pain to play.Overall the game is fun and the community is still alive and kicking, so if you're looking for ridiculous multiplayer game check this game out.Pros:+ Fun gameplay+ DINOSAURS +Varied classes Cons:-Low resolution textures-Connection issuesFinal Rating:6.5/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												If there were dinosaurs, Dino D-Day would be one of many online shooter on the Second World War. While there are dinosaurs and developers recognizing the genius of their idea and intelligent humor with which it is carried out, however, the game is one of many online shooter. The different classes can be interesting for a while 'and the maps are moderately interesting, at least until you get bored, because they are quite small and in a couple of games they already know all the secrets. Twenty euro these days are not a no brainer, but it bodes well that you get the single player and already there is talk of new maps and additional dinosaurs. Of course, when these things will come it remains a mystery. Until then we are in front a game that can entertain but which will soon be shelved, at least until the new additions promises. In short, what the shooter is a market ultra inflated and there is a lot better for a lot less ...			",106,6,5,11,6,1,5

												Wait for a sale and pick this game up. As weird as it is (Nazzi dinosaurs?), you won't regret it (unless you don't like FPS games). This game has everything TF2 needs: non-annoying player base, everyone has all the gear from the begining, and the developers are deeply involved in the game. That last one is especaly true. My first match resulted in me earning the achievement of killing a developer in online play so I think it is safe to say that the developers care about this game. Also it runs on the Source Engine so it will run very well on even to most potato of computers.			",27,6,0,8,12,0,2

												As a child, I loved dinosours, i was fasinated by the reptillian giants of the prehistoric age. Upon growing old in age, I began to lean into FPS and WW2 games, a genre that is popular in our time. A genius who sought to give the a world a meaning, and to explain religion, cure cancer and stop the the world from exploding. This man who we honor in his great name wrote the almighty game codes where our favorite culture pastimes are combined. How could one think of the idea of Nazi's cultivating dinosaurs and taking over the world? Well thankfully you are given the oppritunity to fight for the greatest contry in the world and kill the Nazi empire. I love this game and I love playing it with my friends! 10/10 I recommend getting this game!			",87,2,0,16,6,0,18

												I adore this game. Between my studies of philosophy, and my reading of scientific journals, I make room for this excellent diversion. It is sophisticated (which fits a sophisticated, intellectual man like myself), it is intelligent (which is perfect for an intuitive mind like my own), and it has the necessary plot elements to convey the themes that the developers intended to communicate. My favourite time to play this delectable puzzle is right before my fellow gentlemen and gentlewomen come to my estate to enjoy a nice tea. It sparks great, sophisticated conversations about the inner workings of the now deceased Third Reich. Though some elements interrupt the flow of the natural history of 1940s Germany, anyone would agree that this game is an excellent, relaxing game for sophisticated individuals (like myself).I rate this 10 out of 10 stars.

There were a few problems though like bad graphics and the small number of players playing the game. Overall though, I like this game a lot and recommend it.			",84,11,3,4,4,0,13

NOTE: I haven't bothered with the Last Stand DLC, so this is only a review for the base game.At first glance, I thought this game would be a pass. It had nothing I would typically be interested in: I rarely play MP or co-op because I find the competition/survival aspect stressful, I tend to avoid historically-based war themes (especially involving Nazis), and while dinosaurs are cool, they haven't been a draw for me since I was a kid.But as Dino D-Day was free for a weekend, I figured what the hell, I'd give it a shot. The dinos+WWII aspect was at least enough to make me curious.Lo and behold, by the end of the weekend I had sunk over 14 solid hours into the game, half in online MP matches and half messing around in SP with bots to get the hang of classes and mechanics at my own pace (""dinomon"" difficulty mode is a hilarious godsend). The fact that achievements unlocked for me even though I didn't own the game yet was pretty cool too.As for my dislike for WWII themes, it was surprisingly a non-issue. While in a match the Axis/Allies thing kinda dissolves into the background and simply becomes red vs blue. It helps that they don't flaunt or overuse Nazi-related imagery or buzzwords. There's the occasional themed comment from a character after a kill, but otherwise any blatant ""historical"" references are primarily in the menu text and voiceovers.I really like how you can seamlessly switch classes or sides at any point (, and . keys respectively). It's not something I'd abuse if a match/team is working together really well of course, though the game sometimes auto-balances teams and swaps you unwillingly. Not really a biggie, but less fun if you get saddled with teammates who don't know what they're doing. You can always switch back when a slot opens though. :)What sold me however, was how laid back MP matches were. Not at all like your standard CS:GO/Halo-type level of stress and hair-pulling: it didn't feel like there was a competitive urgency in matches, the voice chatting I did hear was free of gratuitous cursing/whining/trash talk, and ""newbie abuse"" in text chat was very, very minimal. I think the absurdity of the dinosaurs is a big part of all that, honestly. It's difficult to take the game as seriously as one with a completely human cast, so ""failure"" becomes either amusing/inconsequential or just simply a temporary annoyance till you respawn.Parts of the game were more frustrating, but mainly the class-balancing issues, like how much of an edge Compys and Raptors have over humans based on their size and speed. Being pounced to death over and over can get annoying - especially when you know the people playing the small dinos are just using them because they're easy and OPed, and require almost zero skill to rack up kills. (Obviously that's not always the case, as good players do play small dinos, but you can tell when someone doesn't quite know what they're doing. I'm more impressed when I get sniped by someone from across the map.) Either way, it's still not even close to the amount of stress I expected.Conclusion: Dino D-Day, despite boasting themes and genre/play-styles I wouldn't normally even take a second look at, managed to enthrall me so much that I bought it. (The 90%-off sale was also a factor, but I actually did want the game.) I even considered the 4-pack, but that kind of requires that one a) has friends, and b) they would even be interested in the first place. I guess I'll stick to making friends in-game for now. :PBtw, if anyone needs a buddy for some of the trickier two-player achievements (Nigel/Microraptor, Ilona/Raptor, etc), I'll gladly assist.

												This is one of those games that definitely deserve more players.Dino D-Day is pretty cheap and it's really fun.If you don't dislike shooter and think 1€-10€ depending on offer (1€ atm 16.08.2016) is okay for a game you might play couple of times for having fun you should give it a try. If you got some friends who might play it with you it's even better since you'll have some nice players for sure, but also without friends it is fun if you join one of the few populated servers.It's allies (mainly humans, 1 dino selectable) vs axis (few humans and many dinos selectable). The Dinosaurs have unique gamestyles. 1 of them can throw goats or opponents, another one can blow itself up, then there's someone who can fly etc.Different gamemodes.Personally i bought this game for 5€ and don't feel like i wasted any cent on it. While i haven't played it that much (because this is the kind of game i usually prefer to play with friends) i had very much fun playing it.TLDR:+cheap+fun with friends+fun with random other people+unique gameplay-not many players (still enough for a few populated servers)			",267,62,10,42,28,4,48

												(TOP HALF) My experince. (BOTTOM HALF) About the game This is like COD WAW mixed with Jurasic Park.I personaly am having tooo much fun playing this. spending hours slaying britts with my Velociraptor and Desmatosuchus with a 20mm canon strapped on the back of it.I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are a fan of un-usual FPS games such as Team Fortress 2.AND as for classes there is 7 Allied customizable clases and 9 Axis customizable clases. This game IS NOT! just Dinosaurs vs Humans. Both teams can take Dino's and Human's. It is ESSENTIAL that you have a mix of both if you are wanting to win. This game in my oppinion is a 7.5/10 Fun as hell, Much differn't to i first thought. Dino D-Day is a frantic, action-packed multiplayer game that transports you to a World War II that should have been. You and your friends can battle online choosing to serve the cause of the Allied nations or the Nazis. The Allied side includes seven playable characters including Trigger, a Protoceratops rescued from the Nazis. Each Allied class has unique weapons and abilities to use in combat. Gun down a Dilophosaur with your trusty M1 Garand, blast a kamikaze pterosaur out of the sky with your Thompson sub-machine gun, or toss out a dead jackrabbit to lure a raptor into a trap.As an Axis player you will have your choice of three human classes and four dinosaur classes. Ambush your enemy with speed and stealth as the Raptor, mercilessly pound the enemy with a heavy 20mm gun as the Desmatosuchus, rampage through enemy groups as the Dilophosaur or pick up a body and throw it at an enemy for a double kill! Or if you prefer a rifle in your hand, the German soldier classes are the perfect complement to their dinosaur comrades.You’ve played World War II games before…but have you played a World War II game with dinosaurs?

												Although this game is fun and entertaining to play. There are a few things that iit could use to keep players coming back, such as: A leveling system. If it had a xp system players would be more motivated to keep playing.Another addition that I think would be fun is a campaign system.Sadly, 5 years into it's life span there will be no addition of these add on.P.S Sadly we won't be seeing anymore games like this from source until the next huge source engine upgrade.

												Dino D-Day is an oldie, but a goodie! It's pretty damn remarkable after nearing 5 years now, this game still gets plenty of love from it's developers, despite its lack of traffic lately. It's a pretty well balanced shooter, and will give you some fine moments. Of course, the dinosaurs are very unique, not many cut and paste popular dinosaurs here. The gameplay, although lacks a variety of maps, is still refreshing for a good 20-30 hours of play before it runs off.Overall, A pretty damn solid and fun game, get it now! only $0.99!

												So, when I bought this, I thought ""Well, I can always get a refund if it sucks, which it most likely will."" The reason why I bought it was for 3 reasons:1. 3 of my friends already owned the game.2. It was on sale for less than a dollar.3. Most of the reviews were positive, and the ones that weren't were spelled wrong and didn't give me any reason to take their opinions into my decision process (aka they were incredibly stupid)But when I played it, it wasn't that bad. Sure, there are assets and sounds used from other games (ie. TF2), but the game was pretty fun! Raptors were like playing as Hunters in L4D and L4D2, Trigger handled pretty well, and the armored dino was like playing as a tank! Only smaller and more mobility. All in all, give it a shot. People say it's hard, but as long as you are the type that doesn't play all that seriously or just generally not a tryhard rager, it's pretty fun.			",32,14,0,3,5,2,0

												Dino D day isn't without its faults. There are areas where this game had failed but most of it has been addressed and fixed. The big problem with it is that it released too early. Unfortunately most of the people who have played this game played one of its early versions and base their opinions on that.  800 North is dedicated to this game and I can almost say with certainty that if people gave the game another try, they would like it.

												to be honest, i just got this game and have only played it for a half-hour or so.  but already i can tell it's the best two dollars i have ever spent!  just the stupid, simple pleasure of shooting dinosaurs, being shot by dinosaurs, and of course, being eaten alive by dinosaurs.  even at full price (currently $10) i'd recommend it if you have the cash to spare.  get some friends to join you and have a blast!everything you need to know is in the title.  it's a game set in world war II with dinosaurs.  really, you can't go wrong...

 About Dino D-DayIf there were dinosaurs, Dino D-Day would be one of many online shooter on the Second World War. While there are dinosaurs and developers recognizing the genius of their idea and intelligent humor with which it is carried out, however, the game is one of many online shooter. The different classes can be interesting for a while 'and the maps are moderately interesting, at least until you get bored, because they are quite small and in a couple of games they already know all the secrets. Twenty euro these days are not a no brainer, but it bodes well that you get the single player and already there is talk of new maps and additional dinosaurs. Of course, when these things will come it remains a mystery. Until then we are in front a game that can entertain but which will soon be shelved, at least until the new additions promises. In short, what the shooter is a market ultra inflated and there is a lot better for a lot less.Release Date: 9 Apr, 2011All in All  Dino D-Day is a very nice Action Game!9/10 From MeSweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												I started playing this game today thinking what do i have to lose, i paid less than a dollar for the game and love dinosaurs so how bad could it be right? WRONG!This game has a ton of servers up however 95 percent of them have no players on them. But to be honest there were about four servers with players on them so even though it's quiet it still has some people playing it.  The game starts out having you pick between Axis and Allies, i thought to myself okay this is standard in WWII shooters, what's next? So i picked allies as i hate being on axis in games for obvious reasons. I then progressed through all the different gun classes available which is 3-4 different characters per side. Even though their aren't many guns to choose from that's not the problem, the problem is that the gunplay is far below even subpar. The hit detection is broken in the sense that you will not get kills from headshots but rather by firing in a direction that you think the enemy will be going because the animations are so broken you will never get a clean kill unless a player is standing still or is afk.  I can't tell you how many times i shot players directly in the face only to watch them run off like a headless chicken with downsyndrome.Playing as the dinosaur classes is even more problematic and laughable, the animations are terrible, the characters are over powered and it feels broken beyond repair. I won't go into detail but to say the classes are unbalanced is an understatement.The graphics are also horrible even in 4k. This would be acceptable, as i realize the game is getting on the older side for shooters but even the lighting effects are dispicable. Enoujgh said it's hard to make out what's going on in the game even on 4k settings on ultra...The main menu is the best part of this game  because of the music and radio voiceovers. But even the main menu can't save this game as it allows you to customize controls but sadly the controller support does not work even though the game says it does....The in game sounds are also horrendous and gave me a headache after less than three hours of gameplay.. I could go on about this game but do i really have to as i said i got this game for under a dollar and am still staring at my monitor wondering why i wasted the money and time.1.5 out of 10 for those of you that like a score next to a game. I would rather jump into a bed of cactus face first then ever play this P.O.S again. Happy Gaming :D			",529,140,12,35,33,5,22

Dino D-Day offers a somewhat unique outlook on FPS games. I can't think of any other game that involves shooting a gun off the back of a dino. Something that lacked was varity and some style. I did like the smooth non-intensive graphics and gameplay. It is a great game to play with friends but not something to be taken too seriously.

												~Long-ish Dino D-Day Review~Summary: Dino D-Day is a 1st/3rd Person Shooter with a relatively small player base. Do not let this fool you, though. The game itself is actually quite fun. The game is akin to the play style of TF2 and CS:GO. It offers a few different gamemodes as well as a nice array of characters to choose from (everywhere from run-n-gunners to snipers and...DINOSAURS). The best thing this game has to offer is its raw concept, dinosaurs in WW2. Let me tell you, that stays enjoyable.Ignore the Critics: The game does have poor reviews from Metacritic and a few notably bad reviews on Steam. Don't let this deter you. These reviews were written a LONG time ago and the game has since fixed (not all but) most of the bugs that ruined gameplay. Should You Buy?: Personally picked up the 4-pack at $3.00 coming out to 75 cents per copy (90% off). This is a more than acceptable price for the game. I would highly recommend the 4-pack when the game is on sale. Playing with friends is a blast and the DLC (Last Stand) is decent if you have some buds to play with. The DLC is definitely not necessary for you to enjoy the game.Quick Pros:-Playing as a dinosaur in WW2 is just as fun as it sounds.-Really good deal when it's on sale (90% off).Quick Cons:-Small online community.-Couple bugs here and there.All in All:8.1/10 Would Recommend (on sale...)

OF COURSE I recommend this game! I GOT IT FOR FREE.-------EDIT (12/11/2014): I took out ""+/-must commit suicide if changing classes once game has started"" because that's not true. at least not anymore. There is check-box during the class select screen to commit suicide to change class. So it's not required.EDIT2 (05/02/2015):* to be fair, Allies have ONE playable dinosaur, but that's just one compared to about 5 or 6 dinos that the Axis have.			",257,22,12,21,8,0,7

												this game is so so so so funplays a little bit like battlefield 1943 (xbox360/ps3) in that there are classes with set weapons and its ww2 but thats where the similarities endgameplay is fast and hectic, dinosaurs are great to play as andd againstallies get one dino with a 30cal mg, and maybe 5/6 humansaxis get about 6 dinos and 3 humansclasses are well balanced, each fits a role, voiceover is funny and delightfully cheesyyou can punch velociraptors in the face			",120,9,4,23,20,1,28

Each of them carries different weapons.The graphics are quite good and the DLC includes a survival mode.Killing defenseless goats is awesome. Recommended for FPS lovers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had this game since launch, and while it's grown slowly, I've had a blast every time i've played it. Each dinosaur has its own feel and there are some pretty interesting mechanics at play, like the ""distract a raptor with a rabbit"" one. The level design was also very interesting, since they actually created different map shortcuts for different dinosaurs. Compsognathus was extremely fun to play as.xoxo			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The maps are designed very well, it contains a pack of humorous in this game and the upcoming updates as well.

												A fun source based multiplayer game.... WITH DINOSAURS!!!I had a lot of fun with this game and definitely recommend it but there are not that many people playing as of the date of this review, generally there are two or three servers with people playing. There is also an option to create your own match with bots if that is of any interest.You have the choice of soldiers and a dino when playing as allies and then mainly dino's when playing as axis. Each class has their own weapons and special abilities such as air strikes and a dino with ability to throw a goat and kill the enemy in one hit. There are a couple of different game modes including KOTH, capture the point and deathmatch. There are other games modes but they are rarely played.Just in case all of that didn't persuade you; yes you can be a t-rex.With all that in mind, I personally would not pay full price at the moment purely due to low number of players online, I believe I picked mine up on sale at Christmas or another one of steams mass sales for next to nothing. If you can get this on sale, you will not be disappointed even if it's just to setup a bot match and try to defend yourself from a horde of micro-raptors with a flamethrower.			",140,10,1,11,6,0,7

												It's like Day of Defeat... but with dinosaurs. It's good for some wacky shameless gameplay, but it doesn't offer anything that deep. But then again, it's about Nazi Dinosaurs, so I guess you aren't expecting anything deep. But worth a buy, for sure.			",221,18,4,21,14,3,30

												The truth is finnally out there , history is written by the victors and thus we have been lied to by the US Government for 76 years but now it has been released in game form , dinosaurs were indeed resurrected by hitler and turned into socialist/fascist soldiers at the ready to serve the reich , it wasnt panzers that won his blitzkrieg war into france , it was Velociraptors and Styracosaurus's but alas the allies won and the war was over . The atom bomb had made the dinosaurs obsolete and were shipped to area 51 , left forgotten by the world .. until now			",63,1,0,1,4,0,5

												A game of truly rough n' tumble skirmishes set in the second world war. Nazis alone don't make for an edgy enough plot anymore, and zombies are a garish pink vibrating strap-on of an angle that's been utterly exhausted. Despite this, it still remains on the throne, an idea selling like hot cakes much like that decayed ol' king from warhammer 40K. So, What's next on the list? Dinosaurs? Sure, why not.    My first impressions are that the game plays rather nicely. Controlling dinosaurs and humans alike  feels fairly fluid, though the 'runts' and humans are fixed in first person while the bigger dinosaurs take third. It would be nice to have the choice if there's variation to begin with. So You've got a mix of human and late cretatious characters to play as, and each team has a fairly unique roster to offer. Unfortunately, it's the Axis that are milking this historical re-jigging for it's worth, as they have around six or seven full dino variants to pick from. Allies only have the one, and the rest of your team is comprised of pink♥♥♥♥♥♥♥honkeys. This alone can sap the joy out of playing as an American, bar the fact the world hates you, but I wouldn't say it presents a significant disadvantage. I suppose there's just no satisfaction in beating on a dinosaur as a dinosaur, but rather playing Godzilla and crushing the fleeing people on a whim. This is presumably why teams are reversed each round.    My main gripe with this game as it stands are the maps. They seem lackluster in design and rather sparse. Vantage points are obvious and don't really appear to be very thought out, and you can't even sling a few shells through glass windows. Overall, the game seems a tad shallow and lacking potential for interesting, engaging tactics. It's a pretty standard formula (often likened to Team Fortress 2) with nothing terribly new to offer.Nevertheless, I can't say it isn't satisfying to flatten a few yanks using a goat flung from your gargantuan jaws, or with another yank that you'd previously managed to keel over. There's fun to be had in this game for sure, but it's a quick, silly fix of entertainment and not one of any real lasting value. Would I recommend the game? Sure, for a happy drunken hootenanny or something. It's worth a chuckle or two at the least.			",43,10,1,3,1,1,2

It's a very good game that allows liberty to choose between people and dinossaurs, and most of all, there are completly different styles of people for every kind of player, and some even have a chance to swap weapons!The dinossaurs are for all kinds of players too, you can be fast and sneaky, or slow but deadly, you can even fly! You have plenty to choose from, and the best part is that all classes ARE actually useful for teamwork and can prevail against stronger classes, all you gotta do is get some skill with the character you choose!

												Very fun game, but obviously has some downsides which are just part of the game. It's hard to hit the tiny dinosaurs, but this is offset by the flamethrower. It is still possible to kill with the Garand or automatic weapons if you aim properly. Tiny dinos aren't that good anyway.I find it odd that there is no kick to guns if you aim down the sights, but this is offset by how much it obscures the screen.Most other negative reviews for this game are just rabbling about the hitboxes and how the game works. Axis and allies aren't actually unbalanced, and teams are auto-balanced so there is an equal amount of players on each time. Usually, the game is unbalanced in that good players really stick out.This game is more-or-less Day of Defeat Source but with Dinosaurs. Try the game, it's good. Definitely worth money.

												First when I saw the game SS , I thought this is one of those boring games with not so many players playing it online. But at the first time when I played it, I really got addicted to this game. It's too fun. This game reminds me a mix of cs 1.6 together with COD 1 , but with dino's in it, which makes the game even more fun.I strongly recommend this game.			",86,3,3,2,6,0,3

The game is an exploring game, if you think that you know everything then there are still things out there that you do not know.3. The game has amazing loadingscreens that show you a paper articel about WO2, ofcourse in DDD style!4. The game has different characters with each a different playing style, you have big dinos, small dinos, HUGE dinos!!5. The game has a lot other things, which i do not know yet, but i will find out, and so will you!! Just buy it ^_^Greetz, $weety			",173,38,3,22,9,2,17

												Totally recomended! It's a very good game that allows liberty to choose between people and dinossaurs, and most of all, there are completly different styles of people for every kind of player, and some even have a chance to swap weapons!The dinossaurs are for all kinds of players too, you can be fast and sneaky, or slow but deadly, you can even fly! You have plenty to choose from, and the best part is that all classes ARE actually useful for teamwork and can prevail against stronger classes, all you gotta do is get some skill with the character you choose!

It shifts from the ""usual"" shooters!There are not that much players on this game, but the people playing it are really nice, I never seen a community as good as that for a while.. Basically, most of the players are really friendly and this gives a nice atmosphere on the servers.			",78,4,0,1,1,0,4

												I didn't know nazis had dinos...thx 4 history lesson devs 10/10------------------------------All jokes aside though, This is sort of a interesting fun thing to pick-up for a cheap price, It's basically a fictional WW2 scenario where the Axis have Dinos hence the name ""Dino D-Day"" (?)It's multiplayer only and you get to pick a team, then pick a class and so forth.Then it plays out as a normal TDM/CTF like most multiplayer games.What made me recommend it because it felt different as in some maps the Axis can have a T-Rex fight alongside them which changes the game abit.There's some mounted guns around some maps that sorta help out if used in the right angle...Not exactly different from the rest but something.Another thing is most classes (except the T-Rex) have REALLY little amount of health but still do-able which made it feel balanced and in a weird way entertaining.That's pretty much it, just the little things you'll get bored of it really early on but still unique in a way i guess.Oh I forgot to mention that the Allies also have Dinos but not alot (only 2 classes) while the Axis have about 6-7 (Which still doesn't make the Axis OP, some weapons on the Allies's side are really powerful.)

												This game, Fits my catagory as fun. The insane plot, and the humor to go with it, makes it worth buying. If you like TF2, You will like this game, the humor from that game, can be found in this one, but it's still a different kind of humor. What I mean is that, It's not directly copy and paste. But that alone, should make someone want to play it. But, No, The gameplay is great as well. First off, This is a multiplayer game. No single player. HOWEVER, there is an option to face bots, if you want to play singleplayer, And you can customize the bots freely, Such as the difficulty, and What class they spawn as, But the fun can be found in the multiplayer in my opinion. I just like the fact they added the bots. You play as 1 of 2 teams. Allies, or Axis. The two powers in World War II. And each has some unique classes, Of course, You have your standard soldiers, for standard FPS gameplay, But they can be limited in what they do. Some are more close combat oriented, and others prefer long range. And you are stuck with the weapons they spawn with, you cannot pick up others. I like that idea. Of course, The most unique aspect of the game, Is the Dinosaurs. They are fun to play as... Extremely fun... At least for me. Others might have fun killing them, i like playing as them. The dinos in this game, Can also be unique in class. None feel the same. And some are harder to play than others. Also, Taking a dino, And strapping a gun to it's back... Is just awesome. Teamwork is rewarded in this. Going off alone and not helping the team, will almost always result in death. Sometimes, it can be worth it. But most of the time, helping team mates goes a long way. It almost feels like a comedic Battle field game, with smaller maps and such.  And while we are on the maps, They are all unique, and enjoyable. None of them make me say ""Aw... this map again?"" I always had a smile towards the next game. So, I recommend this game. The fact that nobody requested this, and the Devs put effort in this, makes it a very enjoyable game.			",67,8,0,11,11,0,26

												Nazi's with Dinosaurs! At first i though the premise was lame. I mean, I don't even like Nazis! And there are a brevvy of FPS WWII games already on the market. But it was on sale for only a single dollar, so what did I have to lose but a buck? And im glad I did.It's pretty much your typical multiplayer FPS war game, Axis versus Allies. Pick a team, a unit and duke it out with your chums online. But the worlds change when you realize.. YOU CAN BE A DINOSAUR.Now if you dont care about being a Velociraptor eating faces, this game isnt for you. But if you like dinosaurs, this game is for you!			",100,11,0,11,4,0,3

												This game is not complex. It is not ground-breaking. It brings nothing new to the table and honestly, when you really look at it, is just your average shooter. Except it's extremely fun. The best kind of fun. Dumb fun. The comedy and the art style, as well as the sheer stupidty of the scenario that this game poses fits well with the fast-paced objective combat. If I had to compare this to an existing game, I'd say a Team Fortress 2 / Day of Defeat Hybrid.When I first played this when it was a mod, it was horribly unbalanced. The Nazi's would always win. But they've fixed that in the retail release. The Allies and the Nazi's are pretty much equal (Nazi's have the most dinosaurs, while the Allies have the best guns.)8.8/10 It's dumb, but it's solid			",157,13,4,17,4,1,21

												YES, get this. Let me get to the point, its fun, hilarious, (one of the only games i enjoy the loading screens, hilarious), and in some ways, realistic battle elements (except the dinos!) did you like the mechanics and world of Team Fortress 2? did you like the weapons and combat style of Ressitance and Liberation? This is it. Comedy, action, and tons of fun. Sure, it has some work to be done. Currently, Micro-Raptors are a bit OP (small, hard to hit, let alone kill, good HP, and a 2 hit kill, and the ability to blind enemies). Wish there was an inventory menu like Team Fortress, so we can have variations in guns, but i also worry that would ruin the community. As it is, for the low price, extreme fun, get it.

												I bought this game looking especially the price, less than 2.5 euro ... thinking that even if it was crap, the economic loss would be completely irrelevant! Well, after a few hours of play I can be said to be more than satisfied with my choice: let's be clear, is anything but a masterpiece, but manages to give an immediate and enjoyable gaming experience. It's far from the technical levels of the most modern shooters, but it reminds me those games of late '90s that I loved to play cause they were able to enjoy immediately and give a couple of enjoyable hours, especially sharing them with friends. Again, the game has a pretty old graphics, mechanics  little outdated, and many people (especially younger players) may not like it, but in my opinion it's a must (at this price) for people like me who loved the first-person shooter in their beginning, because Dino D Day is this, a dip into the past. PRO: + concept + dinosaurs + class system + immediate gameplay (+ old mechanics) CONS:: -graphics -no interaction with the environment -some weapons are really OP (...flamethrower ) -some minor bugs (-old mechanics)ITALIANO:Ho comprato questo gioco guardando soprattutto il prezzo, meno di 2,5 euro...pensando che se anche fosse stato una schifezza, la perdita economica sarebbe stata del tutto irrilevante!ebbene, dopo un paio di ore di gioco io posso dire di essere più che soddisfatto della scelta fatta: parliamo chiaro, è tutto fuorchè un capolavoro, ma riesce a dare un'esperienza di gioco immediata e piacevole.Lontano dai livelli tecnici dei più moderni sparatutto, mi ricorda però quei giochi fine anni '90 che tanto mi piaceva giocare poichè capaci di divertire immediatamente e regalare un paio di ore spensierate, specialmente condividendo l'esperienza con gli amici.Ripeto, il gioco ha una grafica piuttosto vecchia, meccaniche superate e a molti (specialmente i più giovani giocatori) potrà non piacere, ma a mia opinione è un must (a questo costo) per chi come me hanno amato gli sparatutto in prima persona ai loro albori, perchè Dino D Day è questo, un tuffo nel passato.PRO:+concept+dinosauri+sistema a classi+gameplay immediato(+vecchie meccaniche)CONTRO:-grafica -nessuna interazione con l'ambiente-alcune armi OP (...lanciafiamme)-alcuni bug minori(-vecchie meccaniche)NB:Mi trovate su YouTube, Raziel's Channel all'indirizzo https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8mjStAGRGo-5SV9K205NBw ",185,31,0,22,33,2,9

												There is something about this game that brings out the little 10 year old in me... yet, at the same time, that 10 year old self merges with my 20+ year old self. Dinos plus shooters...? Sign me up!Very fun game that you'll play with your friends a lot. In regards to that, however, you are unable to create a server without port forwarding, etc. If only there was an option to create a server without all the hassle...			",318,135,4,23,36,6,46

												If I would have 2 euros in my steam wallet I would totaly buy it right now. This game is really hillarious and the game is not that serious. Would you like to punch a dinosaur? You can do it here. Also for some reason goats are implemented in this game and they must be killed. I've played this game twice on two free-to-play weekends and I can totaly recommend this game. 8 bananas /10 bananas			",311,63,6,16,24,4,27

												Remember when you were a little kid and you had army men, often engaging in crazy battles between transformers, Batman, and even dinosaurs? Those timeless days spent by yourself, picking up tiny pieces of plastic and following along with insane campaigns of your own demented design?That's sort of what it's like playing Dino D-Day. You might be spraying tiny carnivores with your tommy gun one second, and the next, you'll be ragdolled against a wall, instantly slain by a flying goat. Or you might be courageously defending an ally with your trusty M1 Garand, clips flinging out of your weapon hither and thither, when suddenly you hear a mighty roar behind you, and you are mowed down by the twin chain guns of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. These things have happened to me and will assuredly happen to you.The game is just great, goofy fun. You'll never feel TOO mad losing in this game, because there's always something dopey to laugh at. Even the loading screens, which are for my taste, a bit long, are still dominated by silly wartime documents detailing the Nazi war machine with their new reptillian additions. I am particularly fond of the newspaper article concerning a dino rendition of a grand Wagnerian opera that goes horribly wrong.In terms of gameplay, the multiplayer is indeed frantic, and requires you to do some thinking. If you choose the wrong class for your situation/map, then that could spell doom for your team. Alternatively, a well-placed tank dino might be just what you need to hold the point long enough. And although not many people necessarily play games with that much thought, I am confident that the construction of the class system is actually well-balanced and caters to any play style.Going back to that previous point, some may argue that certain classes are too powerful. To that I say, ""phooey!"" Each class has a counter-class, and the sooner you realize this, the better you'll play. As the most specific example, I've heard many people complain about the Allied character with the Garand. Yeah, he's pretty strong, especially in the hands of an expert marksman. But you put him in front of a tank dino and he's toast. Really. My point: if you're sucking, it's your own freakin' fault.If you don't have the DLC (and I don't, although I'm going to pick it up soon), there are three basic match types: deathmatch, king of the hill, and demolition. The T-Rex spawns on a couple maps, and adds a whole new dynamic to the gameplay. The maps are also well-made and don't allow players to hide anywhere indefinitely, save for the flying raptor, who often needs that upper hand/deception to stalk and make great kills.Anyway, if you're on the fence, I am all about this game. It's really excellent, and incredibly rewarding to people who play it either casually or otherwise. The only downside is that there is not a huge amount of people playing at the moment, which is really a shame, because this game rocks. I am looking forward to what other games the developers make.Go on, you know you want to throw a goat.			",20,5,0,2,3,0,4

												Dino D-Day easily captures attention by mixing Nazis and dinosaurs into an online World War II shooter but doesn't stay interesting for long. The guns don't feel powerful and the Nazi dinosaur combatants, despite all the humor value they bring to a fight, bring little in the way of satisfying gameplay. Sloppy controls, class imbalances, mediocre maps and a general lack of polish make Dino D-Day a tough game to enjoy. Once it's done making you laugh, there isn't much else worth sticking around for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dino D-Day easily captures attention by mixing Nazis and dinosaurs into an online World War II shooter but doesn't stay interesting for long. The guns don't feel powerful and the Nazi dinosaur combatants, despite all the humor value they bring to a fight, bring little in the way of satisfying gameplay. Sloppy controls, class imbalances, mediocre maps and a general lack of polish make Dino D-Day a tough game to enjoy. Once it's done making you laugh, there isn't much else worth sticking around for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How can I describe Dino D-Day? It's kind of like Day of Defeat with dinosaur's, and more weapons, and you have alternet weapons to choose from. Dino D-Day is the most underrated game I have even played. I have had more fun in Dino D-Day then most other games. Sure the game is in the Source engine, but that's ok, dated grachic's don't make a bad game. The only problem I have with Dino D-day is that there are not that many people playing it, other then when it's got a free weekend. I hope People pick it up more and play it. It's way better then most multi-player games out there. It's one of the few good dinosaur games out there, and the consept is great! Please pick this game up, you'll have a great time!

												Dino D-Day is a game with 2 teams Allies (mainly a human team with only one dinosaur named trigger) and Axis (mainly a dino team with only 3 humans) the 4 game modes are TDM, T-Rex mode, Capture The Flag, and King of the Hill. TDM is allies vs axis, T-Rex mode is when they choose one person from axis to be a rex, King of the Hill is when you try to capture the flag for the team and wait for the time to run out, and Capture the Flag is when you capture 5 flag points and one point requires 2 or more people to capture it. This game is really fun and i recomend it, its worth the money and time to play it. Anyways if you ever get the game i hope yall enjoy playing it!			",16,3,0,2,2,0,1

												I never really enjoyed first-person shooter games, because they normally give me headaches, but this game may be one of the only exceptions! With a steady hand on your mouse and a good connection to the internet, the headaches cease to torture me. I find the game light-hearted and fun. I mean, how can you take a game where you play as/with/against (nazi) dinosaurs seriously? It's funny and enjoyable. There aren't many people playing online, but when you find a decently filled server, it is fun to play. I highly recommend this game to those who are in it for fun rather than to beat the rest of the players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OverviewYou can't get more rediculous than Nazi Dinosaurs. Dino D Day is a funny little indie game that puts you in online multiplayer fights between humans and dinosaurs, axis vs allies. There are dinosaurs and humans for both sides however - unlike primal carnage and extinction. This also means you get less annoying people going AFK so they can switch teams. But anyway, this game is pretty fun and has an amusing story shown through news clippings on loading screens. However everything does a little too much damage, so whatever you are you die pretty quickly. This does get a little annoying...Positive+ Dinosaurs+ Team Variety+ Lots of game modesNegative- GraphicsConclusionDino D Day is interesting and fun enough but can get very frustrating as everyone dies so quickly, so a lot of your time will just be spent waiting for the respawn screen. Also, there are bots in the game.			",207,50,1,11,9,3,6

												This game takes place in the era of WW II, Hitler and his scients have found a way to make Dinosuars. Thus the concept of Dino D-Day. Battlefields of team deathmatch against the SS and their dinosuars vs the US troops and its dinosaur. (Notice i didnt had an S at the end of dinosaur?? Well thats because the US only gets one [""Everybody gets one.""] ) This game is extremly fun and i absolutly recomend this game. (hints the thumbs up, and why this is sectioned under the positvie section of the review catagory)  This game does have a low amount of people playing, infact you generally find your playing with the same group of people. While this game as a low user plaer base, it doesn't stop it from being extremly fun. Its actually a shock at how low the user player base is. Thats why im writing this review, to get YOU. Yes i do mean YOU to come play this game. come be apart of the DDD comunity and come kill some Nazi Dinosuars!!!...... or kill Americans, you know your call. What are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? Go buy this game! Seriously stop reading this review, come join this community and this amazing adventure youll have playing this game.			",112,7,1,11,7,0,18

												I enjoy the fact that the graphics aren't perfect like most new games. It gives the game an older feel. Considering it has dinosaurs, that isn't a bad thing. I also really enjoy the dinosaur aspect. It's brilliant. Give it a go and for a good length of time. I have to agree if you enjoyed TF2 you will enjoy this. Don't be put off by bad reviews.

												Dino D-Day is a multiplayer team-based first-person action video game developed by 800 North and Digital Ranch and published by Valve Corporation. It was released as a digital download, via Steam, on April 8th 2011.The game is developed as a total conversion modification on the Valve Corporation's Source engine.The premise of the game is that during World War II, Adolf Hitler found a way to resurrect dinosaurs for use in the war effort. Players can battle online choosing to serve either the Allied nations or the Nazis.The game has been described as a new twist on ""the overdone World War II FPS ... that has become a running joke in the industry and gaming press"". Upon the game's initial release, both the Allies and the Axis had six different classes of soldier. The Allied classes range from assault troops, medics and heavy support. However, the Axis have three human and three dinosaur classes. The human classes comprise assault troops, snipers and medics; while the dinosaurs comprise an attack Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus, and a Desmatosuchus with a cannon mounted on its back. Additional classes were added to both teams at later dates bringing the total to seven classes for the Allies and nine for the Axis. The Allies gained a dinosaur class of their own, a Protoceratops with a mounted machine gun. The Axis gained a Stygimoloch with a mounted gun, a Compsognathus that acts as a kamikaze bomber with a grenade and a flying Microraptor. In certain maps, an Axis player can also be chosen at random to play as a Tyrannosaurus with a jaw-mounted machine gun. While powerful, the class counts as three kills in a team death match.

												Ok so I got this game from vizzed.com's market so I pretty much got this for freeAnyway I thought this was just going to be some game that I'd regret getting but I was pleasantly surprisedIt's pretty much CS:GO or TF2 set in WW2 time period that has dinosaurs added to one team. All in all crazy fun, but I can already tell that the dinosaurs are overpowered AF.			",42,3,0,1,1,0,0

THAT IS MY DINO.Dino D-Day is a simple and fun multi-player FPS. The game is set in a WW2 setting where dinos are a thing and both Axis and Allies have some of them. This is it. You pick a server, chose your class and play it. After some time, you'll be given the chance to play as a big dinosaur and make lots of kills (or be just an idiot dino and wander around the map). However, at least without the DLC Last Stand, I couldn't find lots of servers, but I had some fun with it in some of the official servers. And it's obviously unbalanced.I also experienced some performance issues and long loading times, both unexpected, especially the loading time (in my first play it takes 1 minute to load the map/server, then 30 seconds on the next plays).Anyway, I really recommend it for it's price.This is a 8.0/10 for me.

												A gem in the rough, as they say.Fun and satisfying, both as humans and dinosaurs, Dino D-Day is so far the best dinosaur arena PVP game I've played, even though I'm very very late to the party and the community for this game is tiny as of writing this review.While the game could definitely use more work and some balancing, it's still a very solid experience, and most importantly it's fun to play as the dinosaurs which, let's be honest, is what everyone is after with games like these.It's definitely worth the price if you're hankerin' for some dinosaur on man action ;)			",151,23,1,9,8,1,2

												5.3/10 - Dinosaurs and Nazis Mixed with Counter StrikeIt’s a pretty fun game, not the best by any means. For the price I would pick up CS:GO or something with more polish. I have to say though killing and Nazis and Dinosaurs can never be that bad!I've found its way easier to play as the dinosaurs/Nazis. Some of the dinos are too small and prove impossible to kill with your gun alone. (Being one is way fun.) You will do more dying in this game than many others. For that reason I can't give it too high of marks. Multiplayer still has a few servers rocking; these players for the most part have played lots and will crush you at first. Keep at it though!Worth $5; not $10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Dino D-Day is a treat.The story drags you in from the very start. The game had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through! Every time I think of turning the game off something amazing happens and sucks me back in. The only thing I really think this missed out on was deep and envoloping romance, this is just a personal perference that I want all my dinosaur games to have so I was a little disappointed. However the game makes up for lack of romance with it's amazing cast of characters that I have never been more attached to in my life! (they actually make me feel like I have friends) All in all Dino D-Day really captures the Friendship and captivating story most games miss out on. Just wish it had romance :( 8/8 gr8 game.

												This is an excellent game. Even though Dino D-Day isn't that popular, the game has some good and bad thigs things about it. First of all, the different classes are very creative and fun, especially in the Axis. You can control a variety of different dinosaurs like the velociraptor and the compsognathus. The velociraptor can leap on people and will kill the oppenent and kill them if someone can't shoot it off in time. The compy (Compsognathus) will go and take out peole. If they get 3 kills, they can run at the enemy and explode with devastating power. Those are just a few of the creative dinos and what they do. The Allied classes are pretty cool too, though I thought the Allies could have had one or two more classes, but that's just nitpicking. There are some great map designs, (Other then T-rex maps, talk more into detail later.) I still haven't found all of the good sniper spots yet. The only bad things I can think of are the graphics, and the ultimate kicking-butt-and-taking-names-dinosaur, the T-rex. The graphics are meh, but can be easily overlooked after a few rounds. The T-rex, though incredibly awesome, isn't that great in game. At times he seems overpowered, but at other times he seems too weak. I think it's mostly because of the design of the maps with the T-rex. In one map there is a huge open expanse where there will either: A. Get slaughtered by snipers, the machineguns, snipers, etc. or B. Get to their base and slaughter them. It doesn't bother me much because I play the maps without T-rex, so I can't comlain much. The only other thing wrong is how unpopular this game is. When the servers start to empty out, there can sometimes be only 5 people total on one of the many servers there are. Like most other games, it's only fun when there are lots of other people. So I recommend you get this game and fill up the servers.			",63,9,0,14,20,1,3

												I hadn't played a first person shooter type game since 2009, so I was a bit skeptical about picking this game up. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. There are strengths and weaknesses in both groups which helps balance everything out. The levels are pretty fun and inventive and smooth to play through (though sometimes the Dinos get stuck on objects... especially the big ones!). The graphics are also very nice, and the little details that they put into the Character models are pretty cool too... the T-Rex's belly jiggles when she moves! All in all, I am very happy to have bought this game and have a lot of fun playing whether I win or lose. But... remember that this is all coming from someone who hasn't played a shooter game since 2009. So I can't compare it to other games and have no other shooter gaming experience.As with most online shooters, your experience will vary depending on whomever is on the server at any given game. Sometimes you do well, sometimes you don't. Just keep that in mind! ^^ ",3,0,0,1,1,0,0

												I played the game for a bit on a free weekend I while I thought it was a novel experience, the user interface is complete♥♥♥♥♥ This game cries out for an interactive run down of the controls. It was a constant annoyance having to back out to the Controls sub-menu ever 2-3 minutes to troubleshoot some queuery of 'how do I do that thing'. Also, the Axis teams seem to be disproportionately occupied, making getting to actually play as a dinosaur almost impossible with the constant auto-balancing. Out of 7-8 matches in which I STARTED as Axis I was abruptly auto-balanced over to Alliance, something I found supremely obnoxious. But at the end of the day 100% of the playability comes from playing as/shooting up Nazi Dinosaurs. And if playing as/pumping lead into a Nazi Dinosaur is your dream the learning curve shouldn't dissuade you from flailing around, frantically nipping the ankles of Ally scum/blowing the head off a mother-chompin' T-Rex.

												I was not sure after purchasing dino horde if I should get this even on the cheap  . But with minutes left and abit of funny stuff watched on youtube I decided to grab it for £1.70 . Abit miffed it was going free a few weeks back from a well mnown website but so many savings on cheap summer sales I felt i could push the boat abit HA HA .. So glad I did . Its far better than some would have u belive and is also very playable on a pad (certain classes suited more than others , I did very well for a first try with a pad) . Its very fun for a few hours at a time . I have only played one decent session with a most classes (no idea how to be a big trex yet) but will be back for more fun many times .. If we were back in the 80s/90s I would of spent my money 5 times over in the arcade already so walking away on day one chuffed . And many players . Not loads but at least 4 to 5 full rooms at all times I was on (early evening) with many more half full lobbies , which I found abit more stealthy and fun If u see it cheap then just grab it . If u Really Really love dinosaurs I see no reason why a full price purchase wouldnt satisfy your dino thirst . And if u are kinda sick of the same old modern shooters and miss the old days abit . HELLO !! right here LOL			",121,4,32,4,7,4,12

												15/10Game of the Decade.I was lucky enough to pick this game up for free, so I am slighty biased, as I didn't have to spend a dime on it. However, I would happily pay for this game.As a kid, I am sure you would often play with your dinosaur toys and your army-men action figures. You probably had some crazy scenario where the bad guys controlled the dinos and the good guys were the army men trying to stop the bad guys.This is that game.This is the awnser to a question I never knew I had, and that question is ""What would I call the Peak of humanity?""Brilliant gameplay, great ingame chatter between the NPCs, and amazing matches.I never knew I wanted to be a 25 foot T-Rex with Gattling guns strapped to the side of my head before today.

												Dino D-Day is a fresh breath in the unfortunately stale age of Call of Duty. Like all games it has it's pro's and cons, but I feel the pros far out way the cons. The community is friendly and the game is simply entertaining. Over all I give the game 7.5/10The Pros:The community is friendly. The game's loading screens let and trailers let you know the game doesn't take itself seriously and the community seems to reflect the ""It's just for fun"" attitude. Newbie’s are always asking for help and the Vets are off to the rescue with quick replies.The Dino-factor.Adding in a handful of random dinosaurs with machine gun attached to their head makes it fun to play other characters for a change instead of the running shotgun or the always camping sniper, although those characters are open if that’s your style.The game offers a multiple maps and game play options.This is often taken for granted, “it's an online multiplayer game, of course it is going to have options!” Yes, but these add a certain flavor to each game and game play.The Cons:There is no tutorial and the manual is not always helpful. The game gives you some hints on the loading screens, but more often than not the Newbie’s, like myself, have had to take a break from chowing down on an Allied soldier or shooting dino's to ask for some help.The maps are often cluttered.It makes for great fun on some places but other maps just feel like they were thrown together quickly so that there was an extra map. One map even has two towers that allow you to spawn camp rather easily.The graphics aren't too modern.This one isn't a large concern of mine, I remember Goldeneye, still have it in my N64 and this is a large step away from the age of Doom. Still, I understand why some people could be put off by the raw graphic.			",208,36,4,36,15,0,26

												It's always great to see the looks on my friends faces when I tell them I'm going home to play ""Dino D-Day"". Dino D-Day is a multiplayer game that throws dinosaurs into an otherwise mediocre FPS. It's really a novelty more than anything and a great game to pick up for on sale, but play it for no more than 15 minutes and you'll quickly realize it's nothing more than an unoriginal cardboard cutout design of the ever popular TF2, taking similar systems, sounds and maps Dino D-Day still reamins playable thanks to its lovable gimmick.

												It's always great to see the looks on my friends faces when I tell them I'm going home to play ""Dino D-Day"". Dino D-Day is a multiplayer game that throws dinosaurs into an otherwise mediocre FPS. It's really a novelty more than anything and a great game to pick up for on sale, but play it for no more than 15 minutes and you'll quickly realize it's nothing more than an unoriginal cardboard cutout design of the ever popular TF2, taking similar systems, sounds and maps Dino D-Day still reamins playable thanks to its lovable gimmick. I mean who doesn't love cannon mounted dinosaurs? A decent and playable 6/10			",118,12,1,15,10,2,4

												Well, it seems games evolve with updates, so never tried dino d day in its early days, but people said it was bad. After 3 years of being released, I got it and all the bugs and glitches have been fixed. Didn't find any bug like animals floating etc. Regarding to gameplay, now it is more balanced, since you can go dino + soldiers (axis) vs dino + soldiers (allies). Before, only nazis had dinos. Although it could be named as a mod, dino d day is a very fun game, very arcade so don't compared it to COD or BF3/4.The animations of dinos are ok, the weapons are ok, and graphics, well, it is made in source engine (2004), so kind of meh.  But when deathmatching and combined with parade music of world war, it makes the game ridiculous in a good way. To kill some time is recommended. I wish it had more maps and game modes, the game offers little. So, buy it only on discount (50% off 0r 75% off)P.D I enjoyed more dino d day than titan fall and COD ghost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The lols are strong with this one"" - Yoda If you like channleing the power of america and punching T-rexs to death then you've found your new home. Whether it be hocking lugis on your enemies faces or dining on jackrabbits as a raptor you'll have some fun with this game. It plays a lot like Tf2 in a sense but has dinosaurs (Note the allies only have 1 dinosaur who is pretty exceptional.) the dinosaurs are the highlight of the nazis but the allies have some heavy hitters as well like Hardgrave who uses an M1 garand and after getting 3 kills can use his beserk ability, this ability literally makes you only able to punch and near invincible for about 20 seconds. There are a lot more classes with a lot more ways to play and have fun you might be able to spend 40+ hours on this game.			",62,3,3,10,4,0,2

												I did not partake in the war, but i do know that this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I mean, you forgot that Hitler did infact did have a mechsuit that was in the shape of a cactus to strike fear into dwarven enemies. The allies also strapped these velociraptors to their guns to boost morale and to throw them at their enemies to murderize them when they run out of bullets. And most of all the game lacks the giant earthworms that wear tinfoil and emitt oil from their teeth. Overall, not accurate, but close enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, and I thought WWII was done to death. Turns out, all you need is dinosaurs. Combining the two greatest things, guns and dinos, Dino D-Day is more fun than it has any right to be. The classes are all unique, and the dinos are a blast to play as.The only issue is getting used to the dino controls. Some are a bit wonky, and you may need to remap them, but it's a simple fix.Seriously consider getting this game.			",40,4,0,15,9,1,0

												I'd say this game is just a Call of Duty clone with dinosaurs, but it is actually quite different. Instead, it plays a lot like Team Fortress 2 (most likely because it runs off of what looks like the Source engine). The game doesn't fling you into a chincey ""First person shooter...but with DINOSAURS!!!!11!!11!"" mentality because the game is actually well balanced, with even the Tyrannosaurus Rex being well balanced. It features plenty of playable reptilian friends along with those of the homosapian nature, and neither class is overpowered. A definite buy (especially at it's 90% off sale at .99 cents)!PROS:Play as different dinosaurs that aren't gimmickyWell balanced game overallPretty good map designAudio is cleanDoesn't feel repititious like CoD or Battlefield because of the Dinosaur mechanic and their strengths and weaknessesDefinitely asking a good price for the gameCONS (with opinions):Game engine could've been better, something that doesn't feel too Valve-y, could've utilized higher detail engines (Unreal would've been perfect in my opinion).Even with the selection of Dinosaurs, more would've definitely been better.The wait to respawn mechanic gets old. Fast.Switching class in spawn kills you (and restarts the respawn timer).Other than that, the game is pretty good.IS IT WORTH YOUR TIME AND $$$ - YESWILL IT SATISFY YOUR DINO FPS HUNGER - YESIS THE GAME REALLY FUN AND FRESH FEELING - YESWILL THE GAME MAKE YOU RAGE - PROBABLY AT TIMESDO I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME - YOU BETCHA!Gameplay 9.5/10 ",19,0,0,1,1,0,0

												I played the game for a bit on a free weekend I while I thought it was a novel experience, the user interface is complete♥♥♥♥♥ This game cries out for an interactive run down of the controls. It was a constant annoyance having to back out to the Controls sub-menu ever 2-3 minutes to troubleshoot some queuery of 'how do I do that thing'. Also, the Axis teams seem to be disproportionately occupied, making getting to actually play as a dinosaur almost impossible with the constant auto-balancing. Out of 7-8 matches in which I STARTED as Axis I was abruptly auto-balanced over to Alliance, something I found supremely obnoxious. But at the end of the day 100% of the playability comes from playing as/shooting up Nazi Dinosaurs. And if playing as/pumping lead into a Nazi Dinosaur is your dream the learning curve shouldn't dissuade you from flailing around, frantically nipping the ankles of Ally scum/blowing the head off a mother-chompin' T-Rex.

												A great game, where you can play dinosaurs revived by Hitler.Welcome to Nazirassic Park.More seriously, this game is wonderful. It feels exactly like Jurassic Park, but with guns. The T-Rex is still impressive, and when you try to kill it and that he looks at you, you thinks something like ""OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, WHY DID I TRIED TO ATTACK SOMETHING SO HUGE ?"" And you usually die before the end of this sentence. Some days, you should just stay in bed. But to buy this game, I'm ready to wake you up myself.			",48,9,2,5,6,0,3

												At its price, you really just need to read the title to know if you want this game. I will note that it does not really have a massive amount of people online regularly, but there will usually be one or two servers with a good amount of people. Playing against the AI is also great, except in the snow park map where they can see through obstacles and have better vision than the player.			",66,17,0,25,9,3,8

												Hey Guys, TheRetroGamingNerd here for a game review.So! I go check around for the big Holiday Sale, and I see this.It's basically Call of Dinosaurs!!!! But here's the review partGraphics: 5/10The Graphics are ok, they remind me of the first COD games, and TF2 a little bit. they could have done better, but they're good for a newer game!User Interface: 3/10They Really need to seperate the ammo from the health. I thought the ammo was the health for about 20 minutes.Community: 4/10It's got a pretty small Player-Base.Content: 8/10Fun content, but needs some additions like new weapons, and more customizationStory: 10/10Shoot. Kill. Explode. Die. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.Total Rating:7/10It's a great game, but needs A LOT more work.			",65,7,0,12,7,0,9

												It’s like Counterstrike with dinosaurs, DINOSAURS WHICH ARE NAZIS! It's pretty safe to say Dino D-Day is a different kind of World War II shooter, mostly because it features dinosaurs. This game has some kind of sarcastic humor and trys to show the people the worldwar-topic on a funny not serious way. Like WTF THE NAZIS ARE SO OVERPOWERED and have MAGICALLY POWER…!!! HAVE YOU HEARED THEY RESURRECTED THE DINOSAURS FOR A NOT STOPABLE DINOSAUR ARMY? Ehm… yes thats the game about. xDGenre: Multiplayer, first person shooterGraphic: 9/10 good graphic with funny detailsAudio: 10/10 realistic sound, historical soundTeams: Allied nations and NazisCharacters: 9 different humans, 7 dinosaur classes All with special abilities and weapons (26 classical weapons from WWII). Gameplay: 8/10 for the controls; primary it’s a bit confusing but when you are better with the controls and you have a better overview about the map ist pretty funny.Cons:I don’t know why but some controls don’t work for me: For example I looked for the keyboard controls and it said „F = weapon option“ but with a human nothing happens when I press F and when I press F with a dinosaur he pees. O: Really…. He pees!And the R for reload also doesn’t work for me… I have just played it for 2 hours but it’s still a bit confusing for me (so I would be really happy if someone of you can help me out ^^).An other negative aspect in my eyes that there are just a few people playing this game so there are a lot of server with no players and you don’t have much choice on which server you want to play. It’s also sad that there is just ONE Server with BOTS and I asked myself if this server is in china or where because first time I couldn’t connect and the second time I waited for 5 minutes till I connected with 900+ Ping and frozen pictures / teleport (you maybe know this feeling).However I still think its a good game because I was 2 hours on a good working server with uhm around 20-30 players the whole time and I had a lot of fun. You should make your own opinion from the facts but if you play it please let me know! (:			",90,4,2,2,8,0,3

												Really fun game that I got for free over the summer thanks to PC Gamer.  You get to play as one of two sides, the Allies or the Axis.  When you're the Allies, you will play as soldiers, though there is one dino available to play as.  The fun part of the game is when you play as the Axis, since that is where most of the playable dino characters are available.  My favourite dinosaur is the small flying one, and you get to rekt snipers since they never pay attention to their surroundings.  If you like class based shooters, then you'll probably like this game .  If not, then maybe you'll like the dinosaur gameplay.ALSO:  They recently updated the game, bringing it to a newer verison of the Source engine from what I know.  There is also a new DLC called Last Stand which is just survival, seems cool but I haven't gotten it yet.			",203,24,7,16,17,3,13

												A legitimently interesting FPS. A class-based multiplayer shooter set in an alternate version of World War II. One where the Nazis ressurected dinosaurs to fight in an army. You can play as the dinosaurs. The Axis has 3 human classes and 6 dinosaurs, whereas the Allies have 8 humans and one dinosaur. The Allies are also from different backgrounds which makes them feel like actual characters.In Short: The maps are interesting (In one the Allies can collect presents that Santa dropped after he was shot down), the mechanics are cool, and the game is very fun.

												This game is fun.  Now, when I say ""fun,"" I mean that it is FUN.  Pure, unadultered FUN.  It's the sort of game where you can play as an exploding compsognathus, which should say enough.  Of course, there are some people out there who want realistic, serious games.  People who get offended because someone else's dinosaur does not match what they pictured as said dinosaur.  This game is very tongue-and-cheek about everything it does.  It's a war game with dinosaurs, and it knows it.  It's a beautiful sense of humor that also makes this game a winner.  As well as the community; it's a small, friendly group of people who will help you out if you're a beginner.  In short, if you have a sense of humor and a love of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you.			",270,179,5,28,17,3,19

												This one's a decent buy but just barely in my opinion. You can get it on sale for $1 and it is entertaining but I don't feel it's something that can be played for a very long time. May be wrong about that though.Pros:Only $1 on saleFunnyThey have a tiny dinosaur that has a stick grenade taped to it's back to suicide bomb. That falls under funny but it deserves it's own.Cons:Most servers seem empty, only like 3-4 populated ones.My ping will randomly jump from ~40 to over 800, it did this in every server and turned the game into a slideshow making me a free target for the other team.The axis gets most of the dinosaurs and the allies only get one. This wouldn't be too terrible if 2 of the axis dinosaurs weren't microscopic and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to shoot.The teams aren't exactly mirror copies, obviously because axis gets the most dinosaurs you'd expect that. The allies have a flamethrower which the axis has no similar class for, meanwhile the axis raptor is close to an assassin since you can pounce people for a near instant kill. The most annoying part is that the classes that do exist on both sides aren't necessarily lined up. Both teams have snipers and medics for example but when your team switches you'll be something else because they're not in the same location on the selection screen.So-So:The graphics aren't the best but that's to be expected.Some of the gun animations look like crap to me.A bit odd is that some dinosaurs are 3rd person and others are 1st person.Community, I put this hear because I couldn't get a read on them. Some of the chat seemed joking and friendly but then other times it's a flame fest I tried to ignore, and I had to turn voip off because I couldn't take the stupid conversations.

												Wow, and I thought WWII was done to death. Turns out, all you need is dinosaurs. Combining the two greatest things, guns and dinos, Dino D-Day is more fun than it has any right to be. The classes are all unique, and the dinos are a blast to play as.The only issue is getting used to the dino controls. Some are a bit wonky, and you may need to remap them, but it's a simple fix.Seriously consider getting this game.			",40,4,0,15,9,1,0

												I did not partake in the war, but i do know that this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I mean, you forgot that Hitler did infact did have a mechsuit that was in the shape of a cactus to strike fear into dwarven enemies. The allies also strapped these velociraptors to their guns to boost morale and to throw them at their enemies to murderize them when they run out of bullets. And most of all the game lacks the giant earthworms that wear tinfoil and emitt oil from their teeth. Overall, not accurate, but close enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every once in a while I play a dumb game that gets a special place in my heart. Dino D-Day was one of those games. Imagine a world where, instead of Zombies, the FPS genre took a hold of dinosaurs instead. It's wonderful.A couple of the lobbies we joined seemed to have bugged out spitting dinos, that made quick work of the allies. The teams and classes themselves aren't particularly well balanced from what I saw, I think the Allies won 1 of the 5 games we played.I was sold this game in the promise of T Rex's but I couldn't find if and how I could play one, which was a little disappointing, but the Dino Tank made me forget about it pretty quickly.

												Dino D-Day is a fresh breath in the unfortunately stale age of Call of Duty. Like all games it has it's pro's and cons, but I feel the pros far out way the cons. The community is friendly and the game is simply entertaining. Over all I give the game 7.5/10The Pros:The community is friendly. The game's loading screens let and trailers let you know the game doesn't take itself seriously and the community seems to reflect the ""It's just for fun"" attitude. Newbie’s are always asking for help and the Vets are off to the rescue with quick replies.The Dino-factor.Adding in a handful of random dinosaurs with machine gun attached to their head makes it fun to play other characters for a change instead of the running shotgun or the always camping sniper, although those characters are open if that’s your style.The game offers a multiple maps and game play options.This is often taken for granted, “it's an online multiplayer game, of course it is going to have options!” Yes, but these add a certain flavor to each game and game play.The Cons:There is no tutorial and the manual is not always helpful. The game gives you some hints on the loading screens, but more often than not the Newbie’s, like myself, have had to take a break from chowing down on an Allied soldier or shooting dino's to ask for some help.The maps are often cluttered.It makes for great fun on some places but other maps just feel like they were thrown together quickly so that there was an extra map. One map even has two towers that allow you to spawn camp rather easily.The graphics aren't too modern.This one isn't a large concern of mine, I remember Goldeneye, still have it in my N64 and this is a large step away from the age of Doom. Still, I understand why some people could be put off by the raw graphic.			",208,36,4,36,15,0,26

												I was not sure after purchasing dino horde if I should get this even on the cheap  . But with minutes left and abit of funny stuff watched on youtube I decided to grab it for £1.70 . Abit miffed it was going free a few weeks back from a well mnown website but so many savings on cheap summer sales I felt i could push the boat abit HA HA .. So glad I did . Its far better than some would have u belive and is also very playable on a pad (certain classes suited more than others , I did very well for a first try with a pad) . Its very fun for a few hours at a time . I have only played one decent session with a most classes (no idea how to be a big trex yet) but will be back for more fun many times .. If we were back in the 80s/90s I would of spent my money 5 times over in the arcade already so walking away on day one chuffed . And many players . Not loads but at least 4 to 5 full rooms at all times I was on (early evening) with many more half full lobbies , which I found abit more stealthy and fun If u see it cheap then just grab it . If u Really Really love dinosaurs I see no reason why a full price purchase wouldnt satisfy your dino thirst . And if u are kinda sick of the same old modern shooters and miss the old days abit .

												This game is a mix of DoD and Dinosaurs... It's awesome! and the only negative aspect is that it's MP only and it lacks the strong community TF2 has. But everything else is top notch, especially the Axis dinosaurs. Throwing goats, sneaking, flying and spitting, it's epic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it seems games evolve with updates, so never tried dino d day in its early days, but people said it was bad. After 3 years of being released, I got it and all the bugs and glitches have been fixed. Didn't find any bug like animals floating etc. Regarding to gameplay, now it is more balanced, since you can go dino + soldiers (axis) vs dino + soldiers (allies). Before, only nazis had dinos. Although it could be named as a mod, dino d day is a very fun game, very arcade so don't compared it to COD or BF3/4.The animations of dinos are ok, the weapons are ok, and graphics, well, it is made in source engine (2004), so kind of meh.  But when deathmatching and combined with parade music of world war, it makes the game ridiculous in a good way. To kill some time is recommended. I wish it had more maps and game modes, the game offers little. So, buy it only on discount (50% off 0r 75% off)P.D I enjoyed more dino d day than titan fall and COD ghost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was my first honest-to-noodly-appendage first person shooter, and I *loved* it. I found learning the controls a bit tricky and the in-game help was a bit hit and miss on that front (perhaps it is geared more toward people who have fps experience rather than a beginner), but the game itself is pretty forgiving. My chief complaint with the game is the load time - I am used to tabbing in and out of games and found I needed to do it on this one to try and look up help with the controls. Trying to tab back in? Forget about it. The screen can take a number of minutes to load again, and with quick games this can mean you're out for an entire session (your teammates *love* that).The group I was playing with also was having a very difficult time setting up our own game with our own controls (we wanted to play in a group with a bunch of bots as our first experience with D D-D), and we never did manage to do it.In spite of the little quibbles, this game really is a lot of fun. I laughed quite a bit at someone in the chat complaining that the gun on his dinosaur wasn't as accurate as he wanted it to be because, well, Nazi dinosaurs. tldnr; NAZI DINOSAURS. EEEEEEEEEEEE!

Some of the maps have pretty powerful camping spots - which can be annoying and fun.  On some of the bigger maps you can play as a T-rex if you get a high enough kill streak.  There are different game modes as well.  A amusing, fast paced, easy to learn online shooter.			",52,4,3,2,5,0,1

												There's really no reason not to buy this game. There's no unlocking anything or improving weapons. You start the game with everything and it's just straight up who is better. Snipers are AWESOME and actually require some degree of skill. Also there's some dinos with guns strapped to their back. Random game modes on random maps. Changes it up quite a bit. It's never TDM over and over. Scoring is off for the rounds. You switch sides but the sides themselves are scored, not the teams that control the sides. So if it ends in a tie for the match, it can mean one team was just dominent.			",49,3,3,5,18,1,6

												Balance is important for a game like this, and controls.  No matter how fun it is, the game needs these to be great.  Luckily, the controls are very tight and the game seems very balanced.  Each class is unique, and the dinosaurs are great to control and are more than just gimmiky, they offer great loadout options and are great for gameplay.  Furthremore, while the Nazis have dinosaur classes, the other human classes have a wide range of weaponry to counterack the dino-threat.  Playing as humans in this game is not as boring as you would think it is.    If you like TF2, then you'll really dig this game.  It feels like a TF2 with dinosaurs, as you'll often see every class from TF2 implemented in this (Save for the engineer and spy).  Whether or not you want to spend 10.00$ for a class based shooter that plays similarly to TF2(Which is free), that is up to you.  However, if you're itching for another multiplayer shooter where you can play as Nazi dinosaurs, or just looking for a really good time, then pick this game up!Kim Jong Un Approves.

												I'd say this game is just a Call of Duty clone with dinosaurs, but it is actually quite different. Instead, it plays a lot like Team Fortress 2 (most likely because it runs off of what looks like the Source engine). The game doesn't fling you into a chincey ""First person shooter...but with DINOSAURS!!!!11!!11!"" mentality because the game is actually well balanced, with even the Tyrannosaurus Rex being well balanced. It features plenty of playable reptilian friends along with those of the homosapian nature, and neither class is overpowered. A definite buy (especially at it's 90% off sale at .99 cents)!PROS:Play as different dinosaurs that aren't gimmickyWell balanced game overallPretty good map designAudio is cleanDoesn't feel repititious like CoD or Battlefield because of the Dinosaur mechanic and their strengths and weaknessesDefinitely asking a good price for the gameCONS (with opinions):Game engine could've been better, something that doesn't feel too Valve-y, could've utilized higher detail engines (Unreal would've been perfect in my opinion).Even with the selection of Dinosaurs, more would've definitely been better.The wait to respawn mechanic gets old. Fast.Switching class in spawn kills you (and restarts the respawn timer).Other than that, the game is pretty good.IS IT WORTH YOUR TIME AND $$$ - YESWILL IT SATISFY YOUR DINO FPS HUNGER - YESIS THE GAME REALLY FUN AND FRESH FEELING - YESWILL THE GAME MAKE YOU RAGE - PROBABLY AT TIMESDO I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME - YOU BETCHA!Gameplay 9.5/10 ",19,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Dinosaurs and day of defeat? Why wouldn't anyone want to buy this! This game is a fps with dinosaurs, nazis, and the allied forces in a day of defeat style game with a couple of game modes which include ctf, dm, and objective. The nazis have brought dinosaurs back to life to fight and the allied forces must defeat the tyranny of Hilters army. I love this game and you should buy it, it has very good gameplay.

												One of the most under rated shooters out there!How something like COD can get popular but original ideas like this get almost no credit I will never know, but that's besides the point, let's dive into my review, shall we?So lets start with the pros first:-A fun take on combat, with humans pitted against different dinosaurs-For the most part, the combat is pretty balanced. Different characters counter different dinosaurs, and vice versa. I have yet to have encountered something OP so far (though the jackrabbits can be pretty annoying)-Almost all the characters/dinos are well thought out, with actual backstories and some with special abilities!-Different dinos and (I think) different humans have different health bars. With this, comes some cons though. The tankiest dino can only move into places more into the open, because he's too fat to squeeze through doorways. I feel this is a good way to balance things-Awesome comics to read if you're interested in the backstory! (as you can tell by the trailers, it's pretty well thought out!)-MUTE BUTTON! THANK YOU!-Lots of new people trying out the game, so we're all on equal playing ground. Not a lot of sweaty tryhards here!And now.....To the cons:-Once you've played all the classes it gets a bit repetitive-The community isn't DEAD but it's starting to get there. Like I said, under rated games are...Under rated.-Basically almost always any gamemode besides TDM is dead...-Comics cost money on top of what you're paying for the game. It's only a buck but, come on!-The devs have sorta abandoned this game, we haven't had an update for a while other than the Last Stand DLC, WHICH ALSO COSTS MONEY.-Can be sorta overpriced when not on sale considering the ammount of people playing, so maybe get it only when it's 40% off or more. I got mine when it was 80% off for around a 2 dollars so make sure to do what I did!So, in conclusion I think I have fun on this game much more than having a bad time on it. Like I've said before it is an extremely under rated game IMHO and I hope this review will help you in the decision of if you're going to buy it or not.Have fun,-Monkey King ",42,0,0,5,4,0,0

												Every once in a while I play a dumb game that gets a special place in my heart. Dino D-Day was one of those games. Imagine a world where, instead of Zombies, the FPS genre took a hold of dinosaurs instead. It's wonderful.A couple of the lobbies we joined seemed to have bugged out spitting dinos, that made quick work of the allies. The teams and classes themselves aren't particularly well balanced from what I saw, I think the Allies won 1 of the 5 games we played.I was sold this game in the promise of T Rex's but I couldn't find if and how I could play one, which was a little disappointing, but the Dino Tank made me forget about it pretty quickly.

												At first, it was an awesome game. You could be dinosaur or human! But one day, it appeared to me that I hadn't purchased the game. Since then, I haven't been able to play the game. But still, I recomed this game for all the other users because i was very cool.			",30,6,0,1,3,0,2

												While quite a lot of fun indeed, Dino D-Day suffers from quite a few flaws, in my opinion.While the class based system is quite fun to use, a lot of the characters are just... too hyperspecialised. The medic can barely defend herself, the rocket user needs to be bang on target otherwise he's dead, and the dinosaurs feel hard to use under lag. The multiplayer scene is quite dead as well. I only found a few servers online, and even then, they were all North American servers, so I was unable to play without severe lag, which impacted upon my fun.			",87,8,4,12,11,2,10

												This is my first review on this account, so bare with me.For what it's worth this game is pretty good.The plot is that the axis have re-created dinosaurs to use in battle against the allies, and it's a preety fun game.Pros+Decent graphics+Don't need a good PC to run it+Quite fun if playing with friends+Dinosaurs+Did I mention dinosaurs?+Good community supportCons-Gets boring after a few hours of playtime-Online only-Some classes are a bit unbalanced-Connection can be terrible at timesI reccomend this game to anyone who likes online shooters, dinosaurs or WW2 style games.Also when I bought this game, it was on sale for 69p so it was great value for money!I rate this game a 6.8 out of 10			",51,3,0,3,1,0,0

												I know maybe you think I haven't played Dino D-Day long enough to make a review but as a Battlefield 4 veteran (700h+) I just can say that Dino D-Day is one of the funniest game I`ve ever played and worth its money. It has not the best graphics but who needs this really when you can be a dinosaur?Pros: -the game is really good balanced between AXIS and ALLIES-it is kind of a new and funny way for a WW2 game-you can play different dinosaurs and T-Rex.. YES f*cking T-REX!!-the first game where the AXIS is also fun to play because the other side is not overpowered-barely bugs and glitches and you get not stuck-did I mention T-REX? God damn T-REX?Cons:-sometime the bullets came through the wall, but you get no damage it's just irritating-if you have a presentation about WW2 and you say the Nazis had dinos you will get a F-the game is just in english (it's not really a bad thing because you should at least be able to speak english nowadaysIf you are not sure jet I made a short gameplay video:

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #47 - Dino D-DayThis is such a strange concept.  I can't even imagine where the developers came up with this idea of mixing Axis vs. Allies with dinosaurs.  What's even more strange is that this fusion somehow works.Playing the humans is much like you'd expect from a class based shooter, which choices like playing a medic, a sniper, or an assault type class.  The dinosaurs change things up by replacing weapons (for the most part, a few dinos still have mounted guns) with abilities like melee attacks or spitting poison.One thing I noticed though the distribution isn't exactly even.  The story (such as it is) has the Axis team responsible for bringing back the dinosaurs, so that side has virtually all of the dinos to choose from, while the Allies have only one dino (liberated from the other side).The game offers a variety of game types, which I noticed would change based on the map I selected.  The game comes with a decent number of maps to start with, and I also saw an option for loading custom maps.  Every map seemed to have the option for deathmatch, and capture the flag was another common option.  Deathmatch plays just like I expect it would.  Capture the flag looked pretty simplistic, there were only 3 flags to capture on the level I played.  I saw where a few maps had an objective based game type, but I didn't have time to check this out in my first hour of play.  Same goes for a deathmatch variant with T-Rexes.This is definitely one of those games that is really hard to evaluate on just an hour of play, but I had a lot of fun trying out everything.It is possible to play singleplayer with bots if thats your thing.  The bots have a difficulty level that you can select.  But obviously the real intent of this game is to play multiplayer.   There isn't any real matchmaking going on here, you just have a basic server select, and from there you can pick a side.  There didn't seem to be a huge number of people playing, but I also had no trouble finding an active server to hop into.Presentation wise the graphics are fine, but you aren't going to be blown away by anything.  It does have the typical options you'd expect like changing resolution, playing in a window (bordered or borderless) or fullscreen, and various other options as well.I can't give this game anywhere near a complete review with only an hour in, but I had a lot of fun in my first hour.  And for only $9.99, it looks like a good value for the variety of maps and game types you get.  I don't know that this would be a game to keep my attention for a long time, but it definitely makes for a nice alternative to the AAA shooters that are out there.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												The greatest one- WAS. IT WAS it! So, I wrote a critiqe when I played only some hours with that game- since that, there was a „jurrasic sized update”, so this is the time for  some new opinions.It was my favorite game, and then, the update came.Positive things:- develops are nice and great guys, sometimes plays together with players- new graphic is niice.Negatives:- After update, I cannot hit. Really, can not take a single shot- MISSED everything and couldnt use stairs :D Felt like lagging, but there was no lag.  So, for this game  I just bought a  new gaming mouse ( it was 50 Euro..). My accuracy get better, but nota s good as the „old game”- I bought the DLC. Definietly played ONE single TIME, since that, the game says: I havent got the DLC, plz buy it, if i wanna play. Feels like my money stolen. (yes, I uninstalled-installed the game, no, not solved..) - Some class specific abilities did not work. Medics,- ok, develops said, the work on it.  And Hissmans ptero? Call the ptero one time, and CAN NOT call again- it seems like „loading” after explode, but not load again. Never. - Ok, develops designed class-skins. Some have armour, compy have no. OK. Compy is an „in-building-assasin-class”  vulnerable and has no armour- BUT the assassin get the FUNKIEST colors? Really? - There are some class overpowered. For ex. Hardgrave. In old game there was a quit hardplay class, and now? - There are some new cheaters. They said, its just game „glitching” or  game-crash. Yeah, always the same guys :D always :D - Old players just extinct because of  update  - there was a little, but friendly community. We knew each other, we knew the others weaknesses- so, the games in this little community was about strategy. Not there are no „oldies” just russian 10 year old boys. This is the worst- we were in-game friends, and now..? /Sorry for very baad english :D/			",52,7,0,6,1,0,1

												Funny, wacky concept for a game, but I got bored of it really quickly. Then again, you can't really expect much from a game this cheap. Tried it for a couple of minutes and found that the game is completely unbalanced in favour of the Axis.Also, it was nearly unplayable for me because the camera kept getting stuck for no reason.If you want a proper, balanced Source engine multiplayer game, stick to CS or TF2 instead.That said, I'll still give it a thumbs-up for the weird and crazy nazi dinosaurs concept.

												I wish there was an in between for yes and no reviews. I guess I'll simply say I recommend it ""conditionally"" and I'll explain what I mean.Buy this if...You want a fun and quirky game with dinosaurs:I have always loved dinosaurs since I was a kid... and as a teenager/young adult I also developed an interest in WWII history. This game meshes the two together and I find it quite interesting and funny. The game itself has some humor to it and some pretty crazy unrealistic stuff but it makes for some great gameplay. Playing as T-rex can be fun if you know what you are doing and don't just stand there in the open while everyone pelts you with grenades and rockets. Conversely, taking on a T-rex is also quite fun if you use the right strategy (the Hardgrave berserk strategy tends to be the fastest and most effective.) You are okay playing with bots sometimes:There aren't always many players online so some servers have bots. Depending on the class they are, the bots can be somewhat tricky to downright stupid. It can be pretty fun facing off against bots for practice, but after a while it can become too easy. If this is your first time playing, I recommend playing with bots to get a handle on the controls and character abilities, but don't expect actual players to act as bots do.It's on sale or free:I got this game completely free. I think $10 is an okay price for a game like this, but I've seen it often on sale for $0.99 so I recommend waiting for a sale. It might not be worth buying right away for most people.Don't buy this if...You want to play with lots of different people all the time:The amount of servers with people on them and the amount of people playing total tends to fluctuate (highest on weekends) but generally there is only a few servers and maybe only 1 or 2 that are actually full. Because of the small player base, chances are you will run into some of the same people a lot. I often see a few players who are either extremely good at this game or are hacking and this definitely changes up the game for people who are not on their team. If you play for a while you'll notice these same people always playing.You want a completely balanced and easy to learn game:Now... I'm not saying that the game is completely UNbalanced, nor am I saying that it is DIFFICULT to learn, but the classes can definitely take some getting used to and you might play a while without realizing the full potential of some of the characters or maps. As for balance, it is definitely debatable. The combat is asymmetrical, even for deathmatch. Each team has completely different classes except for maybe sniper and medic but even those classes have different guns and abilities. It can be argued that each team has a class to counter a class on another team. For example Nigel (bazooka/flamethrower) is a great anti-raptor character and Hardgrave (rifle and berserk mode) can easily bring down a T-Rex given the right circumstances. I find that the tide of the war greatly depends on the skills of the players. Sure, Axis dinosaurs seem OP at first, but the Allies can win easily if they know what they are doing and use the correct abilities. I find that the team that wins right off the bat tends to be the team that keeps winning regardless of alternating from Allies to Axis each round, and as I said there tends to be one or two players who carry the game. If they are on opposite teams, this will make for some tense gameplay. If they are on the same team, then you will steamroll the other team and it might be fun for a while until it gets repetitive or if you get tired of those carries taking all the kills.In conclusion...This game can be either really fun with money well-spent or a boring complete waste of time. It depends on what you are looking for. However, if you want to try something that will make you laugh and is fun to mess around in, I recommend picking this up if it reaches $0.99 on sale again.

												Funny, wacky concept for a game, but I got bored of it really quickly. Then again, you can't really expect much from a game this cheap. Tried it for a couple of minutes and found that the game is completely unbalanced in favour of the Axis.Also, it was nearly unplayable for me because the camera kept getting stuck for no reason.If you want a proper, balanced Source engine multiplayer game, stick to CS or TF2 instead.That said, I'll still give it a thumbs-up for the weird and crazy nazi dinosaurs concept.

												Honestly, at first the look of it drew me away, it looked clunky, ugly and bland. Then I said ""What the hell I ain't got nothing else to play *Not true BTW* let's play this"". Boy was I wrong, never judge a book by it's cover, it blew me how COOL it was running around as a little Dino with a grenade attached to me, having a Dino which can knock you over pick you up with his mouth and throw you like the ♥♥♥♥♥ you are. The game has issues, the most obvious the lack of people I find a steady amount of people usually you'l see a server list of around 8-10 games being played by players around 4-12, so that's good. There are a lot of empty servers which can be used to play with you'r friends easily. The most irritating problem I had with the game was the game would crash on 1024x768 after a minute of gameplay, and the cursor is known to pop up while shooting from time to time. Should you buy it? When a sale hits and want to play with you're friends or just want to play with randoms get it.			",130,14,6,16,15,2,12

												Do you like World War II? OF COURSE, IT'S AWESOME!Do you like Dinosaurs?OF COURSE, THEY'RE AWESOME!Do you like Nazis?If you answered yes, you need serious psychological help.Anyhow, your political views are none of my concern.If you answered yes to the first 2 questions, then you will enjoy this game.After all, what could possibly be better than shooting a bunch of one-testicled Dinosaurian reptiles who have been trained to gun down the enemy and/or throw goats of death at them by Adolf and Fegelein themselves? I'll tell you what could be better. Shooting a bunch of one-testicled Dinosaurian reptiles who have been trained to gun down the enemy and/or throw goats of death at them by Adolf and Fegelein themselves AND can♥♥♥♥♥♥on you. This is a wonderful game where the objective is to kill these cryptorchidic reptiles before they can rip your face off and♥♥♥♥♥♥down your throat, or throw goats at you until you are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that you desert the war. Or, on the other hand, if you have ♥♥♥♥ed up- I mean... highly right wing political views, you will have to throw goats at and♥♥♥♥♥♥on the enemy, but here's the catch, the brits have captured and trained their very own dino as well, and he is out there to kill you along with the stereotypically british/american/french allied troops. Although to be honest, it's not a catch, he in fact has no testicles, as opposed to the mighty cryptorchidic dinosaurian reptiles of the axis. Also, one of the Americans thought it would be fun to circumsize him while he slept. Eugh. Anyway, you must guide your one-balled reptiles into war and have them defeat the nasty hoomans, because, you know, hitler. Make sure you throw enough goats to bring their spirits down, after all, NO ONE wants to see a flying goat covered in blood with bite marks in it screaming as it whacks them in the chest. And don't even get me started on those microraptor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, after all, being Micro isn't always good.9/10 would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on by a one balled micro-penised raptor with a goat in it's mouth again			",121,6,0,5,9,1,6

												This game is absurd, and fun to play... usually. Pitting the Allies vs the Axis in an alternate history where Germany clones dinosaurs to fuel their war effort, the Axis forces have a near monopoly on the Dinos. This doesn't mean that the Allies are any less fun to play though. Trigger, the Allies sole dino is one of the better ones, with a charge ability, and a solid machine gun to use. Playing at the Allies is more a straightforward FPS, with relatively standard classes. There is an assault, a sniper, a medic, all the regulars, and they do quite well against the dinosaurs, to the point that with a competitive team, the Axis forces have a bit of a harder time of things. Shotguns end dinos, sniper rifles end dinos from a distance. The Allies have a clear advantage on range in general. With a female french resistance medic, and a female sniper, I am also happy to see that I can play as a woman for once in an FPS. One that isn't merely relegated to a healer or noncombat class. This is pretty rare, and most people won't care, but I think it is pretty cool. Also of note is that several classes have area of effect buffs, such as accuracy or healing, allowing small squads to become even more deadly. Where the Allies have an advantage in range and teamwork, the Axis have a huge advantage in variety. Want to be fast and do melee? Try the Velociraptor, which can pounce, and generally kill people (if they are not killed during the feast animation) or the Microraptor, who can glide about the battlefield and spit poison. Want to bring in the big guns? Play as a Stygimolochs with a heavy machinegun or as a Spinosaurus, who is a miniature, low slung tank. On some maps you can even play as the legendary T-Rex.Both teams are very asymmetrical, but when dealing with new players, it seems the Allies will always get the win. Learning how to move as a dino is difficult, and many of the more powerful ones are large to the point that missing them is harder than not. My favorite thing is that the Allies are not seen as a writeoff. With some games (Pirates Vikings and Knights II comes to mind) there is a clear preference for the ""cool"" team, which the Axis easily could have been. Gladly this is not the case, and both teams have excellent up and downsides, encouraging you to play on both sides.			",74,16,2,10,4,0,13

												I wish there was an in between for yes and no reviews. I guess I'll simply say I recommend it ""conditionally"" and I'll explain what I mean.Buy this if...You want a fun and quirky game with dinosaurs:I have always loved dinosaurs since I was a kid... and as a teenager/young adult I also developed an interest in WWII history. This game meshes the two together and I find it quite interesting and funny. The game itself has some humor to it and some pretty crazy unrealistic stuff but it makes for some great gameplay. Playing as T-rex can be fun if you know what you are doing and don't just stand there in the open while everyone pelts you with grenades and rockets. Conversely, taking on a T-rex is also quite fun if you use the right strategy (the Hardgrave berserk strategy tends to be the fastest and most effective.) You are okay playing with bots sometimes:There aren't always many players online so some servers have bots. Depending on the class they are, the bots can be somewhat tricky to downright stupid. It can be pretty fun facing off against bots for practice, but after a while it can become too easy. If this is your first time playing, I recommend playing with bots to get a handle on the controls and character abilities, but don't expect actual players to act as bots do.It's on sale or free:I got this game completely free. I think $10 is an okay price for a game like this, but I've seen it often on sale for $0.99 so I recommend waiting for a sale. It might not be worth buying right away for most people.Don't buy this if...You want to play with lots of different people all the time:The amount of servers with people on them and the amount of people playing total tends to fluctuate (highest on weekends) but generally there is only a few servers and maybe only 1 or 2 that are actually full. Because of the small player base, chances are you will run into some of the same people a lot. I often see a few players who are either extremely good at this game or are hacking and this definitely changes up the game for people who are not on their team. If you play for a while you'll notice these same people always playing.You want a completely balanced and easy to learn game:Now... I'm not saying that the game is completely UNbalanced, nor am I saying that it is DIFFICULT to learn, but the classes can definitely take some getting used to and you might play a while without realizing the full potential of some of the characters or maps. As for balance, it is definitely debatable. The combat is asymmetrical, even for deathmatch. Each team has completely different classes except for maybe sniper and medic but even those classes have different guns and abilities. It can be argued that each team has a class to counter a class on another team. For example Nigel (bazooka/flamethrower) is a great anti-raptor character and Hardgrave (rifle and berserk mode) can easily bring down a T-Rex given the right circumstances. I find that the tide of the war greatly depends on the skills of the players. Sure, Axis dinosaurs seem OP at first, but the Allies can win easily if they know what they are doing and use the correct abilities. I find that the team that wins right off the bat tends to be the team that keeps winning regardless of alternating from Allies to Axis each round, and as I said there tends to be one or two players who carry the game. If they are on opposite teams, this will make for some tense gameplay. If they are on the same team, then you will steamroll the other team and it might be fun for a while until it gets repetitive or if you get tired of those carries taking all the kills.In conclusion...This game can be either really fun with money well-spent or a boring complete waste of time. It depends on what you are looking for. However, if you want to try something that will make you laugh and is fun to mess around in, I recommend picking this up if it reaches $0.99 on sale again.

												Its a fast paced shooter with dinosaurs what more could you want? Its a great game that has a ton of classes to choose from with many different ways of playing each role, You can be your standard boring sniper class or you could be the compy which a small dino with a bomb strapped to your back the gets more potent as you kill more enemies with your claws. This game is a bit silly at times but is solid in it's gameplay mechanics. 10/10			",24,1,0,9,0,0,4

												This is another standard run-of-the-mill team deathmatch game made very fun and interesting by the introduction of dinosaurs.  If you ever feel bored by the same combat system or want to mix it up, just respawn as a tiny flying dinosaur and annoy your enemy to death.  It's hilarious every time.  Would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a quick, uncomplicated multiplayer FPS with a fun twist.			",80,6,1,3,0,2,3

												Do you like World War II? OF COURSE, IT'S AWESOME!Do you like Dinosaurs?OF COURSE, THEY'RE AWESOME!Do you like Nazis?If you answered yes, you need serious psychological help.Anyhow, your political views are none of my concern.If you answered yes to the first 2 questions, then you will enjoy this game.After all, what could possibly be better than shooting a bunch of one-testicled Dinosaurian reptiles who have been trained to gun down the enemy and/or throw goats of death at them by Adolf and Fegelein themselves? I'll tell you what could be better. Shooting a bunch of one-testicled Dinosaurian reptiles who have been trained to gun down the enemy and/or throw goats of death at them by Adolf and Fegelein themselves AND can♥♥♥♥♥♥on you. This is a wonderful game where the objective is to kill these cryptorchidic reptiles before they can rip your face off and♥♥♥♥♥♥down your throat, or throw goats at you until you are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that you desert the war. Or, on the other hand, if you have ♥♥♥♥ed up- I mean... highly right wing political views, you will have to throw goats at and♥♥♥♥♥♥on the enemy, but here's the catch, the brits have captured and trained their very own dino as well, and he is out there to kill you along with the stereotypically british/american/french allied troops. Although to be honest, it's not a catch, he in fact has no testicles, as opposed to the mighty cryptorchidic dinosaurian reptiles of the axis. Also, one of the Americans thought it would be fun to circumsize him while he slept. Eugh. Anyway, you must guide your one-balled reptiles into war and have them defeat the nasty hoomans, because, you know, hitler. Make sure you throw enough goats to bring their spirits down, after all, NO ONE wants to see a flying goat covered in blood with bite marks in it screaming as it whacks them in the chest. And don't even get me started on those microraptor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, after all, being Micro isn't always good.9/10 would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on by a one balled micro-penised raptor with a goat in it's mouth again			",121,6,0,5,9,1,6

												This game is not only hilarious but also quite solid. Playing as the various types of dinosaurs is seriously fun and they are all different enough to give good variety to the gameplay. I was surprised at how solid the gameplay as the soldiers was as well. The gameplay reminds me of kind of like Day Of Defeat mixed with the Versus Mode from Left 4 Dead, except with dinosaurs instead of zombies.

												Like Day of Defeat crossed with dinosaurs.Quite a nice thing to see a new spin on the whole World War 2 genre that isn't zombies, while certainly quite a wacky idea the game takes little to no effort in being taken too seriously and nazi zombies is getting very datedIt's a source built game and it's so basic almost a new born baby can play it without trouble, if you've played any source game (Half-life, Day of Defeat Team Fortress 2 etc.) you'll have no trouble getting the hang of this game. Often on sale very cheap it's a quite fun game to pick up. Might not give you thousands of hours of fun but it could at the least give you a couple of hundred.			",295,96,7,18,34,3,27

Posted: June 9, 2016
												The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a ""second war of independence"" against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an ""Era of Good Feelings"" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

												This is actually a very well made game. It is based on performance, not graphics(which I prefer). You basically take part in online battles; choosing to be the Axis or the Allies. Most people will choose the Axis because they have the majority of the dinosaurs. The Allies are more soldier based, only having one dinosaur. Overall, besides a few glitches here and there, it is a great game. P.S. Goats are awesome.			",104,13,2,8,8,2,4

It's a fun game to play and decently balanced which is rare in games like this. You can play as the Allies which are mostly people and have one dinosaur and you can play as the Axis which have a mix of people and dinosaurs... lets face it we all really wanna be a Nazi in this game the dinosaurs are awesome.Worth $3 tops though in my opinion just dont like play much for games of this style since i play them sporadicall and they have little to know storyline.

You can play as the Allies which are mostly people and have one dinosaur and you can play as the Axis which have a mix of people and dinosaurs... lets face it we all really wanna be a Nazi in this game the dinosaurs are awesome.Worth $3 tops though in my opinion just dont like play much for games of this style since i play them sporadicall and they have little to know storyline.

												I tried playing this game with bots at first to try and get an idea of how to play as dinosaurs, it wasen't verry enjoyable. I then tried to join of the only active servers with people on it, as soon as I joined said server I was completely surrounded by 11-14 year olds erping as their favourite dinosaur on the opposite team. I tried to play the game like normal at first until I tried to kill one of the kids erping, he ran away but yelled on his mic saying ""Leave us alone we're role-playing"" I tried to inform the kids of how stupid they are, then I heard some guy that sounded like he was 22-24 years olds I think maybe, he told me to leave them alone and let them play the game, That's when I turned off the game and I never played it or reinstalled this♥♥♥♥♥♥smeared fest ever since. I wish this game was gone completely that's how utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥it is.			",122,6,2,4,10,2,4

												Dino D Day is a fantastic and honestly underrated game. The game started out as a Source mod that eventually got to star in its own show! The game is in an alternate universe where the Third Reich somehow brought back dinosaurs through science! The game pits German soldiers and dinosaurs vs allied soldiers and a single dinosaur. The gameplay is smooth, which is from what you would expect from a source engine game. It's easy to learn, somewhat easy to master, and an absolute blast to play. The game has a few hundred people playing it, so finding a populated server isn't difficult to find. It's only a pity that more people don't play it. When it goes on sale, do you and your friends a favor and buy like 10 copies at 99 cents a piece. The game is silly, fun and the playerbase is friendly!			",282,25,0,24,17,1,49

												A barebones multiplayer game that would have felt dated if it had been released 10 years ago.There are very few people playing this game, mostly people with 900 hours logged in it, or the devs themselves. So have fun as a noob getting repeatedly killed by the few hardcore fans who are still playing.Actual gameplay is your basic bunny-hop shooting simulator. Everybody jumps all the time. Somehow people will hit each other. Hit detection seems way off, and all guns are wildly inaccurate and have oddly short ranges. MGs overheat after 2 seconds of firing. Grenades appear in mid air in front of your character before sailing off in a seemingly random trajectory.Graphics are meh.Dinosaur classes are completely broken. Several of them don't have guns, so enjoy chasing enemies that are bunny-hopping backwards as they riddle you with bullets. Most people seem to just play the human soldiers, removing the shred of uniqueness this game possessed. Often they have convoluted tactics in order to be useful. The Compy, for instance is a suicide bomber with a pathetically weak normal attack and almost no health, but must kill enemies in order to make the blast more powerful. This is nigh impossible and about as much fun as it sounds.There are the expected modes, team deathmatch, king of the hill, etc. Unfortunately, with so few players, there is pretty much only one populated server up at any given time.In conclusion: The game isn't very good and its servers are all but dead, but at least I got to shoot a T-Rex in the butt with a flamethrower.

												This game is essentially Team Fortress 2 and ORION Dino Horde, mixed in with WW2. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who have played either games (WW2 not included, wasn't a game). It's fun to play for me, and i think it should be tried for about a month before casting it away.			",170,17,1,9,11,1,4

												I honestly did not expect this game to be so much fun. Think Team Fortress 2, but with goats and dinosaurs in a World War II setting. I currently have nothing to complain about with this game because right off the bat everything feels balanced and there are no major bugs. The only way this game could be ruined would be if they pulled a valve and started adding hats. I'd really hate to start getting killed by a veloci-raptor wearing 20 fedoras.			",121,13,9,4,6,0,12

												Though it's now 4 years old, I'd still recommend this over any vanilla shooter like any Counter Strike or CoD or whatever. T-Rex is fun, raptor is fun, cannon slowish-dino is fun, mg dino is fun, throw the rabbits watch the lulz human is fun, pretty much lots of fun and Source engine reliability & features. Course, its mp only and I don't know the state of the servers anymore but I have a feeling people always play because whenever I go back there are people playing.

												I'll come right out and say it, if you look at this game and for some odd reason expect a game about nazi dinosaurs to be a super serious competitive game or the next call of duty, you're obviously going to be disappointed. However, if you're looking for something you can play for a few laughs, have some fun with your friends, or just relax a little bit, you'll be as satisfied with this game as I was. It gives you a good amount of classes, interesting places to fight in, an open skybox (which can let some parkour get you on top of buildings for some amusing tactics, goats, and even a dlc which goes on sale for as cheap as the game ($1). Personally I'd recommend getting this on sale, or finding a nice bundle where you can get it. So far I've given about 9 copies away to some of my good friends if that says anything about the enjoyment and amusing nature this gives off.			",657,188,15,66,35,7,57

												This game makes me want to vomit blood. I recieved the game a gift from one of my dearest friends, and though i was going to have a good time, little did i know of the bunddle of fun that truly awaited me. Where to begin: first of all the match rule make no sence what so ever, im pretty sure they drew from a hat to decide how the game modes would play out, second the little freakin' ankle biters were were just one giant suitcase full of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and i do not exagerate. After playing for not but one hour all of my hemeroids in my arese exploded creating an ooze of discusting puss and blood, and by the end of it all i am pretty sure i develeped pancreatic cancer. Not to mension the hemmorage in my skull to top it off. All in all...Great game 10/10 would buy.			",45,2,0,4,6,0,5

												Doesn't work too well with a controller, or I messed up setup somehow.It's a CS game.  It's at a CS pace.  It just has dinosaurs and stuff.There's no intro to the game, no practice space.  Just dive headfirst into ""how do I play this game?"" mode.fun, but I wont spend too much time on it.  Worth the cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought it on sale for 50 cents.  Would be worth the full price IMO.  Win or lose I don't seem to really care.  I just have a lot of fun playing it.  So far of all the games I've purchased during the summer sale this has been the msot fun.+Dinosaurs+Multiple Classes+Moderatley Balanced+Decent sized community+Easy to learn+Runs smooth on a moderate PC+Community is civilized.  Have yet to find any rude or negativer players- Lack of customization.  Some Of the classes allow for changing a single weapon, not much in the way of a personal loadoutOverall I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10, considering what it is.  A cheap, fun, mindless, good way to waste some time and enjoy doing it.  It's far from a perfect game, but its charming in its own imperfect ways.			",234,30,1,26,20,3,18

												This game is great. I got it on sale for $0.99 (it is on sale quite frequently) and I must say: this game is a steal at that price. It has a pretty funny sense of humour and it is fun to play as the various dinosaurs. I particularly like using the Compy :P I do think the Allies are a bit OP as they win a solid 75% of the time and some maps people will launch grenades from spawn or snipe your spawn from across the map and it does get annoying but otherwise it's pretty great. I recommend whole hearted.

												Reminds me of the days of Counter Strike: Source.What great fun it is to shoot a Nazi Dino, over and over and over, then play as one!Multi-player only done right, with just good gameplay, thats it, cheap, no bs, no microtrans whatever, just good gunplay.Play as Allies, with many classes, different guns, and secondaries (no loadouts) .Or Play as the Nazi, with human gunners (which I love, MP40 is god) and 5-6 different Dinos.Ranging from Raptors, to even T-Rex. They all seem so well balanced.I paid 99 cents for this game, but it is worth it. Countless hourrs of Multiplayer fun, voice chatting, and spraying Dinos with bullets, all day, I did it.One problem I have. Late night, when I got some beers and wanna play @ like 1am or so, the servers sometimes are dead. and bots suck.I rec this game 9/10. I hope people buy it, and tell your friends, this is one of the best multiplayer experiences I have ever had, Counter Strike: Source being my favorite.			",491,214,16,66,32,8,56

												This game was worth every cent - all 99 of them. It's a great game to join for a round or two when you have nothing better to do and the other games in your library don't call out to be used. That said, it's far too unpolished and even uncut to be worth full-price, but it is very charming and unique, and I am glad to own it. If you have a lot of money and just want to try something fun - get it. Otherwise wait for another sale and get it then.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great. I got it on sale for $0.99 (it is on sale quite frequently) and I must say: this game is a steal at that price. It has a pretty funny sense of humour and it is fun to play as the various dinosaurs. I particularly like using the Compy :P I do think the Allies are a bit OP as they win a solid 75% of the time and some maps people will launch grenades from spawn or snipe your spawn from across the map and it does get annoying but otherwise it's pretty great. I recommend whole hearted.

												Bought it on sale for 50 cents.  Would be worth the full price IMO.  Win or lose I don't seem to really care.  I just have a lot of fun playing it.  So far of all the games I've purchased during the summer sale this has been the msot fun.+Dinosaurs+Multiple Classes+Moderatley Balanced+Decent sized community+Easy to learn+Runs smooth on a moderate PC+Community is civilized.  Have yet to find any rude or negativer players- Lack of customization.  Some Of the classes allow for changing a single weapon, not much in the way of a personal loadoutOverall I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10, considering what it is.  A cheap, fun, mindless, good way to waste some time and enjoy doing it.  It's far from a perfect game, but its charming in its own imperfect ways.			",234,30,1,26,20,3,18

												I tried to play the game, but it put me in an empty lobby with no goal or objective which was both stupid and lame. It wasn't even a tutorial, it was just a ""wander around and figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out""- empty map. Then, when I tried a second time to play it, it crashed my entire computer! What a waste- even if it was on sale. Even Orion Prelude was better than this garbage. Its normally 10 bucks and I can't even get it to work/ play properly. Maybe its just me, but this isn't worth it imo. Does't even work properly.Controller support is a joke. Took me several minutes to just get the left movement stick and the right trigger to work. The button configuration choice was also hidden so I couldn't see what the heck I was even doing/ choosing. I still only got three buttons to work. Jump, basic attack on dino, and move/ look. Movement and look should be on different keys/ buttons, I mean seriously. Annoying much? Gameplay? Crashed my entire computer at character select and wouldn't properly load me into a game/ lobby. I tried to load up task-manager, but that didn't work so I had to restart. I don't believe I've been able to get any actual play time, but then again I lost interest/ care after having to RESTART my computer. It looked like it should have been a fairly decent and playable game, but nope. Can't say I trust the game much after having to restart my computer to deal with a game related crash. I couldn't see my mouse or do anything.At the moment I also have a bunch of animals annoying me...*sigh*			",211,63,4,36,19,0,14

												Dino D-Day is a must have game. It is tf2's gameplay with DoD's details. Such as aiming and the fact that it's WW2. Dino D-Day brings countless hours of fun. The game uses classes such as a sniper, frontier man etc. You can play as Humans and dinosaurs which are equally balanced. Im pretty sure that everyone just wants to be a big♥♥♥♥♥dino that can throw goats at people. But it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. Please help the devolpers by buying this AMAZING GAME!

												This game is great. I got it on sale for $0.99 (it is on sale quite frequently) and I must say: this game is a steal at that price. It has a pretty funny sense of humour and it is fun to play as the various dinosaurs. I particularly like using the Compy :P I do think the Allies are a bit OP as they win a solid 75% of the time and some maps people will launch grenades from spawn or snipe your spawn from across the map and it does get annoying but otherwise it's pretty great. I recommend whole hearted.

												A very great game.This game is one of the few who can run at normal graphics which is so good since I have to render my games a ton of years.Let's get to the point.-Pros:-TF2-styled game with dinosaurs. A TF2-like game is always welcomed in my library and I don't like, but LOVE dinosaurs so 10 points.-You can play as a suicidal bomber. My newest job in TF2 is to scream ALLAHU AKBAR and laugh as they kick me. This will make it funnier to blow myself up. 20-Runs greatly with normal graphics. I have stated this above. 30 points.-Huge diversity of characters. TF2 has 9 classes. In this game it's 8 for each team (Allies and Axis). 16 total classes. 40 points!-Cons:-Game can be hard for newbies like me. -10 points.-None other than above. No points.Overall: 9/10. I'm still exploring the game, so more will be added soon. Also you can grab goats and kill people with them by throwing them wich reminds me of Goat Simulator and thus, a huge boost.

												This game is a hidden masterpiece. Sadly, it was kinda buggy when you could find lots of full servers all the time.Now, the devs have been updating the game, but it seems like few play this game nowadays, I can only find 1-3 servers with people, 5 if I'm lucky. I just wish more people would play this game.Other than that, it's a fast-paced team based first person shooter with nazis and dinosaurs, with simple controls and basics, I would definitely recommend it.

""What happened?""The old guy sighs and tells him, ""My ship was torpedoed by the Germans in WWII. A mermaid rescued me and promised to grant me three wishes. For my first wish, I asked to return to the States. My second wish was to have all the money I would ever need. Finally, my third wish was to have sex with the mermaid.""""That doesn't sound too bad,"" says the bartender.

												This game is a brilliant idea and the gameplay is special and very fun. It a Source engine game so any computer can run it. I always had a lot of fun playing as Microraptor and other Dinosaurs. The dlc is more like MvM in Team Fortress 2, so i personaly didn't buy it. The only problem about this game is that nobody is playing it, every time i start searching for servers there are only 2 of them with players. This game definitly deservs more antention and fame.Even if you don't want to play it, it's the card giving game and it's very cheap (especialy when is on sale it can even be just 1 euro) so it's worth having in libary.Definitly check it out!Oh, and there is a Philosoraptor meme easer egg in this game. Try to find it ;)			",58,3,1,9,3,1,0

												I tried to play the game, but it put me in an empty lobby with no goal or objective which was both stupid and lame. It wasn't even a tutorial, it was just a ""wander around and figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out""- empty map. Then, when I tried a second time to play it, it crashed my entire computer! What a waste- even if it was on sale. Even Orion Prelude was better than this garbage. Its normally 10 bucks and I can't even get it to work/ play properly. Maybe its just me, but this isn't worth it imo. Does't even work properly.Controller support is a joke. Took me several minutes to just get the left movement stick and the right trigger to work. The button configuration choice was also hidden so I couldn't see what the heck I was even doing/ choosing. I still only got three buttons to work. Jump, basic attack on dino, and move/ look. Movement and look should be on different keys/ buttons, I mean seriously. Annoying much? Gameplay? Crashed my entire computer at character select and wouldn't properly load me into a game/ lobby. I tried to load up task-manager, but that didn't work so I had to restart. I don't believe I've been able to get any actual play time, but then again I lost interest/ care after having to RESTART my computer. It looked like it should have been a fairly decent and playable game, but nope. Can't say I trust the game much after having to restart my computer to deal with a game related crash. I couldn't see my mouse or do anything.At the moment I also have a bunch of animals annoying me...*sigh*			",211,63,4,36,19,0,14

												This game is a hidden masterpiece. Sadly, it was kinda buggy when you could find lots of full servers all the time.Now, the devs have been updating the game, but it seems like few play this game nowadays, I can only find 1-3 servers with people, 5 if I'm lucky. I just wish more people would play this game.Other than that, it's a fast-paced team based first person shooter with nazis and dinosaurs, with simple controls and basics, I would definitely recommend it.

												Dino D-Day is a must have game. It is tf2's gameplay with DoD's details. Such as aiming and the fact that it's WW2. Dino D-Day brings countless hours of fun. The game uses classes such as a sniper, frontier man etc. You can play as Humans and dinosaurs which are equally balanced. Im pretty sure that everyone just wants to be a big♥♥♥♥♥dino that can throw goats at people. But it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. Please help the devolpers by buying this AMAZING GAME!   Score rating not high enough 1000000/10			",57,16,1,2,1,2,3

												Are you someone who has always wanted to see guns and dinosaurs collide in a dumb WW2 scenario where Hitler invades Poland with T-Rexes?You should probably try this game out! It's pretty good fun, whilst the graphics could do with a little work...7/10, better than TF2 (in my opinion)			",27,10,0,13,8,0,11
