												Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone. It is a very hard game. A few hundred hours is the basic learning curve for essentially being a beginner. That being said even for people not planning on being competitive there's a lot of content just in the combo system. It's satisfying working towards just doing combos in themselves or eventually beating your first opponent online. That being said, this is where the true nature of this game comes out.USF4 Is a game of competition and self-discipline. This game will appeal to yourself if you always strive to improve. There will be an unlimited amount of times you will frustrated and convinced you hit a brick wall. This game is about gradual improvement, a constant cycle of finding new plateaus and satisfaction of overcoming them with practice, hard work and intellect. This is a personal game, you shoulder all the blame for losing in a competitive setting. If you are prone to rage-quitting then this game will quickly be deleted from your hard drive in anger.Pushing past this however, you see the evolution of play and how you express your personality and play style as well as who you are playing against. It's oddly intimate in that you can recognize someone solely based on their movements, actions and decisions. In every game it is you against another person, another individual wanting to get better and improve, wanting to learn from you as you learn from them. This is the addicting part of USF4 and Fighting games in general, your best friends are always your enemies and you push each other constantly. Nobody will ever truly be satisfied in being ""good enough"", and that's all the reason you'll ever need.Economically speaking it's the best ratio of purchase price to play time I've ever had and will probably ever have. Something like less than 2 cents per hour? Highly recommended. 10/10 ",235,43,5,29,9,1,25

												Genre: 2.5D Traditional Fighting GameSummary:SFIV is a footsies-based fighting game that emphasizes slow methodical play and meter management between rounds. Game features the inclusion of 'focus attacks', a universal move that grants a character one hit of armour and the potential to crumple the opponent; the nature of focus attacks allow characters to aggressive advance through attacks without infringing upon the effectiveness of projectile characters. Pros:- 39 characters, an additional 5 in Ultra Street Fighter 4.- The majority of match-ups are balanced (future update to provide further balance). - Decent netcode if neither player has much traffic.- Large established player base online and offline.- Great for players trying to get into fighting games. Will teach fundamentals through play and the abundant tutorials on the internet.Cons:- Single-player modes are lacking; arcade mode has terrible A.I. and the challenges aren't fun.- The game itself does not provide instruction to newer players.- No theatre mode for the animated clips from Arcade Mode.Neutral Points:- There will be a learning curve; it is a fighting game afterall. If you are a new player then you will be terrible for a while.- Input leniency allows newer players to perform special moves more easily but can become an annoyance at higher level play.- There is a comeback factor for newer players (Ultra) which becomes a tool at higher level play.- The plot is barebones, but hey, that's a norm for fighting games.

Online has been patched. It was an issue on Steam's end, and now many problems have been fixed. Reviews before March 2015 lamenting online play might be outdated. Online isn’t perfect but it is definitely playable (and better than Netherrealm fighters at least).In my opinion this is one of the best fighting games on Steam. If you want a deep and competitive game or just want to jump into the genre, this is a great title to pick up, especially with EVO right around the corner. +Diverse roster of 44 playable characters+All classic SF2 world warriors (Guile, Sagat, Cammy, Akuma, etc.)+Good mix of SF Alpha and SFIII characters (No Alex or Q though)+Wide range of controller support+Very balanced. Every character is viable in the right hands.+Good soundtrack (Character themes aren't nearly as good as in SFIII: 3rd Strike though)+Useful training mode with attack data, input display, dummy recording, and even 2 player online training+Matches can get pretty hype+Runs well on PC (80 fps on an AMD 7770)+Solid netcode. Again, not perfect (unless you live in Japan) but most matches are smooth. +Lots of colors and costumes (everyone has at least 3-4 costumes and ~12 colors)+New unique Focus Attack system.+Extensive Trial mode gives a fun way to burn time if you want a challenge+Interesting Japanese ink brush art style with great 3D visuals (sort of prefer the old 2D sprites though). Fireballs look beautiful. +Online community is still active-V-Sync causes input lag-New Revenge Meter is built up by taking damage. At 50% you can do an Ultra combo. This feels like it rewards bad play and makes comebacks more common and less exciting. -Ubiquitous 1 frame link combos. These are much more punishable on a missed link due to the large reversal window, allowing players to mash out a dragon punch if you mistime your inputs-Typical cheap arcade fighting game A.I. with psychic reaction time. Final boss in arcade mode is cheap as hell-3 joke characters. Dan is funny, but Rufus was unnecessary, and El Fuerte should be removed entirely. -Character Select starts 1P at Juri and 2P at Hakan. Why not Ryu and Ken?-Did I mention El Fuerte? With USF4 what you get is a well polished, balanced, and deep fighter. What makes this game enjoyable to me is the high skill ceiling; every time I play I have the opportunity to improve my ability. Heck, even with the amount of hours I've put in I still kinda suck. Much of my playtime consists of playing in private lobbies with friends, which is always a blast. While Street Fighter may seem technically daunting, I definitely recommend it to those looking to get into the fighting game genre. A learning curve is definitely present, but the fundamentals you pick up from playing this will carry on to other fighters. This is also currently the most played fighting game in the tournament  scene, so those with a competitive drive should be satisfied. Whether you’re familiar with fighters or are a total newcomer, I recommend picking up Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC.			",136,17,0,10,6,2,6

												Title: Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition makes for a very intriguing title. It contains one of those fancy circle Rs which probably stand for something legal, so you don't have to worry about any legal issues when you fire it up. Title has you covered. This game is also rather super, as every single character without exception has a super move that can be activated when you have a full super meter. Each character also has Ultra combos, although the title will not reflect that until an upcoming change in 2014. Street Fighter IV is the defining Street Fighter of this generation, with over four street fighters to street fight as. Furthermore, this is the arcade edition. Arcades are known for many things, but I don't actually know what any of those are. I remember that I never wanted to play in them that much because I'd have to pay every time I wanted to try again, which would be extremely frequent. I'm terrible at this. Fortunately, you do not have to buy a respawn DLC, even though this is the Arcade Edition. Graphics: The game comes with graphics, many of which are even 3d. The camera does fancy spinning flying things when you do ultra combos, and while that may not be related to graphics, I feel that is a very huge selling point as there is no better way to emphasize just how hard you punched that little casual in his filthy jaw. There are also fancy effects you can put on the characters that make a subtle but noticeable difference I can't put my finger on because my monitor does not have a touch screen. At any rate, the answer to ""Does Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition have graphics?"" would be a resounding ""Yes!""Gameplay: As you might expect, Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition does indeed have gameplay. As games go, I would call it very good gameplay. Combos are hard as verdammt to pull off and I have yet to actually do one in a real match, although I most definitely can show that training dummy (His name is Dan :) who is the boss of 10 hit combos by nailing him in the face with one. Inputs are pretty typical for fighter games, with the stick being used to make complicated motions really fast and my xbox controller probably isn't the best for this. If you like your circles being quartered forwards, then Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition is for you. As mentioned previously, it does have more than four characters, and some would even go as far as to say maybe more than twenty. Some people would say more than forty, but I am not positive that they are very proficient at counting. Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition also comes with the internet! The internet is very well beloved by many people, and in Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition, the internet is as fast and fluid as ever. There is very little lag and I often feel like I am losing to a real person sitting right next to me! I once even tried to unplug their controller, but ended up getting my power cable instead because they weren't actually next to me. It just FELT like they were, because the entcode* is so good. Sound: The characters are voiced and say things like ""I will win"" or ""You will lose"". They also deliver classic lines like ""Do you want to take this outside... ON THE STREET?!"" punches and kicks also sound very much like punches and kicks, although they may arguably sound more like someone clubbing a baby seal. I am rather fond of the neat ""whump"" noise it makes when a hit connects.Characters can also be made to speak in Japanese instead, because dubs are ABSOLUTELY terrible in anything where they should be speaking in Japanese. Juri even laughs better in Japanese. Do her backwards grab and tell me I'm wrong. Title: 6/10 + 2 for legal coverage and impending updates to address present concerns (Is not marked as Ultra)Graphics: 8/10 + 1 for subtle touch screen effects (I would rank it a bit higher but Juri's neck looks weird. Tell me I'm wrong.)Gameplay: 8/9Sound: 5/10 + 6 for being able to listen in authentic Japanese with real and true-to-life subtitles.__________Overall: 9/9.75 I just averaged all the scores and the maximum points for each category and got this, I don't really know if it's accurate or not. *Haha, I meant to type netcode. ""Don't be so hasty to point out typos, you stupid hobbit!""- a real ent playing Super Street Fighter® IV Arcade Edition ",209,14,0,32,11,0,18

												Yeah, what can I say. Greatest game ever made if you put in the time to learn it at the higher levels. This is definitely the deepest game out there. Pro's have to consistently hit timings down to 16 ms, in addition to reading the opponent, adjusting to their character, and developing their own strategies to psyche them out. In reality this is psychological fighter IV, and if you like deep games, you can forget about any of the other ones out there. USF4 takes the cake.			",41,2,0,6,5,0,11

												Can't get past Ryu Trial #1 10/10No, for real though, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a superb fighting game, boasting some of themost iconic characters, music, and mechanics that's ever been put on PC, Console, or otherwise.Keep in mind that this isn't a overly fast-paced 10,000 combo fighter,know that Online Multiplayer has a few hiccups, but overall is actually quite good now,grasp that USFIV doesn't play like Third Strike or Street Fighter II in regards to timing andexecution (though some aspects definitely strike Street Fighter II more than any other SFtitle to date), don't expect too much from this title in regards to story,and you'll know what to expect if you've every even glanced at someone else playing a StreetFighter game.Like any other Fighting Game, it will take time and dedication to arrive at the same level as others you might come across online, but at the end of the day the rewards greatly outweigh the effort you'd put into the game.If you like Fighting Games at all, PICK THIS UP.Maybe when it's on Sale, though. I know the struggle.			",145,14,2,15,4,0,1

												As an avid Street Fighter 4 player, I consider this game to be one of the best fighting games currently available.  Not only the character roster great, comprised of 30+ old and new fighters from the series to date, but so is the sophisticated combo system that is both easy to pick up yet difficult to master.  I wasn’t particularly a fan of SF4’s visual style and initially reluctant to try the game because of it, yet I’ve grown to appreciate the unique look and feel of each characters and stages that the developers faithfully recreated in this title.Like many similar games in the genre, SSF4 was initially released on console systems and then ported over to PC.  Luckily, the developer Capcom has done an amazing job, implementing number of customization options for PC, such as support for greater than 30fps and multiple resolutions including 1080p.  In addition, the game also supports many controllers out of the box including XBOX 360 controller and numerous fightsticks.  Outside of Games for Windows Live, game runs smoothly and the loading time is relatively short, so there isn’t much for me to complain about this quality port.Although brief single player portion of the game is quite good, the multiplayer is where this game truly shines.  Thanks to its improved netcode, finding multiplayer matches are quick and reliable.  Built-in match setups work consistently for the most part and despite it missing my favorite “championship mode” from a previous title, both ranked and endless mode keep the game interesting and fun.  I really like the replay / save feature as well, which helped me to capture and savor those favorite character match ups over the years.Super Street Fighter 4 definitely isn’t perfect and the game isn’t groundbreaking enough to likely persuade those of you who aren’t interested in fighting games.  If you hold even a little preference over the genre though, this is good as any place to start.  I wholeheartedly recommend this to both casual onlookers and fighting game fans.

												Ultra Steet Fighter IV is an update for the original Street Fighter IV which was released in 2008. Believe it or not, but this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise.  This game is a standalone product too, allowing you to just purchase this definitive edition. This update brings the total number of playable characters up to forty four - each of the characters also has a different version of them selves, meaning you have in effect eighty eighty different characters to play as. Street Fighter IV has one of the best combo systems I have played with, much better than the combo system in Mortal Kombat X to say the least. You can easily view the combos for your character on the pause menu, meaning you can learn them on the fly, The graphics are really quite nice too, it shows a cartoony style art much like the previous games, but with a more polished and finished look to it. All of the special moves and combos each have their own animation, as well as special effects, making this a really good looking game to look at whilst spectating. Each of the characters in Ultra Street Fighter have their own story line, so with 44 different characters, that is a lot of story to include! I was quite surprised at this amount given the very linear style of fighting games I have played in the past. Obviously some of the stories are more in depth than others, but each of them give you a good amount of content to see. I only managed to play this game on Easy mode, and even then, on some of the latter stages to the arcade mode, I was struggling. I would hate to see how devastatingly hard the normal and hard modes are, because I was having to retry plenty of times before being able to beat some stages. That being said, this is the sort of game that you will just get better at with practice, you won't be pulling off massive combos to start with (unless you are highly experienced with this genre) so it will take some time before getting right up to speed. I have completed four characters arcade mode, meaning I have another forty left to go, this has taken me just over two hours to do, so there is a heck of a lot of content on show here, and that is just the single player. Ultra Street Fighter also has a local and online multiplayer too which will really wrack up your hours with ease. I had one technical issue whilst playing, I for the life of me could not get the game to run in 1920 x 1080 AND full-screen. Not sure whether this is intentional of a bug with my game. It runs fine in that resolution and windows mode though. That being said, you probably won't notice it too much given the amount of time you actually get to look at anything else whilst playing. I can easily recommend Ultra Street Fighter IV, even though this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise, it really does a good job of introducing you to this style of game and giving you hours and hours of content too. To buy this game from scratch, the £22,99 price tag is easily justified with the quality and quantity of gameplay on offer. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone . It is a very hard game. A hundred hours is the basic . Always people say you need to know combos No!What You Need To Know This Game+Basic Elements+Game Systems+Frames+Hitbox+Save/not save combos/moves For example Heavy/Ex Shuryuken is not save What i like in ultra street fighter 4 is W-Ultra is the big standout here, giving you access to both of your characters ultra combos instead of one or the other. Neither will do as much damage, but the utility it provides is almost irresistible for characters like Dudley for instance, whose Ultra 1against those whos like to throwing Hadouken's but his Ultra 2 when making combos at the corner almost at the end need make ex machine gun blow C.HK Ultra 2very useful to It's a great additional tactical consideration that adds dimension to many formerly stale matchup consideration.Red-Focus-Attack on the other hand, are a little more situational in application With multiple hits and more combos.The most changed is blanace like increased damage reducing and fixing .For instance Ken's Shinruyken non animated version is now increased and Cammy and Fei long was reduced damage But Rufus Messiah Kick And Chun li Ultra 1 now is fix it and others.Online/GameplaySteam version was with problems connection .Even when my opponent's connection quality is green, one out of every six even with even ,with green bars was bad but now after patches works good.Online is pretty funny endless mode you can meet strange people you playing too good you kick it you playing bad kick 0pp/bb deafet opponent with more then 1kpp/bb kick it even .I remember my first matches First Match-Lost Second-Rage quiter Third-Lost Forth-Rage Quiter and circle gose again i won after after twenty times by cause to many rage quiters sometimes even i quting matches:Dafter more hours in rankeds i win againts high rank player sometimes but even opponet wanna rematch when i lost match reamtch beggins i got the advantage almost at the win opponent The Player Has Left The Session almost everytime .I saw there almost at the win rage quit's almost everytime even i saw on steam community screnshots/youtube video's i saw how low pp/bb almost deafet opponent with high pp/bb The Player Has Left The Session :D.What really my friends/people thinks this game is so easy some of them say this is mash buttons this is not hard and not competitive this game not popular bla bla bla bla hater gonna hate talking bull♥♥♥♥♥♥:@ :@ :D :D.I have friend whos always say it this game so easy has no skill and i can take 50 win streak is not hard even more than 50 win streak this game is not so hard.My friend try this game on free weekend about Jul 16 and after first match his got rekt so hard and say this game not blanaced i get only strong players is not impassible to make combos talking nonsense about this game when it is crap but for me and others this game is not crap is so funny :D :D.About me i played Ultra Street Fighter 4 because this game is good and competitive is really hard game i can not explane how this game so hard my stats below.

												The best fighting game in the last few years, it offers an addictive and engrossing experience. To master each character you will need to spend some time tinkering with each moveset, but once that character clicks in your mind (and fingers :D) it is a blast.If you decide to go online after practising with your favourite chars, you will find a good range of fighters available in ranked and/or endless lobbies. My favourite way of playing online is to activate in single player the 'fighter request' option, so you can practice with any character against the cpu, honing your skills while you 'receive' requests to fight some real people.Last but not least, I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone interested in the game to buy a fighting stick, it is essential to master the game.

												Fantastic game, ashame steamworks had to ruin it for everyone. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really miss GFWL!Cons: Laggy beyond all beliefDuring said lag it says Waiting for other player, whoever reconnect first gets to attack first while the other player is waiting at his mercy to not land a free ultra/combo.Can no longer message people, instead forces you to use a mic to communicate with whoever your fighting.Mic must be either on or off, you can no longer toggle a button to make it active, extremely annoying.Announcer is annoying as hell and there is no way to turn him off.Did I mention the lag?If you bought a dlc pack from someone other than steam your SOL.Pros:Can change your name at will whereas with GFWL you had to spend money to do this.DLC from steam convert over.

												No longer properly functions online after GFWL removalThe game breaks into bouts of pasuing and stuttering stating it's retrying for a connection and sometiems even drops mid-game. This is a massive hazard when making inputs.Judging from people willingly going for a rematch agaisnt me even after it, it must be the norm and not just meI did not have this issue even once before steam integration and now it's in nearly every matchI for one would rather not play Super Stutter Fighter IVAdditionally everyone who joins my games is said to be local canadian players but their steam profiles have been in kanji or cyrillic and listed as being from entirely different parts of the world			",61,3,0,5,2,0,17

Going from GFWL to Steamworks has made this a laggy terrible game that disconnects CONSTANTLY.

												Optimization and Netcode performance 10/10would play again while downloadiing i am not a fighting player at all the only fighting i play and i am super good at is Mortal Kombat series. i got this game from bundle for a really really cheap price then i just wanted to test the netcode and went directly online, well honestly even with red bar connections and me downloading and playing at same time i had no lag at all, the best part is game is not even fps locked like MK. i could reach over 91 fps at a time and have extremely smooth matches online.instead of wasting your money on netherrealm garbage products just support this game and buy it and gift it to your friends and play together because online WORKS in this game. in MK series there is no online it is just an option which never works...^ this comment comes from a guy whose life was dedicated to Mortal Kombat and you wouldnt be finding a hardcore MK fan like me, but when the developer has ZERO respect to at least test their product before releasing it on PC after getting $90 for their garbage game (MK X) it can even turn a fanboy to hateboy. i probably start learning SF and play it more i just have to find me favourite character then it is a GO!

												So it's about a year until Street Fighter V comes out and people who haven't really took Street Fighter seriously are wondering if it's worth the purchase. The answer is yes.I've been a complete casual Street Fighter player for years. But gradually over the years I always saw the pros and wonder if I can compete at their same level. Quite honestly anything is possible.. Except in a fighting game you don't rely on what level you are, or what kind of stats and skills determine the outcome of your character. It all boils down to memorization, muscle memory, adaptation. Honestly, the entire point of Street Fighter is the interesting aspect of the mind games between 2 players. It has the ruggedness of not a multiplayer game but some odd form of chess/board game appeal. As I played dozens of hours of this game I seem to realize it really does have a chess-like learning curve to all of these characters. As long as you put forth the effort into learning patterns and the characters mechanics (strength/weakness) and overcome all the mistakes you've been making as a casual player, this is a very rewarding game. Anyways, All I'm saying is if you're looking for a worthwhile fighting game I suggest you pick this up strictly to learn the fundamentals until Street Fighter V comes out. Also, Online play is very habitable. Pick it up before V comes out I promise you.. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game.Since the transition from GFWL to Steam the online is broken, matches are very laggy, matchmaking is much slower with many timeouts, and it's generally a very frustrating game, and now today I can't even play online, I get ""session creation failed"" and can't search for games.Capcom has gone really downhill, and they keep promising to fix it but end up giving out band aid patches which fix nothing, if it's not sorted soon I will be looking to get a full refund and possibly taking legal action as all other pc gamers with this game should do, it's not acceptable.I urge you to write a similar review if you have had this bad experience with ultra to put people off buying it and giving more money towards this broken game and defunct company.Update: 6 months later the game still isn't fixed.

												From an outsider's perspective, the differences between Street Fighter 4 and its three existing sequels must look marginal at best. The first game made its console debut back in 2009 and helped revitalise the fighting game genre. Super Street Fighter 4 surfaced a year later and added 10 new characters to the roster, but since then, the game-to-game differences have been tailored more towards the dedicated fans. Ultra Street Fighter 4 continues this tradition with five new characters, a trio of fundamental system changes and not so much as a story mode in sight.If you're not the kind of player who spends hours learning combos in the training room, discusses the finer points of character match-ups on a regular basis and stays up till the crack of dawn watching the Top 8 duke it out at the yearly Evolution Championship Series, then the Street Fighter 4 series' consistent lack of single-player content will be a tough pill to swallow. But for those who view Street Fighter as a competitive fighting game that only truly makes sense when two minds are trying to outsmart each other, then Ultra can be seen as both curtain call from Capcom and the most substantial sequel since Super.Of the new talent, Poison stands out as the easiest to get to grips with. Her lingering fireball and feet-first dragon punch mean she shares some shoto fundamentals with Ryu and Ken, but when you also consider her Rekka-like whip special and her command grab Ultra, it's clear that Poison isn't as orthodox as she initially seems. The larger than life Hugo, on the other hand, is about as heavy-handed as a grappler gets. His normal attacks have extremely limited combo potential, but if you can close the distance and land his wall-bouncing command grab, you can inflict severe damage.New girl Decapre can combo into her air throw from her launcher. She can also use the new EX Red Focus to land an Ultra off her Rapid Dagger special.If the fighting styles of a pink-haired cross-dresser and a gigantic wrestling simpleton don't sound like your thing, then the other new characters offer something a bit more technical. Elena returns from the Street Fighter 3 series with two far-reaching overhead attacks (must be blocked standing) and one frighteningly quick overhead special that can combo into respectable damage. In comparison, Rolento is more of a hit-and-run-style character with excellent mobility and lots of long-range pokes. He can quickly get out of trouble with his EX roll and his Pariot Sweeper Ultra will combo off anything stronger than a sneeze.The last character on the guest list stands out for two reasons. Firstly, she wasn't previously playable in Street Fighter X Tekken or any other fighting game; secondly, she's the first new charge character to grace Street Fighter in what seems like forever. Indeed, Decapre may look like just another Shadaloo Doll with similar moves to Cammy, but once you actually take her bladed gauntlets out for a spin, you'll realise that she's fundamentally different. Her variable dash can be cancelled into her slide, dive kick, launcher or even one of two baits, and while most characters tend to have one standout Ultra, Decapre benefits from two.Choosing which Ultra to incorporate into your game plan has been a core feature of Street Fighter 4 since Super, and now with the advent of the Ultra Combo Double system, you have the option to take both at the cost of raw damage output. Other additions to the core mechanics include the Delay Stand and Red Focus. The former prolongs the time it takes for your character to rise after a hard knockdown and is useful for escaping vortex pressure from the likes of Akuma, Cammy and Ibuki, while the latter lets you absorb any amount of hits in addition to giving just about every character a viable way to combo into their Ultra.Six new stages have made the journey from Street Fighter X Tekken. That should decrease the odds of getting Volcanic Rim on random.The fact that there's no way to elegantly highlight the impact of these changes without dipping into fighting game terminology just reinforces who Ultra is aimed at. The same is true of the extensive list of frame data tweaks that have been applied to the existing cast of 39. Evil Ryu has more health, Yun's EX lunge punch is (once again) advantageous on block and dragon punches are no longer safe after focus cancelling forwards. This might not mean a lot to casual players, but if you've invested the time with any one of these characters, then the chance to fight with a heavily revised set of rules is an offer that's hard to refuse.There's no way of knowing where Ultra will take the competitive scene or how much the changes will affect the overall balancing, but if you feel like going back to the series' roots to see how much damage Vanilla Sagat could achieve off a simple Tiger Uppercut FADC into Ultra (it's over 600), then the new Edition Select has you covered. This isn't the first time that Capcom has put all past versions of each character into one game, but its inclusion suggests that this will be the last chapter in the Street Fighter 4 saga. Plus, there's nothing like picking the definitive version of your character when you're trying to prove a point.Despite boasting a thriving community that streams regular tournaments and keeps the online competition flowing day and night, the Street Fighter 4 series has always been somewhat lacking when it comes to useful features. Ultra helps to remedy this with the option to record your matches while playing offline and change your button configuration while on the character select screen. Better yet, the Training mode has been expanded with a network simulation tool that lets you mimic input latency and a save state feature that makes practising your setups less time-consuming.Poison's Ultras basically boil down to a kick in the crotch or a whip-assisted assault on the buttocks. Tough choice…The only feature I couldn't find was a way to reduce Elena's health so I could test out her Healing Ultra, but that's a minor grievance. On the flipside, the new Online Training mode lets you practise against another player without health bar limitations. There's also a revised Team Battle mode that pits two teams of three against each other with a shared health bar that carries over between matches. It feels a bit gimmicky when weighed against the other new features, but at least Capcom has added something that isn't focused purely on the one-on-one experience.Taken as a package, Ultra is an easy recommendation for players who view Street Fighter as a sport. It offers highly refined gameplay married with a rich art style, and by acknowledging fan feedback in an effort to make a well-rounded game even more polished, Ultra feels like the work of a developer that's content to please its core audience rather than trying to grab everyone else's attention. That's rare, especially from a studio that was responsible for Resident Evil 6.The only thing that holds this sequel back is the sense that it was made on a fairly tight budget. It's the little things, like the meagre choice of ""new"" characters and the way that some of the new Ultra animations lack the dramatic flair of their predecessors. But with the development team's passion taking up most of the slack, £11.99 for the digital upgrade feels like a fair price. It's not the Street Fighter 5 that we've all been hankering for, but as the fifth (and reportedly final) version of Street Fighter 4, Ultra is an ultimate end in more ways than one.9 / 10  ",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

I recommend it to pretty much anyone. If you're new to the fighting game genre, don't be afraid. AE is probably the best modern fighter to start with if you want to learn how to fighting. AE is not terribly complex, and there are plenty of resources out there to help you learn how to play. Buy this game when it's cheap so that you can get ready for USFIV.Or you could just wait for USFIV. It's probably cheaper if you buy this discounted and buy the USFIV upgrade though.

												I can't stop playing. This game is truly a positive arcade experience on my PC. Everything plays right. Although I had to adjust the detail level for my laptop in order to get a nice framerate I am pleased by Capcom's plethora of graphical option adjustments to tailor to my PC. Too many characters to choose from. I noticed the Easiest setting is truly easy now compared to Street Fighter IV which I own on disk. Cloud syncing at the moment is really slow , but it's nice to know the developer had its fan base in mind and ported this game over to Steam Works so we would not lose our investments. If any game company needs a good example to learn from... Capcom is the one to learn from. Not too hung up about the DLC's either. You can really enjoy the game without them unless you want extra costumes and other knick knackks.			",276,99,12,30,29,4,26

												I grew up munching on a SNES controller plugged into SFII Turbo. And since then I've been hooked on fighting games; there's something about the 1 on 1, heavily skill and intuition based gameplay that always manages to drag me back in.Fighting games are hard. You will lose a lot if you haven't played them before, but that moment when you finally manage to nail a difficult combo, or make a read on an opponent so hard that he salty ragequits, it'll be worth it.USF4 is a solid continuation of the SF4 experience, adding some great characters from 3rd Strike into the SF4 engine.

												9.5/10USF4 is the latest version of SF4.Yeah, capcom ♥♥♥♥ed you with 4 or 5 version of the same game, maybe you wasted a lot of money, we can say 20-50 usd per version with little upgrades or more characters.But do u know what? if i would support a fighting game throwing my money, that one is STREET FIGHTER.Have you seen the Tournaments of Street fighter?, they are amazing!, super hyped because already exist a global competition, Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapur, USA, Canada, Brasil, UK, France, Italy, Spain already has professional players that fly around the world to play in the tournaments.This game is a really simple fighting game, there is not to many variation of what you can do or make, But that's why this is so popular!, you just not need a good execution to do combos or do the same thing over and over. you need change, need techniques, you need reactions. A simple game always goes more than his simple mechanics, that is the moment when you realize it, this is not a simple fighting game, this is not easy, this is so hard if you want to play the game in a high level skill. Because a high level skill is not about to do the largest combo, is about to know what your enemy is going to do. So basicaly if the game is simple, easy to do combos and the options that you can do or make, that actually mean that everyone could do what the mechanics let you to do because they are really simple. Then the important is not about to be good with your controller pad or arcade stick, the important is about to read your opponent: in what he is good, in what he is not, what he is blocking, what he does not block, what are the advantage of your character against the opponent's character, what are his common reactions, what are his common reversals or counter hits, when he is going to do a special move, when he is not going to a special move (DP). Do you understand? skills is the basic that everyone can do, this game is a mental game like every martial arts, just a electronic one because we are fat people that does not do anything else than going to work, make money and buy food to eat and living a pasive life sitting in our chair.btw, that's does not apply at all in online because you can't see your opponent, maybe you can predict some moves or understand some of his patterns. but the mental game is limited. actually online is about skills + your adaptation to the lag, offline is about the mental game.right now (03 of july 2015) does have a decent netcode. EDIT: added the last setences about the netcode.			",442,97,12,21,13,0,36

												Let's get started...Fight!Street Fighter IV returns with yet another version in Ultra Street Fighter IV, after the big successes of Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition and Super Street Fighter IV updates. New characters and stages have been added in what is the definitive version of Street Fighter IV.Story: The story unfolds as you play through each character's Arcade Mode. We get to see the motivations as to why each character has decided to enter the Street Fighter tournament. Some are pretty interesting like Chun-Li's, where she teams up with Guile and Cammy to defeat S.I.N. and discover what happened to M.Bison. Others can be pretty silly. Dan's story revolves around entering the World Warrior tournament to spread the popularity of his fighting style, Saikyo. It is pretty humourous and ridiculous. Overall, the story is nothing too interesting.Graphics: Ultra Street Fighter IV still holds up even to this day. It's artstyle is unique and immediately recognisable, often looking like a painting brought to life. All character's attributes such as face, hair, arms and legs are heavily exaggerated often looking enormous and cartoonish. However, the character models are fairly detailed and the backgrounds have alot of personality and life behind them. Special moves are also good ot look at.Sound: Each character has a fantastic voice actor attached to them. They bring personality and charm to otherwise lifeless pixels on a screen. The dialogue they speak, special attack moves, groans and screams are all done very well and convincingly sell me that this is a memorable fighting game. Also, the soundtrack for this game is one of the best in the Street Fighter series. Each stage has it's own beat and more often than not it is iconic and will stay with you long after you have finished playing the game. It's the best it has been since Street Fighter II.Gameplay: Ultra Street Fighter IV is a pretty technical fighter. The speed of the game has been slowed down from Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike and is more about patience and watching your opponent carefully than simply button-mashing combos. It is alot of fun to have that back and forward duel with opponents, seeing who makes the first move and countering as neccessary. This is what Street Fighter is about. Not ridiculously long combos like Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 but reading your opponent and beating them through pokes, fakes and great strategy.Overall, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a fantastic fighting game. It rejuvenated my interest in fighting games and is one of the best Street Fighter games in recent memory. All gamers should try this game even if fighting games aren't their thing. 9/10.

												Best fighting game since SF4 came out, best fighting game today.  Not a lot to say about it other than:So far it is a far better value in the USF4 package than SFV.I will *never* own all of the DLC for this game which makes me pretty sad.  The game during the Steam Summer Sale 2016 is $7.49.  All DLC for the game at the SAME TIME would set you back $164.  Why this oversight even exists is beyond me.  They're even advertising bundles of costumes as ""complete"" packs for $20 but don't specify that each only contains 9 of the costumes.HOLY CHRIST CAPCOM DO SOMETHING RIGHT FOR ONCE.

												This is almost the end of an era with SF5 coming early next year. I have played SF since SF2 in the arcade, and SF4 on and off from Vanilla to Ultra and now I find myself playing it everyday, and impatiently waiting for SF5.This game is so deep once you get past the execution wall, but that is not for everyone. If you are a new player and need to ask someone some questions you might be scared to ask your friends, feel free to msg me. I LOVE THIS GAME <3 The community is surprisingly awesome. Since you only get better from playing better people, it is in your interest to ""level up"" your opponents. Example: If i do something and my opponent does not know what to do, I will friend them and tell them how to counter me. When I was a newbie I jumped too much. A player destroyed me for 4 games then invited me to endless and trained me for an hour. I love this game I love the people. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, atleast they have good taste.			",240,20,14,27,29,4,39

												I've clocked 1500 hours in Street Fighter 4's online multiplayer since August 2012. The game's main selling point is its online part, which allows you to compete against people from all around the world - but with the most recent upgrade a month ago in August 2014 called Ultra Street Fighter 4, this game's online component has been destroyed by the developers.Matches will randomly freeze for a second, unpredictably alternate between playing in slow-motion and regular speed within a couple of seconds, automated matchmaking will match players from different continents and introduce ever more lag, manual matchmaking doesn't communicate other player's pings in any reliable way, and finally, the game's rendering and network backend are dependent on one another in such a way that players with low framerates effectively lower the speed at which the match they're playing at the moment is running.Street Fighter is a very entertaining game, but it seems Capcom has completely written off the PC userbase.

To excell and master one character, it really needs commitment and there will be always some guides, posted by communities, which makes this game worth playing.

												Street Fighter IV was a superlative experience even before today, but Ultra Street Fighter IV, with its well devised additions, has added the bacon to what was already a tasty burger – you don’t know that Street Fighter IV needs these mechanics until you’ve tasted it with them.With new characters, stages, modes, and careful tweaking of the entire roster, Ultra Street Fighter IV is without a doubt, the definitive version of Street Fighter IV. It provides a plethora of new content and a staggering amount of detail, all for its modest price. Its greatest feat, however, is that everything culminates into a package that casual fans will enjoy and fighting game enthusiasts will appreciate.Whether you consider it to be meaningfully different or pretty much the same old thing, the important question is whether or not it’s worth playing. That one’s easy to answer. The game is aging, but it’s still great. And if you’re already a Street Fighter fan, it’s hardly a question at all.It will make your blood boil at times, but even if you’ve never played a version of Street Fighter IV before, you owe it to yourself to give this definitive edition a go.

The game ran smoothly with GFWL but now the online is the worst of any fighting game I have ever played. Well functioning online is essential for a game like USF4, because it's a game with barely any off line content. Until they fix this, I will not recommend this game to anyone.			",96,5,0,6,3,1,5

												Yes, having a bunch of different clothes variants is amazing but doesn't shadow the fact Street Fighter is a pretty good game. I first picked this game up with huge anticipation. I've seen the tournaments, I've watched the Pure Pwnage episode on this, and I've played Street Fighter 2 The World Warrior back in 94' like it was Call of Duty to these kids today. To say at first, I was a little disappointed. However, with a bit of practice and exposure to unique combos and moves, I became immersed. Besides the regular arcade/world tour mode, the game also features a challenge option for you to try out and test every characters combos and special moves. This is extremely helpful to new players in learning how the game mechanics work. At first it seems impossible to do anything super or ultra combos, especially with all the joystick or d-pad movement. After hammering it out a few times in this mode, you get used to the movements and mechanics start making sense. Some moves require all three punch buttons to be pressed. I didn't know that it was supposed to be at the same time and tried hammering three quick punches to which no special move would occur. It dawned on me eventually to try pressing all three punch buttons which resulted in a successful special attempt. It can seem extremely difficult, challenging, and even apathetic, but stick with it and keep plugging away and eventually the control schemes all make sense. I felt the combos were a bit more fluent than what Mortal Kombat X's was. Just like in the old Street Fighter games, you can grab and throw your opponents. The basic controls are weak punch and weak kick, then medium punch and medium kick, then there is two variances of hard punch and hard kick. Within the game, the player is able to choose the costume, fight style and taunt of the fighters before entering the stage. There are two bonus stages that are also featured throughout arcade mode. Similar styles and patterns can be noticed between fighters where some feel balanced, some are wrestlers, and some are acrobatic. Story lines within the game don't tell a lot of story, but do give a bit of insight into the characters of the Street Fighter World. Each character has a short story segment at the beginning and then again at the end tell of their triumph.The graphics in this game are distinctive. It follows a 3D sort of pattern but it's definitely 2D. I really like the art style they chose and they way they chose to end fights. Upon delivering a final blow, players can see their final actions carried out in slow motion. Sounds are good and do not necessarily mimic the old noise were used to. None the less, some of the old sounds are noticeable while the new ones deliver the impact they are meant to deliver.Multi player is absolute overkill. I don't think there are many players like myself still stuck in the 90's trying to put two punch combos together. Match making does a decent job trying to pair you up with someone close to your talent but often feels like it misses big time. Either really get to know this game and spend time learning character move sets, or be stuck getting punched and kicked thirty times in a row followed by a special combo.Overall, it is a pretty good game. I'm not a huge fight fan, but I do like my street fighter.For future SF games, it would be nice to see them try to new things with the game and maybe even go for a 3D plane. I have no problems with the way things are now, but why not try to add a bit more? To buy the full version of the game it costs about $45... I think for $45 there should be a bit more into the game than small variations on fighting. And maybe for guys like myself have certain move sets for certain characters that fight in different ways? RATING : 7.4/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  Ryu talking to himself, in a forest, by himself, prior to starting arcade/world tour mode Power/combo bars have been added at the bottom. I took this shot because the diversity of the levels and graphics are awesome Using the super combo to finish off an opponent  Finishing off the opponent with ultra combo ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Since the migrated from GFWL to Steamworks about 2 months ago. The game can best be viewed as a Early Access game. I was hopefully the release of the Ultra DLC would fix the game. Sadly the Ultra DLC has only come with it own set of problems Here are some of the biggest issues:* The netcode is very unstable. * Freezes and Game crashes* The five new characters are unfinished. Missing hurt- and hitboxes. * Lack of polish on the new animations and SFX* Missing modes: like training mode* bugs everywhere.Treat this as a Early Access game without Feedback.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why are you looking at the reviews? It's a great fighting game with a huge community, lots of video and stream content featuring tutorials, tournaments, LPs etc... If you like fighting games, you should get this game. If you never played a fighting game and want to know if this is for you, I'll just say this: You'll start off as a weakling online vs a sea of giant sharks, all ready to bite your head off. But with training, you'll start to fight off those sharks, start becoming a hard to catch pray. And eventually, you'll become a hunter. You'll want those sharks after you for the challenge. The excitement of winning a very close match vs an honorable opponent in a fighting game is like no other. If that sounds like fun to you, then definitely get this game.			",191,45,6,23,16,3,35

												Street Fighter has had quite a long history behind it. First releasing in 1987 in the Arcades, the series became popular once the sequel, Street Fighter II released on 1991 and pretty much created the Fighting Game genre and the competitive scene for it. This now being the fourth iteration features a number of gameplay changes to the traditional Street Fighter formula as well as a slew of new and classic characters from past Street Fighter and Final Fight games. The story (Yes it has a story) is set chronologically after the events of Street Fighter II but just before Street Fighter 3rd Strike. A new World Tournament is arranged after Bison's defeat at the hands of Akuma (SF2) in order to draw out Ryu and use his hidden powers and complete a project. Besides the main premise, every character has their own intros and endings after defeating the final boss, known as Seth - a new character to the Street Fighter franchise.The gameplay's still top notch Street Fighter. The game's heavily based on pokes and footsies (throwing out safe moves and controlling distance to your opponent) rather than combography, like games like Marvel vs Capcom or Mortal Kombat. Almost every character plays differently, with the obvious exception of the Shoto characters like Ryu, Akuma and Ken.Street Fighter has a 6 button layout, divided by Light, Medium and Heavy and each by Punch and Kicks. (Eg - LP - Light Punch or HK - Heavy Kick). Unlike in games like Marvel vs Capcom, however, these inputs can't be linked by just dialing-a-combo, they have to be timed as the animation ends or you use an old trick found out that helps players link together these moves known as Priority Linking or Plinking. Every character also possess their own Special Moves, most of them CAN be linked from normals, however. Motions also vary per character as well as the requirements for executing these moves - for example, Ryu's Hadouken has the standard QCF motion plus a punch button (QCF stands for Quarter Circle Forward or in NUMPAD motions - 236), likewise, Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku (Spinning Kick) has the motion reversed or QCB plus a kick instead of punch and Ryu's most complicated move, the Shoryuken has a ""Z"" like motion, (..or in Numpad reference: 623). Other characters, like Bison, have Charge moves. Charge moves are moves that require a direction to be held for a set amount of time, for example Bison's Scissor Kicks require you to hold back for a few seconds, then when you're ready to use the move, tilt forward and press any kick button, Bison will then execute the move. Kick motions are usually written in Numpad reference as: 4Hold 6+Button.NOTE: The Numpad References mentioned above require you to, of course, take a look at the numpad on your keyboard, an analog stick or a joystick go by that to divulge input information easier to Fighting Game Veterans and Newbies alike. In Numpad - 8 would be Up, 2 would be Down and 4/6 would be Front or Back depending on your positioning in the game.There's more stuff characters can do to further extend their offenses:*L,M,H Alterations to Special Moves: Almost every character, if not all of them - can slightly alter their special moves depending on the designated punch or kick used. For Example, using QCF+LP can result in a slow moving Hadouken, whereas using QCF+HP can result in a faster Hadouken. Some moves also come with different frame numbers, so maybe a Light version of a move is safe on block, but the heavy version of the same move is very punishable after you use it haphazardly.*EX Attacks: EX moves are that require meter to pull off (Read below) but are, essentially, buffed up Special Moves. EX moves are executed by holding two of the same button when inputting a special move. For example, Ryu's EX Hadouken would be QCF+LP+MP/HP.*Focus Attacks: Focus attacks are done by holding the Medium Kick button and Medium Punch button. Focus moves, if charged enough can soak up certain moves up as a counterattack and cause a Crumple State on your Foe (Crumple State means that your character is in an animation where they can't move, defend or attack). After a successful Focus Attack, if you input a dash, you can cancel out the residual animation and continue your offense or escape a failed Focus Attack before you get punished, some characters, however are unsafe even if they cancel out. A Focus Attack cancel into dash is widely known as ""FADC"" or Focus Attack Dash Cancel and these can be used to cancel out of some special moves. NOTE: Some moves WILL break through a Focus Attack, when they do, you'll hear a shattering sound, be mindful of this when haphazardly throwing out focus attacks.*Super Moves: Super Moves can be done when you have a Full Meter. Just like Ultras and Special Moves, they have their own input that varies per character. Using a Super will drain your entire Meter. *Ultras: Every character has 2 Designated Ultras, you can, however only choose one in the character select screen after choosing your fighter. In game, you get the meter to use your Ultra moves as you take damage. It is possible to use 2 Ultras in the same round.*Throws/Command Throws: Every character has a designated throw move. A throw can be done by pressing the light Punch and Kick buttons. Throws can be teched out of (Escaped) by pressing the Throw buttons just as you're being thrown. A throw can come out instantly and is often used for mix ups in an on going match. A Comand Throw, however, is only usable by certain characters, like Abel and Zangief. These have their own motions plus a button press, same as Special Moves, however, these throws are untechable and often deal high damage, but they aren't as easy to land as a regular throw.In game, you have three meters you need to keep track of as well!These being your health bar at the top, your Super Meter (Has 4 rectangles - each indicate an EX move that's now usable) and your Ultra bar by the side, which, when it lights up, means your character's Ultra is now useable.The game itself looks great visually with a lot nice visual effects that still look great to this day. The character models are a little bulky looking, but it's more or less to do with the game's own art style. The stages in the game look great as well, some are very vibrant and colorful and some have more animated backdrops in the stage to give it more authenticity to what you're seeing on screen.Soundwork is great aswell. Every stage has it's own theme to fit what you see on screen and helps further the authenticity of it, as well as some stages have their own added background noises. Each character also has their own theme songs and can be chosen to play them instead of Stage themes in the options menu as well as changing the character's Voices to English or Japanese. In game, everything also has it's own little chime that helps the player to identify them. When you gain a block of Super meter, it usually has a little 'puff' sound that helps you identify that you or your foe have a new block of meter to use. Hit noises are also fairly well done and help identify the more solid moves to give it more impact, likewise, the weaker moves, like light punches and kicks have their own sound that sounds less impactful but serve to help you identify that you hit your foe or viceversa.Overall, this is an amazing fighting game that no fighting game fan should miss. Not much to say other than it's Street Fighter. Great mechanics, a healthy selection of characters with high variation to them and of course, the game ALWAYS has something new for you to learn, even if you're seasoned veteran. Pros +Great Mechanics+Lots of Character Variation+Has an amazingly balanced roster+Amazing Visual Effects+Amazing Soundwork and soundcues help give the game authenticity and impactCons-Dodgy Online System			",907,239,29,104,39,8,85

												Ultra Street  Fighter IV is a fighting game that deserves recognition as one of the best of its kind aside from Tekken.Its 2D fighting style is superb than others while Ultra edition bring balance to the characters and replay matches.New challengers from old games like Final fight bring nostalgia to me. Combo are very basic and often used along withthrow,focus or even Hadouken moves, make this game even more harder to mastered.It still hold the name really welland might be able to match SFII Hyper edition.That's my opinion after all.7/10 - Shoryuken never feels better than this.

												Genre - Japanese 2D Fighting GameOkay I was always more of a Mortal Kombat / Soulcalibur fan. However, this is the best Street Fighter game I have played so far and the animated cut scenes and graphics look really nice. There are loads of chracters and moves to try out. I tend to play these sort of games on the easier settings as I am pretty crap. However, by doing this I still got to enjoy the game. Also been online and still a few people around to play against. Too many achievements are geared towards online games though. I just watched the latest film by Cine-Asia and this encouraged me to buy the game. Great fun to play through each of the characters story modes and looks sweet at the same time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ultra Street Fighter IV, should probably be called the Ultimate Street Fighter IV since that is what it is. It has all the characters from the Street Fighter Franchise as well as some new faces and locations. 44 different characters to choose from with updated standout graphics that make the characters pop on screen. The game looks good, feels good, and for those of us who grew up with old school Street Fighter, it brings back a lot of memories. Ultra Street Fighter IV allows you to play solo arcade mode, or multiplay with friends. You can find online opponents, and pit yourself against some of the best Street Fighters in the world, the choice is up to you. I played the arcade mode against the PC, and enjoyed the little mini animations between rounds. I thought that was a nice touch. Playing Blanka, who was always one of my favorites, I thoroughly enjoyed trouncing the competition. I'll admit I haven't actually played the Street Fighter Series since the 90's, but Ultra Street Fighter IV feels like a more modern version of the original, with better graphics, more characters, and new moves. If you enjoy the street fighter series, you should really consider picking this game up.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

Updated review, since changes to the Steam client have improved online performance significantly:What's what:The most recent iteration of classic 2D fighting in the Street Fighter universe.  44 characters to play on or off line, and many mechanical intricacies to master, many not covered by the fairly basic tutorials.  Steep learning curve, highly satisfying to master.What's Good: Large roster of well balanced characters, and fully mastering just one can be a serious commitment.  Most players will never run out of new things to tackle and learn. Robust net code for online play, which is always going to have some microseconds of delay compared to offline versus, but for the most part plays fluidly and works great for practice and casual matches. Classic 2D fighting mechanics evolved from SF II that also offers a lot of depth.  Characters can use powerful and flashy ultra combos as a powerful comeback tool.  Make your attacks safe or extend a combo using Focus Attack cancels.  Combos with tight execution require training, but are satisfying to master. Good amount of game modes, from the barebones arcade versus CPU and the feature rich practice mode and character combo trials, to online ranked or casual lobbies and (little used) team battle and 8 player tournaments.What's Bad:  Searching matches based on skill online doesn't work, causing frustration for new players and professionals alike.  Its entirely possible for someone just having installed the game to be matched against an EVO competitor.  USFIV is showing its age visually.  SFIV was never visually advanced, to make sure it ran constant 60 fps on consoles 6 years ago and hasn't seen any visual upgrades since then.  Characters and especially stage backgrounds look quite ugly by today's standards.  Unreasonably strict combo system.  This one's debatable and many will put this as one of the game's strong points.  Most combos are links, meaning they have to be input after an attack animation has ended completely, as opposed to chains, where normal punches and kicks can be cancelled into other attacks.  The frame window to hit these combos can be extremely narrow, often down to 1 or 2 frames precision (Using 60 frames in one second as measuring), meaning even professional players with 5000 hours and more clocked will still sometimes or often miss combo timings.  I'm all for being rewarded for vigilant practice, but combo windows being this rigid is a bit too much, and can be very offputting for newer players to cope with.Summary:While USFIV has strong competition from other fighting games these days, it is still a very good fighting game.  It lacks in tutorials and teaching how to combo and understand the finer technical points however, so new players are going to have to educate themselves outside of the game through wikis and watching a lot of high level play on YouTube or Twitch.  It still enjoys a healthy player base, and despite other games competing for attention in the genre and SF V being in production, I still feel comfortable recommending Ultra Street Fighter IV for players looking to get into a fighting game, or pondering getting the PC version of it.

												USFIV is currently one of the most balanced 1 on 1 2D fighting games with a good fighting system, good amount of characters, moves and game modes. SFIV is a 2D fighting game like most of the previous Street Fighter iterations. It has various characters which increases the chance of some that may catch your fancy. There is even more characters in this ultra edition which is an upgrade to previous SFIV versions. Fighting speed in general is normal compared to other 2D fighters which leaves a good open window for command inputs in-between. This PC version have a decent system settings and controllers compatibility other than x-input (xbox 360/one based) devices and keyboards. For all characters the fighting system has 6 main buttons, blocks are done by holding back, standing, crouching and jumping attacks, throws, dashes, wakeup delay, characters get stunned after certain amount of attacks taken, a 2 stage charge attack (called focus) for each character which strength varies by the duration pressed, characters have special moves and there is extra bar (called super) which has 4 stages (bars) and can be used for having ex version of some specials by using one bar and a super which consumes all 4 bars, there is finishing move bar (called ultra) and each character has 2 ultras which can be selected individually or together, focus then dashing can be used to link some attacks (called focus cancel) and can be used to cancel an active attack for defense and backing up. Attacks are categorized into high, medium, low, overhead, throws, some characters has command throws also and fully charged focus is unblockable. All non-normal attacks will chip the health bar when blocked and can finish a round. All characters have taunts which can be disabled before matches.  Arcade mode acts like story mode with few (1 or more) still images with narration as prologue and a small animated clip as epilogue with rival battles before the boss battle that has special before and in match dialogue. There is versus mode for local or computer battles and also there is computer versus computer matches. Training mode is on normal quality with ability to record actions for the dummy and can be locally controlled or computer controlled and all bars are modifiable, there is challenge mode which is a series of combos for each characters. Online multiplayer is decent now but with less players than the consoles versions as there is no cross platform multiplayer, all online battles have voice chat, there is ranked battles, online training, room battles and tournament like rooms with one active match at a time and all can be open invitation to all or friend invitations and in rooms you can set the number of slots for which type. Online battle can be selected to start and halt current offline matches when found, this applies to arcade and training modes. Online and versus matches replays can be saved although in limited amount and you can watch some matches for high ranking players and some recent replays for others all can be viewed by region or characters. There is a ranking system for your overall points and your character points. You can be unique online by having an icon, a title and a vs screen message and all are pre made. There is different customs for each character and a lot of them are unfortunately available as DLC.Pros:Easy to pick up and learn but hard to master.A very balanced fighting game.Big selection of characters that a lot are totally unique with either English or Japanese voices.All characters versions are available in addition to omega versions.Ability to have different playing styles, strategies.Community, as there is a lot of player made material for every subject.Competitive real life tournaments.Almost endless shelf life for a fighting game.cons:Lackluster arcade/story mode.No Tutorial mode.Stages default BGM is mostly boring except for a few ones.No visual upgrade from 2008.Price is high for an upgrade.DLC is overpriced and cannot be earned in-game.Mastery require too much training for any character.No time attack or survival/endurance modes.Offline and online play variety is limited.Some online modes are almost abandoned.Need to manually adjust some settings in graphics card options outside the game for optimum performance.No official list of all combos or official in-depth guide, also no technical visual assist in training for hitboxes and moves recovery and active frames.Only icons, titles, default custom colors and taunts are rewards for playing.I hope this is a fair review of USFIV on Steam.

												“Yo, this game is so sick”. That is what I said about Ultra Street Fighter 4 after I KO’d one of my many online opponents by mercilessly throwing a beefy Metsu Hadoken right into his chest.  USF4 is, quite possibly, my favorite fighting game that exists to this very day.  This is a strong opinion that I have just given, but please allow me to explain why I feel this way, and why this game may interest you as well.The characters.  USF4 boasts an IMPRESSIVE cast of fighters.  Fans of the older Street Fighter games will see just about all of the old characters they remember and love like Ryu, Chun Li, and Sagat, but the game also throws many new fighters into the mix as well. All together, USF4 offers 44 different fighters to play as.  Can you imagine having 44 different types of delicious pasta given to you at once? I would probably blow up from eating too much.One of the ways that USF4 separates itself from other fighting games is by how accessible it is to fighting game newcomers.  Special move inputs are simple to perform, basic combos are not lengthy or technically demanding, and the pace of the game is much slower than other fighters like Marvel Vs. Capcom or King of Fighters.  This may sound bad for fighting game experts, but USF4 still manages to have a great deal of depth and can be very rewarding for those who put in the work and become godlike.Be warned that this game does not offer much for the single player experience.  It comes with Arcade mode, Training mode, and a Trial mode.  Most players, though, will likely be spending their time playing online trying to become THE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE.  Please keep in mind that many players have had problems with the online thus far. I, PERSONALLY, haven’t had much trouble.  Every now and then, I get a match that lags like a ravenous herd of chunky sea slugs swimming through a rich manure field, HOWEVER, most of the time it runs quite well and I dominate the opponent with my MLG decision making and cunning brilliance.I would like to believe that Street Fighter is the face of fighting games, and luckily, it is also DOWNRIGHT SICK NASTY at what it does.  It’s got tons of memorable characters, stages, and music.  Good visuals and flashy attacks.  An online mode that works great (at least for me) and is very active.  It’s easy for newcomers to enjoy and deep enough for experts to play for hundreds of hours.  To put it simply, USF4 is just like a steaming plate of luxurious lasagna fritta that you never grow tired of.I give Ultra street Fighter 4 a score of “Undisputed Champion of the Makuuchi Sumo Wrestling Division”. Thank you for reading this review.			",55,6,0,7,7,0,1

												Great game for anyone who enjoys competitive play with a potential for high skill cap. Unfortunately the net code is horrid, and is impossible to play timing-dependent characters such as c.viper online. Most of my games say that the connection is a full green bar, but yet still feel very slugish. It really is a good game, but I just can't recommend this due to the poor net code.			",81,17,0,9,2,2,1

												Not for casuals. Unless you want to be some guy who sits at home all day playing Street Fighter, you'll never be as good as the other players. The controls are ""responsive"". Too responsive. Unless you hit that punch button the exact moment you make that quarter circle, you won't get the Hadouken. Once your opponent traps you in their combo, there's no escape. The block will work, miraculously only. If you want to play for fun, this game is not for you. You'll just get mad when your moves won't execute which will be a big buzz kill. Trust me. I tested this by playing with someone in my house. We both got frustrated in the 5th round. If you're into a rough community and games that require a week to perfect your skills, go ahead. Get this amazing jewel. If you want to have fun, I can recommend Super Smash Brothers. In Super Smash Brothers, you'll have bigger windows of opportunity to escape from combos or make comebacks.The music is great. The main menu music is AWESOME!!! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, MAN. I MASTURBATE AND ♥♥♥♥ DIAMONDS TO THAT MAIN MENU MUSIC. It's my waifu.The art in the menus are quite awesome too. When you start up the game you get a cool opening scene of all the characters fighting. It's not an in-game battle. It's an animated battle. THAT'S RIGHT, you'll see the characters pull off a bunch of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥against each other.Would rage quit again, 10/10.Edit: Actually... The game's multiplayer is GENUNELY♥♥♥♥♥♥ People will spam combos. There won't be any escape once you're trapped in a combo. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you want to play a game that's balanced. In my opinion, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you play Character X VS Character X. Same Char VS Same Char.  In fact, don't buy it. It doesn't deserve it. Just buy the soundtrack. Get a better fighting game where you actually have a chance to block anything but require skill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a game, Ultra Street Fighter IV is pretty good. The main thing I look for in a fighting game is gameplay, and USF4 mostly delivers in that respect. However, as a PC port, USF4 is disappointing. That doesn't mean you should write it off, however.USF4 is the final entry in Capcom's line of Street Fighter 4 games. Before this particular entry was developed, Capcom made the stupid decision to saddle its PC ports of Street Fighter IV and Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition with Games For Windows Live. GFWL is DRM that no customer wanted; not only was it unnecessary, but it caused problems for many of the game's paying customers. When Capcom seemingly did the right thing by patching GFWL out of SSF4:AE's PC port, the game's netcode inexplicably took a serious hit. Online play became unreliable at best.Not long after leaving GFWL in the past, Capcom announced that it would develop USF4, and that this update would be developed with Steamworks-based netcode. PC gamers had reason to believe that USF4 would have great online gameplay because it would supposedly be developed from the ground up without any GFWL integration. What PC gamers got instead was simply a patched version of SSF4:AE that still features the same broken netcode. Capcom promised to fix the netcode, butyears later, it has clearly failed to carry out that promise. With Street Fighter 5 having been released, it is unlikely that Capcom will ever fix Street Fighter 4's netcode for the PC.What USF4's sorry state of online play usually amounts to is that internet-based games will be unplayably laggy. This problem occurs even when both of the players are in the same region and have stable internet connections. If you have the fortune of playing online without significant lag, the experience is compromised by the fact that the game does not support voice chat or even native texting.The game isn't a total wash. You can have a good time playing with a buddy who's physically in the same room as you, and the single player arcade mode is mostly fun to play through. For me, the fun stops as soon as I reach Seth, the game's final boss. He's frustratingly cheap and you'll probably struggle to win more than one round against him unless you resort to memorizing his patterns and exploiting their few loopholes in a very contrived manner.Seth battles notwithstanding, USF4's gameplay is solid. However, I don't like Capcom's decision to substite the SF4 games with a focus attack system instead of the parry system that was introduced in Street Fighter III. Although USF4's roster is large, there are many shoto clones, so the gameplay between characters isn't as diverse as your eyes may lead you to believe.As far as graphics go, the characters look pretty good, although Decapre looks way too derivative of Cammy for a first time playable character who was hyped to the moon. (Thankfully, she handles completely differently and does indeed function as a unique character.) Most of the backgrounds are bland and unimaginative, but this has been a problem with every Street Fighter game since Capcom moved on from the Street Fighter II series.I really dislike that game's music, sound effects, and especially its announcer. Sound-wise, the only thing I like about the game is the voice acting.Bottom line, this is a pretty good game, but Capcom should be ashamed for promising to fix SSF4:AE's netcode, only to release this installment and have it suffer from the same problem that Capcom neglected to fix. Mainly for that reason, I disapprove of this port, but not the game itself. People who have friends who can play with them IRL will likely derive the most enjoyment from the PC port of USF4.

												The most balanced fighting game you could ever own, Ultra Street Fighter IV stands as the king of fighters. I'm not one for reviewing games but I wanted to throw in my two cents to encourage you that if you are interested in playing a fighting game, this should be your first if not only choice. While Street Fighter was first born in 1987 and the title may seem like they have rehashed the game overtime, this is definitely not so. Each character has their own unique attributes, strengths, weaknesses, and believe it or not, playstyle. Just like with any game, there is a so called tier-list based off their number of favorable matchups against other characters but for the most part, anyone can win. It is not as up to date graphically but if you appreciate the cartoon/cell shaded style graphics that gives it much more of a fantasy look, it's great. Beautiful soundtrack, sound effects during fights, and add-on content with crazy costumes for characters gives you personality during your fight.The biggest turn off that you may expereince in any fighting game is that you instantly go on-line and expect results. The problem is in a fighting game, being hopeful and mashing buttons just does not bring results (think of grinding in MMOs). While anything can happen in a match, the greatest feeling is learning the ins and outs of the fighting system where combos are difficult enough that when mastered give you a trule feeling of levling up in your gameplay but are not long stretched out button cominations such as Tekken which I myself never was fond of. Online/Offline training mode as well as trials give you the opportunity to grow and develop your timing, spacing of moves, see damage statistics as well as observe your input data to see why the special move you are trying to do is not happening.When it comes to fighting, Street Fighter is very straight forward, with three different levels of punches/kicks, ranging from the lighter faster jab or kick all the way to the stronger but slower hook or roundhouse. While it seems so simple, every character has completely different frame data (meaning that moves do completely different damages and come out faster or slower, some making a character vulnerable to being hit if blocked). This includes characters like Ryu and Ken who everyone knows and thinks they are so similar. While most think that all that is needed to be done is throw Hadoukens or mash special moves to win, this is just not the case. In this generation of gaming, it is crucial that you fight with your mind. Not being able to defend yourself results in very fast knockouts. What I love personally about this is that since every character is different, you start to learn which characters are aggressive, defensive, controling certain spaces, etc. This aids in creating a unqiue experience with every character you play. The community for this game itself is very focused on the growth of players though just like any game, you will have trollers. It's inevitable. Great replay channel usage (download and upload as well as linking to Youtube.) Split-screen play as well which is a rare commodity in this day and age.The only downside about Street Fighter is that on PC (While I wouldn't consider it a precise downside but for those that don't do reserach, it will be), playing online optimized will require to setup your PC in a specific way. The game is made to run at 60FPS for second without too much enhancement. Failing to run it properly will keep you from being able to perform combos correctly which of how frame precise button presses are (though this is with just about any fighting game). The preferred method of running the game includes the following settings:- Enable v-sync and triple buffering for Ultra Street Fighter IV in your nVidia Control Panel or ATI Control Center (This fixes screen tearing and allows a 60fps without over-smoothing the game to cause issues with button presses- In-game run whatever resolution you can comfortably and disable V-Sync in game, and put Frame Rate to ""Fixed.""By doing this, it will be running close to if not mimicing the arcade version in terms of fluency.With achievements, difficult to master, great online experience, and depth, this is THE fighting game you will not want to pass up.PROS-------------+Replay value+Character Roster  (44 Characters)+Character creativity / uniqueness+Controls+Online community+Gameplay Depth / Mechanics+Soundtrack+Graphically beautifulCONS_________- PC version not as optimized as console. Requires tweaking for the best experience.Welcome to the community if you buy it! Enjoy!			",63,0,0,8,1,1,4

												I am a mortal kombat player and have never touched a StreetFighter in my life. When I first started it was so difficult and confusing. I couldn't get the motions down and I could barely perform Ryu's ultra. To this day I still can't link all that well but with the 80 hours I have into this game I can say that Ultra Street Fighter 4 is definately worth your money. This game is a completely different genre of fighter from Mortal Kombat and I love it. This Killer Instinct and (until I get a ps4 cuz the PC version is the reason I got USF4 to begin with) MK are my favorite fighters. Until the REST of SF5 comes out, you can play USF4.

												The ultra version of Street Fighter 4 brings us a lot of ballance changes and above all, new characters.Street Fighter 4 is a game that some might concider the most balanced fighting game out there with interesting characters and game mechanics. Old favourites like Ryu, Ken and Chun li all makes an appearance in this edition with 45 others in the roster to choose from.The game is amazing to watch at professional levels and even more fun to play it for yourself and win games!Heads up: See Street Fighter as a sport, you will not be good at it right off the bat, practice and patience are required in order to succeed.

												(Too long; Didn't read at the bottom)Okay, yeah, you know what, there's a massive issue when you prefer Games for Windows Live...Okay sure, it's a fun fighting game for all players, young, old, beginner or master and it's easy to learn with a different variety of characters, costumes, colours, stages and moves... But what's not fun is getting absolutely destroyed because of the online of this game.Steam has completely ruined online for this game, it jitters constantly which slows the game down and makes it literally impossible to do a special move, but then what happens? It's A-Okay! Finally the lag is over!.... For 5 seconds then proceeds to jitter more, I don't know if this is just the netcode, my internet connection (which is perfect, I have no issues on any other version on this game), or my computer (which is a beast and runs anything I make it run on the highest graphics possible) but it's seriously broken, like, actually broken.On the other hand, some say that the netcode is fine with no issues, but these people who have told me that the netcode is fine have over 40mbps download and 10mbps upload speeds (no surprise there is there.) So what about the people who can't get fibre optic connectivity? We just can't play, at all.Games for Windows Live was a GODSEND compared to this broken hunk of junk, GFWL is active on multiple games *cough* Street Fighter x Tekken *cough* UMK3 *cough* so why can't we bring it back? It was infinitely better than this, sure we sometimes got some problems with connections, but that was mainly down to a persons internet speeds and connectivity, NOT broken netcode... I seriously pray for Games for Windows Live to make a return, at least that worked correctly!In conclusion, I recommend it for people who want a fun OFFLINE fighting game, or for people who want to practice without the need of a console, but unless you have very fast internet speeds, I wouldn't recommend investing time going into Ranked Mode.TL;DR: Broken netcode, not fun, dropping combos, fun game offline for the whole family, praying for GFWL to come back, not recommended online, recommended for offline use.

												A pretty great starting point to get into fighting games. Easy to pick up but incredibly difficult to master. It's like a game of chess, you know how everything works, but making it so it all fits together in execution is where you will need to practice and get better at. Lots of different characters that play differently and have different playstyles, everyone's got their favorites. Definitely worth picking up on a sale, make sure to get THIS version of the game if you want the full experience. Especially if you're holding off for Street Fighter 5.			",591,111,9,64,49,6,66

												What can I say, this game had a REALLY good run. 2008 to 2016 is pretty damn good. This game has so many good memories for me. I remember the time when my uncle had pre-ordered vanilla SFIV for the PS3 and I wanted to play it so bad because the commercials made that game look HYPE AS♥♥♥♥♥♥ heh, good times those were. Anyways, this game has a HUGE roster of characters at this point and is very easy to get into, however at some point you will get the urge to become better at this game, that's where you'll get frustrated. Trust me, this game can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master, but once you have all the hard stuff down like, FADCs, solid combos (because this game has 1 frame links), footsies, zoning and ESPECIALLY the mind games, you'll be an excellent player. So do I recommend this game? OF COURSE! It's an amazing game. However, the entire reason why I decided to share a little memory of my past with this game was because I'm honestly kind of bored of it and moving on to SFV. Why move on to SFV? Well, for many people the answer is ""because it's the new Street Fighter, DUH!"", but personally for me It's because it's been a while since a Street Fighter game has felt like the classics and SFV really brings that back, but if you're new to the Street Fighter series I can guarantee you that this game will be a hell of a lot of fun when you first get your hands on it.2017 edit: Forget what I said about Street Fighter V this game is still a ton better than that trash.

I don't know any game that brings so many emotions to both players, it can be laughter, anger, saltiness... no other fighting game affected me the way SF4 did. Despite having minor flaws this is truly the best Street Fighter game Capcom ever produced. To hell with SFV! USF4 FOR LIFE! SOOOOOONIC HURRICAAAAANE!!!111 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It doesn't matter if you good or bad at fighting games. I am not good-at-all at it but Ultra Street Fighter IV (USFIV) is clearly the only fighting game that make me want to be better at it. This game is awesome. Really, it is. It's also a great game if you're really strong at fighting games of course don't worry.Let's make a list.Pros ;+ Controls ; You have a couple of choice, arcade controller (the best), the XBOX or basic controller (the good) and the keyboard (the not-so-good). I am playing on keyboard and Capcom show us that it's possible to play with a keyboard at Street Fighter. + Ambiance ; One of the most intense and greatest ambiance I ever saw in a videogame. + Sound ; With quality voice acting and sounds, it won't hurt your ears and it keep the great ambiance.+ Music ; I am not into Techno music but this game have clearly great musics that fit every situations.+ Graphism ; Colorful and awesome. The characters animations were really polished and all the extra effects look perfect.+ Storyline ; Yes, there is a storyline for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the Arcade mode. Every character have their own theme, rivals, boss and cutscene (let's not forget about the animation that starts at the begining of a fight too.)+ Character choice ; There is a lot of playable characters which made the Street Fighter Universe so great. Make your choice. Play only with your special someone or try'em all.+ Character customization ; You can change the color of your character clothes and even changing them if you have the correct DLC of course.+ Difficulty ; There not only Easy Medium and Hard there is like 10 differents difficulties. You just need to pick-up the one that fits you which make this game perfect for Not-good players or Super strong players.+ 2 Players party ; Of course, why in the world would you not being able to play with your (real-life) friend at a Street Fighter game?+ Training and Challenge Mode ; Those are great and can really help you to figure out some new tricks for your favorite character.Cons ;- Online ; No much people and most of them are smurfs and people that is playing fighting games from the time they're 5. No actual rookie, initiated, causual or even intermediate players. Only brainless phycos that absolutely need to play with a stick. - Online lag ; Like the online matchmaking isn't already that hard. There is a serious problem about the lags in this game.- Team Match ; It looks interesting, but I was never able to find a single server.- DLCs ; It bring great customization possibilities but it's expensive. Like 5€ for 4~5 outfits.- Difficulty at the end of the Arcade Mode ; When you're going for the boss it will be really, really, really harder that the other folks you just met ealier. It can be really frustrating sometimes.- Achievements difficulty ; Why Capcom, why ? These achivements are super hard, really.TL;DROverall, this is great. Really. But don't bet on the Online mode, it's not nice. However the Arcade and Versus Mode are awesome. You will really have fun by playing this game. It worth the price, definitly→ 89/100			",17,1,2,1,2,1,0

												The king of the hill. The epitomy in fighting games. Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition is continuing the success of the Street Fighter franchise that started and ""created"" the fighting genre as we know it today.Beautiful 2D graphics, amazing soundtrack and all the classic moves we learned while playing in the local arcades while being young. Its all back better, faster, harder, stronger. With a huge cast of characters for all tastes, a plethora of different moves and combos and a good online battle system which is lag free most of the time. SSF4 AE is super enjoyable for everyone, even those who prefer the offline game or their living room fighting with friends and having a blast. For those that money isn't an issue, or for those that really want to focus on the game i recommend to buy an arcade fighting stick as a controller. The experience is trully unique.The learning curve for the more advance technics might be a bit steep for new players that try the genre for the first time, but the fighting is community is insanely active and offer great assistance to everyone that is willing to ask or look for it.The only con i found personally is that the tutorial on the mechanics of the game is nonexistant so you have to figure yourself or watch one of the many tutorials out there of how the game actually works.I recommend it 100% to everyone that wants to start the fighting genre, veterans of the kind are already playing it the review isn' t for them, its the perfect game to be initiated to fighting games.

												SSFIVAE is a 2.5D fighting game that has a lot of different characters, all with unique playstyles and moves.Gameplay: The gameplay is great; there's alot of special attacks and unique attacks specific to each character, combos are difficult but satisfying, and playing on the keyboard is pretty tough so I would suggest getting a controller to play.Content: SSFIVAE has an Arcade mode which has a cutscene at the beginning, a series of matches against AI or a second player, 2 minigames built in, then a cutscene about specific rival, you face the rival, then you face Seth: the game's 'boss'. There are 24 specific trials to each character which make you do special moves and combos that allow you to train and get better with a character.Multiplayer: For the most part, the multiplayer is smooth, fast, and rarely has lag. Occasionaly you will get put up against someone that has network problems but you can always back out before you go into a match. There are 4 gamemodes in the multiplayer: ranked match, endless match, team battle, and tournament. In a ranked match, you will gain and lose player points(points specific to your profile) and battle points(points specific to a character). The PP and BP will be visible to the other people in a lobby/match with you. The multiplayer also goes through GFWL(Games for Windows Live), which most people don't like, but I've heard that its shutting down soon, so don't worry.Visuals and Audio: The graphics are great, it has a cartoony style to it and the characters have a cool black outline on them. The maps are really cool, and they all have animations to them(besides the training stage). The sounds are really good aswell,  there's great voice acting, but occasionally the map music gets a little repetitive.Overall I would recommend this to anyone. 9/10 ",84,10,1,10,3,0,7

												One of the best fighting game of this generation. Although the entrance may be a bit harsh and unforgiving for beginner fighters since the learning curve is pretty stiff, you're still gonna have a blast of fun button mashing with your friends. A great game for a sleep over party where you can casually beat up each other till the sun rise :DBut when you got a hang of the basics and want to discover futher, this is where the true fun begin: this game offers unlimited type of playstyles to learn, depends on your character of choice: grappler, zoner, defensive charger, offensive rush-down...and many more. I spent almost 3 and a half years playing this game with mostly one character and still got a lot to learn from! The soundtrack is amazing, Indestructible and Sakura themes are my personal favourites, although all other themes are awesome too. In my experience, the game is best enjoyable when playing with friends offline, such as the arcade or a net cafe rather playing it alone with AI and online opponents. So go ahead and join your nearest Street Fighter local community!			",96,19,0,10,5,0,21

												This game is a joke! It's not possible to effectively play it with a keyboard and it does not recognize a gamepad. In order to play it with a gamepad it requires to switch windows with Alt+Tab and then switch back to the game again. While playing with a keyboard, some characters are not moving back and forth, and it's almost impossible to perform special moves. Besides, special moves do not cause substantial damage. Taking into account the time you need to spend on pressing special combination, it's better to just stick with the combos. The story and character lines are too cheesy even for a fighting game. The gameplay itself is boring. I feel really disappointed with this game, although it was one my favourite titles back in the days of 8-bit consoles.Full price, costs of upgrade, DLCs and costumes are a steal. Capcom is just exploiting the popularity of the title.My only comfort is that I bought USFIV with 75% discount. It's still not worth it.Overall rating: 4/10.If you want a decent fighting game, go get ""Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition"" or ""Injustice: Gods Among Us"" during sales time. It has much more to offer for a lower price. Or, if you want something from Street Fighter, go try Street Fighter X Tekken, but it's good only because it has Tekken characters in it. Oh, Capcom, please don't go down that road Nintendo did. Some of your other titles are really great, but if you'll keep exploiting the glory of past days, you'll loose your customers. Atleast in the West.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												In few words - this is the best fighting game on PC, no doubt.+ Great netcode, you can play online without lags near every match;+ Big character roster, each character has unique moveset and game tactics;+ VERY cool soundtrack+ Game is not so hungry 'bout system requirements;- Medium-to hard threshold to the game, combo-attacks are not so easy to do;- It's better to obtain arcade stick to play this game, 'cos it has a 6-button mechanics. Gamepad users can be frustrated about it (keyboard users is more happy);- You can't choose character's alternative costumes, until you buyed them. Shame on you, CapcomP.S.

												I write this as a reflection on it's current state, I feel like if the issues I'll mention are sorted it could be a fanstastic game.Basically the game played online is the greatest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ever.You receive pings from other players whilst in game which makes the game lag, the online experience has gone from what was pretty stable on GFWL to almost unplayable if you want to play a serious competitive game that doesn't involve both players turtled in the corner hitting jabs to make sure they aren't lagging for hopefully 10 seconds at a time.If nothing changes, I will never buy another capcom game again, they need to know their half arsed lazy patches which fix nothing will not suffice.

												I can't recommend it with all the Lag. If you want it for offline fights, it really good. Otherwise, forget it unless you got people from your country playing with you which can be forgiven. Its not fun to me since I can hardly find people that I can fight with.Good game, crappy online, one of the worst online services. GFWL had a better servers than this, and my PS3 have a better online than this and I did test it with SF4 Arcade on both. FU[K THIS GAME, waste of time and biological age from the annoyance it gaves during the lag. Uninstall.Edit:Just to let you guys know, I had this game on PS3,(SF4 and SF4 arcade) and both worked with 1mb internet speed. Now I have 50MB and I lag like sh*t with people, Steam service to this game is SH*T. I played this on Windows for games and it was Good with no lag but once they made the change to Steam it become utter Hell to me and my friend.Second Edit: I have upgraded my connection from 50mb to 100 mb download and 20mb upload. I know the connection is Sh!t in UAE/my area but Fu(king Hell, even with this I LAG. Told my friend to never bother me with this sh*tty Pc game.			",212,68,1,10,5,2,4

												Recommended! If you're looking for a warm-up to Street Fighter V then here is your chance.If you're a long term fan of the Street Fighter franchise, then SF4 should be familiar to you - and an enjoyable experience.Certain things have changed in ths version of SF4 however;1/ You will fnd fireballs less effective (aka zoning)2/ Being able to 'get in' on people significantly easier (some call it 'rushdown')Those two points makes life easier for low to intermediate players making the game enjoyable without investing hundreds of hours into the game to 'get good to win'. Long story short, you can probably win more games with less time invested than older versions of SF4 and have fun with it. I'm crusty and old and enjoyed SF4 and SSF4 more. :) but can still extract some fun out of Ultra SF4!			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a small, teeny tiny learning curve. At first you will fight street and street will always win.

												THE definitive edition of Street Fighter 4!


YouTube™ Video: Summer Fight Nights   Ultra Street Fighter 4 

			Views: 30		

			Today we blast through one of my favorite iterations in the Street Fighter series thanks to the summer Steam sale! ***** This game is copyright Capcom, 2014.		

I absolutely love the Street Fighter 4 games.  I thought Capcom may have been done with the 3D fighter realm after the Street Fighter Ex games, but nope!  This game is dripping in style and there are a lot of great fighters, new and old.  If you never got a chance to try SF4, now's the time to start!			",474,238,2,111,29,2,39

												It took a while, but I think it's now safe to say this is the definitive version of Street Fighter 4. It had some ups and downs but the community is still strong in this 6+ year old game. Ultra brings with it a slew of buffs and nerfs of all the characters, 5 new characters ( 4 carried over from SFxT) and more costumes than you could possibly have any use for.As the basis for most if not all 2d fighters in the last decade or so, you wont go far wrong choosing USFIV as a first forrey into the world of Fighting games. Intimidating at first, but you will be hadoken'ing and shoryuken'ing in no time at all. Extensive trials for each character and even an online training mode so you can practice with your friends makes it even easier to pick up for first timers.A game that is easy to pick up but takes time to master. In my opinion, if you are willing to put some time and practice into it, this games value far exceeds the price of admission.			",495,138,13,100,83,5,89

												Been playing Ultra on Steam on and off for the past 2 months. In terms of graphics, it is the best looking version followed by PS4, 360 and PS3 bringing up the rear.  In terms of online play, XBLV is superior in regard to connection (surprisingly) and amount of players.  Steam and PS3 are about even in connection quality with the PS4 version bringing up the rear.Being able to mod the PC version is a plus, but in terms of online competition (quantity and quality) XBLV is best.  It’s too bad online matches across all platforms wasn’t considered viable until recently.All in all, you can’t go wrong with this game regardless of platform.8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent gameplay, incredible variety and selection in character roster (40+ characters) make this an easy to love game for newcomers and pros alike. Add in the great nostalgia effect for those who loved the earlier SF2 games (similar music, plenty of familar characters and play styles) and this is a winning title with unlimited replayability due to smooth online matchups and additional multiplayer modes to keep you hooked.

												Recommended! If you're looking for a warm-up to Street Fighter V then here is your chance.If you're a long term fan of the Street Fighter franchise, then SF4 should be familiar to you - and an enjoyable experience.Certain things have changed in ths version of SF4 however;1/ You will fnd fireballs less effective (aka zoning)2/ Being able to 'get in' on people significantly easier (some call it 'rushdown')Those two points makes life easier for low to intermediate players making the game enjoyable without investing hundreds of hours into the game to 'get good to win'. Long story short, you can probably win more games with less time invested than older versions of SF4 and have fun with it. I'm crusty and old and enjoyed SF4 and SSF4 more. :) but can still extract some fun out of Ultra SF4!			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played Street fighter, or any of its many clones, this game should be no problem getting right into as long as you play casually.  But if you expecting to be playing online against experienced player and winning, you might want to take time practicing and watching tutorials online.  That’s if you can get a decent connection with other players.  That’s my main gripe.  Everything appears to be fine with full green bars, but as soon as the match starts, it’s like some time wizard slows everything down as you desperately try to block a string of unconnected attacks.  And it appears that many online have mastered exploiting the lag fest with repetitive moves that make blocking seem impossible.  Best bet is playing against friends you know have good connections, which will limit you to non ranked matches, but who cares.  Overall, it’s good fighting game with a substandard online matchmaking component.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very frustrating at the beginning, because you need a long time to learn the game. But if you keep playing it and become decent with your character, you will definetly have fun with this game. The combos aren't big like in MVC3, but needs precise timing, so not all of them are easy to learn.I recommend playing it with arcadestick or controller. Keyboard works too, but with a standard keyboard a few Ultras are hard to use and you can't use advanced techniques like ""P-linking"". Just don't use a 360 controller and if you want to play online, you should look that the connection is fine.			",126,10,0,21,10,0,6

												Street Fighter is Street Fighter, since I was only seven I'm addicted to it... There's nothing on this game I can complain about, specially now that the game doesn't needs the LIVE anymore! I simply love SF games, from NES to new generation ones, from Hadoken to Tatsumaki Sempu Kyaku, from Ryu and Ken to Rose and Chun-Li... and with this version, things are not different! Highly recommended, worth every coin spent on it!Can't wait to play Ultra...Shooooooryuuken!!!			",1621,654,91,239,228,21,333

												I'm a long time Street Fighter fan and started playing the game on the Super Nintendo when I was a little child around 11 years of age.The game came as a package with the console and I was drooling over the cartridge's cover which looked so much cooler than the other variant sporting the Super Mario World cartridge, so I was making up stuff about what this game would be going to be like and who this Hulk-esque looking beast was.My imagination was wrong, because even the imagination of a 11-year old boy could not fathom the awesomeness that was Street Fighter II: The World Warrior.In Germany where I come from, there sadly was never an arcade culture, since our law sees every machine you throw money into as gambling and that is strictly prohibited to minors.That still did not stop me to visit my friends and play the game with them, competing with each other and dreaming about how cool it would be if you could play with people from around world and visit tournaments and stuff.Sooner or later my friends quit playing the game, either out of disinterest or because they felt it was too much effort to try keeping up with me.Now I'm coming closer to the point I am trying to make.See fighting games are pretty much worthless as single player experiences. You simply NEED to play these games with human competition, no matter how well-crafted the single player experience may be, in the end everything boils down to multiplayer.When SFIV was finally released I first chose to ignore it, since I did not own a console at that time, but the thought that you could finally play this amazing game against other people from around the world was intriguing to say the least.Couple of years later I saw the game in a Steam Sale and picked it up, had tons of fun with it, even though the Games For Windows Live-Online was garbage by my standards (I come from playing DotA, Blizzard titles and Dota 2, so my online standards are pretty damn high), it did the job good enough for me to keep playing and stay interested.Now it has been 3 month since Super Street Fighter 4: AE2012 was ported to Steamworks and it completely broke online play for a lot of people. I personally have to set my computer to DMZ in my router in order to be able to play the game properly and it still lags horribly at least once a match, the menus start lagging as well and it's generally a pain in the butt playing the game.When Ultra Street Fighter 4 hit the stores, I thought Capcom had been working on fixing these problem for the past couple of month and are now ready to patch it along with the upgrade.Plot Twist:Turns out they did not do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ despite their forum posts saying they were aware of the problem and working on it, they did not do anything and even had the nerve to post the same stuff that they already did with the AE transition, which was ""We are aware of the problem and we are going to fix it"".I will try to come to an end here in my clumsy try to make a game review.Bottom line for me is that if you are not living in Arcade America/Japan and you do not know anyone around you who regularly plays Ultra Street Fighter 4, then do not bother with this game since Capcom does not give a single fart about you and chances are that you will not be able to play this game with anyone else but yourself.The game itself is well-designed maybe a bit buggy overall but it is a good entry to the Street Fighter series and tons of fun, ultimately I decide against recommending this game, since the online multiplayer is a major selling point, not only for me but for most people, and since it does not work like intended, I will refrain from telling anyone to buy it.UPDATE:As of the 03.30.2015, this game is actually playable online, to the same extend that GFWL was and XBox Live is.Go ahead and buy it, if you're looking for a rather defensive but well-made Street Fighter game.The game has its downsides of course, but it's still Street Fighter and a lot of fun to play.

												My first fighter type game bought and I'm in a love hate relashionship with it. Firstly the game is very difficult it needs precision and being Korean helps (and Japanese), and because of the needed precision lag kills your hole online experience. In 1 out of 3 game you will get a laggy mess, but if your lucky you will hate it. Why you may, ask because its been a long time since its release and only pros are left playing the game, so prepare for a lot of assloppin. But with the free weeks and sales some new players joined (me) but its still super rare for me atleast to find a fair match.The game preforms well enough outside the online lag. You got some challenges plus arcade mode and you can unlock icons and titles that you can put on your online accountI do Recommend the game but be warned its has issues some just because of its age			",61,4,0,6,2,1,3

												Street Fighter IV is the sole reason why fighting games made a comeback when they were at the edge of fading away. If you ask anyone who takes fighting games seriously this game is incredibly important and obviously has a huge following. Its greatest strengths come in finding a way to reintroduce characters from previous games in a setting that dosent screw the story up as bad as SF3 did and at the same time maintain a presentation that has become iconic since its initial release. This game has had WAY too many re-releases in forms of newer versions that that includes the most recent update ""ULTRA Street Fighter IV"" coming out early next year, but obviously if this game has been going strong for THIS LONG, it must be doing something right. Now, from my own personal opinion, i think a good number of the ""new"" characters they tried to introduce alongside the classic roster dont really have the same magic as the classics, especially El fuerte and Rufus, but that might just be me. Either way, this game is worth the time and money if you intend on buckling down and seriously practicing and playing as much online and local competition as possible. The online is good, netcode is far better than most PC fighters we get with the exception of GGPO netcode games. I suppose in a way, this game is great for both beginners who get exposure to many of the best classic characters without having to play the older games and its worthy of getting the attention of seasoned veterans. If you look at SFIV's track record, you can argue, but you wont get far. 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recmmend this game, just not for Steam. The reasons? since GFWL was removed from SSFIV the game has no longer worked properly for lot's of people (myself included) due to the netcode. This messed with the fps (even in single player) because of a massive memory leak which was fixed by the community and not Capcom. The second problem with SSFIV was the online matchmaking was just a massive lag-fest again because of the bad netcode. How did Capcom respond to fixing SSFIV? They decided to just release the USFIV DLC knowing about all the problems that were present with SSFIV. So basically the one thing most people complained about (GFWL) was actually the only thing saving this game from a disaster. Capcom has a bad habit of releasing a broken game then letting the community know ""We are aware of the situation"" without actually fixing anything, then abandoning the game to focus on money grabbing from their next game (DR3 is also a broken mess).

												The PC version of this game is broken.  Capcom really dropped the ball with this release. Matches (both online and offline) are riddled with slow down or lag which kills all momentum and flow within the game.  Until Capcom fixes this game, stay very far away.			",22,1,0,5,0,1,1

												This game plays like TOTAL @$$. The online has been destroyed by Steamworks and is almost entirely unplayable. The bars used to let you know your connection to your opponent are useless. Ive had numerous matches that showed full bars but were full of latency issues causing huge frame drops and inputs to come out late or not at all. This is disappointing since the GWL was a lot more balanced. But Capcom made the game so I can't blame it all on steam, especially since even the offline seems to suffer from stability issues. Was such a waste of money to upgrade. I'd rather have spent the money on a decent indy game. But alas Crapcom did it again. They tricked me into buying rehashed garbage put into a shiny new package that barely runs. I've heard the Xbox 360 version is the more stable one but even it has its problems. It may be better to avoid this game altogether.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Super Street Fighter IV does an amazing job of serving lapsed Street Fighter players who remember the days of jump hard kick into sweep combos and fireball wars while providing enough breadth and depth to entertain fighting game veterans.I fell into the former category until this game drew me in; it reinvigorated the genre for me and, alongside countless others, I tried to learn the genre ""properly"" for the first time. 3000+ hours later I'm still obsessed with it, playing SSFIV, reading about SSFIV, watching SSFIV matches but more than that I've also developed a greater appreciation for three decades worth of fighting games of the past.Super Street Fighter IV is excellent and terrifying and addictive and fun. A wonderful stepping-stone on your way to divorce. ",92,18,1,4,5,0,5

												Street Fighter has been the quintessential fighting game series since Street Fighter 2 and with Street Fighter 4 that title is staying put.The Street Fighter mechanics haven't changed much since SF2 but it really doesn't matter.  The game is still fun whether you're playing it for the first time since SF2 or at a much higher level.  Added modes such as the Trials, where it teaches you how to perform any characters combos, and a training mode where you can record the computer's movements and play them back are terrific tools.The game is superbly balanced and as long as you know the fundamentals, you'll have a fighting chance with any character you choose.  The fact that they brought back all 8 characters from the original SF2 with only minor differences to fight against newer, much more complex characters further proves how balanced this game really is.  The game has a whopping 39 character cast that will see 5 more additions with the next expansion set to release in relatively soon.Visually the game is still great to look at. The art style is reminiscent of old Japanese calligraphy, which they go crazy with when a character lands an Ultra attack.  Going with non-photogenic art direction makes any game’s graphics longer lasting.After 4 years Street Fighter 4 is still the most popular fighting game out there.  With its giant all-star cast, and finely tuned fight system one has to wonder if this series has anywhere else to go.  It’s nice to see Capcom experiment a little with games like Marvel vs Capcom and Street Fighter X Tekken but Street Fighter 4 is still THE fighting game.			",83,15,1,4,8,0,21

												Best of all the SF titles in my opinion. Bear in mind: being old, I'm comparing all the way back to Champions Edition. Even including the VS titles and various remakes (minus the Ex series because no one in their right mind liked them). If you like SF or just want a good fighting game, your money won't be wasted here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's just a rehatch. The new characters and stages ripped out from Street Fighter X Tekken, and a new character that is a Cammy clone. One character's theme should been Sweet Transvestite. Don't support Capcock. We want them to go out of business. If you really want some of the Capcock games, just pirate them. It's okay.

												My first fighter type game bought and I'm in a love hate relashionship with it. Firstly the game is very difficult it needs precision and being Korean helps (and Japanese), and because of the needed precision lag kills your hole online experience. In 1 out of 3 game you will get a laggy mess, but if your lucky you will hate it. Why you may, ask because its been a long time since its release and only pros are left playing the game, so prepare for a lot of assloppin. But with the free weeks and sales some new players joined (me) but its still super rare for me atleast to find a fair match.The game preforms well enough outside the online lag. You got some challenges plus arcade mode and you can unlock icons and titles that you can put on your online accountI do Recommend the game but be warned its has issues some just because of its age			",61,4,0,6,2,1,3

												SFIV is an amazing 2 player fighting game.  If you understand how to do the basics, like a fireball, dragon punch, wirlwind kick, etc, the game is almost flawless with a splash of supers and ultra combos!  I havent had as much fun with a fighting game (save Killer Instinct) as I have with this game.  It is truly awesome.That said, if you have issues performing the basic moves, you may not end up getting all that much out of the game.  For me, its hard to imagine anyone that can't do the basic moves which can be applied to pretty much every other fighter on the roster.  And there are a TON of fighters to choose from.  But not being able to do basic moves would make the game rather dull.If your into fighting games, you probably already own this game but if your new to Street Fighter and want a solid game to even just start learning, I would highly recommend this game.  There also isnt any shortage of DLC for the game, though most of it are costumes which is not needed but fun to have.			",171,27,4,20,15,1,22

												Seriously the best purchase I have ever made.   After all of this game play, it's difficult to explain how it still has an allure for me.  Most games I have one playthrough and that's it, but not with this game. I still lose quite a bit in this game, but I think that's what keeps on bringing me back, because I have gotten better over time.  It is a really deep game that requires you to anticipate the patterns of you opponent, and then execute flawless combos.  With time, the combos become natural, and you will slowly develop more skill.  Don't be afraid to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, because it will happen.  All you can do is learn from it and then come back stronger.  Amazing game.  Best Steam Purchase Ever.			",427,90,17,68,28,5,91

												One on one competition at it's finest. No teams to fall back on or get in the way. No killstreaks. No map advantage. No gear. No excuses. Super Street Fighter IV is the finest current game that the fighting game genre has to offer. With remarkably deep mechanics, great balance, and a seemingly limitless skill cieling, it's obvious why that after 4+ years, the latest iteration of Street Fighter 4 is still the most played fighting game out there these days. Button mashers beware, you'll get nowhere online against the people that play this game. You'll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked relentlessly until you learn to kick back, but earning that clutch victory against a skilled opponent is one of the most satisfying feelings in all of multiplayer gaming. For those that want a truly competitive experience, I really can't reccommend any game as highly as this. That is, as long as you're ready to rise to the challenge. It will be a very long and brutal road to becoming a good player in a game like this.			",136,17,1,11,4,0,33

												One on one competition at it's finest. No teams to fall back on or get in the way. No killstreaks. No map advantage. No gear. No excuses. Super Street Fighter IV is the finest current game that the fighting game genre has to offer. With remarkably deep mechanics, great balance, and a seemingly limitless skill cieling, it's obvious why that after 4+ years, the latest iteration of Street Fighter 4 is still the most played fighting game out there these days. Button mashers beware, you'll get nowhere online against the people that play this game. You'll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked relentlessly until you learn to kick back, but earning that clutch victory against a skilled opponent is one of the most satisfying feelings in all of multiplayer gaming. For those that want a truly competitive experience, I really can't reccommend any game as highly as this. That is, as long as you're ready to rise to the challenge. It will be a very long and brutal road to becoming a good player in a game like this.			",136,17,1,11,4,0,33

												One of the best modern fighting games out there. Don't be ignorant about the online ranked match lag. It isnt the game's fault, it's steam's. Most of the time, it's pretty decent any way. Now to the actual game.Pros:-Deep gameplay you would expect from a Street Fighter title-One of the best rosters the series has ever seen-Very ballanced game, matchups dont get any worse than 3-7, and there aren't many 3-7's-Simple enough for a beginner, complex enough for the fighting game godsCons:-The sound quality of the in-game chat is really bad-Community isnt very big (this game is played mostly by console players)Misc. Comments:-Best played on an arcade stick, but a standard game pad will suffice-Players on steam aren't as good as the players on console (For example, I would consider a player with up to 500PP ""free"" on console, but on steam, i would consider a player with up to 900PP ""free""-Patience is your greatest weapon in this game-There is a ton of input leniency (it's good and bad, depends on the situation)Hence, I would highly recomend this game to any one, even if you aren't really a fan of fighters. This one is a ton of fun. I have about 116 hours on steam, and another 200 hours on console invested into this game. I dont regret a single second of it.			",18,2,0,1,0,0,1

												Capcom has no love for PC The netcode has been broken for half a year while they focus on releasing more and more costume packs. There are a great many issues that have been well known for years like controller swap in arcade mode or having to specify what controller you're using every time you go to the character select screen in VS mode. Capcom has chosen to ignore every single issue while they put more and more resources into the sort of outfits that only a 5 year old would think is cool (swimming outfits from 100 years ago and fury outfits so the characters look like they're going to a Halloween party). Consols get all updates and DLC long before PC, and when we do finally get them they're usually broken. As of now I could not recommend anyone buy anything Capcom on PC. They treat us like a red headed step-child that's lucky to get any attention at all. Even if Capcom decided to snap out of their PC hate today it would take years before they reorganized the company in a way that made PC anything but a third wheel. If you want a good fighter for PC check out SkullGirls. Even if it's not the sort of aesthetic you prefer their developers have proven that they actually care about PC. They actually listen to what players complain about, patch the game regularly, and do not slow things down for consols. They should serve as a model for any company wanting to release fighting games on PC. I'm willing to bet Capcom will release a costume pack with all the characters in pink tutus long before they take any complaints seriously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most of us could never forget those local arcades even if we wanted to. The smoke, the loud cheesy music, and the nasty Cheetos residue that seemed to be on every joystick. Street Fighter 4 (in this case Ultra Street Fighter 4, not to be confused with the other 4 iterations) keeps this spirit alive in arguably the most classic fighting franchise in history, with fresh coats of paint and brand new systems. Being a 6 button fighter, I'd imagine you already own a PC compatible arcade stick or a different pad if you so prefer. Unless you want eternal carpal tunnel or feel the need to flex your masochistic man-boobs, avoid using the keyboard at all costs.Most reviews will say ""DON'T EVER BUY THIS GAME EVER EVER CUZ LAAAGGG :(((("" and they honestly have somewhat of a point. It's difficult to improve at such a difficult game without fighting others online - one of the most demanding online games to date that requires near perfect execution, which is damn near impossible in some of the servers you get set into during a ranked match. As long as you aren't playing on a toaster, this game will run perfectly fine for all other modes including 2 player local versus. But let's face it, at least 80% of your playtime will be in the training room against an auto-blocking Abel. Let's face it, he has the most consistent hitbox, or maybe you just hate the French. All in all, USF4 is that arcade experience we've always known and loved, but excluding those guys who don't shower and wear Etnies. What a bonus! Comes packed with great content and all them #alternateskinzzz. If Capcom can get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together with the netcode, there's absolutely no reason for a fighting game enthusiast to not pick this title up on the genetically superior platform.

												This is a very hard game to review under Steam's system of recommended versus not recommended. Even though I have it set to not recommended, I plan on continuing to play this game extensively. I also think it's a very well made game with extremely tight balance. Yes, even Dan is playable in this game (though still not great, by design).If you're a fighting game enthusiast, then odds are you already own this game. If you don't, and you really are into fighting games, then get it. I fully recommend it, just be aware that this game is much slower paced than most 2d fighters. Combos tend to be short and difficult to execute, as opposed to being long and fairly easy. Other than that, there's nothing here that should be out of the ordinary to you.For everyone else... this is not a game you can simply pick up and begin playing. The single player content is as bare bones as could be, providing a training mode, a short arcade mode, and then a series of trials for every character. I'll get to the trials in a moment.Quite simply, this game does not teach you anything. It does not delicately introduce you to its mechanics and help you learn. If you want to play this game, you must dedicate yourself to it or else you're basically throwing your money away. I've played a lot of fighting games, especially in the Soul Calibur, Smash and Marvel vs Capcom series, and this game is the single most prohibitavely difficult game to begin playing of any of them. The trials I mentioned, while they do help you learn some things about your chosen character, there's nothing in the game that teaches you about the core fundamentals of how to play it.At this point, I've spent more time practicing, studying (using online research, as again there's not much here that will teach you on its own) and learning this game than any other I've ever played. That includes things traditionally considered hard to learn, such as MOBAs like Dota 2. In fact I'd probably guess I've spent as much time with this game trying to learn it as I spent with the majority of the college classes I took when I was still in school. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. And after all that, I still lose the vast majority of the time, despite the fact I have fairly good win percentages in other fighting games. Or at the least, not as crushingly awful as my current 15ish to 120ish win:loss ratio.You're also probably going to want to buy a specialized controller for it, like a Madkatz Fightpad or an arcade stick (and good arcade sticks cost as much as some tablets, keep in mind). You can play it with a keyboard or a regular controller, and there are a small number of really good keyboard warriors, but I think it's generally accepted that these methods are harder than playing with a stick or a specialized fightpad controller.And that's really why I have to set this game as not recommended, despite the fact I love it. It's entirely unacceptable that I am currently almost 70 hours played after doing online research since the game does almost nothing to teach you anything itself, and I still barely understand what's going on. At this point I'm just continuing to play it because I'm just starting to reach the point where I don't feel completely lost and overwhelmed, but the satisfaction I get out of it is about the same as if I had just booted up my Wii U and played Smash Brothers instead, a game which is far more accessable.If you have a true commitment to learning this game, and you don't mind getting utterly crushed for an extensive amount of time and buying extra peripherals just to play it, then go ahead and get it. Also, pick Guile or Ryu for the first little while, as those characters are made to help new players learn the game while still being powerful at high skill levels. Pick Ryu if you like quarter circle characters, or Guile if you like charge characters... and if you don't know what a charge character is, look it up, because the game won't tell you. For everyone else, save your money and look elsewhere. You will just get frustrated and feel like you wasted your time.			",122,13,0,26,1,2,26

												***This review is intended for people who are newer or unfamiliar with fighters. If you're an experienced fighting game player you probably already know why you love or hate this game!***This is the gold standard for fighting games. No fighter out there is more balanced, rewards fundamentals and guesses/reads more intelligently, or has the staying power of USF4.The balance is so impressive. So often, fighting games eventually mature to the point where people have found the 2-3 most powerful characters and the rest of the cast is ignored. In USF4 there are definitely characters considered better than others, but the ""top tier"" consists of almost a dozen characters, and every single character of the 40+ in the game, even the ""low tier"" is extremely viable.This game will force you to play more solidly than a lot of other fighters. Button mashers beware - you may take a few rounds now and then but this game is designed to punish you HARD. In fact, if you're new at this, THIS GAME AND EVERYONE WHO PLAYS IT WILL KICK YOUR♥♥♥♥♥ It will stay that way for probably at least 100 hours in. And even then, the skill ceiling is practically infinite. When I bought Street Fighter 4: AE I knew nothing about fighting games. 1400 hours later I'm finally at a level where I'd consder myself ""decent"". On the way, I've discovered everything about what makes fighters an intelligent, deep, addicting, and all around amazing genre, way beyond what I had ever imagined. It's a genre that can make you feel the raw sting of defeat (where unlike in MOBAs, you only have yourself to blame) and the consequent high of a hard-won victory. There is a definite lack of in-game resources for learning, so you'll start off stuck in a trench of sorts. You'll have to spend a long time reading up online and practicing to get acclamated to the game systems, which to some may seem archaic at times (1 frame links are a common source of frustration). But if you can fight through this and make it out of this phase you'll be on a journey to discover what makes fighting games truly amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Links are near impossible to perform when everything randomly goes slo-mo. If you want to buy this to play online dont even bother until they fix the netcode.Game will even lag in singleplayer. Not fps drop but total freeze. If they fix the netcode I will change my review. This should have been fixed before release.			",270,77,3,43,29,3,41

												Ibuki had trouble playing this at first. After attempting the many character's trials, Ibuki was upset she couldn't get the timing down! Why is the execution in here so tedious to learn! Eventually, she started using easier characters like Ken, Ryu, Cody, and Cammy just to name a few. Ibuki quickly learned about tier lists, frame data, and what the heck 4F means! After spending enough hours in training mode, Ibuki was now ready to go online with all the work she did on practicing the many set-ups and match-ups each character had. Unfortunately, Ibuki's first ranked match was against a 7000BP Dudley as Rose no less and he wrecked the floor with Ibuki. Ibuki was letdown as it felt her whole time was waste, however she rewatched the match and noticed that she was too rushdown heavy with a non rushdown character. The rest is repeated but Ibuki can now fully understand how fighting games work after this experience. You adapt to the situation your in and the better you get at apdapting the better you perform!

Street fighter 4 is largely regarded as being the current centrepiece of the fighter genre, this is perhaps due to the fact that it is essentially an updated and carefully expanded version of Street Fighter 2 – the game that in many respects defined the genre. The motions and inputs required to perform moves are often daunting to players unfamiliar with fighting games and accustomed to the streamlined, immersive control schemes of today's FPS games and platformers, where pressing the 'right buttons' isn't really a factor you have to worry about. This may be in part the reason why Street fighter has a smaller (but no less passionate) following than the big MOBA, RTS and FPS games despite being such a rich and strategic game. Because to access that part of the game where you need to consider timing, reading, predicting, matchups etc you must first be able to pull off the moves and subsequent combos reliably, a process that can be a barrier to new players.But at the same time this is what makes Street fighter so great. The controller motions and inputs and the special attacks they yield have a sense of logic to them. 'Shoto' characters launch most of their special moves by timing an attack at the end of a quarter circle movement with the joystick. 'Charge' characters achieve their special moves by momentarily holding the joystick in one direction and then pressing an attack as they move it in the opposite. Grappling characters launch devastating throws and slams by doing entire loops with the joystick just before they attack, and Special and Ultra moves are done by pulling off really quick 'double movements' and by pressing down three buttons at once. The inputs for moves don't feel like arbitrary sequences or codes but rather appropriate movements. This sort of gameplay, which has it's roots in the video game Arcade, has a genuinely tactile quality to it that lends itself to representing fighting and martial arts.On top of that Street Fighter boasts some of the most iconic video game characters of all time who are conceptually inseparable from their signature special moves. In summary, Street Fighter is to many, including myself, the definitive 2D fighting game franchise and Street fighter 4 ULTRA with it's insane roster of 44 distinct playable characters is the best version to date.

												Disclaimer: I'm awful at this game, thus I spend a lot of time angry at it.But I think the reason I dislike it is some ratio of that, the fact that the game just feels clunky, stiff and robotic, and that the AI cheats. Hard to pinpoint what ratio that really is.The presentation is alright. The 3D models animate pretty well and all, but eh, 2D was better and had much more personality. I wish everybody didn't yell so many quips in mid-combat. Voice acting mainly ranges from unremarkable to bad, with a few exceptions. Music is decent across the board and actually sometimes pretty excellent.Upgrading from Super to Ultra earns you five new (read: mostly rehashed from SFxTK) characters and a handful of new (read: mostly rehashed from SFxTK) stages. Also probably some rebalancing or whatever that most players will never notice. I gotta admit I really like Rolento though. And I do appreciate the sheer volume of characters.I...ugh. This game just went so far backwards from SF3 and SFA3. Seems like every action in the game imposes a quarter-second or more delay on anything else you do. I mean I don't -hate- it, but gameplay never seems satisfying to me, always leaves me feeling like I just spent an hour arguing with something. I'd be willing to overlook most everything else except that the AI uses that patented ""read your button inputs and always respond with the one perfect thing you are mathematically not prepared for"" style which is pretty much one of my least favorite things on earth. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becomes a matter of outsmarting/tricking a computer instead of playing the game. Yes, I know, play with humans instead. If you've got friends to play with, sure, but I don't have the mental fortitude these days to put up with randoms.I guess I'll refrain from plugging a specific other franchise this time, but SF has really fallen behind all the other mainstream fighting franchises with this one, while others have hit astonishing new strides. I mean, it does feel like Street Fighter, that's for sure. Like SF2 but slower and clumsier. I don't want to call it bad, but I don't really have fun with it, and that should be what matters here -- I can't personally recommend it to most people.			",209,15,8,13,11,3,29

												Don't waste your money into this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is supposed to be a ""better"" version of the game, but CAPCOM got the idea : Let's ♥♥♥♥ this up, they did! The controls are horrible (I play with a good joystick), the AI is rampant, you can be playing on very easy, all of a sudden, it gets harder as ♥♥♥♥, this isn't an ejoyable game and if I could, I would ask for a refund, won't be an idiot and buy another capcom game, they are all for the $$$ while making 63547563432454 versions of the same game,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",445,106,12,34,43,4,41

												I could tell you this is an excellent game, if it wasn't for the horrible network experience quality. If you expect to play this game online competitively you will be dissapointed.Edit: Also, the game is constantly disconnecting me from Steam, like I have to reboot my pc to connect again. It would be good if the devs took they finder out of their asses and fixed their game, it's a real shame, I want my money back.			",66,5,20,1,1,0,2

												It's a nice game, but there are three things might be improved, firstly, if you are a new player for Street fighter, it may not suitable for you, especially for Online mode, that means the system of this game is a little bit hard to move stept by stept. Secondly, If you are looking for a big change compare with the previous game of Street Fighter, It may not that much surprise you. Thirdly, The story mood is boring comparie with the other fightting game such as ""Naruto"" ""Tekken"" and ""Died or alive""			",13,1,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this yet! Capcom still has to fix the online lag, there are no new game modes and no new trials. Advertising ♥♥♥♥ that isn't in the game, is illegal in some countries but Capcom just doesn't care.Not in the game: http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/feb/17/characters-will-get-new-trials-and-challenges-ultra-street-fighter-4-combofiend-feels-will-be-definitive-version-sf4/Seriously, I will never buy another capcom game. Sayonara Phoenix Wright.Update 16/11/2014Still laggy as hell, months after release. How is this still on steam?!Update 15/12/2014New trials, wow, that was fast. Online mode still unplayable.Update 09/06/15Online is fixed for some or maybe even most people. For me, the lag is still an issue. Most of the time I can't even play people who don't live too far away. SF4 is and always will be, a great game but buying the PC version is a gamble. I still can't recommend the PC version.

												It's Street Fighter, of course it's a cool game. It looks pretty slick, and the controls respond quite well too.It's no good online tho, but meh, I hardly play online anyway.

Posted: January 18, 2014
												TL;DR - Very little content, and multiplayer is too hard. Avoid, unless you like salty Spam n' cheese.(Updated for Ultra)1) GFWL  - Support for online play through Games for Windows Live expired July 2014?Update: Online play has been transfered over to Steamworks. Capcom made statements implying that AE (Steam) players would be able to play against Ultra players. However, I have been unable to confirm this. Servers for GfWL are supposedly still active. So, if you did not transfer your game to Steam, have recently purchased AE via Amazon, or still have your old ""CD key""... you can still play on GfWL... supposedly. I have not been able to confirm this either.2) Trial / Challenge Mode - A number of factors make this mode impossibly difficult. This mode asks you to perform a specific set of moves/attacks in a sequence. However, there is no explanation and no demonstration. Believe me, it sounds easy to do these sequences, but they are anything but that. The game will ask you to hit your opponent with say, 2 light kicks in a row. You won't be able to do it! It makes no logical sense whatsoever!  - I'm told these are ""links"". I'm told that with patience and experimentation, you can eventually learn them. I found that you must have perfect timing, spacing and execution. A fraction of a second off, and you fail. The average player will NEVER clear all trials for one(any) character. (Even if you use a guide!) The worst part is that the ""dummy"" character will block semi-randomly. This means that even if you are good at performing the links, you still risk failure.3) Online Play - The game's matchmaking system is just horrible. It's gotten even worse since the beta patch. The game ranks you in a number of different ways. The game is supposed to use this to find similar opponents. I, for example, have roughly 500 Player Points(PP). When I attempt to find opponents using the ""same skill"" setting, it gives me players with 3000+ PP. It isn't even remotely close to fair. This, and other factors, make online play is exceedingly difficult.4) It Doesn't Matter How Much Time You Play - The level of competition in this game is too high. My win percentage, after nearly TWO YEARS of serious effort, is around 35%. I've put over 700 hours into this game. (More than shown here, I know. I played on a friend's Xbox before I owned this version. Also, Steam didn't record hours played in offline mode.) I've spent nearly as much time researching in an effort to get better. Nothing has worked-out. Ultimately, I gave up on being good. Improving in the game feels more like work than entertainment. - The sad part is that I'm actually pretty good at the game. It just doesn't matter because my average opponent is still x10 better. I've wasted a lot of time on this game. Don't make the same mistake! Abandon all hope if you play USF4 online.5) Online PLAYERS - The vast majority of people you'll run into online are jerks. There is a lot of trash talk. There is a lot of rage. (Not surprising really.) It is so bad, I had to mute voice chat. The better players will stomp you, and then play around. They won't even fight you. They'll just run away as long as they have the advantage. If you try to give up, most players won't accept it. They'll hit you a few times, and then taunt until time runs out. Alternately, they send a trollish message like, ""whats wrong ;D"". - The kind of person that plays this game... you don't want to know that kind of person. Here's a quote from ""The Fighting Game Primer"" which can be found at the popular shoryuken website: ""Your job is to take the tools the designers have given you - characters with moves - and turn the game into a sheer mess of broken parts that no one ever wants to play again."" This ideal has been widely adopted by online players. It is a very good reason to avoid this game. Being locked into place, unable to move because your opponent's attacks never end? That's not fun. - The Fighting Game Community(FGC) are made up of the most elitist people you will ever encounter. They like to say, ""nothing is cheap"". Yet these same people complain when someone is ""random"" or ""lame"" or ""spammy"". Their gameplay is highly respectable, yours is lame. See?6) Arcade Mode - The best part of this mode is the arcade experience. By that, I refer to the ""Battle Request"" feature. This allows online players to challenge you whilst you play Arcade Mode. (Just like at a real arcade!) Aside from that, it's bad news. Even on ""medium"" CPU opponents can be unbelievably difficult. (Blocking everything and countering/punishing with ultra/super!) - A.I. has improved considerably in Ultra. It now fights much like a typical online warrior. Which means it will cheese you to death. It will find a move you have trouble dealing with, and it will spam it. If you have trouble teching throws, it'll throw you at every opportunity. If there's a specific special move that keeps hitting you, it'll use that move frequently. This is both good AND bad. For one thing, it's really annoying. (It's nice to just fight a dumb A.I. sometimes.) On the other hand, it better prepares players for online play. Anything that can do *that*, is a BIG plus. The A.I. will also block/avoid/punish a lot of things that previously, it would ignore. (Like Ultras. Instead of just eating them. Although it still does that occassionally.) - Seth still too strong. It must be hard to balance a character with all the greatest moves the game has to offer! Still... more than a little ridiculous that everything he does is un-punishable.7) Ultra Combos - Ultra combos are like super moves, only more potent. Ultras are represented by a meter separate from your super meter. The ultra meter is charged as you take damage. The idea is that this gives you a big attack with which to make a comeback. Unfortunately, most characters make it VERY obvious that they are going to utilize their Ultra. As a result, most Ultras are very easy to block or evade entirely. Even worse, your character will just stand there helplessly for several seconds afterward. So, performing your Ultra could lose you the match. - It is possible to make your Ultra part of a bigger combo. However, this almost always requires a difficult timing that demands precise execution. (Which can be ruined by marginal lag.) It's just another tool for the good players to beat you. So much for a comeback!8) Old-School Experts - Many of Street Fighter's biggest fans (and pros) have joined Capcom over the years. As a result, SF4 is ""By pros, for pros."" If EVO is any indication, they like SF just the way it is. Many pros acknowledge the game is quite difficult to get into, but they have no idea. If you developed your skills back during the days of S-Turbo, then you don't know what it is like to start these days. A lot of what you have learned has become something you just assume, or take for granted. I'm being asked to learn, before I can EVER hope to win, TWENTY-FIVE YEARS worth of tactics and strategies.I gave up on this one. I only play to remind myself why I quit! I can't recommend it to anyone. Even if you have LOADS of free time to sink into the game. After two years of effort, I'm ready to say it's just not possible to get into this genre. You have to have natural talent. You simply CANNOT train to be good at this game.Don't believe me? Have fun losing. Because, if you are not god-like-perfect at fighting games, losing is the only possibility when you play Street Fighter IV online. If you hear that this game is great for casual play, please know this is a lie. This is not a game for casual or even average players. This game is for fighting game PROS ONLY. Anyone else will waste their money and time. (Like me.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to get into fighting games, this is where you should start. This is the latest iteration of the SSFIV franchise and includes the Ver.2012 patch which is the latest patch to be released. Ultra SFIV will be released in 2014, but you can still purchase this and get the upgrade for $15. Either way, this is a great introduction into fighting games. Baby's first fighting game basically. Easier controls, parry system is replaced by ex focus which absorbs the attacks but if you get hit afterward you will take the damage + w/e you absorbed.

												I bought this game because I wanted to reminisce on my youth when I used to play SF2 in the arcade (where you actually have to put $1 or $2 to play). I have to say, wow! Even though I am very rusty and mainly button mashing at the moment, I am having alot of fun. This game is very easy to learn but very hard to master and after 50 minutes only my left thumb already have a blister and feeling sore. I am so happy I bought this game and it would be one of the games I come home to after a long day of work and just chillout on. Highly recommended.			",13,8,0,3,0,0,0

												Being an old school Street Fighter fan, and I still have and play Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo (SNES), I thought I would give this new Street Fighter a shot. Today I learned that the SNES controller is much better at Street Fighter  games than my Logitech 310. I crouch hitting my left trigger just to watch my fighter looking at the other fighter without doing a sweep or anything. The control on USF4 is horrible (compared to SSF2T on SNES). I play sports games like FIFA and NBA 2k without any trouble but this game seems to not work unless you button smash. v,>,punch does two moves  and never the actual v,>,punch move when you need it. The game also seems to not realize that you missed a flying kick or punch you cant go striaght into a move while still in the air after a miss but I guess logic has no place in this game.Went to my friends house to pick up his arcade control and this game is amazing. You need the arcade style control to play it which is sad because as a young child I use to play with a gamepad and that's the only reason why I got this game. For Street Fighter fans I would say get it on sale. For someone just getting into Street Fighter I would totally tell you to get this game. I will try to get another gamepad to see if it makes the game better but I doubt it.tl;dr game sucks with a gamepad but is awesome with arcade control 8/10			",888,292,31,102,107,12,133

I really have no gripes with this game other than the frustration brought forth from trial mode and some of the design choices for the alternate costumes-neither which will hamper your gameplay experience.

												The best fighting game to date. - Huge cast, including classic SF II chars like Guile and Bipson, new chars like Juri and Gouken, even Final Fight chars were added, like Cody and Poison.- The core gameplay is still very similar to SF II, with a more slow game pace focused on zoning, anti-air and short combos.- The new mechanics, like the focus attack and the ultras add more depth to the fight, make the game very technical on a high level.The only problem I can think of is that some game mechanics like the focus cancel were made thinking in an arcade stick, you wont be able to pull it off on a pad or keyboard, so I would say that an arcade stick is recommend to play the game on a high level.I rate it as: 5/5			",137,13,0,25,3,1,6

												Made by fans for fans.If you are new to the series, then this is a must buy.If you've played the old versions of the game, then you have already bought Ultra.If you're thinking ""this is a new version of an old game"", then you probably haven't played SF4 ever and you're just an internet troll .The definitive version of the game. There really isn't any competition when it comes to deep, involved fighting mechanics. You aren't drowned in a quandary of different systems and minutia. Everything simply works.The balance is also razor thin. The worst characters (when looking at a 10 point match up tier list) are only 20% below the best. The same can't be said for pretty much any fighting game aside from SF2. Using MVC3 as an example, the best character is actually close to 250% better than the worst (on a match up based tier list).You also don't have to sit there and watch the other person play while your character is endlessly juggled for half the match. Combos are there but they are swift and succinct. No more 15-20 second long combos of MVC3 and King of Fighters 13.The character variety is amazing. The inputs are tight and responsive while also demanding that you learn your character. There is no dial-a-combo system, so mistakes are still risky but not as risky as Street Fighter X Tekken where stray jabs lead to full out dial-a-combos.If you are new to fighting games this is absolutely, positively a 10. If you have the older versions of Street Fighter 4 then this is a 9, seeing as how you've tread this ground before.			",4,1,0,1,0,0,1

For newer players this will start out as a rough journey you will go thru growing pains with it i only played 4 hrs im starting to improve a little.  You will need to put time into this to get better at if you are new to it.  I try useing controller and doing a ultra move couldnt do it try with the keyboard took a while but eventually pulled it off.  So if you dont mind putting in the time to get better get it you will definitely get more out of it then what you paid for by the time you get the hang of it.  and it looks beautiful as well			",75,10,5,8,20,3,7

												As far as fighters go this is the cornerstone. I feel that no fighter collection would be complete without this one. In my personal opinion I'm not the biggest fan of fighters but this one catches my attention. I've always kinda sucked at fighters but this one was easy to learn because of its great range in characters. Some characters are very simple for beginners and get gradually more complicated as you rise in skill level. That being said there are very few to no characters that i would say are ""op"" or ""cheap"" and none of which are unbeatable given your own skill level when facing them. The networking isn't the best as we all know, but I can't say that it's been horrid for me when playing with people in my area or others that share the same connection. I've used almost any controller you can think of from consoles to fight sticks and havent had any issues. Taking everything into account, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get into fighters.			",39,2,6,8,8,0,3

												This game is good, but it comes with a few conditions:If you have shaky internet, don't expect a good online experience.  It won't even come close to acceptable.Use forced Vsync via your graphics card (NOT IN-GAME VSYNC).  For whatever crazy and nonsensical reason, this game runs better online with it slammed at 60 fps via Vsync and not just because you have the in-game option set to ""fixed"".  Also, you'll want to mess around with your Vsync options to test for input lag.  For me, I use adaptive Vsync because the game is generally good at staying at a constant framerate on my setup, so this produces the best in both online environments and in terms of input lag for me.  Regular Vsync and triple buffered Vsync cause a noticable delay on my rig.  For others it is different and it really just depends, but using Vsync in some manner should be aimed for.The game is standard SFIV fair: easy to understand, hard to master.  This game is both deceptively accessible and not accessible.  Be warned, you will have the urge to practice.  And if you don't, well time to move on I guess.			",65,7,1,7,0,1,2

												I am a beginner in SF4 but have quite a few hours of SF2HDR under my belt. So far the things that make this game are the matchmaking, training modes and that there are quite a lot of people playing online.Any online competitive game that has a decent ranking matchmaking system that is customisable for skill and ping is immediately going to get people playing. And SF4 does it very well. The only complaint I have is that there isn't more of an emphasis on a skill-per-character rank. It is already implemented in SF4, but it seems to rank mostly on the global points rather than the points for a particular character. Over all though, this is nearly as good as Star Craft 2. And in someways, actually better.Being able to be waiting for an online game while being in the single player game is awesome too!The downsides are mostly related to my gameplay tastes. I love games that are easy to play and hard to master. SF2HDR is pretty good for this. Unfortunately, SF4 brings back an execution barrier to entry which I don't enjoy. I much prefer the decision making based on spacing, zoning, yomi, etc rather than mostly to do with if I can actually carry out a set of moves.So what would I give USF4? A big thumbs up for online play and fun and a big thumbs down for lacking the courage to do things differently from historical fighting games and remove the emphasis on combos.

												Most balanced fighting game there is. If you care about tier lists you would see that tiers are pretty close to each other. Of course top tier has a small advantage but tiers shouldn't matter to people that have less than 1000 hours of playtime. There's no god tier like in some fighters. Replayability is off the roof with this franchise.Ultra Street Fighter 4 has the biggest online fighting game community so if you want to have lots of online matches I recommend this. Some people have issues with online but it works well for me as long as you stick with endless. To be honest, netplay is better than in King of Fighter XIII Steam version when you get it to work.

Wish they would patch the netcode issues though. I recommend you invest in a fightstick or at least a controller to play however. Fighting games played on a keyboard sucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The 5th iteration of Street Fighter 4 on PC, and somehow the game has taken gigantic steps backwards.The game itself, not just the netcode, still needs a major patch and at this point, I don't think we'll ever get it. For example, sometimes the MENUS lag. Yeah. Widespread frame rate and other assorted graphical issues for almost all users from the get-go, with no clear, definitive way to fix them. There are so many guides and posts for tweaks and workarounds that users can utilize on their end to make the game playable, but there are also so many issues that it becomes pretty confusing. Some fixes work for some users and have no effect for others. Whatever the Steam transition and the release of Ultra did to this game really broke it. The netcode is infamously terrible and has been covered to death. It has improved but still bad overall. Do I recommend this game? Yes and no. Yes, if you are willing to tinker with the game and your system to get it running right. USF4 can be a lot of fun. With that said, there are issues you WILL need to address if you decide to play, and there are still many issues with the online play. So keep those things in mind before you buy.I don't know if Capcom will get this game fixed. Despite the beta and patch, many problems remain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoy the amount of work Capcom puts into their Street Fighter brand. Good or bad, in the eyes of the fighting game community, Capcom is always pushing forward. This new update brings back old favorites as well as a new member to the roster, Decapre. The game's balancing, to me, is very well done and pretty fair. I strongly recommend this to anyone and everyone!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm no hardcore competitive type, so I can't speak to how that works. But I can tell you, I've enjoyed this game, both on this and the PS3 where I usually play it. Lots of people complain about lag, but that's less true than it was a few months ago. This is slow paced, and if you're like me, used to games like BlazBlu, Guilty Gear, etc, you're going to be thrown by the weird♥♥♥♥♥pacing, as the matches look less ilke dances far more like mind games. THat's not so much a knock on it, as it is a taste thing. As much fun as I have with this, it isn't my taste. But it would be unfair of me to say no to it purely on the grounds it's not my preferred type, that'd be like giving a Chinese restaurant a bad review for not serving pizzas. What I can hold against it is its aesthetic. This game is ugly as a Brock Lesnar suplex. Some visual options make some slight increase in aesthetic, but not too much. I don't know what they were going for, but they missed. Bad.As far as Street Fighter's go, it's, well, clearly a late game in the series. If you aren't a Street Fighter (or other fighting game fan) go back and futz around in the earlier games a while. It'll do you some good. Hell, if you are another game fan, at least give it a shot. That's the basis that later gaems like this are based off. This game has a lot of systems to remember. I might actually say too many. Street FIghter's greatest advantage is its simplicity, and this feels more like something someone else should be making at times. For all those criticisms, it's still good. It's a well-made fighting game. The iconic cast is present, and brings in some new friends as well. It could afford to be simpler, and prettier, but for what it is, you're getting your money's worth. If you're not sure if you'd like the game, give it a try.			",89,13,2,37,24,10,39

												""Currently unplayable, dont buy. Needs some a lot of work before I can support this game, a lot of work!"" - at realease Now I change my review because the game is actually really good. Say what you want about the netcode and overall balance, but it still is the face of modern fighting games. Sure execution can be tricky and not very friendly to new players. But the depth and width of the characters are something that will help you keep playing the gameOnce you find a few character that you like and got the basic execution down, the game really opens up and becomes much less frustrating. Wish SF5 took some pointers from this game but sadly they seem to go in a different direction4/5 would get a clean 5 if the netcode was better, it wasnt a straight up port, and character balance was better!

												This is the best edition of Street Fighter 4 hands down. If you disagree, then you can switch the characters balancing to any other edition. At time of writing I prefer this game to Street Fighter 5, although both have advantages and disadvantages. This game has a lot more modes and characters than SF5. SF5 has quite an active eSports presence, has more diverse character abilities, and has better graphics. If you can pick it up on sale and have some friends to fight defiantly pick it up.

												I've played every iteration and patch of this game, minus the original arcade release (and even the beta Ultra release while in Japan), and would say this is my favorite iteration thus far. The balance is as good as it has ever been, while supporting many different playstyles. This version is a love letter to fans of SF4. Tons of content (arcade mode, trials, robust training mode) for those who shy away from playing online or with a friend, or even competitively.Having said that, some fighting game fans have a hard time enjoying this one. I would be willing to be this is in regard to mid to high level competitive play. Casual fans of fighting games will find a lot to enjoy. The other issue, as of writing this, is that the online scene has all but faded away. Ranked matches will be your only way of finding competition unless you already know a group of active online players. The player base has moved on to SF5, I suspect.Regardless of what the online scene looks like, this is one of the most solid entries in the series.  Super Turbo and 3rd Strike players would hate me for saying this, but I honestly think Ultra belongs on the same pedestal.			",217,53,1,14,5,2,14

												This game jettisons the high learning curve and time and skill investment that the various versions of SFIII required. SSF4:AE is something akin to SFII with a glossier coat and several new features, making for a well-balanced game that both novice and veteran fighters can pick up and enjoy with ease. Tons of neat characters, great music, and appealing visuals make this game one rock solid fighter.

												I am a beginner in SF4 but have quite a few hours of SF2HDR under my belt. So far the things that make this game are the matchmaking, training modes and that there are quite a lot of people playing online.Any online competitive game that has a decent ranking matchmaking system that is customisable for skill and ping is immediately going to get people playing. And SF4 does it very well. The only complaint I have is that there isn't more of an emphasis on a skill-per-character rank. It is already implemented in SF4, but it seems to rank mostly on the global points rather than the points for a particular character. Over all though, this is nearly as good as Star Craft 2. And in someways, actually better.Being able to be waiting for an online game while being in the single player game is awesome too!The downsides are mostly related to my gameplay tastes. I love games that are easy to play and hard to master. SF2HDR is pretty good for this. Unfortunately, SF4 brings back an execution barrier to entry which I don't enjoy. I much prefer the decision making based on spacing, zoning, yomi, etc rather than mostly to do with if I can actually carry out a set of moves.So what would I give USF4? A big thumbs up for online play and fun and a big thumbs down for lacking the courage to do things differently from historical fighting games and remove the emphasis on combos.

												I'm so bad at Street Fighter, but it doesn't matter because Cammy's got a booty.Looks great, is balanced, easy to pick up and play; but when you step outside of easy mode you best prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥ I just wanna spend a lot of time on this game because it's so tight, and is so fun.

												[Opening]I'm going to have to revoke my previous review for this game because I just realized I've played every Street Fighter game 'cep' 1 and Alpha 1, including the Street Fighter V beta.  And, in hindsight, I've discovered just how terrible the controls are in this game.I grew up in the arcades back in the day, playing Samurai Shodown, Street Fighter II Champion Edition, World Heroes and whatever else I could stick my quarters into.  I've always known fighting games to have tight controls, and while I haven't always played them competitively (as much as I would've loved to), this game does not have tight controls.  Lemme tell you what you can expect to see a lot of in this game.[The Cons]First off is negative edge.  Negative edge is present in all fighting games.  When you press a normal attack button, then cancel it into a special move, occasionally fighting games will take the previous button press and apply it to your next movement.  This usually happens if you take too long to release the first button you press in this sequence.  In Street Fighter IV, you can expect to see this happen a lot.The next one is something I honestly don't know if there's a name for yet.  People who play this game will burn meter if for no other reason than to prevent the use of a super move.  They do this because sometimes, when you do a special move with a similar motion to your character's super move, the game will automatically cancel your previous special move into a super move, even if you only pushed the button once.One frame links (and two frame links, etc.).  Just one frame links.  This is the only fighting game that has them.  For the uninitiated, a one frame link is when you press one normal attack button, then press another one at ONE VERY SPECIFIC frame of animation from the previous attack.  One frame at sixty frames a second.  Doing this is insanely difficult, ESPECIALLY ONLINE, and takes more patience and practice than anything I've ever had to do and I've been playing fighting games for over twenty years.  I just keep my combos simple.The input leniancy.  This is the game's worst offender.  You will get misinputs for days on account of how the game ""guesses"" when you do any complex motion.  It even lead to a glitch (or ""feature"") called priority linking, or plinking, in which you press two buttons of the same type.  Say you want a medium kick to come out at the speed of a light kick.  What you do is press both buttons and the game will always give you the attack of the stronger button, but it gives it the priority of the lesser button pressed.  This makes combos easier, but this input leniancy applies to every button pressed.  When the game handles directional inputs...honestly, I don't know.  I haven't really figured out how it handles those at all.  There's been too many times I just don't know how I got the input I got.And before any of you scrubs who never played a Street Fighter game before come running to defend it saying ""You just can't do these moves/combos 'cuz you suck,"" remember.  I've been playing fighting games for over 20 years.  I've put way more practice into Street Fighter as a franchise than any of you.  That being said, however, I'll list some pros, now that I've got all the cons out of the way.[The Pros]It's got a great cast of characters from all the Street Fighter games and some new ones.It looks great.The PC version has easily the best netcode.  You'll still get some lag (and laggers), but netcode doesn't fix people's bad connections, it just makes the game flow a little better.  And it does flow well.  When it wants to.Being the most popular fighting game currently on the market, you'll never have trouble finding people to fight.  Online is always crowded, no matter which platform you play it on.  It saddens me that I can't blame the netcode for some of the BS that happens in this game.Ranked mode's scoring and ranking is based off the same as professional chess tournaments.  You get points when you beat somebody, lose 'em when you lose and those points determine your rank.  PP (Player Points) applies to your rank as a player and BP (Battle Points) refers to your rank with your current character.[Closing]Play 3rd Strike on home consoles or wait for Street Fighter V.  If you haven't played this game yet, you're not missing anything.			",139,46,4,19,6,2,7

												Those new to fighting games will have a rough start but when the work is put in, it becomes a very engaging and rewarding compeditive experience. Lots of characters with different play styles. All around the best fighting game I've ever played.Some (percieved) cons:-no ""natural"" combos. hope you like training mode. I happen to like this about the game.-netcode is meh (this one is just a con, seriously, it needs to be fixed)-those that get put on tilt or frusterated easily and salt-prone. you may have a bad time. You will lose. A lot. Circle of life.If you put in the time, and love the game, it is definately rewarding.			",148,11,1,11,6,1,15

												I would reccomend this game to anyone for 2 reasons. One is a more opinionated reason because I feel like this game takes  actual skill for playing the game and skill for learning how to correctly input commands (Like quarter circle back then punch or 270 degree foward circle then kick); if you cannot do that or know that you mess up inputs constantly, you are basically shooting your own foot. The second reason is the online - at this moment in time that I write this very short review about the game - is amazing since the game moved from GFWL to Steamworks; you are basically only left with playing with friends from the same country and single player modes which is great!My opinion this game is worth it if you are looking for a more multiplayer, boost your own skills game at it's current online state. But if you wanna mess with friends or mess offline then it is okay if it goes on sale.I believe people will have less fun playing a game like Tekken, seeing as skill is required less on the game itself and not just learning how to flawlessly input commands which every character shares and has to follow (except for charge characters).But yes, that is my opinion, and long term Street Fighter fans will find this a load of sense, but if you are a diehard Street Fighter fan; why are you reading this in the first place?(maybe because you are so awesome)?

												""Currently unplayable, dont buy. Needs some a lot of work before I can support this game, a lot of work!"" - at realease Now I change my review because the game is actually really good. Say what you want about the netcode and overall balance, but it still is the face of modern fighting games. Sure execution can be tricky and not very friendly to new players. But the depth and width of the characters are something that will help you keep playing the gameOnce you find a few character that you like and got the basic execution down, the game really opens up and becomes much less frustrating. Wish SF5 took some pointers from this game but sadly they seem to go in a different direction4/5 would get a clean 5 if the netcode was better, it wasnt a straight up port, and character balance was better!

												SF4 is easily the best fighting game to come out in the past... I dunno, 10 years.  This is the game you basically need to play if you're into fighting games at all, imo.  It's a bit slower paced, yes.  But the roster is huge and varied, there's a character here for just about everyone's style.  The presentation can't be topped, I can't overemphasize how HYPE that♥♥♥♥♥♥gets.  SF4's neutral game is mostly about footsies and space control, in a really intense and understated way that not a lot of other fighting games can touch.  It's all about fundamentals, here.  You can learn your combos, sure.  You can spend time in training mode; absolutely, you should.  But the mindgames in SF4 are so crazy.  You don't have to be an input master to do well.It also just so happens to be incredibly well balanced, especially considering how many characters there are.  It's got a pretty damn good online system, and you can watch other people's replays.  What more could you ask for?As of the release of Ultra, there's quite a few new characters to screw around with, including some SF3 characters.  Most of them are pretty cool I guess?  None of them can replace my main, though.  NOW, FACE THE MIGHTY BISON.			",120,10,1,16,9,0,15

												I am a beginner in SF4 but have quite a few hours of SF2HDR under my belt. So far the things that make this game are the matchmaking, training modes and that there are quite a lot of people playing online.Any online competitive game that has a decent ranking matchmaking system that is customisable for skill and ping is immediately going to get people playing. And SF4 does it very well. The only complaint I have is that there isn't more of an emphasis on a skill-per-character rank. It is already implemented in SF4, but it seems to rank mostly on the global points rather than the points for a particular character. Over all though, this is nearly as good as Star Craft 2. And in someways, actually better.Being able to be waiting for an online game while being in the single player game is awesome too!The downsides are mostly related to my gameplay tastes. I love games that are easy to play and hard to master. SF2HDR is pretty good for this. Unfortunately, SF4 brings back an execution barrier to entry which I don't enjoy. I much prefer the decision making based on spacing, zoning, yomi, etc rather than mostly to do with if I can actually carry out a set of moves.So what would I give USF4? A big thumbs up for online play and fun and a big thumbs down for lacking the courage to do things differently from historical fighting games and remove the emphasis on combos.

												One of the best if not the best 2d fighting game out there - easy to learn - hard to master. There are 30+ characters in game and almost all of them are very different. It is rely hard to be good at multiple characters, it takes some time to master one character. I have around 500h hours in this game and can play only 1 character at a decent level.Combos are done by 1 - 2 frame links, you need to spend some time in a training room if you want to get a hang of them. The best thing about them, is that in ""trials"" there are only few combos, all other combos you have to figure out by yourself or just look them up on youtube.There are multiple gameplay styles posibilities with same character. You can be super agresive, or rely passive or just find your own thing. You can play at prety decent level without complicated combos, but you will have to outsmart your oponent more times then.This game is all about multiplayer it runs very smoothly, without lags. Single player is ladder type gameplay with a boss at the end. There a 24 trials for each character that are rely hard, you have to feel the character well in order to complete them.

												I've played every iteration and patch of this game, minus the original arcade release (and even the beta Ultra release while in Japan), and would say this is my favorite iteration thus far. The balance is as good as it has ever been, while supporting many different playstyles. This version is a love letter to fans of SF4. Tons of content (arcade mode, trials, robust training mode) for those who shy away from playing online or with a friend, or even competitively.Having said that, some fighting game fans have a hard time enjoying this one. I would be willing to be this is in regard to mid to high level competitive play. Casual fans of fighting games will find a lot to enjoy. The other issue, as of writing this, is that the online scene has all but faded away. Ranked matches will be your only way of finding competition unless you already know a group of active online players. The player base has moved on to SF5, I suspect.Regardless of what the online scene looks like, this is one of the most solid entries in the series.  Super Turbo and 3rd Strike players would hate me for saying this, but I honestly think Ultra belongs on the same pedestal.			",217,53,1,14,5,2,14

												Do you like spending thousands of hours in training mode practicing one frame links and then going online to face yellow bar abel players who mash ultra one through everything well have I got a game for you it's called Ultra Street Fighter 4 what a great game truely the pinnacle of competition make sure you pick a top tier character though because if you don't then you'll be sure to lose to the best character in the game Elena who takes no skill whatsoever to play at the highest levels and can heal through everything Seriously though this game is fun buy it and play it			",62,1,0,3,1,1,4

												I'm no hardcore competitive type, so I can't speak to how that works. But I can tell you, I've enjoyed this game, both on this and the PS3 where I usually play it. Lots of people complain about lag, but that's less true than it was a few months ago. This is slow paced, and if you're like me, used to games like BlazBlu, Guilty Gear, etc, you're going to be thrown by the weird♥♥♥♥♥pacing, as the matches look less ilke dances far more like mind games. THat's not so much a knock on it, as it is a taste thing. As much fun as I have with this, it isn't my taste. But it would be unfair of me to say no to it purely on the grounds it's not my preferred type, that'd be like giving a Chinese restaurant a bad review for not serving pizzas. What I can hold against it is its aesthetic. This game is ugly as a Brock Lesnar suplex. Some visual options make some slight increase in aesthetic, but not too much. I don't know what they were going for, but they missed. Bad.As far as Street Fighter's go, it's, well, clearly a late game in the series. If you aren't a Street Fighter (or other fighting game fan) go back and futz around in the earlier games a while. It'll do you some good. Hell, if you are another game fan, at least give it a shot. That's the basis that later gaems like this are based off. This game has a lot of systems to remember. I might actually say too many. Street FIghter's greatest advantage is its simplicity, and this feels more like something someone else should be making at times. For all those criticisms, it's still good. It's a well-made fighting game. The iconic cast is present, and brings in some new friends as well. It could afford to be simpler, and prettier, but for what it is, you're getting your money's worth. If you're not sure if you'd like the game, give it a try.			",89,13,2,37,24,10,39

												an excellent game to introduce you to the genre, although the absolute best in-game tutorial for fighting games would be in skullgirls. this game does not have an in-game tutorial and many concepts are left for you to figure out on your own. i can't think of anything in the current state of the game that a casual player would immediately be able to identify as cheap or spammable. you must exercise fundamentals to get anywhere in this game and those skills (zoning, footsies, neutral, decision making, positioning, match-up recognition, frame data) can easily translate to other games in the genre, or all games if you're a huge nerd like me! i highly recommend learning the game with a buddy since the online player base is highly experienced and, even though you can learn from losses, you will get much more from playing with someone on a similar skill level. shoryuken.com , youtube tutorials, and watching streams of the game on twitch.tv are good ways to learn, but nothing beats playing a friend.settings wise, it is a MUST that you turn OFF vsync (having it on will introduce input lag, although i heard it is not bad if you implement it on a driver level) and set frame rate to FIXED (allows the game to always run the game at 60fps, even if that means skipping frames [essential for gameplay since it keeps timings consistent and is as the game was intended to be played]. setting this to variable or smooth will allow the game to run under 60fps and this is bad due to multiple gameplay and netcode reasons.)

												I would reccomend this game to anyone for 2 reasons. One is a more opinionated reason because I feel like this game takes  actual skill for playing the game and skill for learning how to correctly input commands (Like quarter circle back then punch or 270 degree foward circle then kick); if you cannot do that or know that you mess up inputs constantly, you are basically shooting your own foot. The second reason is the online - at this moment in time that I write this very short review about the game - is amazing since the game moved from GFWL to Steamworks; you are basically only left with playing with friends from the same country and single player modes which is great!My opinion this game is worth it if you are looking for a more multiplayer, boost your own skills game at it's current online state. But if you wanna mess with friends or mess offline then it is okay if it goes on sale.I believe people will have less fun playing a game like Tekken, seeing as skill is required less on the game itself and not just learning how to flawlessly input commands which every character shares and has to follow (except for charge characters).But yes, that is my opinion, and long term Street Fighter fans will find this a load of sense, but if you are a diehard Street Fighter fan; why are you reading this in the first place?(maybe because you are so awesome)?

												I got alot of enjoyment out of the SF IV series over the years, and I feel t-hat this is the most definitive version yet- plenty of characters to choose from, lots of different modes to play, and many more! I really have no gripes with this game other than the frustration brought forth from trial mode and some of the design choices for the alternate costumes-neither which will hamper your gameplay experience. I throughly recommend this game to longtime fans of SF and newbies alike!			",13,1,0,4,0,0,0

												This has been the best Street Fighter thus far IMO. I feel that this game requires more skill and thought processing than V. IV allowed players to be creative with their characters and the mechanics such as FADC, FA, and being able to link light attacks into Heavy attacks or medium attacks (and vice versa) gave this game life. I am aware that some attacks are like this in V, but not as much and a lot of combos start off with either st.mp or cr.mp to get everything going. I feel that V lacks the fidelity and still has a lot that needs to be worked on. Yes, IV had its problems (it still does), but guess what, V carries out some of those problems as well. But, everyone has their own opinions about both these games. I hope this review helps (or somewhat does) gamers who are trying to look for a good competitive and serious game.			",58,1,0,0,3,0,1

												""Currently unplayable, dont buy. Needs some a lot of work before I can support this game, a lot of work!"" - at realease Now I change my review because the game is actually really good. Say what you want about the netcode and overall balance, but it still is the face of modern fighting games. Sure execution can be tricky and not very friendly to new players. But the depth and width of the characters are something that will help you keep playing the gameOnce you find a few character that you like and got the basic execution down, the game really opens up and becomes much less frustrating. Wish SF5 took some pointers from this game but sadly they seem to go in a different direction4/5 would get a clean 5 if the netcode was better, it wasnt a straight up port, and character balance was better!

												Love this game, have played Street Fighter in arcades and at the local dairies and fish 'n' chip shops since I was a kid. SSFIV:AE is a very different game to those first few titles but it still evokes the same sense of awe when I play. Ultra SFIV is almost upon us and I am looking forward to the changes and the addition of a few new faces. With all that said though, this game is BRUTAL to get in to as a beginner, even all the years I have played casually never really prepared me for the depth and technical possibilities of the SFIV series. That coupled with the absolutely average connections I get to most people (even in the same area, don't even mention overseas) can mean weeks of losses and probably the most frustration I have ever exprienced in a fighting game. But still, the payoff is there - you practice, you WILL get better. I almost liken this kind of game to the guitar, hours of practice is required to train your muscles to do the things in your head without actually thinking about the inputs. Actually, ♥♥♥♥ this game - it drives me nuts. Haha.			",122,9,27,20,16,3,27

												Really great game.Just do NOT buy the cheesy, low quality, over-priced, costumes. They put Akuma in swim trunks. Sakura has texture errors big time. Ryu is dressed like a Jersey thug. Ken looks like a Cowboy, hat and all. Blanka had a snorkel and flippers. For real. I'm not kidding. Cammy even has some rediculous looking cat outfit... and that is just what comes to mind. Shame... but it does allow for hours of FUN modding skins. (in order to correct the last minute mass pile of costumes that are a serious wallet drain)The online versus is good, and the new stages are well made. The gameplay is all good, there are new ultra options and the new heroes are a nice addition.Just steer clear of those terribad skins. There are WAY better costumes modded for free on the web... Who needs a 3.99$ Blanka with flippers and snorkel when you can get a Blanka that looks like the Predator with HD textures for free???			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just amazing. The world’s greatest fighting game evolves to a whole new level with Ultra Street Fighter IV. Continuing the tradition of excellence the series is known for, five new characters and six new stages have been added for even more fighting mayhem, with rebalanced gameplay and original modes topping off this ultimate offering.

												UPDATE: This is now the previous version of the game. OLD GAME OUT OF DATE DO NOT BUY.USF4 basically works now for most of us. Thanks to Valve for fixing the game. Don't expect any patches since Capcom has moved on to Street Fighter V, and once SF5 releases this game will no longer be recommended since the vast majority of players will move to SFV and USF4 will become a ghost town. Until then, there is no reason to not get this game, especially if it's on sale.			",48,5,0,14,3,0,3

												 It's Street Fighter 2 +2 then Ultra'd. I love SFII and most of the 90s SF games. I have some resentment towards Capcom millking this series so much. People that complain about paying for DLC that should be included day one  don't remember or weren't alive for what Capcom did the the SNES/Genesis from 1992-94. Every year 4 more characters and another 70-75 bucks.  Why would we pay that. Well it made the fighting genre popular and was the best one.(don't get me wronge SNK put some  good compition) There wasn't much else either at the time. So here we are on the 4th one.   I like this here SF4 a lot. A lot more than SF3. Really it would be between this and SSF2 or Alpha 3 as the best in the series. The game play brings me back 24 years when I first tried Street Fighter 2. Everything came back to me and I got right back to what I did so well in arcades 20 something years ago. Won matches again and again. This game works so well I really don't see a need for a 5th. I mean this one didn't do much gameplay wise to the old formula. It's an update, and a good one at that.  My only issue with this game is the stages are random and don't go with characters. There are also fewer stages to characters as well. Some may say that doesn't matter, but it does. That was part of the fun to get to a characters stage. It said something about the character.  Everything else though is awesome. From the characters, to the graphics, to the controls. Everything is good, If you were a fan of the SF at all get this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have spent so much time playing this game on the Xbox 360 that my PC time seems absolutely miniscule in comparison.I must have played over 30000 matches at this point, which sounds absurd but that's a fraction of what people who are really serious about the game have played! Not to mention countless hours in training mode, completing all the trials, watching replays.Street Fighter IV is easily my favourite competitive multiplayer game of all time and certainly near the top of my favourite games period.

												Ultimate Street Fighter 4: Super DLC Edition PROS-Plenty of character variety-Lots of Modes & UnlockablesCONS-NOT for Casuals-Online Mode(s) are Laggy, Inconsistant & has cheaters-Huge difficulty curve-Sore Thumbs & Fingers-Best Played with an Arcade Controller-No Tutorial-DLC (Disk Locked Content) is Overpriced -Technical IssuesNegativesRemember when you could unlock costumes & characters by simply playing the game?  Well now you have to spend more money cause ♥♥♥♥ YOU that's why!Even though the DLC upsets me greatly & buying 3 versions of the same game also upsets me (SF4, SF4:AE, USF4)  it's still a great game & worthy of your time.  The DLC is a god awful overpriced cash grab. You might as well just wait for a sale & get all the DLC cheap.  That's what I did.  They don't add anything except costumes anyways.  Some DLC are locked as preorder bonuses & you can't get them anymore which is also just a terrible business practice that I hate very much.DLC whining aside, the game itself is good excluding the online modes.  The ranked system leaves much to be desired.  Here's how most of my games end up matched when in ranked.  Either the game puts me against an A+ rank (I'm a D rank) & I get destroyed in 10 seconds, the game puts me up against someone who either abuses some kind of lag exploit by downloading in the background or just has a crap ISP & the game is played at 5FPS, or I get put against someone who plays like an infant & I win easily.  Also, there are a ton of fireball spammers (which isn't the games fault but still is an annoyance).  Online ranked is also full of macro users.  What this means is they mod a controller to input specific commands when they just press a single button.  So, sometimes you will find players who are low ranked & somehow always manage to input pitch perfect combos that you'd only see a high ranking player be able to pull off.  AKA, Cheaters.Also, this game makes my thumbs & fingers hurt.  Like, a lot.  After about an hour or so of playing trying to beat Arcade on Hardest or just playing online trying to rank up my hands will cramp & I can't continue to play anymore afterwards.  Seriously, if you make a game that causes people pain from playing it you've done something wrong. Features The real draw here is the local multiplayer & arcade modes since there's no lag & you can set your own rules.  The most annoying part is that this game is designed with an Arcade Stick in mind.  So, unless you're planning on playing this with an expensive & sturdy arcade controller don't bother playing it seriously.  Your thumbs will thank you for this.The game also doesn't have a tutorial which is a darn shame.  There is a challenge mode which shows you some basics but ""some"" is the key word here.  It barely shows you how to do anything with zero explanation.  I have plenty of 2D fighting games at my disposal & nearly all of them have some kind of tutorial mode, so why can't a AAA game developer like Capcom hash out some extra funding to make one?  A game like this should have an in-depth tutorial for every indivitual character.  Instead you get a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥challenge mode that any average player will find impossible to complete 100%. Technical Issues The game also has issues.  A good example is turning on V-Sync or Anti-Aliasing will cause an input lag effect.  This means there will be a delay on when you press a button to when your character does what you commanded.  If you have both on the effect is very noticable.  You'll have to turn these both off if you want a decent gameplay experience.  Another problem I have frequently is when trying to throw a fireball the character will instead throw an uppercut.  This happens on several occasions & is very frequent.  That's what happens when you make a game that uses such similar button presses to seperate different moves.  This is another problem that seems the only way to fix is to go out & buy an arcade controller or some kind of controller that's better suited for fighting games, which I'm not going to do.  There are also some odd hitboxes, best example of this is Hugo.  He's the biggest character in the game, slow & lumbering grappler, but his hitbox is the same size as Ken's or Cammy's.  Some moves will just go straight through his head while he's ducking.  Not blocking, just ducking.  One of the dumbest things I've ever seen in any game ever.Combos require too much precision to pull off properly.  You also can't make your own combos in this game.  You have to figure out what combos the game will let you pull off for each character or look them up in a guide.  Also, there are a lot of tricks & such that the game itself will not tell you anything about so a guide is pretty much mandatory to be good at this game.  The biggest tactic being the dash cancel the game tells you nothing about. Overall Overall, the game itself is good but much of which is meant specifically for E-Sports & serious players only.  Casuals should probably steer clear of online modes otherwise (if you're like me) you'll just get frustrated at how poorly the game controls with a standard controller & how the online modes are just utter garbage that are full of lag spikes & people who take the game way too seriously.In short, Go Pro or Go Home.

												It's the first Street Fighter game I have played, and after saying that I didn't like traditional fighting games (besides dbz) for years, I actually quite like it. ""World's Greatest Fighting Game"" is a bit of a big stretch, I mean it's not smash melee, the actual best fighting game.Pros:+Cartoon style graphics (age well)+Online+Customisable character colours, taunts, actions+Multiple modes+Plenty of stages+Good price+Good character roster+Great cutscenes (anime and sketch style intro)+Sound design+Tutorial for moves and some basic combos (Trials/Ultra Trials)+Icons and EmblemsCons:-Doesn't teach you how to do everything you need-Some clone characters-Ranking system puts you with people much better (Only won 1/100 matches and only 5 of those people were even close to my ranking)Final Verdict:I am very impressed by this, though it's my first street fighter I'll probably try other street fighters and maybe even some other fighting games. It's not the best fighting game like it makes it out to be, but as a traditional fighting game it seems like it is up there near the top. It has the problems that all traditional fighting games do, but hey, not all fighting games can be as good8/10			",308,44,1,30,11,3,19

												Really great game.Just do NOT buy the cheesy, low quality, over-priced, costumes. They put Akuma in swim trunks. Sakura has texture errors big time. Ryu is dressed like a Jersey thug. Ken looks like a Cowboy, hat and all. Blanka had a snorkel and flippers. For real. I'm not kidding. Cammy even has some rediculous looking cat outfit... and that is just what comes to mind. Shame... but it does allow for hours of FUN modding skins. (in order to correct the last minute mass pile of costumes that are a serious wallet drain)The online versus is good, and the new stages are well made. The gameplay is all good, there are new ultra options and the new heroes are a nice addition.Just steer clear of those terribad skins. There are WAY better costumes modded for free on the web... Who needs a 3.99$ Blanka with flippers and snorkel when you can get a Blanka that looks like the Predator with HD textures for free???			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As Street Fighter V inches ever so closer, I think it's time to take a look back on the lifespan of one of the more well-known entries in the series. Initally released in 2008, Street Fighter IV has seen so many subsequent updates and rereleases, some of which admittedly feel a bit unnecessary. Nonetheless, all of these versions have ensured the core game's place in the fighting game scene, It had its ups and downs, but Street Fighter IV is still a very robust and shining example of practically everything the series has to offer.PROS-Characters from all sorts of games (The original, II, Alpha, III, and a few new ones)-The biggest roster of a Street Fighter game I know-Several alternate costumes on top of that-Easy-to-play, hard-to-master control scheme-Version select (only available in local versus(sorry, Omega mode))-Evil Ryu is waaaaaay better than regular RyuOf, course, it's not without its flaws:CONS-Character imbalance still sneaks through every once in a while-Alternate costumes are paid DLC in spearate bundles organized by character archetytpes-Arcade-Last-Boss Seth is still a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Lag can pose a greater threat than your opponent, depending on the connection-Decapre (Would this be considered petty?)Even with these flaws, Ultra Street Fighter IV is still the definitive version of the game(even if Seth Killian said that about Arcade Edition), and PC users can mod even more costumes in the game (can you say Spider-Man Fei-Long?). So, in short, I'd still recommend it. It could certainly make the time go by a little faster while waiting for Street Fighter V.			",36,1,0,1,1,1,1

												Pros- The game is a modern fighting game classic at this point in time The roster is huge. No way you won't like at least one character in this gameStages are prettyMost of the cast are viable in high level play, although some do way better than others. Game is based around footsies and spacing rather than memorizing extremely long combos (for most of the cast)Motions are simplified for new combos (Can also be considered a con)The netcode is pretty solid This game is mod friendly! Best part about it in my opinion. Music is great Cons- DLC costumes are disappointingThe game still looks decent but is graphically a little behind compared to whats to come in the future for games like SFVThe motions for moves are simplified, which seems like its pandering to noobies who probably won't get good anyways Ranked matches are not 2 out of 3's, and you can adjust the amount of rounds and the timer you want, which seems sillyMost of the cast is viable but a lot of the worst characters were already bad in previous versions (IE, Dee Jay)Overall, I think Ultra SF4 is amazing. The PC version is honestly the best version of this game and the game still holds up as one of the best fighting games to come out in recent history. It may seem pretty simple for some newer players who have experience in fighting games, but it's extremely deep. The modding community for this game is outstanding as well. 9 out of 10.

												I don't think this game needs any introducing, but I'm going to do this anyway:Ultra Street Fighter IV is the newest in the series of 2D fighting games developed by Capcom, and this series is said to be one of those that coded the genre. I had some experience with Street Fighter II, so I can compare this to some of the older games.First of all: despite the game having cell-shaded 3D graphics, it still sticks to the traditional 2D formula. You might call the graphics not incredible, but they're good enough that you can marvel at all the work in the background or character animations.The gameplay is simple yet fun. All the characters have standard punches and kicks (in the light, medium and heavy varieties), as well as crouching and jumping versions of those. They can block, throw special attacks, use Supers or EX attacks if they get the Super bar high enough, or use Ultras which are fueled by the Revenge gauge that goes up by taking damage, making this a Comeback Mechanic. There are also throws, sped up / delayed wake-ups, Focus Attacks which block damage and guard break, and the new Red Focus Attack which is considered an EX attack (burns Super bar) but can soak up multiple hits (standard Focus Attack can stop only one). This adds to the options for combat and makes for a nice guessing game. Also, this game not being very combo-oriented as other ones (such as Guilty Gear or BlazBlue), it's well-suited for general casual play, as well as high-level play where players can pull off longer combos.As of Ultra, the game has a gigantic roster of 44 fighters available to suit your playstyle, whether you like grappling characters with command grabs, mixup characters, or just want to stick to the standard Shoto Clone (Ryu, Ken etc.). Even the boss characters are more balanced towards general play, which is quite interesting.On the music side, the tunes you hear in the game mostly aren't incredibly memorable, but they're catchy enough that you won't really get tired of listening to them over and over.Overall, this game is a very solid title. Interesting and wide assortment of combat options, a lot of characters to choose from, and fantastic presentation, this game is great for both casuals and tourney-goers.			",100,18,0,17,2,2,5

												It's okay. I mean it works, especially if you're using a good controller. There doesn't seem to be any controller vibration though. If you have a decent controller (or an Xbox 360 controller with a d-pad that doesn't suck) and don't care about vibration ... and your PC has the specs, then it's a hit. Personally, I'd give this a three out of five starts, but that's not an option so I'd saying Yes.			",162,13,0,10,2,1,9

												I've been playing Street Fighter for as long as I can remember.  My earliest memory is of one of my uncles and my older brother scrubbing it up as Sagat and Dictator in SF2 Turbo for the SNES.  I've never really been an arcade rat, but I've played Street Fighter on console pretty consistently my entire life.  Being one of the few kids who got a Sega Saturn helped out with that.  Alpha 2 on Saturn is godlike.  Fighting games were godlike.  That is until 2003 or so and Capcom♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed and started putting out dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like the Harvey Birdman game and those remedial light gun editions of Resident Evil.  They were going to put out this game called Capcom Fighting Allstars, but I guess somebody was afraid of making too much money and they pussied out.   Maybe nobody over there thought fighting games were popular anymore.  I don't know.  Didn't stop them from putting out that Sengoku Basara fighting game in Japan.  Meanwhile, most of us here in the states didn't really know about King of Fighters or Guilty Gear and were relegated to playing Tekken and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D Mortal Kombats for a while.  That's alright, though, because in 2008 Street Fighter 4 came out to ignite new hope and excitement for what was becoming a niche genre.  It's too bad Capcom didn't ditch their old habit of releasing multiple versions of the same game by the time it came out.   I understand that they do it because that's the way arcade machines work.  I also understand that reactive balancing can severely frustrate the pro community.  Still, for your average Sally Lunchpail, this kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥puts a serious strain on the wallet.   If you count Arcade Edition 2012, Ultra is the fourth iteration, and the bonuses it adds are basically just flipped assets from X Tekken and a pallette swap of Cammy.  But later on, they added a mode where the characters have weird moves, so I guess everything's cool.  At least it's not like Ultra Street Fighter 2, where they're taking a defibrilator to that dead horse by just adding more shotos.I digress.  If you happen to like Street Fighter 2, you'll probably like Street Fighter 4.  It's got all the same stuff, including all of the characters and then some.  Where the older games introduced totally different casts with each roster,  Street Fighter 4 is more like the greatest hits album of fighting games.  Now with bonus tracks that no one really cares about, like Hakan and Rufus.Also, if you're a masochist, you'll probably enjoy playing this game online.  I have like 35 hours on the steam version of Ultra, but I've been playing Street Fighter IV since vanilla on console.  I've no doubt logged hundreds of hours, if not thousands.  I no lifed Arcade Edition for a while.  That's the kind of thing you do when you work a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead end job because the only academic field you're interested in is literature, and there's no real point going to college for it.  So yeah, I'd spend hours in training mode, trying to get better.  Jonesing for a win.  Even if you're a loser in life, you can be a winner in Street Fighter.  Except for me apparently.  Maybe I can't get my brain and my thumbs won't cooperate.  Maybe my background in literature left me too dumb not to fall for stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tactics.  Whatever it is, I can't seem to get a win most nights.  If you're new to the game, you won't either.  Most of the time, when you do manage to get the upper hand, the scrubby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're walloping will most often rage quit at the last minute to rob you of any progress.  That's why you have to be a masochist.  But don't go away thinking of this as a negative review.  Street Fighter 4 is a comfortable game to play, after a while.  You get used to the rhythm of matches.  The familiar characters insure that even a complete beginner will have someone simple enough to play.  (Unless your entire fighting game background is in Smash Brothers or something.  Then, you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.)  Some of the remixes of the music is pretty good.  Juri's theme is pretty good.  Poison is a pretty killer addition to the roster, and a lot of fun to play.  There are tons of modded skins out there if you're into that kind of thing.  Online, much like working a crappy fast food job for minimum wage, you won't make much progress for a long time, but at least you've rolled out of bed and done something.  TL;DR 9/10  Definite must play for fighting game fans.			",115,11,0,12,3,0,4

												It wasn't the best fighting game of its time, nor was it the best in the series. With that said, I still love this game despite all of its faults.Online is dead now, and the local scenes have pretty much dried up, but you can still get some casuals in if you know where to look. If you don't already have it, you've never played it, and you don't have friends that play it..... You might reconsider buying this, but it does have a considerable amount of offline content to validate a discount purchase when compared to SFV... Cough, cough.			",48,5,1,5,1,0,0

												As Street Fighter V inches ever so closer, I think it's time to take a look back on the lifespan of one of the more well-known entries in the series. Initally released in 2008, Street Fighter IV has seen so many subsequent updates and rereleases, some of which admittedly feel a bit unnecessary. Nonetheless, all of these versions have ensured the core game's place in the fighting game scene, It had its ups and downs, but Street Fighter IV is still a very robust and shining example of practically everything the series has to offer.PROS-Characters from all sorts of games (The original, II, Alpha, III, and a few new ones)-The biggest roster of a Street Fighter game I know-Several alternate costumes on top of that-Easy-to-play, hard-to-master control scheme-Version select (only available in local versus(sorry, Omega mode))-Evil Ryu is waaaaaay better than regular RyuOf, course, it's not without its flaws:CONS-Character imbalance still sneaks through every once in a while-Alternate costumes are paid DLC in spearate bundles organized by character archetytpes-Arcade-Last-Boss Seth is still a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Lag can pose a greater threat than your opponent, depending on the connection-Decapre (Would this be considered petty?)Even with these flaws, Ultra Street Fighter IV is still the definitive version of the game(even if Seth Killian said that about Arcade Edition), and PC users can mod even more costumes in the game (can you say Spider-Man Fei-Long?). So, in short, I'd still recommend it. It could certainly make the time go by a little faster while waiting for Street Fighter V.			",36,1,0,1,1,1,1

												This is the best edition of Street Fighter 4 hands down. If you disagree, then you can switch the characters balancing to any other edition. At time of writing I prefer this game to Street Fighter 5, although both have advantages and disadvantages. This game has a lot more modes and characters than SF5. SF5 has quite an active eSports presence, has more diverse character abilities, and has better graphics. If you can pick it up on sale and have some friends to fight defiantly pick it up.

There's just no good difficulty to play at.I'm not new to fighting games by any stretch, as I played SF2 when it first came out. This problem isn't in the Blazblue, KoF, Samurai Shodown, Darkstalkers, Rival Schools, or other high profile series I've tried... In fact, it's not even in the original Street Fighter IV. I don't know what happened with Ultra, but it's just no good for single player.			",74,16,8,3,13,2,4

												I have it since September 2014, and i can say it's a great fightning game, it have the hardest frame links and inputs you'll find on fighters for Steam and a gigantic roster + pretty good graphics (at the time, considering this is basically SFIV from 2008 with a patch for each edition) and innovative mechanics. I would love for this game to have some more DLCs, to get this game revived. If Capcom released Oro, Necro and Q for USFIV, i would buy them in an instant. My 1st fighter for my Steam account along with Skullgirls, and a lot of good and bad memories with in. After SFIII series, this is my favorite SF series, as the second best, for me. I still play it sometimes and i have a lot of fun, i used to watch USFIV tournaments daily untill 2016, great times.			",41,1,1,3,1,0,5

												This is the best edition of Street Fighter 4 hands down. If you disagree, then you can switch the characters balancing to any other edition. At time of writing I prefer this game to Street Fighter 5, although both have advantages and disadvantages. This game has a lot more modes and characters than SF5. SF5 has quite an active eSports presence, has more diverse character abilities, and has better graphics. If you can pick it up on sale and have some friends to fight defiantly pick it up.

												My daughter and I have been on a fighting game kick lately.  I recently was diagnoised with MS and over the past few months gaming and life in general has gotten harder for me due to a number of issues, one of which is lose of motor control in my right hand.  I decide to help battle this by doing my own physical therapy via gaming.  Granted it is rather humbling that my 10 year old daughter is slaughtering me in fighting games, but none the less we are having fun.  Okay this is my lead in for this and a couple other fighting games I am reviewing tonight mostly to just set the some background.Right now there are three fighters we are playing Injustice, Skullgirls and Ultra Street Fighter IV.  Each of these three have their pros and cons.  Injustice has DC characters we enjoy.  Skullgirls has unique tag teams and artwork.  USFIV has a huge list of playable characters and is very well balanced.  My daughter thrashes me bad in the game.  Yes I am man enough to admit it.  That said we are still having a good time.  I picked up the game while on sale however and can't say that for the normal price that we would like it better than Injustice or Skullgirls.  Mainly because it is a complex game and the skill level is high.  I can't speak at all to online or against AI as I have only played against her.  All in all though we have enjoyed the game.  My daughter LOVES playing as Rose.  One question, OMG what is with the women and their huge thighs?  lol.			",417,89,17,130,63,2,130

												Having played both SF IV (ps3) and USF IV (PC)  this update really delivers some much-needed upgrades to the original. There is a healthy variety of characters to suit playstyles and the movesets are the same as previous editions of the franchise. Definitely play this one with some kind of joystick instead of a Dpad or keys. Compared to when I played the original with a PS3 controller, the xbox is much more ergonomically sound. It's a solid game offline (haven't played online) and the combo timing is more forgiving  than other titles I've played in the genre. I'd say its major downside is that it feels old, because like most games that come from Capcom, this one doesn't rock the boat much. It's a great title for fans of the genre, but it probably won't win over any new faces. 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I have barely played any Ultra Street Fighter IV ever.... Well on Steam it looks that way, but I had it for Windows Live which is why my achievement list looks odd as it says I got the clear 10 trials and clear all trials with one character at the same time. I also main the game on Playstation 4 now and already had it on PS3 and Xbox 360. So I have a little experience with this game before hand.With that said I have noticed some odd things about this particular version. Like hitting an opponent with an anti-air and then getting hit by said opponent from the ground in the very next frame. All of the other frames disappeared. I have it set to run at a fixed rate as my computer can run the game way faster than necessary. So that should not have happened, but it did. The other thing I noticed is the game sometimes has button lag in this version, but not always. It is very inconsistent about that. So that is also kind of interesting to note.Other than those issues this game is fantastic. Despite how some people complain and say, ""Well I am still waiting for the Ultra Street Fighter IV Hyper Rainbow Edition"", these add-ons were actually heavily demanded by the hardcore fanbase that have supported it through each version. Very few games and especially fighting games will ever have the longevity that Street Fighter IV has had and still has now. With Street Fighter V's beta fast approaching and that game already looks like it might be the successor that one would hope for after a title like Street Fighter IV, there is no better time than now to join into a game that has such a massive community and is both good for casuals and hardcore players. I will warn you that if you are fairly new, you might want to go into challenge mode and try some of the trials to learn a few basics before getting online as experienced players might hand you a bit of a whooping, but it is deffinitly a game that will forever be remembered.Street Fighter rarely disappoints and we have seen many great titles come out of the series. Ultra Street Fighter IV is a testement to how great the series can be and it also raised the standard for fighting games which is why many others since then have had trouble as they get seen as a bit of a side note, but I have played most of those as well. I highly recommend this title for old veterans of fighting games like myself to the newest of new interested in just trying one out. Either way you are likely to have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like it.But there is a thing that makes me mad about latest street fighers... try this: Select Ken, go to training mode, move a few cms from the enemy and perform a Crounch strong kick in order to swipe the enemy. If you are in the right place, you can see that the foot of Ken hits the enemy's foot, but doesn't hit him. This happens often on this kind of 3d street fighters, collision sucks... I hope that for sf5 this doesn't happen anymore... nevertheless, online play makes it very cool.			",54,5,4,3,1,0,0

												I'm more of a Mortal Kombat fan, but I decided to try Street Fighter since I used to play 2 a lot when I was a kid.The gameplay mechanics are VERY different from those in MK which makes it feel way harder for me, but it's worth it because the ultra combos are SO MUCH satisfying!Soundtrack:Should I really talk about it? It's great!Especially the main theme!This is one of the few games in which I DON'T skip the intro, it's so good I could be watching it over and over without getting bored.I reccomend this game, but I can't say I'm happy to support Capcom, one of the reasons I bought this is because the Beta Online Test refused to make me login because of IDs problems, never giving me the chance of playing it.Speaking of online, don't expect GGPO's performance in this game.I give it a 7/10.Would have been better without the countless DLCs, (luckily I only bought ULTRA) better netcode, and a story mode, just like SF5's DLC.Playing with a friend is better, by the way.

												Ultra Street Fighter IV is the latest and (probably) last addition to the Street Fighter IV series. It features 5 new characters, new stages, new soundtrack and tons of balance changes to the roster. A word of advice to beginner fighters: Don't buy this game unless you have an arcade stick (fighting stick) or a good gamepad. The keyboard is not meant for fighting games, even if some people CAN make it work. Being good and enjoying a fighting game takes a lot of commitment. Hundreds of hours in minimum and thousands of hours realistically speaking.+Great gameplay. A good entry-level fighter for beginners too.+A huge roster of varied characters.+Good soundtrack with many iconic songs from the past.+Active community.+Smooth 60 FPS animation and beautiful visuals.-Mediocre netcode. Online multiplayer is still prone to lagging and connection time-outs. This is has been patched somewhat successfully and will be further patched in the future.-Could use a proper tutorial à la Skullgirls. There are character trials and a manual, but no real tutorial.

												A very solid, balanced, and timeless Street Fighter game. Where as newer fighters (Street Fighter V, MvC3, Street Fighter vs Tekken) feel like games of checkers, Street Fighter IV holds its own and plays like a game of chess. The game provides a variety of characters, each unique in their balanced set of strategic advantages/tactical allowances, and allows players to really discover that one character that matches their preferred style of play. The game does require investing some time to gain an understanding of the game's mechanics, level design, tactics commonly used by other players with each character, and their preferred character/character's core, but the time will pay off as you'll feel a greater sense of gratification and appreciation for the game and other players with each spar you engage in.Street Fighter IV is a game of SKILL. It requires the abilities to read one's opponents, quick reflexes, and the timely precision in executing inputs/deploying tactics. As mentioned many 2D fighters nowadays play like checkers in the sense that the bar for entry has been set too low for the sake of reaching a wider market and as a result increase profit generation. They feel as if the only worth they have is to those who want instant gratification in playing something that is easily accessible and off the bat sets an unbalanced win-loss ratio to their favor, leaning towards 'win'. This is apparent with MvC3's dedicated launch button and semi-unbreakable air combos that require a cheap guessing game of rock-paper-scissors to break out of. Street Fighter V and Street Fighter vs Tekken are also guilty of similar mundane juggling/gambling mechanics that one would expect to be integrated in the likes of a Mortal Kombat or a mobile game whose purposes and selling points are based on spetacle, cheap thrills, and the instant release of dopamine. The list of criticisms, for the above mentioned games, goes on and on (lets not get started on the gem system/shortcuts in SFxTekken), but if you want a game that is fun, entertaining, requires critical strategic/tactical thinking, and brings a sense of fulfillment with each match, Street Fighter IV is the cream of the crop.

												I mean I LOVE this game, here are the reasons:* It has Cody,Guy and Poison* CAPCOM actually made pretty neat outfits for all the characters* The online play works* My computer can run it* I might lose all the time but i still find it fun* I don't have to play a stupid survival modes to unlock stuff*  It has single player modes that a fighting game SHOULD have*  CAPCOM didn't load a rootkit disguised as copy protection and sent to me in this one yet<3			",225,50,5,53,12,3,32

												This game is fun for beating the snot out of your friends. I personally am not that great at the game however, I still have lots of fun with it, and it is a great game to play with a group of friends. My friend bought myself and a few other friends this game, and we have a blast when we play together!			",9,0,0,1,1,0,1

												What i DO like about the game:* All Characters can be customized with different outfits and Taunts.* Characters are relatively easy to learn.* The Music is badass.* Can hold it's own on just about any old Potato PC you own provided you play on all low settings.* TONS More!!What i DON'T like about the game: * Certain Combo Moves like Specials and Ultras are fairly difficult to perform if playing on a Controller.* Characters' Mouthes don't move in Sync with what they are saying. (This might be because the game was developed and published in Japan)* Multiplayer Matchmaking tends to match you with Players ranked alot higher then you.Overall Verdict:86/100.Recommended Playstyle:ProDownload Size:14.81 GB			",108,9,6,7,7,2,4

			The last edition for the Street Fighter IV series is going out with a bang with its additional mechanics and game modes. Has the move from Games For Windows Live been a smooth transition?

												Really disappointed with this game that I purchased. I can't even play the game as intended. The game will not recognize any MadCatz fightstick or XB360 controller at all. I am running Windows 8.1 and I expenience ZERO controller issues on any other game. I am disappointed and really wishing Capcom could address this issue, as I have sent multiple requests to Store Support. I shouldn't have to downgrade my OS just to play one game.

												Really awesome game.Pretty easy to get into, but difficult to master.Netcode is a bit iffy though at times, but luckily Capcom is working on patching it (hopefully).The roster of characters is pretty massive in terms of playstyles you can adapt.Just a fair warning.. Don't be discouraged by losing like 5 times in a row in online because you will get better when you notice your mistakes.NEVER GIVE UP ",258,25,5,46,14,1,21

YouTube™ Video: Ultra Street Fighter 4 (Steam Version) Review 

			Views: 2,893		

			The last edition for the Street Fighter IV series is going out with a bang with its additional mechanics and game modes. Has the move from Games For Windows Live been a smooth transition?

												Really disappointed with this game that I purchased. I can't even play the game as intended. The game will not recognize any MadCatz fightstick or XB360 controller at all. I am running Windows 8.1 and I expenience ZERO controller issues on any other game. I am disappointed and really wishing Capcom could address this issue, as I have sent multiple requests to Store Support. I shouldn't have to downgrade my OS just to play one game.

												An okay fighting game and a mediocre Street Fighter.Play 3rd Strike instead.Anyways as much as I and anyone else in the fighting game community is willing to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game for it's stupid mechanics and questionable framedata, it's fun. Huge list of characters to choose from, and it's definitely more complete than SFV at the time of writing, so if you're looking to scratch that modern Street Fighter itch, this certainly isn't a bad pick. By all regards still a perfectly functional fighting game.If you do pick this up, also make sure to get the Street Fighter IV Remix mod, because it's hilarious.			",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												I'm not necessarily new to fighting games in general, but I am new to playing them 'seriously'.That being said, I've had the game for about a week now and I've already logged 36 hours in it- Ultra Street Fighter IV is fantastic and extremely easy to get into, though that may very well be due to the amount of friends I had that were already in to it before me. The only problems I've found is that the training portion doesn't hold your hand which is leaving me having to find out certain symbols used in the characters command lists on google when I feel that's unnecessary.By writing this it's clear that I do indeed have an internet connection, but why should I NEED to check google to find out how to play a game? I don't think it should be a necessity- but at least it helps newbie players out by often introducing them to pro players (like ChrisG or Justin Wong in case you happen to be infatuated with Elena like me) who can show you how to string the combos you'd like to get.The graphics are tight, the controls are tight (once you learn them), the Arcade Mode can be as rage inducing as it is mindless fun as it is fun always offering a new kind of challenge every time you play. The one thing I believe that's hurting USFIV, at least for this reviewer, is that at the time of writing this there is a HUGE problem with finding online matches. You can do co-op with friends and everything, but if you're looking to fight and make with friends with new peeps- Well, looks like you'll have to check out groups on Steam or find some fighter forums until the problem is fixed.However, if you're reading this after the glorious coming of the patch, do yourself a favor and drop this game in your cart.

												It really is tough to say which is better: Super Street Fighter IV, or its Arcade Edition (ver.2012) update. It really comes down to whether or not your character got better compared to the older version, I suppose :PI'm glad to see that GFWL is going away for this game, and will get steam matchmaking support. USF4, too, is going to have steam matchmaking. And to GFWL I say good riddance. Fighting games aren't for everyone, but if you like fighting games, do yourself a favour and play this one.

												Really fun game, always something new to learn, and try to master. If you've read the other views, you probably noticed everyone is saying the multiplayer network is pretty bad, and I'd have to agree. However, I still end up playing online like everyday. During matches the game usually stutters once or twice, but other then that the game plays as smooth as butter. I would recommend the game despite it's shortcomings, but if Capcom were able to fix the network, I would recommend it even more to those looking for a fun fighting game. Besides, there aren't many fighters on PC, so there are not many to choose from.			",206,59,2,27,9,1,17

												As much as I love Street Fighter, it seems to have fallen victim over time to being an example of the phrase “don’t fix that which is not broken.” Street Fighter II was the perfect fighting game in my opinion. You could just pick up a controller and pulverize people. Now Street Fighter has so many different game mechanics and each character is so much different from the others, which just makes it needlessly complicated. That’s not to say this is a bad game. Aside from the learning curve and pretty much the NECESSITY for a controller, this is a great game.			",183,30,1,8,7,3,10

												Remember all the great fun you had playing Karate, Swordfight at Midnight, Fighting Road, and Super Black Belt Karate???  Of course you don't.  Why??  Because they all sucked a mile of chicken butt.  There's actually a long list of fighting games that have been put out to the masses over the years but only a choice few actually stand out amongst all the others as great and memorable fighting games.  Ultra Street Fighter IV along with the majority of the Street Fighter franchise is one of those few.  Pop quiz time...... Name all the current Ultra Street Fighter IV characters that also appeared in the original 1987 release of Street Fighter.  I'll give you the answer at the end.If you've never played a Street Fighter games now is a great time to try your hand at it.  Controls are smooth and easy to grasp with a little work.  Gameplay is realitively easy to grasp but difficult to master, which in my opinion is a mark of a great game.  Online play seems to be smooth and there's plenty to do solo too as no two fights, online or off, will ever be the same.  With all the different characters in USFIV there's bound to be at least one character you side with,  As a matter of fact, there's so many different characters that if there was a downside it's that it's hard to settle in on  just one fighter if you'r new.If you have played Street Fighter games before then what are you waiting for?  There's a fairly good chance at least one of your favorite characters from a previous version is just waiting for you to use them in a fight.  All your old memorized combos, supers, are still here and most likely use the same movements and button combos to execute.  And if you're looking for something new there's plenty of new and new/old characters too as well as some new moves and ultras.  This has certainly got to be one of the prettiest looking Street Fighters to date.  Colors pop, backgrounds look amazing and have loads of funny/interesting characters in them, and every character has several different DLC costumes you can buy if you so choose.  Other than the cosmetic character costumes though there's no game changing DLC within USFIV so yo don't need to worry about pay to win junk here.Overall the game looks and plays amazing and is great fun.  Since you can also play two player on the same screen/PC it also makes a great party game and looks amazing on a nice big screen TV or monitor.  If there was one major downside it would be that the game doesn't play well with a keyboard/mouse or a standard Xbox controller.  You can do it sure, but you'll most likely be at a disadvantage when playing against someone who has invested in and trained on a fightpad, fightstick, or one of the newer hitbox controllers.  Owning one of those types of controllers though opens up a world of other interesting gaming on Steam though as all fighting games and many other arcade style games found on Steam just feel better when you use one with it.So the answer to the question at the top:  Ryu, Ken, Gen, Adon, and Sagat.  There was also another character named Mike who greatly resembles the boxer Balrog so I guess he gets a half point...  Another character from the original Street Fighter named Eagle also appeared in Capcom vs SNK but not in USFIV.  There's your history lesson for today folks...			",200,48,1,38,24,4,28

												This game is FANTASTIC! The combat is smooth like it was in Alpha 3; The fighters are better balanced and in greater numbers, and the skill ceiling is higher in this game than in any other street fighter (and in most other fighters). I prefer this  fighter over all other fighting games. I would definitely recommend this game to any fighting game finatic with alot of time to invest. The only things holding this game back from a perfect score are the occasional frame drops and the lag and lack of match making in online mode. Normally lag in online wouldn't hold a game back for me but the online lag in this game can be crippling, but if both players have a good connection online is just like fighting normally. All in all I give this game a 9/10, a must own for those who play fighters.			",53,2,0,2,5,0,1

												I've played the game across platforms and over the various iterations since Street Fighter 4 came out. This iteration, on PC, is probably the worst I have played.The Good:-Since Street Fighter 4, this series has been highly accessible to a new audience. Large community.-Roster is very large now with a nice balance between characters-Not very demanding graphically-New Omega mode is very fun and interesting, breathing fresh air into old characters-The new delayed wakeup option and red focus seem to add new potential (and frustrations if your character relies on knockdown momentum)-Online training mode is a nice addition that can help new players learn from veterans regardless of physical locationThe Bad:-The netcode is easily the worst it has ever been. Games for Windows Live actually was a benefit to this series on PC. There were at least matches where you would not experience any latency. Not so anymore. Do not buy this for PC if you are a tournament player, want to play competitively, or want to improve your skills against other people in general. Period. You will never be able to tell when you have lost a match legitimately or when it was the delayed inputs that caused it. You will never have a match without high latency.-Half of the modes are untouched. I don't think I have used tournament mode or team battle more than a handful of times since they were introduced in Super Street Fighter 4. Online training suffers from the lag as well.Now you may say ""That's not a lot of cons? Why are you not recommending this game?"" The entire draw of the game is to play against other people via online. With the high latencies that appear like they won't be resolved any time soon, this game becomes highly frustrating on a good day. Even when I win the matches, I'm frustrated because I know the other player was feeling the same lag I was.It's not worth $40 on PC. It's not worth $15 on PC. It's probably not even worth $5. Unless you get this game gifted to you, do not buy it on steam. Buy it on a console and save yourself the trouble. I remain hopeful that Capcom will fix these issues someday, but it looks like they're already trying to milk me for some more money with Street Fighter 5.			",60,6,0,14,2,0,12

												Coming from someone with little experience in fighting games, who has to play it on a keyboard, and who's so bad he usually only plays against AI, I have enjoyed this game a lot so far.  I think that might say something about how fun the game is.  With 44 unique playable characters (<3 Poison and Ibuki) and many costumes for those interested, plus some pretty cool levels to play in, there is a lot of variety here.  My only real complaint is that at times multiplayer can have some weird lag issues.  Not much else to say other than it's a lot of fun.  ""Go ahead.  Just tell me what you'd like me to do to you..."" -Poison			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the series that many consider the core of the one-on-one fighting genre, Street Fighter has become a staple to many players.  With the latest version, it continues to prove why it has that reputation.  However, by showing why it was always a good series, it might be seen as a bad move.One thing that might be a bad thing about the game is the roster.  Having 44 characters is good because there is plenty of variety.  The part that is the minus is how many returning characters.  About 75 percent of the characters came from at least one other Street Fighter game.  This is the exact opposite of the previous game were 80 percent were original characters.  This does mean that fan favorites like Chun-Li and Dan are playable again.  However, with so many repeat characters, it makes it that the game does not much of a personality on its own but relying more on the nostalgia from past games.  A little more effort into creating more original characters than simply bringing back old ones would be more desirable.Even without the nostalgia, the combat is what makes it fun.  Even with having so many moves to use, the combat is simple enough for most players to pick up and play.  For those unfamiliar to the genre, the combat is simple enough for newcomers using just a couple of buttons to make a usable combo with three moves.  This makes it allows even those without prior knowledge can get into the game.  Once familiar with the mechanics, it becomes easy to pull off multi-move, double-digit combos.  With the system being this flexible, the one thing limiting the player is the desire to learn.However, with all the complexities of the game, the game does not do a good job in teaching how they work.  In Capcom’s previous fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken, there was a real training mode that teaches the player about all the various details about the combat system.  Unlike that game, this one does nothing to tell you about how things work.  There is a challenge mode where you can learn about combos, but that alone does not say what these mean.  To understand what the various symbols means, it is necessary to read the virtual manual.  Not having a physical manual might be normal nowadays, but with a system with many variances, this is a case where having something physical to read or a proper tutorial to study, many of these details are easily lost to the rookie player.Overall, this is still one of the great fighting series ever made.  Unfortunately, with the series getting more and more complicated, having a better teaching system is crucial.  Even without a proper manual or tutorial, the game is fun and deep enough to warrant any action fan to play.			",2673,1105,99,291,293,32,439

												I'm a Street Fighter fanatic.  I've bought 3 version of SF4:Arcade editions (Games for Windows Live, Steam, and Xbox 360) and have bought Ultra twice (Xbox and PC).  I love playing this game.  That being said, the online is completely terrible.  I have never been so disaapointed in a company as I have been with Capcom.There was a time ""Japanese made"" meant something of high quality.  Capcom is an embarassment to it's home country.  I'm dead serious.  This game is the worst and it's only ruining their reputation.  I will never, ever, buy a Capcom game on release.			",140,32,2,10,12,2,32

												perhaps the best fighter on pc. don't be discouraged if you keep getting destroyed online, it takes time to get good at this game.if you are having problems with lag during online play it's most likely that you or the person you are playing doesn't have the right ports open. steam made it easy to get into pc gaming for the none technical types. though not always the case, many games require that certain ports are opened in order to function properly. sadly not many people have the technical know how to log into their router and configure it for pc gaming. i think capcom should program an alert message when you start the game informing the player to make sure the right ports are forwarded as well as a guide of some sort on how to configure your router.also don't forget that streaming services such as netflix are bandwidth hogs. so if you're sharing your internet with other people and they are using these services while you are gaming, unless you have some type of qos/traffic control implemented your online experience is going to suffer to some degree.

												If you're just getting into this game, don't do it alone - get some friends to tag along. The majority of the playerbase are veterans of the Street Fighter scene and are happy to eat up new players. It's difficult to input special moves correctly with a controller and impossible to play with keyboard/mouseYou'll want to invest in a joystick...it'll still take a long time to get the inputs consistent, thoughIt feels almost like a guessing game at times, but you can tip the scales in your favour if you can recognize patterns in the other player's gameplayThe game engine demands dedication.It's sometimes difficult to simply land a special move on its own, but you aren't going to win much if you don't learn to string moves together (forming a combo) at a timing that's sometimes as tight as 1/60th of a second.Enter at your own risk.EDITAfter playing for awhile, I'd like to point out that combos with a margin of error of only 1/60th of a second are far and few between You can go far without that sort of thing, but know these combos do exist			",46,3,0,4,7,0,3

												Haven't played it that much yet, but from what I have seen is that the game has great art and visuals and runs seamlessly and has great moves and last but not least it's not an easy game to play unlike tekken where even a noob can defeat a pro just by spamming the same move until the hp hits 0%. I'm more of a tekken player but this game is turning out to be great and I see myself playing it a lot in the near future.10/10 Pretty Colors.			",595,122,22,89,70,5,61

												Fantastic game, ashame steamworks had to ruin it for everyone. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really miss GFWL!Cons: Laggy beyond all beliefDuring said lag it says Waiting for other player, whoever reconnect first gets to attack first while the other player is waiting at his mercy to not land a free ultra/combo.Can no longer message people, instead forces you to use a mic to communicate with whoever your fighting.Mic must be either on or off, you can no longer toggle a button to make it active, extremely annoying.Announcer is annoying as hell and there is no way to turn him off.Did I mention the lag?If you bought a dlc pack from someone other than steam your SOL.Pros:Can change your name at will whereas with GFWL you had to spend money to do this.DLC from steam convert over.

												This game is about a man named Ken, who wears a pink cowboy outfit as he fights for his family. His journey nears an end as he meets his lifelong enemy, who is more jelly donut than man. These guys will have at it in a epic battle that will decide the fate... wait who is that guy again? No I'm not a Ken Masters double, I'm the real thing!--Pros---Runs well on even lower end comp. All you need is a graphics card not even a good one, just stick cardboard in your PCI or PCI-e slot, it'll work fine.-Trails to help you learn your character's general feel and combos-Training mode with a wide variety to test varying situations--Cons---Online multiplayer is spotty at best right now, Capcom is addressing these so hopefully this won't stay. They're not making games, so this should be resolved quickly.-Everyone plays the same few characters, so you'll learn how to fight E. Ryu, Oni, Poison, etc quickly.-Not everyone likes my Ken outfit			",66,3,1,7,2,0,2

												Do not, under any circumstances, purchase this game if you don't have prior experience. The only people left playing this game have several years of experience and will so thoroughly whoop your♥♥♥♥♥over and over that you'll never want to play again. Just got kicked from another lobby because I couldn't stand up to these guys. But what do they expect, honestly? How does one get better when people won't even fight you? I just can't stand this game. It's not a bad game, by any means, But if you're new, it's extremely frustrating. I feel like i'll need to play hundreds upon hundreds of matches to even begin to get good at it, and it's just not worth the hair ripping frustration.			",76,1,0,6,0,0,4

												thjs is my review of ultra street fighter 4 withoug using the backspace keysteet fighter is a really good game where you punch some ♥♥♥♥♥s or something, i don't really remember because i fell asleep alfway through the campaign wich is actually boring as hellit's fun to play with your friends (THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME) because you're naturally better than them at video games so you can bet money, kick their asses, and then acquire monetary valueyou can also buy outfits but i only recommend the girls outfit packs because then you can get them to wear less clothes and maybe change some colors or something i wasn't really paying attentionlieke there's spme really insany korean chick in that game and she's like really hhot and you dcan do like a taunt twhere she acts like a ♥♥♥♥ing stripper and starts gyrating her hips and it's like really l-=lewsd but i just thought i'd mention it because it's the only wothwhile thing about this gameexcept tfor everything elseten out of ten would play europ truck simulator two again but probably not this game because none of my friends play it and i'm really sad because of it :(i even bought it for one of them any they still haven't installed it♥♥♥♥ing bithces			",76,11,0,8,9,1,7

												This game is about a man named Ken, who wears a pink cowboy outfit as he fights for his family. His journey nears an end as he meets his lifelong enemy, who is more jelly donut than man. These guys will have at it in a epic battle that will decide the fate... wait who is that guy again? No I'm not a Ken Masters double, I'm the real thing!--Pros---Runs well on even lower end comp. All you need is a graphics card not even a good one, just stick cardboard in your PCI or PCI-e slot, it'll work fine.-Trails to help you learn your character's general feel and combos-Training mode with a wide variety to test varying situations--Cons---Online multiplayer is spotty at best right now, Capcom is addressing these so hopefully this won't stay. They're not making games, so this should be resolved quickly.-Everyone plays the same few characters, so you'll learn how to fight E.

												Some people would recommend this to be your 1st Fighting game to play. Reasons being it requires a LOT of different techniques to be able to play against a decent (over 1000PP) players. However since fighting games are moving away from the deep ""need to learn a variety of techniques to be begin enjoying the game"" and towards simple to pick up and execute, but still deep gameplay I would not recommend this to be your 1st fighting game.

												Haven't played it that much yet, but from what I have seen is that the game has great art and visuals and runs seamlessly and has great moves and last but not least it's not an easy game to play unlike tekken where even a noob can defeat a pro just by spamming the same move until the hp hits 0%. I'm more of a tekken player but this game is turning out to be great and I see myself playing it a lot in the near future.10/10 Pretty Colors.			",595,122,22,89,70,5,61

												Let me tell you something you may already know. This game ain't all shoryuken and rainbows.When you first start, it’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how good of a gamer you think you are -- it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it. You will lose your first game.. you will probably lose your 2nd game.. you may even lose 30 in a row (like me...) But..remember.. it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can GET hit and keep moving forward. How much you can TAKE and keep moving forward. THAT'S HOW WINNING IS DONE (i just won 2 in a row woot 2W-30L). But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers about to uninstall saying you ain't where you want to be because of cheesers, hackers, or anybody! Noobs do that and that ain't you! You're better than that! ADRIANtl;drget this game if u got da will of a championp.s.  u may want to invest in a fightstick or hitbox if you are on a controller.			",48,7,1,4,5,3,5

												If you're not familiar to street fighter or any fighting games then you will be in for a crash course lesson with SSF4AE. Street fighter has had a long and successful history at being one of the best fighting games around which goes to say that this game is in no way a dissappointment. There are a huge number of characters to choose from each providing new and different styles for fighting. The original characters such as Ken and Ryu are as formidable as ever while newer characters such as C.Viper and Juri really put a spin on the fighting stlyes familiar to SF4.If you find yourself being KO'ed too often then you can dial down the difficulty in arcade and versus mode when playing against the computer but against other players, I'm afraid only god can save you then. This goes to say that online mode especially now that the game has been out for some time is filled with experienced players so you'll need to put some hours in the training room.All in all this is a great fighting game for beginners and experienced fighting nuts, with this game being continually updated with more characters especially with Ultra street fighter 4 already being released on console and coming soon on PC, you can be sure to find a great balanced fighting game if you buy this and future editions.

												Amazing game! It is really good fun and provides a big challenge for any level of player, new to street fighter or not. Picking out a character to master who suits you and your playing style is pretty cool. It can take a while to find anybody who fits you, the challenge is great. For example, Vega is my main, but I am having fun learning a lot about Gouken and Gen as alternative choices.Online play is alive and competitive and easy to jump into, but I'd advise making sure you're confident with good defence, offence and combos which you know you can pull off, training mode and arcade mode are good places to practice, and of course the challenge mode.

												As of launch day for Ultra:Top notch fighting game, Ultra's balance adjustments and additional systems (such as red focus and delayed wake up) to SF4 puts every character on a more even playing field, especially those who had no answer to vortexes.The only gripe with the game is the online play. Since Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition's transition from Games for Windows Live (GFWL) to Steam servers the online play has seen a noticeable drop in quality (i.e. laggier). And the transition from SSF4AE ver 2014 to to Ultra has seen another lagtastic dip, at least for me. Matches are playable, and the ""Waiting for opponent"" doesn't pop up like it did in SSF4AE2014, but on occasion the match will slow down as both of us in the match try to distance ourselves from each other until the game goes back to normal speed.It will likely get fixed over time, as the server structures between the two are likely very different. The netcode probably has been or had to be re-written to transition from one to the other, but may still need to be adjusted.			",147,13,2,30,3,0,6

												A very decent follow-up after Super Street Fighter 2.  Capcom did release some sequels but while the Alpha franchise represented a prequel and part 3 did have a new storyline, Street Figther 4 is the direct follow-up after part 2.Super Street Figther IV: Arcade Edition has the same roster as Street Figther IV, but with an extra 14 characters. The game is very entertaining - visually superb and its gameplay is very addictive. I can only recommend it, especially since there are barely any 2D fighters available on PC nowadays.UPDATE: Ultra Street Figther 4 is a decent DLC making 5 more characters available as part of the already huge roster. I have only played a couple of hours with the DLC content but already met all the new characters as enemies - it seems they offer quite varied moves and playing them will be interesting and, hopefully, challenging.What I noticed is that it is possible now to use both Ultra Moves - the 3rd ultra choice is actually making both available (on the character screen). So, why pick only one of them in the future? Because making both available means they do less damage. Still, the variation can be helpful if fighting a particular enemy. Also, I hated those ultras where it was a requirement to be hit by the enemy or simply let them close. Now, it's best to have both at the ready.Another thing is that as Windows Live is not available anymore (or simply just not supported - I have not really followed related news), achievements are now logged via Steam and of course updating the game will also be easier. New characters also means new stages and new soundtracks for these. My favourite is the Jurassic Park one with the two dinosaurs constantly roaring in the background.Multiplayer seems to be finetuned and I noticed a Youtube upload option for the matches we have played. I hope this time it will be easier to find opponents - whether it is a netcode issue or the fact that this is not played by many on PC is still unknown for me.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												My favorite fighting game of all time. I remember playing street fighter II at the arcade in my childhood. Still a big fan today, can't ask for a better game. Thank you Capcom for developing this. The graphics are stunning, characters are unique, and complex fighting mechanics that are easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's hard to be good in this game without spending hours in training mode. The mechanics in this game will not let you mash the buttons to perform a move, but it requires strict timing in order for the moves or combo to come out. Once you master the techniques and timing, it will pay off when you play competitively. The thing that impress me the most is the cool moves that each individual character has. The level of details in every fighters' muscles and little extra effects when a punch lands on an opposite always leaves me in awe. The sound of every punch is crispy clear. Just the cracking sound of knuckles landing on my oppoent's face always gets me high. Honestly, you really have to get this game and see for yourself. This is a number one choice for any fight games fanboy out there.			",120,7,2,10,6,1,26

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Outdated design? CheckClunky gameplay? CheckSlow gameplay? CheckBoring gameplay? CheckFun to mess around with friends in? CheckAs far as fighting games go, there's no game that frustrates me more than SF4. The core game design is clunky, limited, and slow. It makes me feel trapped because all that matters is single attacks into special moves with some grabs thrown in here and there (and, of course, projectile spam but every fighting game has that). There's no comboing worth anything, minimal pressure game, and Capcom still hasn't realized just how terrible a design idea charged attacks is. As a whole, the game is unejoyable because the core game design is more akin to a boxing match than a fighting game: single hits now and then to slowly chip away at the opponent until they fall over.You know a fighting game has a problem when the fastest characters are played best at midrange, sitting and waiting to get a hit in then back away and repeat. That, and such a drastic difference in power between the top and the bottom.I give SF4 a 4/10. It would be a 3, but the game is coded well with minimal to NO bugs which is a huge plus. I do not recommend Ultra Street Fighter 4 (or any other version of SF4) to anyone who wants to play a fun fighting game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, this is a terrible Street Fighter game. I don't think Capcom will ever surpass classics like Hyper Fighting and Super Turbo. Street Fighter 4 just does so many things wrong and alot of it's game design doesn't make alot of sense to someone that has been playing Street Fighter since arcades blew up with fighting games in the early 90's. This game is five years old now and my opinion of it hasn't changed since the first game in the Street Fighter 4 series released. Ultra does very little to adding much to an already below average fighting game, mostly by adding more nonsense instead of directly addressing the problems with the game.People are gonna play it anyways though because 1. It's Capcom, 2. It's Street Fighter and 3. It's the Newest game. My advice is don't fall into the hype, and only pick this up if you can get it for real cheap.			",143,6,1,13,4,0,0

												Probably the best 2D fighting game out there and with a huge following to boot. But I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone as it is right now. The reason being that the steam integration has royally failed even though they have had so much time on their hands to make it work. -Mic is ON by default and there is no in-game option to switch it off much less change anything related to voice communication.-Announcer is really loud and repeats almost any phrase twice and sometimes echoes.-Achievement don't transfer properly, for example if you have won 500 games you still have to win one more to trigger it, some achievements like simply setting an icon and title you have to do over to trigger.-Game says there is an option to switch version which there clearly isn't (it looks like a port from the regular SSF4)-Net code is a hit/miss, worse than with GFWL, I truly don't get why people hated on it so much, I merely had the discomfort of having to type in my info once every 20 days or so due to inactivity otherwise it logged me in automatically.-NO-ONE is online, game can't find anyone. Match request works to an extent which is weird, makes me think it's just me although i have never had any problems with any game I play online.However...If you are willing and have faith you are better off getting the game now while it's on sale and save yourself the smack on the head later. Issues are not unheard off but keep in mind it can take a long time before they fix this depend on how priority it is given.  ",465,77,27,40,26,5,63

												People like you and me ""suck at it"", because when we play online, we play against people who are frame counters. These people will research every single move there is, until eventually they are able to counter and punish every single action you make.For example, they know how long it takes for a Hadoken to be performed, so they look at fighters who are programmed with a timing that will be fast enough to punish that move. To me this is equivalent of playing poker with a bunch of card counters, it doesn't matter to them if you are playing for fun, they are playing statistics. I really wish that the programmers for these types of games would but 3 or four different ways/timings that are randomly performed for each move. For example, when you press ""jab"", sometimes it takes 0.2 seconds to connect, sometimes it will take 0.5 seconds to connect. That way it will be like a real fight, and everyone would be in the same playing field. ",182,9,3,3,4,1,7

												As of launch day for Ultra:Top notch fighting game, Ultra's balance adjustments and additional systems (such as red focus and delayed wake up) to SF4 puts every character on a more even playing field, especially those who had no answer to vortexes.The only gripe with the game is the online play. Since Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition's transition from Games for Windows Live (GFWL) to Steam servers the online play has seen a noticeable drop in quality (i.e. laggier). And the transition from SSF4AE ver 2014 to to Ultra has seen another lagtastic dip, at least for me. Matches are playable, and the ""Waiting for opponent"" doesn't pop up like it did in SSF4AE2014, but on occasion the match will slow down as both of us in the match try to distance ourselves from each other until the game goes back to normal speed.It will likely get fixed over time, as the server structures between the two are likely very different. The netcode probably has been or had to be re-written to transition from one to the other, but may still need to be adjusted.			",147,13,2,30,3,0,6

												Launch the game. You've never played SF but you know from the rumors the famed Hadoken. Try it in the arcade. Feel good about it, you're proud of yourself.Tell a friend to buy the game. He plays it with you, you're having fun matches. It's cool.He stops playing, when you continue training. Someday, you go online.Settings ""Same level of skill"". Match against the #9 Akuma worldwide.

												I've spend countless hours on this game on the Xbox version and I'm enjoying it on PC also.Positives:1. Very solid fighting system2. Controls are great and feel reponsive. You can either play it on keyboard or gamepad/arcade stick.3. Huge cast of character to choose from.4. Great training system and challenges that will make you better.Negatives:1. Players with no experience with fighting games can find it hard to lean, but the training system does a good job.2. The online community is not that high at the time I'm writing this review.Overall, I strongly recommend any fighting game fans to get this game. For players new to fighting games this game may not be the best choice, but it certainly is not a bad choice. If you have the desire to better yourself you will. ",6,1,0,2,0,0,0

												One of the most ridiculously complicated fighting games ever made, with a ton of flaws to stop people getting in to it without thousands of hours of practice. Many of the problems with it have in fact been fixed in SFV, but sadly SFV is extremely lacking in terms of content as of now, so many people are stuck here.So, why is it so bad, you ask?One-Frame LinksStreet Fighter fanboys will defend this nonsense until the end of the earth, and it's one of the most ridiculously stupid things I have ever seen.The general idea behind one-frame links is that when you do an attack and want to follow it up with another, only the joystick's input is buffered. You cannot buffer the button presses, and instead, they must be pressed in a lot of cases, completely frame perfect on the second that attack frame ends.  Not only is this an incredibly needless execution barrier that keeps newer players out, it's also made worse by the fact the online has a hideous delay, making these frame-perfect links almost impossible.These one-frame links are so bad, an in-game exploit known as 'Priority Linking', or 'Plinking', is commonly used in competitive play to increase the leniency of these links. You can tell you've got a needlessly complex game if even the professional players have to exploit the system to pull off their combos. SFV has in fact, fixed these frame links, and according to the developer, the minimum amount of frames needed to do a link has gone down to three.The game's tutorials are terrible, especially regarding movesThis is perhaps the worst thing, in my opinion. You'll quite often be in a match and you'll be struck down over and over, not knowing how to counter a certain move. Do you block high, block low? How are you to know? The ingame move-list for each character doesn't tell you a damn thing about anything. Is this move projectile-invincible, does it break armor?The only way to find out ANY of this is to look the information up on community wiki's, and considering how many characters there are and how many moves you need to learn the properties of, it's almost shameful that the game can't just tell you this.The community is easily one of the worst in the FGCConsider this a deviation with no real inpact on the game, it's more of a personal gripe. When the majority of your game is done online, it's not the best of things to have people taunting you and sending you invites to 'LOL YOU'RE BAD XDDDD' steam groups after every other match. Consider this because of the normalisation of Street Fighter as a game, tons of people play it, which brings in the majority of bad eggs that you see. But this kind of behavior is often seen at professional tournaments, too, which doesn't help to bring down the image of the FGC as a whole.If you're considering getting into fighting games, I'd very much recommend you pick up Skullgirls to start you off. SF4 is not a beginner-friendly game, and has an enormous execution barrier that will stop you from getting the full enjoyment of this game until you're thousands of hours into the game. There are much better fighting games that you could be playing. I only hope SFV gets more fleshed out as time goes on.			",295,37,2,15,20,4,15

												Outdated design? CheckClunky gameplay? CheckSlow gameplay? CheckBoring gameplay? CheckFun to mess around with friends in? CheckAs far as fighting games go, there's no game that frustrates me more than SF4. The core game design is clunky, limited, and slow. It makes me feel trapped because all that matters is single attacks into special moves with some grabs thrown in here and there (and, of course, projectile spam but every fighting game has that). There's no comboing worth anything, minimal pressure game, and Capcom still hasn't realized just how terrible a design idea charged attacks is. As a whole, the game is unejoyable because the core game design is more akin to a boxing match than a fighting game: single hits now and then to slowly chip away at the opponent until they fall over.You know a fighting game has a problem when the fastest characters are played best at midrange, sitting and waiting to get a hit in then back away and repeat. That, and such a drastic difference in power between the top and the bottom.I give SF4 a 4/10. It would be a 3, but the game is coded well with minimal to NO bugs which is a huge plus. I do not recommend Ultra Street Fighter 4 (or any other version of SF4) to anyone who wants to play a fun fighting game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would be great if Capcom could make online play work.  6 months and it is still unplayable, just makes you annoyed to play a perfect match and then see the entire game freeze mid way through for 5 seconds, breaking any momentum you have.  I am uninstalling it.  Not buying any more of their games until I see they are actually playable online.   I've given them too much of my money for all their revisions as it is.  (SSFIV AE 2012 worked perfectly on PC).UPDATE: 5/17/15I have updated the Steam client that was supposed to fix this game and reinstalled USF4.  I have attempted to play many matches today and yesterday, the majority of the games are still too terrible to play (This is not due to my own connection, which is generally around 30mbps download/15 upload, or my computer which is a gaming computer I built myself).  This is my experience, I hope others have a different one but rather doubt it.  This is not worth the frustration.  I would like my money back.Uninstalling this again, I will not be purchasing Ps4 version until there is extensive testing of the play online.  Do not waste your money on this.			",6,0,0,4,0,0,0

												I cannot condemn this game enough.  Just don't.  If you find yourself thinking - maybe it's not that bad; don't.  It's awful.See the problem is Windows Live.  Yeah.  I didn't read the notes before buying it.The first issue I ran into was just trying to find my account details.  I avoid Windows Live like the plague because I have yet to have a good experience using it.  This means I don't use it very often and - unsurprisingly - had forgotten my password.  This is exacebated by Microsofts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ password requirements which include never being able to re-use a password already used in live.  Fortunately I'd written it down and after a bit of digging found it.Alright I'm in.  Gotta accept the terms and conditions before I can install though.  It's a pity there seems to be no way to access them before money is paid but that's pretty much par for the couse these days.  But wait there's more I can't read the terms and conidtions at all - they're missing.  Not a problem - I'll blindly accept them like everyone else.But wait there's more.  I need a CD key.  In this day and age I really still need CD keys?  Oh well it's Capcom and Microsoft; two companies whose grasp of realitiy is poor at best tending tripping balls in general.  Good thing I can copy that CD key into the clipboard otherwise I might have to type it out.  Gotcha!  Windows Live doesn't respect 'paste' (or anything else) so I'm going to be typing it in after all.  I guess it's just a part of the challenge.Glad that's over.  I'll be waiting whilst my profile is downloaded - not that I realised I already had one so that's a bit of a bonus!  Except it turns out that the lengthly profile download is actually the key authentication.  Who'd a thought it.  And I got the key wrong.  Okay, this is a bit of a problem now - I'm only running an a full HD TV and it's really, really hard to tell the difference between 6 and 8.  And that key liked it's sixes and eights.After some trial and error I managed to guess the right combination of 6s and 8s - turns out it wasn't 666 although I'm still not convinced that Live is not in league with the devil.  But that wasn't all somewhere in the trialling and the erroring Windows Live crashed and lost all my account details I'd asked it to kindly save upfront.  Off to find them again.At last I'm in.  I verified I really did buy the game I bought.  I was getting worried I might not be me.Except it was never going to be that easy was it?  Windows Live (which had just updated itself) detected there was an update and infomred me I wouldn't be able to play until I've installed it.  Fine it's getting a bit needy but I let it update again.  Which incidently loses my account information again too.  I can almost remeber the random string of symbols and caps and numbers that is my password now so we can move on.At this point Live get's itself into a 'I have to restart but I can't restart know\ which is easilly solved by killing the process.  Silly LIve it could have just done that itself.And there are new terms and conditions I have to accept before I'll be allowed to play again.  This time there wasn't even an option to view them.  I can accept that Microsoft would never possibly try and sneak a devious clause into it's terms and condiitions so without ado I continue.  And I won.  I am winner.Wait, was I reviiewing Street Fighter or Games for Windows Live?   ",411,86,3,65,51,0,64

												A god knows how the HELL this PC port of one of the best fighting games ever having so very positive reviews out of almost 6000 reviewers.The games has MAJOR problems with its net code .... Lags , DCs and myriad of other problems making multiplayer a nightmare for every single serious fighting gamer out there. Specially when lag and frames for this game is very crucial in order to win let alone manage to do hard frame link combos and alike.For single player ONLY , i give the game 9/10For online mode  2/10This is a 5/10 and will remain a 5/10 to my eyes if they dont fix net code ... I recommend to not even bother if you want to have a nice online experience and buy the game for a console.			",276,116,6,34,23,5,41

Just nonsense.3) Ok, no problem: let's play the online game!...I've never seen such a stupid matchmaking system before. I've played 20-ish games, everytime my opponent was as fast as speed light, just stronger and skilled than me. Ok, I know I'm a beginner...so I'd like opponents that play like me...no way.

												UpdateStill playing it, loving it, it's so much fun!!!! But the lag issues are still there and it feels sometimes we are fighting for who is lagging more than actually a street fight. Please stop neglecting your servers Capcom!!! And no, it's not my internet conection. I had this issue while living in Europe and now in USA so WHEREVER they'r servers are, it just needs to be adjusted.Lag wars anyone?The game itself is a masterpiece.  Playing solo is rather fun or with someone on the same computer.But it was the biguest desapoinment playing it online and realizing how terrible the servers are and how any computer seems to be running on Ram DDR2gb memory while online.I wanted it to play online ,since its not good enough, this is my negative review about this purchase. SSF4 servers seemed to be running way beter before upgrading to ultra. C'mon Capcom :(			",45,6,3,5,1,0,1

												I've got plenty of hours already in this game and I've got to be honest, it's simply not worth it.If you want to purchase this game to play online, simply DON'T, it's a Lagfest!I don't take this game competetively and the only thing I'd like was a GOOD Online experience, which this game doesn't offer at all, even though I kept playing in hope they would improve this.However if you're buying the game to play with your favourite characters in the Campaign, I have to say that it's really good and challenging, and so is to start doing those amazing combos that we see Professional players doing.Pros:-Responsive controls.-Good graphics and special move/ultra animations.-Challenging Campaign in harder dificulties.-Using abilities like FADC to extend combos or get out of a bad situation.Cons:-The worst multiplayer experience you can get in a fighting game.-Character combos might take a long time to get right.

												This game sucks donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not only does it lag like ♥♥♥♥ online but a  as usual Steam couldn't launch a decent server if their ♥♥♥♥ing lives depended on it.Also, characters like Ryu are so overused and overpowered, all you have to do with him (and his palette swaps, Ken, AKuma, Sakura and Makoto) Is mash SHORYUKEEEEN to win, this game takes no skill and I should know because I'm great at 2-hit combos.So in short, game is so easy even a Mexican child can grasp it in no time, no real combos, button inputs are tough and make no sense, laggy online and a really bad community really ruin the roleplay.0/10 DO NOT BUY (Unless you're Asian)Oh and I forgot there's only like 5 characters to choose form that all do the same moveset.

												This game is one of the definitive, modern fighting games.  It is balanced, nuanced, and visually dynamic.  It is also completely impenetrable to someone who has little or no experience with fighting games or the Street Fighter series.  Being a newcomer to the series, I found this game to make zero effort to explain or even give the basic fundamentals of how to play.  Even the challenges and training modes are woefully inadequate to teach the game.  If you love fighting games or are familiar with the series, Street Fighter IV is a great game.  If you aren't, you shouldn't bother trying to play unless you want to dedicate a serious amount of time playing, watching videos, and reading about it.  This isn't a bad game.  It just is really hard to recommend to people who aren't already fans or willing to put an incredible number of hours into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I waited a lot before writing this review because this awesome game is cursed by a really bad netcode implementation, I thought the issues could be fixed but since after 2 months the situation is almost the same I think things are going to remain like that forever. Anyway, let's start with everything else, we will get there eventually.The game is, as was SSFIV AE, one of the best fighting games ever made. The roster is huge and the gameplay of each character is unique (shotos share similarities ofc). Usually with a huge roster tier list gets crazy but in Ultra Street Fighter IV there are almost no impossible match-ups.Graphics are really nice and on PC you can customize even more game's graphic settings, music is really good (character bgm are better than stage bgm IMHO, but that's just for me) and SFX/announcer are part of what makes the game street fighter.Now let's talk about the netcode implementation. When you buy a fighting game you're not supposed to play alone by design.In 2000 you wouldn't expect the game to have any online mode implementation and you'd have struggled to search players at your level (it involved moving around your country a lot) to learn the game and eventually enjoy yourself.In 2014 you expect your game to be fully playable online since 30~40 ms ping values are totally bearable (it's more or less 2 game frames that should even be mitigated by the netcode). Sadly this is not the case.The netcode is bad and so the ""mitigation"" is completely missing (at least it feels like that) meaning that if you play with low ping values (let's say <40ms) outside ranked, the game plays fine, otherwise you will experience totally unplayable games.To recap, gameplay 10 (wouldn't make major changes), graphic 9 (it's old but on PC you can enhance it), music/SFX 9 (totally enjoyable), netcode 2 (well, read above)			",325,125,7,44,34,2,49

												Amazing but considering how complicated it is to hook a ps3 controller to the computer and obviously motioninjoy is a spyware we can't use the controls that they give you. We can only do ""pokes"" As the wikia says pokes are little attacks. I'm glad they have a ps3 version since otherwise I would be stuck here forever at trying to connect my ps3 controller to the computer. I'm sure it's a fun game but we really need to fix this so that it has controls for the keyboard. My mum has already started to research on getting the ps3 version so please figure out something fast. But overall it's a great game the multiplayer system is wonderful and versus is pretty fun to do too. You will say that my review is long and me typing this is making it longer but I just wanted to make a detailed review on this new edition of the wonderful game that is street fighter. The series is going strong and I'm glad that it's on steam and that it has a trial for everyone to do for 2 days. If you add updates this could seriously be a good game! I hope it will get better and have more stuff for everyone to do! Right I'll stop this review now since it's getting seriously very long. Hope the creators see this review! Bye for now!

												DO NOT PICK UP THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE NEVER EXTENSIVELY PLAYED STREET FIGHTER BEFOREHANDPeople told me this would be a great place to start playing Street Fighter since I couldnt afford V. That was not true. This game's tutorial does not teach you anything adequately for online play, and as of now, all of the community has migrated. The mechanics are choppy and clunky for everyone but the most experienced of players, and after playing for almost 5 hours straight, I am unable to do a TUTORIAL PROMPTED 2-HIT COMBO due to the extremely specific and overly strict timing of these ""combo"" systems. I wouldn't even call them ""combos"". If you dont have a major in rocket science and advanced mathematics, or if you dont have unlimited free time and dedication to play this game for 1000+ hours just to get ""AVERAGE"", DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

												For fighting game fanatics only. This game is way too hard for a casual player, even on the lowest difficulties the AI can counter-play a less skilled player with impunity. Special moves require high manual dexeterity to be performed and Ultra combos... well let's say you will never see any casual player perform these moves. Street Fighter DS allowed you at least to put certain button combinations (like the Ultra Combo) onto the touch screen for one-tap controls.The several (seemingly deliberate) entry barriers for new players and the unforgiving difficulty are nothing for a casual player who wants a quick game and the Arcade-Style controls are a relict from the past.

												I really like this game, but the online multiplayer is unbearable at times and makes me want to quit. I keep playing this game hoping Capcom will fix thier net code but it's always the same. 40 -50% of my games are laggy. Enough to where i can't finish combos, block, tech, or focus attack. I have  300 mbps download speed and 25 upload and still can't bear with the lag. If you plan to play online I do not recommend this game.			",57,2,0,5,2,0,2

												Screen Tearing. Broken graphics. Massive lag.Bear in mind that I brought this game and it then downloaded Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition and demanded I fork out another £20 to ''upgrade''.**** Capcom and their shady practices. As much as I used to love Street Fighter, I'd rather just move on to Skullgirls or Blazblue - you know, companies that don't treat their fans like trash and actually download the correct game...

However I may just be stupid and its really simple, but at the moment I am not enjoying this game at then moment			",67,2,0,4,1,3,4

												I hope i help anyone with their decison on this game and be happy forward on with their games. please read this review.i put good work into it and it wont take much of your time please and thank you for your cooperation.this game is good.however this game is not for everbody.if your very patient,youll enjoy this game.if not you'll hate this game.the gameplay is pretty good and there are 44 characters.playing the game is like mixing colors in knowing what works & what doesnt and knowing how to use you character against others(training room is recommended for practice).the graphics looks good and there is matchmaking online. only thing i dont like focus.it feels it counters fundamentals and you can just easily focus.idk.its just me.ultras i feel people can just use it and the helath bars will be even again the next round is not affected at all by this except who wins.the super metter i feel does better because it carries over.ultra is spam it on an opening and youll get full damage without really earning it.it feels cheap now the negatives(oh boy). this game is insanely precise in execution on almost everything and online is functional and can be good at times,but it handicaps you because the links for combos have to be pressed at such a precise moment, even on beginner things & fluidity can make you drop things and be inconsistent because it feels weird compared to offline(get friends with good conenctions,recommended)there is no story unless you care about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade mode that is no where as good as mk9.no tutorial on how to play the game and many things and secrets the game wont tell you like option selects,plinking,etc.trials dont show you anything,just do moves.who are these characters,and barely any content to do in the game.its mostly barebones meaning all you have is endless, ranked, & training room.the other modes no one is using them.you have a replay channel,but since online is inconsistent sometimes,it can be hardly a prize.the ♥♥♥♥ed up part is that in omega mode,its allot easier to do all these combos because you have a bigger window and more accuracy and consistency to press the button to continue the combos(sfv combos feel like omega).its not insanely precise and you dont have to wait for the animation to finish. trust me, these things that should be easy when you learn them are hard as ♥♥♥♥.ive been using cammy for a long time and i refuse to believe that the game tells me i cant do crouching jab, jab, strong into spiral arrow because of online.thats unnacepptable.another thing is that this game was supposed to be optimized just like the consoles,what i mean is that when you practice on pc and then go play on consoles(except ps3 because i think pc is similiar to it when i played on that console) where the tournaments are on, everything is delayed and feels weird when you do your things, but spend enough time, youll get use to it. i thought it was impossbile, but i actually ended up doing pretty well in a tourney from home with pc to tourney with xbox 360. i spoke with combofiend and he said it was already established or to stay that way by capcom themselves. thats why they didnt change usf4 to make it easier like omega mode or make the pc version exactly like the consoles. that is ♥♥♥♥ed up! another thing i should tell you is that when you go online to fight someone, there is no way for you to know if youll have a good connection or a bad one because the bar rating which is black to green bars and in between, fluctuates. in green bars you might have a bad or a good connection, red,orange,black,etc. the only way to know the connection is to play that person once and sometimes its hard to really know just by one match because the game itself even offline is so precise already.this is why most tourney players dont consider online no where as steady as offline because its too easy to drop things and it constantly changes from the real thing which is offline where tournaments are played.you have to rely stuff like double tapping and p linking in order to not drop your moves instead of just simply doing the moves without doing such unneccessary execution! you feel your fighting the game itself rather than your opponent(like combofiend said lol!) there is no reason for you to make a game so hard when people will look for somthing hard to do in the game anyway! If i know how to do something i know how to do it!knowledge should always beat execution.ALWAYS BEATS EXECUTION!PERIOD.Also if your looking for good tourney players like me and others who know what they are doing with option selects,secrets,expliots, tech, and everything,good luck trying to find them on pc(consoles less hard though) because its hard to find them and youll find mostly people who do random stuff because they dont know any better and you even lose to them because of bad connection.this sucks!also the point system and matchmaking is bs.you have people who are over 10000 BP and all they did was do random moves you cant react to online.the ranking and point system is inconsistent it makes dummies look like pros.if this doesnt tell you how inconsistent online is,idk what does. i sometimes get discconected in matches,from steam in training,and even for winning one round in 2 out of 3.even sometimes the game freezes in lag spikes while playing & also keeps putting me with people that have lower points than me when i put more skilled in my settings which is suppose to put ones with higher points than me.WTF!?I even wanted to be #1 cammy and train hard for it, but why should i go through these problems anyway if online couldve been better fixed? it like walking for hours instead of waiting for a car that shouldve picked you up,but didnt when they were supposed to. its disapointing cause i really wanted to do it.anyway if you want this game get it at the lowest sale if your not sure,but i wouldnt recommend it if you have console.this game might die most likely & sfv is around the corner(if you want,get sfv instead)even if you have the game on console and want it on pc,just play it on console already unless you really want it. not much is differentthis is a fun game when you know what your doing,i just personally feel this game couldve been better with the things ive mentioned fixed, more things, easier inputs etc. i cant recommend this game to new people or even ones experienced from other games.there is just so much they have to do to get started like watch youtube videos on option selects,characters,etc.that its really a commitment your doing in order to be good at it.VERDICT: pc: 5/10 average console: 6/10 above average(pc has more problems online)i hope sfv is better than usf4 and improves on everything from the previous game and becomes great.get sfv if you dont want usf4,but if your going to get usf4,get it at least for the challenge.my experience was a struggle,but i wanted to try other games because i felt its good to have more knowledge from them and i was right.the decision to purchase the game is yours.the reason i dont give a thumbs up is because i dont reccomend this game at full price especially with dlc costumes because we all know capcom is so good at doing those things and whats mentioned,so its pretty fair i do that.Also i understand that things take time to get better at what your doing, but i think allot of people would agree with me that some things in the game didnt have to be what they are already.ive met people that have gotten frustrated over this game and left.those players i wouldnt balme them and they arent wrong either because capcom designed it that way.mkx and skullgirls are hard when you want to be really good at them,but they have allot better welcoming and comfort for those not that experienced.usf4 has nothing to offer to welcome outsiders.its horrible at tha area,but i guess that why sfvs looks like its going the way its going huh.(sigh) man i miss the old capcom.

It took me 41 mins to reconfigure the controls and I was still having problems with the controls and I feel like killing myself now. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy street fighter just not on PC buy it for the xbox 360 or wait for 5 to come out. overall worst gaming experience I have ever had.

If i know how to do something i know how to do it!knowledge should always beat execution.ALWAYS BEATS EXECUTION!PERIOD.Also if your looking for good tourney players like me and others who know what they are doing with option selects,secrets,expliots, tech, and everything,good luck trying to find them on pc(consoles less hard though) because its hard to find them and youll find mostly people who do random stuff because they dont know any better and you even lose to them because of bad connection.this sucks!also the point system and matchmaking is bs.you have people who are over 10000 BP and all they did was do random moves you cant react to online.the ranking and point system is inconsistent it makes dummies look like pros.if this doesnt tell you how inconsistent online is,idk what does. i sometimes get discconected in matches,from steam in training,and even for winning one round in 2 out of 3.even sometimes the game freezes in lag spikes while playing & also keeps putting me with people that have lower points than me when i put more skilled in my settings which is suppose to put ones with higher points than me.WTF!?I even wanted to be #1 cammy and train hard for it, but why should i go through these problems anyway if online couldve been better fixed? it like walking for hours instead of waiting for a car that shouldve picked you up,but didnt when they were supposed to. its disapointing cause i really wanted to do it.anyway if you want this game get it at the lowest sale if your not sure,but i wouldnt recommend it if you have console.this game might die most likely & sfv is around the corner(if you want,get sfv instead)even if you have the game on console and want it on pc,just play it on console already unless you really want it. not much is differentthis is a fun game when you know what your doing,i just personally feel this game couldve been better with the things ive mentioned fixed, more things, easier inputs etc. i cant recommend this game to new people or even ones experienced from other games.there is just so much they have to do to get started like watch youtube videos on option selects,characters,etc.that its really a commitment your doing in order to be good at it.VERDICT: pc: 5/10 average console: 6/10 above average(pc has more problems online)i hope sfv is better than usf4 and improves on everything from the previous game and becomes great.get sfv if you dont want usf4,but if your going to get usf4,get it at least for the challenge.my experience was a struggle,but i wanted to try other games because i felt its good to have more knowledge from them and i was right.the decision to purchase the game is yours.the reason i dont give a thumbs up is because i dont reccomend this game at full price especially with dlc costumes because we all know capcom is so good at doing those things and whats mentioned,so its pretty fair i do that.Also i understand that things take time to get better at what your doing, but i think allot of people would agree with me that some things in the game didnt have to be what they are already.ive met people that have gotten frustrated over this game and left.those players i wouldnt balme them and they arent wrong either because capcom designed it that way.mkx and skullgirls are hard when you want to be really good at them,but they have allot better welcoming and comfort for those not that experienced.usf4 has nothing to offer to welcome outsiders.its horrible at tha area,but i guess that why sfvs looks like its going the way its going huh.(sigh) man i miss the old capcom.

												The largest roster in a Street Fighter game to date, with incredibly solid mechanics and 4 editions worth of time to get everything nice and balanced. Not much in the line of single-player content compared to more story-oriented games like Blazblue or Guilty Gear (really just arcade runs and combo training), but it's a must-have for any competetive fighting game fan.

												Street fighter is a game that has far exceeded my expectations. I initially bought this for a blast in the past game that would give me something to play actively for fun; however, I did not expect the amount of mechanics that players would have figured out by now. There is so many more techniques and data you need to learn to be good at this game. There is Frame Data, Charge Buffering, Combo + Cancelling, and many more techniques. For the price this game is definitely worth it. Keyboard, gamestick, or gamepad all can be customized to be an enjoyable experience. Definitely would recommend this game to anyone I know.

												This game just isn't really my cup of tea. I can understand why other people may like it. I'm just not a huge fan myself because I think the fighting is too stiff and slow compared to some of my favorite fighting games like Mortal Kombat 9 and Super Smash Bros 4. Plus, I don't really care for the artstyle or the overall wackiness of the game. The only reason I have this game in the first place is because I got a free code for it in a Loot Crate I got a while back. ",159,17,0,8,6,1,5

												The Ultra Street Fighter IV upgrade is totally worth it. Capcom gave it to me for free for no reason because I owned Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition, when it says it costs $15 on the store page.

												Fun game, especially for local versus play. But going online pits you against players that seemingly know every single trick of the game and they can dish out combo's that just take you down in one go. The skill level was just way too high, matchmaking really seemed off. I'm actually torn between a positive/negative review. It's definitely fun for a short while. But as you go along, multiplayer is the only way to get a real challenge but because that's immediately way out of the league for most people, I wouldn't recommend this game.			",124,30,4,21,17,0,8

If you enjoy street fighter, i do feel you will enjoy this game. works well with whatever controller you have, works well with an arcade stick. all in all, a most posive experience on steam.10/10 would get punched in the face again!
