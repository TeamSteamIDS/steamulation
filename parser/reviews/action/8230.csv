												A part of the first season of Sam and Max point-and-click adventure game, the fourth episode is avaliable in Steam for free for you to try out.Sam and Max is usual adventure game with humor, with most puzzles making sense... yet you are probably going to spend time guessing what exactly you are supposed to do, like in most games if such kinds. Hell, single episode there may last for few hours if you have no idea what to do, or you may just get stuck if you never had experience playing adventure games before.As for the episode that is given to us, I can say that it has quite interesting concept/idea in this one, being related around Politics theme, first objective being punching president out of hypnotism, with more to come after that (with some nice music... tihi). It has enough content in it for me to say that you should try and beat this episode. Who knows, maybe you will like it enough to get the whole season pack?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The words that come into my mind when I think of Sam & Max would be as follows, Classic, Crude, Comedy, Fun, Old. Those words might mean something different for you but for me it means that the Sam and Max games (S&M) are fun games made after a classic series. There is one waf to tell for certain if you like the games, you could play this one. For the now cheap price of completley free you can play through Sam and Max: Able Lincoln Must Die to see if you like it. If you dont there is no harm done, if you do like it however there will be much harm done, atleast to your free time because you will be playing the Sam and Max series (maybe). So play this, afterall there is no harm in trying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though not a big point and click fan, I used to love the Sam and Max cartoon and used to play a demo version of this a while back, so this just brings back so much nostalgia. This  is how you write a game with  socio-political undertones, with subtly and humor, taking potshots at everything in your path. Not by being preachy or pandering.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back when individual episodes of Telltale Games' Sam & Max adventure games were for sale, they offered episode 4 of ""season"" 1 for free, presumably to draw in potential buyers. In my case, it worked.Episode 4 was probably a good choice, too. It has funny writing and pretty good puzzles for its season. Like the rest of the episodes, it's a staunchly traditional adventure game starring the wisecracking Freelance Police, and while it hasn't aged entirely gracefully in the looks department, it hits the difficulty sweet spot as such that when I first played it to completion, I didn't even need a walkthrough. (I used to be horrible at adventure games.)American patriots need not worry: you don't actually kill the real Abraham Lincoln in this game. His likeness does show up, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has great characters, dialogue, and the art style is a nice change of pace from other games. It's satyrical dialogue is wonderful and seperates it from the rest of the point-and-click style games that are out there. The only problem I have with the game is that the objectives seem fairly unrelated. This is my first Sam and Max game so maybe it's the style of the series that I'm missing, but the constant back-and-forth jumping between areas and activation of obscure points seem vaguely and loosely strung together. I fail to see the relationship between a decent amount of the objectives here. Not all of them- but more than a couple. Without a walkthrough I'd be lost in this. Other games in the genre at least have a box for obtaining more clues, I have yet to find this detail in the game but it'd definitely help. Like I said, maybe it's just me (the majority of reviews here are very positive) but this game doesn't feel as smooth as other Telltale games (i.e. Walking Dead, Back To The Future). I'm a fan of Telltale and everything else going on in the game, but I wouldn't recommend this one to a first-time player in this genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not sure what happened on this episode, but this is by far the worst one in the series.Unlike other bad point n' click adventure games, I enjoyed Sam & Max series because the puzzles were clever, funny and logical in a way the players would be able to figure out.However, towards the last part of the game, Sam & Max 104 suffers from random puzzle solutions that simply don't make sense, and the game requires the players to move from one visited location to the other visited location so often repeatedly on top of already terrible and slow controls.However, the humor was still present and aside from mentioned flaws teh game was enjoyable.

												Tp me honestly, it wasn't that good of a game. Yes, it may be interesting and fun for people in the Sam and Max community, but to me it wasn't un. It was as boring as Flappy Bird is maddening. I have nothing against the game, I just could not get behind it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a free point and click adventure game from Telltale games.  It's an episode similar to a Saturday morning cartoon where you see your characters through to the end and quite easily forget what happened along the way.  The actual length of the game is mostly made up of going back and forth from one place to another and actually thinking what else you could have missed.It's free anyways and finishing it is the best achievement I can get out of the experience.

												Sam & Max follows a formula, sure, but sitcom predictability is proving to be this series' secret strength -- it's rare to see a game conjure up such strong narrative continuity and familiarity in such short a time span.

												My Rating:""★★★★★""You can't go wrong for this price 8D!This game is full of goofy and silly humor, the voice acting is great and situations/puzzles are well thought out.The characters always have some witty stuff to say, and did I mention this game is 100% FREE!!!! Yep it's free, go get your copy while it still is.( but I think it's free forever)On the other hand of me really liking this game, I tend to get peed off at how slow Sam & Max's walk cycle can be sometimes,Like when you're in a room or a smallish area and you click something that is a few feet away Sam and Max will takes their sweet old time getting there. It gets annoying sometime when you're on a roll figuring things out :-P. Kinda wish they had some module to speed up the walk cycle in options.All in all it's a pretty neat free download to checkout.Game Type: Point & Click AdventureDifficulty: Some puzzles are a bit difficult however very rewarding once solved.
