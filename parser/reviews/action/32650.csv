												One of the best games I have ever played.. I cant explain it. I first started playing this game once it first came out. As being a DF/DF2/DFLW vet, I instantly enjoyed it. I made a few clans and went by the name with weird writing ""Prophet"" and was in/made several successful clans such as x1ABE and several others with a fellow old friend of mine I met ingame. I have had couple hundred hours of game play, same as my brother. I started young and was attached to this game! I cant explain how much pwnage I dished out with my M60e mowing through church walls and small walls killin people all day. or my silenced m4. ♥♥♥♥ I MISS THIS GAME. BUY IT NOW! ITS NOT TOO LATE TO REVIVE COMMUNITY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Definitely the weakest entry to the pre-3d delta force series. Uglier and clunkier than all 3 games leading up to it, pretty disappointing tbh.			",84,3,0,7,1,0,1

												so, i just got this game yesterday, and after playing the game, and looking at the negative reviews, i have to say i am disgusted! just about all of the reviews complain that the game is ugly... and at that, i laugh! because you know what, that just shows that they are most likely 10 year old graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s, because if they think this game is ugly, i sure as hell would love to see them play one of those old text based adventure games of the late 80's to early 90's. now that thats off my chest, i have to say, this game is faithful to the delta force series, when is was young, the only delta force game i had and played for countless hours, is delta force 2, (i have a delta force 2 review btw) and i have to say, this game, delta force task force dagger is awesome, the sounds are way better than delta force 2, there is a bigger and better variety of weapons, and the voices over the radio are way more realistic, with the crackling of the radio and what not. now sure, this game is not great graphics wise, but i promise, if you are a man, or an awesome women, this game is for you, its basicaly a better version of delta force 2, so, like in delta force 2, you are able to complete objectives in any fashion you can think of, do you want to find a hill or mountain and snipe with a suppressed sniper from a distance? you can do that, want to go in with a suppressed m4 and get up close and personel? you can do that, or do you want to go in loud and proud with explosives and heavy machine guns? you can do that as well. this game has limitless ways to complete mission, the maps are massive which gives you these options, the ai is pretty decent, and the sounds are amazing! so, if you are a man or women, and not a 10 year old graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, you should give this game or series a try, i doubt you will be dissapointed!    Edit: i forgot to mention, it works on my windows 10 asus! so even if you are sporting windows 10, give it a try! i really cant say enough about this, it makes you feel like a special forces operative, with the real world locations, realistic missions and sound!

												I have had this game for several years now, and have never stopped loving it. I was not able to play it for a while because of that craptastic mistake known as windows 8/8.1. There would be these stupid grey lines and the crosshairs on the scope would flicker in and out, but as soon as I got my free windows 10 upgrade I've never been happier. Anyways more about the game. If you want a good old fashion classic of a shooter Delta Force: Task Force Dagger is for you. I would recommend ANY of the Delta Force games to even my worst enemy. Task Force Dagger is perfectly done. Sure sure the graphics are out dated and it doesn't look like your Call of Retard Advanced Warfag, but have respect for this game. This game is pure gold, and honestly I don't think a game like this can ever be done again, by anyone except Novalogic. More about the game. You can play as one of several SpecOps teams from around the world. Force Recon, SAS, Ranger, Pararescue, C.I.A Special Activities Division.. the flippin aussies. You are Vipper 33 and you are apart of Task Force Dagger, you mission is to shoot the duck out of abeebs (terrorist, I call them abeebs) You go behind enemy lines, destroy communications, snag documents, destroy heavy weapons, all while in (for it's day) stunning maps. The maps are HUGE. You can venture off anywhere and discover new areas. Honestly once I was in the first mission I went to the terrorist command base and up on a mountain there was a whole nother facility that wasn't even part of the mission, went there... terrorist don't know how to dodge. I've gone roaming through out the world and have found random patrols of terrorist. I've discovered lakes. It's basicly kinda like Arma on the free roam Combat Mode, except all the time. It's true there aren't a ton of missions, but honestly, once you buy this game, and you play it that first time... you wont care. This game is worth constant replays. Even now when I'm busy playing BF4, DOOM BFG, all of these others, I still can't help going back to this gold mine of a game.10/10 - Uranus9.5/10 Pluto9.9/10 Mars10/10 Mercury10/10 Earth10/10 Jupiter10/10 Uncle Phil9.6/10 Grandma11/10 Your Mom.

												Funny that a game could be made with the same engine as Deltaforce: Landwarrior, an excellent game, and suck so bad. The mission programming on this game is so random and all over, and at the same time, incredibly vague.			",231,35,12,43,20,1,26

												Comparing to Delta Force Land Warrior, the missions arent that amusing but the gameplay is still remain fun. Kinda wish they made it a bit more clear on the objective like Land Warrior. But i'll still recommend it. And like Land Warrior, i cant guarantee any multiplayer.			",284,30,0,7,2,0,3

												Shovelware. Using the Delta Force brandname and the Land Warrior engine, this game was rushed out the gate in order to capitalize on the invasion of Afghanistan. Not only is the game buggy and unpolished, but missions are ridiculously unrealistic and manage to incorporate many common myths and misconceptions about the conflict, thanks to the low standards of research that went into rushing the game. Definitely the low point of the series.			",236,81,1,37,22,2,51

												This is what Delta Force Land Warrior should have been. Many of the bugs are fixed and patched and the game feels as if it is a more completed experience overall. It also has one feature that made this Delta Force stand out from the crowd. Allowing you to choose which military organization you wish to be affiliated with. It doesn't change anything about the game but allowing you have some uniqueness to your character makes the stand out.			",139,3,0,15,11,0,33

												Considering all the other games that were out by 2002, there is no reason to ever play this unpolished turd.  Land Warrior was bad, but felt like a game.  This is many times worse. ",144,29,0,27,8,1,28

												Delta Force Task Force DaggerThis Is a very addictive game. I honestly think this is an amazing game. Wonderful grpahics, weapons are plentiful. Missions are always unpredictable.Its straight to the point and easy to get use to. This game is based on the events of 2001 terrorism attacks in Afghanistan. Everything is so real. I don't care what anyone else thinks. I love this game I play heaps of this at night.If you are true Supporter of DELTA FORCE the series. This is a great game to have in your collection. Before COD and Battlefield, Delta Force was around. I am very happy Steam recognises Delta Force as a serious combat game.I hope to see more games from NOVALOGIC in the future.This is the game which defines military  FPS. This game is for real players, not arcade style like COD.DELTA FORCE TASK FORCE DAGGER = AWESOMENESS. 10/10			",41,1,5,0,1,0,0

												Pros:-Nice old FPS;-Long Single Player campaign;-Works on Windows 10;-Comes on cheap bundle on Steam.Cons:-Delta Force Land Warrior, its predecessor, is shorter but smoother;-A little buggy;-Some missions are not self-explanatory enough. You may need some trial and error;-Some missions are long and have ambushes. You may need save and load.Tips:-Increase Windows swap file size so you don't have to configure video settings every time you open the game;-Get Fullscreen with the software dgVoodoo, putting it on the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Delta Force Task Force Dagger"".
