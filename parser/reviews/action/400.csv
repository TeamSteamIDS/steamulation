												Portal is a first person action game of logic and strategy developed by Valve in 2007 and released in a package called The Orange Box .The player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until ...... well I will not spoil the  game ....Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer. Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.The game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.Now that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box. El jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego....En cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años. Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.A lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento.El juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto. Es una oda a la creatividad.Su secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente. El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones. El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX. Ahora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will be brief: I downloaded demo and played for 5 minutes. Then I removed it, went to the store and bought  Portal 1-2  bundle. That same f'n day - 16 of July, 2011. The consequences: 50+ hours, all challenges completed and the place earned in my digital heart for ever.The first Portal is for sure shorter, has less story and features than the sequel. Though it has something... the mistery, the charm, the feel of menace, elegant sci-fi scent and terrific GLaDOS who hasn't gone over the top yet. Valve, put your sorry Dota 2 down and please make games like this just like you don't care.			",302,82,13,36,15,6,33

												Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life. We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize. A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust. A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious. We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals. But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses. Ok, if you're already confused, I understand. Just buy the damn game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The cake is a lie!""It is, but Portal does not lie as it truly is a good game! While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called ""chambers"" but in a more difficult version.I'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.I like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.Portal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.Oh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)PS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal. In any case, my review is based on a gameplay time of roughly 15-20 hours.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Portal  Original Release: 2007 Genre Tags: Innovative; Puzzle; Sci-Fi; Action; Funny My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-3 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers  REVIEWPortal is an amazing experience. In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe Portal is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.I say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.But what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.Honestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy Portal, I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”If you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing Portal, then I envy you. Stop thinking about it and just go for it.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												Portal is definitely a one-of-a-kind type of game. It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.You awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! While on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.What strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.But, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!When cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.This game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.			",111,8,0,6,5,1,3

Its a fun little puzzle game and has extra puzzles for people that like hard stuff.Pro:-Fun puzzles.-Great and humorous story.-Extra hard puzzle chambers and challenges.-Very fun to think with portalsCons:-Short-Some of the puzzle solutions are so obvious its hard to find the solution.I recommend turning AA up to the max while playing.I give this game a 9/10.

Summary (TL;DR)Portal is among one of the best games in my library, I am honestly suprised I didn't play this game sooner given how much I've heard about this game before. The storyline was very enjoyable, the graphics are great (even compared to the graphics for games in 2015) and the mechanics were probably the most fun to play around with.This game is well priced, and there's a ton of mods to enhance your game experience even further!Pros Great storyline Great graphics Amazing mechanics Progressively gets more challenging A pretty universal game, there's something here for every type of gamer. Challenging achievements Controller support Has subtitles Neutral Points I felt the storyline was a bit short, but I'm not counting that against it. Cake song was awesome- See end credits.Cons The first game to ever make me feel motion sickness from messing around with the portalsRating9/10			",136,31,0,21,12,1,8

												Anyone else agrees that valve make really depressing games? The source engine has great physics but always looked strangley dull to me. Anyone else realise no matter what game you play, there is always some sort of nature involved. In 99% of games you will at least see grass, trees, plants, the sky, the sun or at least other characters. But not this game. Portal has no life in it at all, and no one else in the game at all (the only enemies you will see are the turrets which are only in very few segments). You can't even see the sky, you are completely trapped and deprived  in a colourless building which is why the companion cube, turrets and glados are so memorable because they are the only things you are exposed to in the entire game. Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is ♥♥♥♥ing genius!!!

												Life was meaningless.I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known.  Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about ""symptoms of enrichment center testing"" and ""perceiving inanimate objects as alive"" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.We continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.""However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.""I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  ""While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.""""You could never be a burden to me!"" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.""You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,"" said my boss.  ""Congratulations.""11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.			",36,3,0,6,9,1,15

Portal (Puzzle-platformer)This is a title that most gamers have played, and if not played, have at least heard of.  If -- like me -- you are late to the party and have yet to play the game, this review is for you... and hey, there's CAKE!There are tabs for the various options:- Keyboard, where you can re-map keys- Mouse, where you can enable the controller- Audio, with separate sliders for Game & Music.  Subtitles are NOT the default. I highly suggest turning them on, as the mechanical voice is hard to understand.- Video, where you can choose Full Screen vs. Windowed, Aspect Ratio, Brightness, Advanced, and Resolution (up to 1920x1080)I was happy to find that the game is mostly controller-compatible... The crouch function doesn't seem to be mapped, so if you're going to use a gamepad, use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to crouch ;)The concept is simple enough.  You (will) have two guns, one that produces a blue portal, and one that gives you an orange portal.  In one, out the other.  Solve puzzles and move on to the next area.  Easy right?Well... Yes and no.  The portals themselves aren't difficult to figure out, but you have to master the physics involved to truly progress in the game.  I had a hell of a time grasping the this point because I was so disoriented when I was falling.  Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal. There is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide.  I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).But.. what story?  O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all!  Sure it was interesting, but story-rich?  But then... finally... It all changed.  Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.You will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.)  Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.Speaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game.  There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.It's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like The Talos Principle.  Portal is on the short side, but well worth playing if you enjoy puzzle-adventures, especially if you plan on playing Portal 2.			",520,547,5,64,35,4,42

												*something something tired cake meme*Seriously this game is a classic. Funny, challenging and unique gameplay combined with a sarcastic AI judging your every action. Not much else can be said about this game that hasn't been said already. If you haven't bought this game yet, do it. It is worth every cent, I promise you.			",113,29,0,23,10,1,1

												There is no other game for me personally, that I would consider perfect, other than Portal.There is literally NOTHING flawed in the game, nothing at all I can think of.The pacing is impeccable, with the correct timing on music and ambient playback with the story.It covers all types of pacing with music and ambience in gameplay, from the slow and depressing downward spiral of thinking you may never escape (Self Esteem Fund from the OST), to the fast paced finale music of the game. The game made me go through so many emotions all in the expanse of my first time playing around 3 hours.The game is UNBELIEVABLY clever, yet doesn't need to break the fourth wall to do that, which is incredibly impressive.The game's humour is absolutely timeless, it is old as hell (9 years from this review point), and yet the jokes are still brilliant. witty, and dark. There are almost NO games that do it on the same caliber of Portal, hell, not even Portal 2 could live up to this godly creation.The puzzles are beautifully made, completely fair (no fidgety rubbish) and once again, timeless in the sense of enjoyment. Visually, you might think this game is nothing to write home about, but to me, once again the game shows how age will NEVER affect this game. NEVER. simplistic visuals will always be timeless, intricate wank in videogames will ensure it stays contemporary.I think I play through Portal 1 at least once a year. The game is short, and scales next to nothing in comparison to other games, but unlike those said games, which take hours upon hours of your life, portal will only take an hour or two. But it stays with you for life, and allows you to experience true perfection in a videogame.I generally hate analogies for this kind of stuff, but if you can think of some other medium with a perfect technicality and timelessness to it (think of Citizen Kane or something), then Portal is that kind of game.I think most people in the year 2016 will have played this by now, but sometimes you just gotta pour your heart out for something you cherish a bunch.Valve may not be the greatest company, but some small dev team in there brought us absolute perfection, and I thank them for this experience with complete content.

												Different people like different games. If you like shooter but don't like RPG, it's fine, don't play RPG. If you like both, play both. But once in a while, a game comes along that is so great that EVERY SINGLE GAMER should play it, even if they don't like games of that genre. Portal is one such game. Portal is a first person puzzle game. It was a great game when it came out, it's a great game even now. Even if you don't play puzzle games, you should still give it a try. The puzzles aren't too difficult. The game slowly introduces new mechanic so that it's really easy to grasp. And solving the puzzles are soooooo satisfying! What's more? It's a puzzle game that has a great background story and although there is only one character other than the main protagonist, it's one of the best NPC in video game history. I don't think I have ever loved an NPC that tried to kill me so bad as much I love GladOS. Portal 1 and 2 are THE BEST puzzle games I have played in my life and are two of the best games of any genreI have played in my life.			",238,18,7,24,28,0,48

												Portal is a unique puzzle game that will bend your mind in ways you never thought were possible. Although it is a short game, Portal will have you at the edge of your seat just waiting to see what crazy experiment GLaDOS has in store for you. Don't let the 3 hour main quest deprive you from buying this game. Portal is a enjoyable experience that I will come back to. And yes you will be baked and then there will be cake.

 One of the most amazing original and unique games I have ever played Holy crap, I've never been so addicted to a game in my LIFE, and I've played hundreds of 'em! I literally could not leave my computer until I had beaten it and figured out all the puzzles for myself.... AMAZING gameplay, and quite humorous as well, I might add! (listen to ""Still Alive"" during the credits....lol!).An amazing game that requires you to think in a new and unique way. Add in the ability to replay the maps with even harder difficulty and challenges adds to the replayablilty. Looking forward to the maps the online community is bound to make! I guess I dont made a single puzzle as it should be done. My Friend who watched the whole 3 hours while playing always said: ""Are you kidding me? No way, that worked man!!!"" xD  ",660,194,24,70,31,10,52

												Everything that you've heard about 'Portal' is true. Well, if you've heard nothing but great things about it, that is. Because this is easily one of the greatest puzzle games to ever be created. Hell, it may even be one of the greatest games created, period. It's like 'Half Life 2' but on crack! You thought crack was bad for you, didn't you? Well it turns out that crack is good when combined with elements of puzzle solving and first person shooters. 'Portal' may be short, but it's pretty damn cheap too. And when you take into consideration the difficulty of the added challenges after you've completed the story, it should take a decent amount of time to complete.Nevertheless, it's refreshing to see a first person 'shooter' without bullets and if you haven't picked this game up that's something that you should probably be doing right about now.

Short Verdict: A great puzzle game strongly based on spatial orientation, physics and some platforming. If you don't know it already, the basic premise is having a gun capable of shooting two portals, between which you can travel to solve puzzles. Portal is a classic and, as you'll see below, I can hardly say anything bad about it. You should at least try it (there's a demo available, or so it seems)!Pros: Smart puzzles, with great balance between pure thinking and skills (a bit too much on the skills side for my personal taste, but I wouldn't say it's a con) Great atmosphere that builds up throughout the game Fun side-quests, like finding radios and taking them to the right spot, and also putting down security cameras Even has advanced levels and challenges for hardcore playersCons: Apart from Least Portals, I couldn't find challenges any fun, especially the Least Steps challenge. Carrying objects around is slightly too clumsy. For instance, I'd like to be able to rotate what I'm carrying.Bought on: Got it as a gift from Xsesis! Thanks a lot! It's been as cheap as US$ 1.99 (or R$ 3,99) on Steam. That's a steal! Definitely worth more.			",2593,1146,60,256,279,22,324

												Portal is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion. The events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.The portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.After you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.Portal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1591,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Portal is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in October 2007. You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.Portal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.The campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.Portal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.Portal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.  Conclusion  Portal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.  Rating  Overall: 7/10  Pros  - The slow-burn approach to the story.- The gameplay that refreshes the FPS genre.- The very detailed portal gun with excellent animations.- The emphasis of creativity in the levels.  Cons  - Length of campaign.- The simplicity in half of the levels. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I won't lie. I have never played Portal before January 3rd, 2016. Sure, I've seen videos of Portal & seen my friends play it on their PCs, but as for myself - I have never played Portal before then.So I'm glad I got it gifted by a friend right before the sale ended.Did I enjoy my time playing this game?Well obviously I did.Time to review.The StoryPortal's story is already pretty well known and it's a rather simple one as well. And that's what I like about it. It's a very simple story to grasp & follow with enough bits & pieces of vagueness like the random rooms with writings & stuff all over it really add to it. I would go in depth more about it, but there's really all there is to say about it. It's just such a simple story that I'm left with barely any words on how to describe my opinion on it.I would make a separate section for the ""Characters"", but really, the only notable character throughout the entire game is GLaDOS. Starting off as this rather friendly robot voice telling you that you're doing a good job & proceeds to explain what each puzzle does and whatnot and then by the end turning into the game's enemy was great. I hardly ever got bored while playing, honestly.Yeah, that's all I can say on the story aspect.The GameplayAs per Valve tradition, this game uses the oh-so-beloved Source engine. Because of this, the gameplay really doesn't need much explanation. In this game, you solve puzzles or ""tests"" as GLaDOS calls them. At the beginning you go around the testing rooms just picking up & placing boxes on buttons to proceed, later get a portal gun that fires only blue portals to help with these tests & lastly you get to upgrade your portal gun to also place orange portals, giving you far more mobility to, basically do the same thing - place boxes on buttons. You also do things like redirecting energy balls into receivers to open doors. That is a very ""in a nutshell"" description of what you do in this game, but it's just enough to give you an idea of whether or not it's your type of ""thing"".In lamence terms - this is a puzzle game. But it's far better than the way I described it here. Trust me.Are there any other guns besides the portal gun?Nope.Can the portal gun damage enemies?Nope.This game is purely puzzle-based and it's a nice change of pace for the first-person genre, really.It was a very relaxing experience, if anything, even the times when the game got tense.The PresentationNote: This section covers the game's graphics, performance, voice acting and soundtrack.How are the game's graphics? They are simple, but god they look good. I've played this game on the lowest settings since my computer is a piece of trash & I was stunned at how great the game looked on 800x600 with lowest settings. Really! And the performance of the game was also rather noteworthy! Again - I am using a totally trash computer and this game managed to play out rather pleasantly at 40-50 FPS average, with it dipping below 15 when there were lots of particles involved. I am super impressed, really! The voice acting for the turrets & GLaDOS was tremendous. They felt realistic, given their appearance and it gave off the atmosphere that they are, indeed, robots. Lastly, the soundtrack - I...didn't hear much of the soundtrack, I think this game has like 4 songs total. However, the songs that did play were pretty good. Loved the ending piece ""Still Alive"" a lot though. Great song.Final VerdictOverall, I think I have been missing out all these years by not playing Portal. It's a very relaxing game, even during tense parts & most importantly - I had a fun time.There's one huge drawback to it - the game is only 2 hours long.But, regardless, it was great & I highly recommend this game.Portal gets a score of:7.5/10Short, but relaxing and it can work on pretty low-spec computers as well.Recommended!

												There are a few games that I can recommend to everyone and will continue to recommend to everyone until the end of time. Portal is just one of these games-- where a gamer can fall in love and someone new to video games can find a challenging and engaging experience that tests your mind. Each level is designed to build up the gamer to feel confident that the challenges aren't impossible and by the end of the game you feel as though you're the only one that could have possibly thought of that particular answer... of course there are only a single answer for each level but Portal is built for you to enjoy every moment of the game. 10/10 great game			",24,13,0,3,1,0,1

												Portal is one of the most fun experiences I've had in gaming. The plot is simple; Your name is Chell, you're being tested in a research zone named Aperture Laboratories. You're only contact is an Ai named GLaDOS. She gives you various hints on how to pass the chambers and provides a bit of backstory to the events that happened prior to the game. You get a portal gun early on in the game which will allow you to create easy ways to travel from one part of the room to the other. But they can only generate portals on solid concrete.The chambers get progressively harder and all the while GLaDOS becomes more malicious in her comments. For completing all the trials your character is promised cake and grief counseling in the end. Portal is a great puzzle game. The gameplay is really fun and GLaDOS has some of the funniest and creepiest lines of any video game character. Some of the chambers can be pretty frustrating but once you figure out what to do, you'll have a lot of fun. This game challenges the mind and gives you a great sense of satisfaction when you've beaten the game. It's an all around great experience.			",670,171,28,41,67,10,67

Not playing Portal is a big mistakeNo seriously. What are you doing with your life? How could you ignore this masterpiece for so long? You probably think your efforts will be rewarded with cake. It won't. The reward is the game itself.Positive:- One of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life.- Hilarious, incredible, and amazing script and voice acting. Shout-outs to GLaDOS. It still amazes me that the one and only voiced character will entertain, anger, surprise and sadden you throughout the game. - Companion cube loves you <3.- Puzzles are well throughout out and designed.- Very friendly learning-curve. - This game is perfect for both gaming beginners and veterans. Beginners are taught how to handle gradually-tougher puzzles, making Portal very non-frustrating. Veterans on the other hand will encounter challenging puzzles along the way. - Replay value to the max.- Great ending-credits song.- Graphically the game still holds up.Negative:- There is no cake.Conclusion:What are you still reading this for? Play Portal already! ",191,40,3,20,12,2,11

												I enjoy puzzle games, so I bought Portal expecting some puzzles, and that's exactly what i got. It really makes you think, and challenges your brain to solve complicated problems. There's 19 main levels, a long escape level, and an ending boss fight. It only takes a few hours to complete, but it's worth your money. The game isn't just a puzzle game, though. It has an interesting storyline, too. The ending of the game makes you wonder, ""Well, what happens next?"" I bought both Portal and Portal 2 in a bundle, expecting that I would want to play the second game too, and I was right! Lots of people play only Portal 2 and not Portal, but I would highly reccomend playing Portal before even opening Portal 2. Fantastic game!			",12,2,0,1,0,0,0

												Portal is a fascinating puzzle game that was first introduced in the Orange Box, a bundle of random Valve games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2. The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.			",74,16,1,2,3,2,1

 Portal	 Pros: + Classic+ Puzzles can be done without walkthrough help.+ Fun Puzzles With A Nice LIttle Story+ Extra Difficult Levels+ Cake Cons: - Short- No Real Replay Value- Lies Review I was always hesitant to buy Portal for I am not a fan of puzzle games, but it was on sale and everyone told me it was great so I got it and I was happy with what I bought. Portal 1 and 2 are the only puzzle games that I have played and enjoyed. That is high praise for I played many puzzle games and the Portal series are the only ones I liked. You play as a human test subject and try to complete puzzles with a portal gun. If you like puzzle games with a nice little story this is the game for you. There is a reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. I suggest buying this on sale.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

												Portal is a very interesting game, your given a gun, and your main goal is to complete all the tests chambers with  that gun, without getting killed, therefore you will earn yourself cake  The cake is a lie!	 . Portal has it's pros and cons, some of which are the concept is absoulutley...AMAZING! You will probably never see a game like this again, so it's best to get your hands on it. The music? There is none....just kidding, beat the game and you will find yourself one of the best songs you will ever hear. This game is actually kind of scary too, some of the sound effects and looks, can give you the spooks, and that's more in Portal 2 though, since it has creepy looks at the beginning, loud noises and all the goodies you could imagine. Here's the bad part, theres only about 3 hours of gameplay. If your looking to get all the achievements, it's right around 30 hours, and theres only like 12? 13? They're ridiculously hard. Some of them, requires you to move 2 steps. HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU DO THAT? Yea, the achievements are hard. Second game? Theres 1 achievement thats tough, get 1 friend who's NEVER done co-op before, it can be tricky, but it's still worth it. Both games are filled with story. If there was a third one, I'd totally get it, without a hesitation.			",125,12,2,9,12,1,11

												Honestly? Good stuff. Challenging, but not to the point of total frustration. Decent story, really suspenseful buildup. Game keeps you thinking and on your toes, proposing new elements every few levels. For basically a test run of the concept, the developers did extremely well. Definitely one of my top-rated games :)			",10,1,0,3,1,1,0

												TL;DR: Portal is a great game with near-perfect level design and lots of enjoyable mechanics. The modes outside of the main mode aren't very good, but if you're looking for a solid game that will take you a few hours to beat, this is the game for you.	Portal is a game where you try to get from point A to point B by using different mechanics such as portals and cubes. The game does an outstanding job introducing its mechanics gradually, so that way the player isn't confused nor bored. The game's story, level design, mechanics, art design, and progression are amazing, however the alternate game modes (namely being the steps and time challenges) are a bit lackluster. LEVEL DESIGN 	The levels in Portal are simply amazing with everything in each level working together to bring the player a great experience. Everywhere the player needs to go is highlighted by an object or an art asset, so the player never feels lost. Even though this may seem hand-holding or too easy, the game will still leave enough puzzles to the player to add enjoyable gameplay with a large sense of satisfaction at the end of each puzzle. Some of the levels in the game have different shortcuts that only experience players will find. These shortcuts add replayability to the later few levels of the game, as the player will most likely not find all of the shortcuts in his or her first playthrough of the game. MECHANICS 	Portal's mechanics are very consistent throughout the game, and compliment the level design. Portal does a great job of keeping the mechanics consistent so the player knows exactly what to do. For example, you cannot place portals on dark surfaces or metal throughout the entire game. All of the games mechanics interact with the level design to create a cohesive puzzle that is extremely entertaining. In the game, every time you see a large button, you know that there is a cube nearby, and the level does a nice job of explaining where the cube is. Also, in the earlier levels where momentum is needed to solve a puzzle, there is always an extended piston so the player knows where to place his or her's portal. The piston tells the player that momentum will be involved, so the level design and mechanics work well together. ART DESIGN 	The art design in Portal is very simplistic, which puts emphasis on the different aspects of each puzzle. It's very hard to get lost in Portal, because the puzzles stand out so much against their environment. In Portal, because everything is so simple, it gives the player a sense of ""Everything is here for a purpose."" The art style also does a great job of telling a story. In the game, certain areas opt-out of using standard lights, and instead use these small rooms hidden behind opaque windows to give the player a feeling of being watched. The art design in Portal works really well with the gameplay and the theme. ADVANCED MAPS 	The advanced maps in Portal add a little bit more to the game, but I don't think they're anything to write home about. The advanced maps in Portal add obstacles, and remove shortcuts to the already existing levels to make them harder. I didn't spend much time with the advanced levels, as they're built on the same maps from the main game, because I feel the main game's maps are a lot more open with what way you solve the puzzle. Each advanced map has only one or two ways to solve the puzzle, whereas the main game of Portal has lots of different ways to solve each puzzle. Overall, I prefer when there are lots of ways to solve a puzzle as opposed to just having one way, so I didn't enjoy the advanced maps as much. CHALLENGES 	In Portal, there is a separate mode called ""Challenges."" The challenge maps are the exact same maps from the main game, however you have a second goal, such as using the least number of portals, taking the least amount of steps, and completing the level as fast as possible. Completing each one of the later levels with the least amount of portals I found pretty clever and fun, but the other challenges have lots of problems. I found the least number of steps challenge to be ridiculous and unenjoyable. The mechanics needed to complete the level with a gold rating, I found to be pretty frustrating and irritating to pull off. Another issue with the steps challenge is Chamber 17. In Chamber 17, most of the level has nowhere to put a portal. Having nowhere to put a portal completely takes away from the challenge, and becomes an annoying game of timing each jump. The final challenge is the time challenge. In theory, this challenge should be pretty fun as it let's anybody try to be a speedrunner. However, for a few of the challenges, the time given to get gold is extremely low, and turns the challenge into constantly saving and reloading. This problem could easily be solved by giving the player a few more seconds to get gold. Overall, most of the challenges are not fun, but they do add lots of replay value as the player must try each challenge over and over again until he or she gets gold. DEVELOPER COMMENTARY 	The Developer Commentary in Portal is put together well, and is pretty interesting. If you're interested in the development of games, including art design, voice acting, and level design, then I recommend playing through the Developer Commentary.Portal as a whole is an amazing game, that has incredible level design. The game does have some problems in its other game modes, but the main game is still great. If you are even remotely into first-person games or puzzle games I strongly recommend this game.

												Portal is a first person puzzle series made by valve themselfs. So before we jump into this review we must praise our lord and savoir Gabe Newell.There are many more good points than I expected there to be for an 7 year old game. The graphics are very good seeing as the age of the game, you could say it's graphically better than some current ones, no offense to developpers who don't focus on the graphical aspect. You get guided along the way with a robot voice called Glados and I must say she has more humor than the most game characters. For example she says ""Your test is almost over and after you""ll be baked and then there will be cake."" The humour itself in this game was also very good, the boss level was very entertaining thanks to all the jokes it had and also the ending was pretty ironic because you""ll be the one eating the cake. The ending song was actually amazing, I'm going to download it some time after writing this review. You can solve the puzzles using companion cubes or normal cubes and using your portal gun. The portal gun has two portals a blue one and an orange one and when you pass through one of them you come out of the other one. The controls are not that hard to understand, I barely changed any to my likings. The puzzles get harder each level but there are many useful checkpoints so it makes it not as bad when you die or get stuck.There are a few minor things about this gem but this are just me noticing details while playing along. You can apparantly save when you are dead or about to respawn rather which is not that useful but I accidentally did that when playing. I was dying from drowning in a puzzle and I saved because I wanted to get back another day and it set my checkpoint to that death so it kept respawning me there. I sometime was doubting if I could portal on some wall or floors. There are three colors in this game, walls or floors rather said, those are black, beige and white. But since beige looks a lot like white you weren't sure if you could portal on it.   I'm doubting still why you are taking time reading this, still thankful though, and not buying this game. Even at full price at this moment it isn't a waste of money and don't mind the gametime as there are many bonusmaps and such which I didn't dig into (yet).			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												Yes we all know how brilliant this game is, so I'll skip all that and cut right to the critical points. This game is a little on the short side, but the content is still really good. This game took me longer then most since I had to deal with serious feelings of nausea and motion sickness.  For those considering playing this, if you have issues with motion sickness, consider yourselves warned, since POV changes constantly in some puzzles . All in all I'm very glad that I finally beat it without losing a meal. The song at the end of the game is hysterical. This was a great setup for the much more fleshed out Portal 2.

												A game I just finished roughly in about 2 - 3 hours (the difference being all the ""figuring out"" time), Portal is a game certainly worth owning.This is from a person who blindly bought Portal 2 without any prior knowledge of its earlier surprise success or without the imagination necessary to fathom how ""portal mechanics"" in of itself, without any other additive, be a good game.Though I enjoyed the pacing, character dynamics, and indirect indie movie-like world building in Portal 2 more, going back to see how it all began will help explain particular jokes and flesh out many of GlaDOS's warped programming. If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)One complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.All in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games. Believe the hype or challenge it, either way, playing any entry from the series will add something you'll cherish in your life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal was one of the games that inspired me to start pursuing a job in the games industry.  Portal is a unique blend of the puzzle, FPS, and (to some extent) first-person platformer genres.The game, for the most part, is a tutorial made into a full game.  This is, however, not a bad thing at all.  The game does its job exceptionally well to ensure the new mechanic, and namesake of the game, Portals, are taught to the player with little room for confusion.  This is an exceptional feat when Portals force players to think differently about the spaces around them, and how to traverse them.Besides enjoyable puzzles and interesting environments to explore, the game employs GLaDOS, effectively the narrator of the game, to serve as a means of adding dark comedy to the mix.  GLaDOS's unique sense of humor makes players want to continue through the game to discover both the secrets of the facility they wake up trapped within, and hear what witty remarks GLaDOS will say next.To conclude, I would recommend Portal to any fans of puzzle games, as well as any fans of FPS or casual games.

												Portal is a unique and mind-bending experience that I am so grateful to have the chance to play. There aren't many people who don't know this game or haven't played it. If you haven't already got this game I urge you to get your card out and buy it straight away. It's a one of a kind and with the sequel being even more astonishing it is definetly worth the money. From the iconic ending, which has one of the most catchiest songs I have ever listened to, to the briliant and hilarious dialogue. It is simply a masterpiece!However, there are times where it can feel a tiny bit repetitive and a bit too hard for most average people like me. But it will never stop you from wanting more and it will never stop you from having a briliant experience.9.5/10Truly one of the greatest games I have ever played.			",9,2,0,0,2,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Portal: This game is probably one of the most innovative titles of the decade. You play as the female protagonist named Chell. In the beginning of the game, Chell awakes inside of a glass room. A radio playing some upbeat music is the only noise heard until an eerie voice from the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS) fills the air. GLaDOS informs Chell about some very valuable tests that need to be performedPortal is a pure surprise of enjoyment. you will get hooked on this game wishing for more by the end. and this game opens up the door for future implementation in valve games that should be very fun.Portal is still revolutionary. The challenging puzzles and clever dialog are beautifully mixed together. Plus, the fact that you're able to reach each goal using different methods truly makes the game personal and memorable for each person.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

There is no fat in this game and seasoned players can probably beat it in an hour, but that is good. The game is kept short and sweet all while being pushed forward by a narrator / villain GLaDOS or however it is spelled. The passive aggressive villain.

Pros:- Unique gameplay.- Great storyline.- The end credits song.- Runs perfect on low spec PCs.- For a 2007 game, the graphics are pretty good looking.- Lots of challenge.Cons:- Messing around with portals made me kinda sick.- The game's too short.Overall, Portal is a great game and it's worth getting it even on full price. It offers lots of challenge, as I mentioned before on the pros of the game, and you can pretty much have lots of fun.

												I can easily say that portal is one of Valve's best games. The idea of using portals to solve puzzles and avoid obstacles is just great. My only complaint is that it's rather short, but there are bonus levels that are the original test chambers but with an increase in difficulty. If you haven't purchased portal yet, then I would suggest waiting until the summer sale to buy the portal bundle for dirt cheap like I did.			",23,5,0,1,3,1,2

 Amazing! You'd never have thought FPS and puzzle could go together, but Portal made it happen- not only did it do that, but it's a really fun experience. Amazing graphics, sinisterly clinical test chambers and an unforgettable villain in GLaDOS really is the cherry on the cake. If there was cake... but it was all lies!!!My score: 10/10			",9,1,0,0,2,0,0

												Valve tried something different this time, they heavily focuses on physics to create one of the best puzzle games ever created. Portal offers players a rather unconventional mechanic to play games, using a portal gun, the users will have to clear the so called test chambers in order to proceed to the next testing areas. The innovation present in this game is so notorious players will love it from the beggining to the finish.+Fun physics-based puzzles+Appealing visual-art+Relaxing soundtrack+Highly innovative+Charismatic enemy-Poor narrative92/100 Amazing ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly it's the game I have the fondest memories of. The atmosphere of Portal is one of a kind, really embraces the loneliness and suspicious peace of the facility keeping you in suspense but not TOO much, as that'd get tiring really fast. Main character looks human, antagonist is well-written, the visual cues are stunning and the storytelling kept me curious enough to care about the game even after I finished it. It's a great story with great visuals and the one game that had me interested in games in general			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best first person games ever made in the history of video gaming. Amazing idea which was executed brilliantly. A completely different approach to puzzles which requires a lot of thinking and patience of course. Don't waste your time on walkthroughs. That's the beauty of this game. You might spend hours on some test chambers but trust me, this game's worth every second you spend on it. Puzzles have never been so fun. 10/10 will shoot portals again.			",321,36,11,19,21,1,21

Portal					* 9/10I need a companion Cube.Portal looks like a First-Person Puzzle Game with the good old Half-Life 2 Source Engine, but it's more than that. We're Chell, a girl used as guinea pig forced to do tests for an artificial intelligence called GLaDos with a portal gun inside this gigantic and apparently deserted structure named Aperture Science Labs. The puzzles you will be prompted to solve involve the use of the portal gun, a gun that shoots two linking portals on specific typologies of walls and, you must complete every test where you might have to push a button, drop cubes, make huge leaps with the help of the portals and a clever use of physics and gravity.Seems simple and effective but what's so special in this game? Well, besides the clever puzzles you can't ignore the ourageously and funny GLaDos, with her sarcastic comments and black humour that will keep on encouraging you in doing tests for her while at the same time insulting you. Exhilarating.The interesting fact is the minimalistic story behind the game. Portal is set in the same ""universe"" of Half-Life 2, but the time is not specified. Anyways it's interesting to notice the small clues around the maps, the small hints and stories told by GLaDos to understand a little what's going on, why are we here and what happened to the Aperture Science Labs.Unfortunately a very big problem of the game is it's length, it just take less than a fistful hours to fully complete it, but believe me it's really worth it.+++PROs+++ PORTAL. Very innovative and creative puzzles. I love the portal gun and it's being used in every possible way pushing the player to make a very attentive use with the aid of physics. GLaDos. Her artificial sarcasm alone is definitely a reason good enough to play.---CONs--- LENGHT. It's Short. Very short... Too Short ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												The pros: very well made game, original idea, the environment is pretty nice too,... But the best pro of all is that the AI voice is simply hilarious XD.(SPOILERSSS) I quote: There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come, because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either, because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikeable you are. It says so here in your personnel file: unlikeable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikeable loner whose passing shall not be mourned. ""Shall not be mourned."" That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted. So that's funny too.F**k, just for the monologue of the AI, I'd play this game again a thousand times =P.The only con: too short ! I finished the game in 3 hours (bonus maps excluded), I want more ! =D.Every steam library should own this game (get Portal 2 as well if you can). ^.^I'll finish by saying... the cake is not a lie !

Posted: April 10, 2016
												After completing the game over four times, and doing the majority of things in Portal, I think I’m ready to review the game. So, Portal is a puzzle-platform game, developed by Valve, and as you cleverly-observed from the title ‘Portal’ there are… Portals, to help you pass each test chamber (best synopsis ever). Thus, I shall just jump straight into the review, which has been split into ‘different sections’ before giving my overall score and final opinions. Story  –The game has quite a simplistic story – the protagonist (Chell) has to navigate through a total of nineteen test-chambers with her Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or simply the ‘portal gun’. She is essentially a lab-rat for GLaDOS, who is an artificial intelligence that would guide and monitor the player. I won’t say any more than that, as it does get quite interesting by the end of the game. When I played through the game for the first time, it took me about three to four hours to complete with that time getting shorter and shorter as I knew how to get through each level, but there was never a point where I felt I paid far too much for the game, and I felt that the game’s length suited the value.  Gameplay  –Obviously, throughout this game you use portals. At the start, you can shoot blue portals before obtaining the ability to shoot orange portals as well. This concept was clearly reused by the game ‘Narbacular Drop’; I believe the people who made that game also joined Valve in making Portal. This idea was interesting enough on its own, for a short game, but they added a few more mechanics such as the Weighted Companion Cube coming into play, or the usage of speed benefitting you in quite a few puzzles. And I liked how Portal applies physics to each of its puzzles, thus making each solution seem more logical (well as logical as portals existing anyway). Of course, it’s nowhere near as in-depth as a handful of gameplay mechanics that has been introduced in the game’s sequel – Portal 2, yet because of the game’s length and style, it holds on its own and I never felt bored by the simple gameplay.  Replayability  –After completing the game, there are further options to lengthen your gameplay-time such as attempting the Advanced Maps, which are quite challenging and they are pretty much just harder versions of existing maps you’ve already done in the original game. There’s also Portal Challenges which involves you trying to beat a puzzle with the least amount of portals, least amount of steps or the fastest time possible (however as of yet, I haven’t tried this option). But aside of trying to claim achievements, finding Easter eggs, finding different ways to do the same puzzle or attempting speed-runs of the game (I managed to complete the game at around 2.1 hours on my last attempt), there is very little reason to actually run through the game beyond a second, or even third time. Yet, even then, I still feel like this game is worth your money and your play-time may reach five-seven hours, if you disregard achievement-hunting or other activities within the game. Overall  – This is a relatively shorter review, than to my first one, which suits the relatively shorter game (despite twenty hours of playtime) but honestly, this game must be acknowledged for its gameplay, its humour as well as its difficulty – as I have to say that the last four to six test-chambers do a good job of challenging you initially and there were fond moments, where I stopped and thought “Oh!!! That’s how you… …damn.”, after wasting  length proportion dying and head-scratching. I can honestly say that this game was a memorable experience for me, when I first bought it a couple of months ago, and it is as fun and enjoyable as it is now, with me now having fond memories of many different sections within this game. I must recommend this game to all, as this is a great game with many great qualities and almost no flaws aside of length (which is not even a major problem for me). Therefore, I’m giving the game an  8/10  and I would highly recommend people to buy it whether you are ok with the price, or whether you wish to buy the Portal Bundle on sale (Portal 1 + 2) for a relatively cheap price, it’s up to you. Thanks for reading my review! My Scoreboard  –1/10 ---> 4/10 – Not worth it.5/10 ---> 6/10 – Below Average/Mediocre.7/10 – Above Average. 8/10 – Great. 9/10 ---> 10/10 – Outstanding + Must Own.

This review article analyzes the tone and design of the excellent single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, concluding that the original Portal is the stronger title.[. . .] I think it’s fairly trivial to say that Portal is a significant and influential franchise. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the original Portal is such a cohesive, nearly flawless gaming experience that it should be remembered alongside the other highest-tier encapsulations of solid game design and execution.

+ Very fun and unique gameplay. You receive a Portal Gun which lets you create two portals that you can pass through at any angle to get to various out of reach places or to quickly navigate from one place to another.  You can even use your momentum from falling to slingshot yourself across a stage by placing portals beneath you.+ The puzzles are challenging but not ""too difficult"".  Most consist of getting from point A to B, some require you to move cubes on top of buttons to open doors. Others require you to redirect energy balls with your portal gun to activate various switches.  These puzzles continue to get more difficult as you get near the end by including obstacles like turrets but the game really makes you think outside the box.+ I personally feel like the story is what makes Portal ""great"" especially near the end of the game where you are trying to escape from the facility + GLaDOS the robot governing the facility makes a lot of funny jokes and remarks throughout the entire game which keeps things interesting and enjoyable. + Quite a few easter egg type rooms with some humerous drawings and writing+ The ending is fantastic which involves an awesome boss fight, lots of craziness, cake, and the best credits song I've ever heard. :)- Some levels (especially in the second half of the game) are a bit too lengthly and sometimes feel a bit overwhelming. It took me many years to finally have the willpower to push myself to get past them and finish the game. (In 2016 lol)- I felt like some parts of the game were a bit unclear...a new player can find themselves getting lost or stuck for quite a long time without using a guide. I did not use any guides on my playthrough and struggled during various parts, often thinking ""uhh....that can't be right..."" or ""umm...what do I do now?""   Be prepared to get stuck multiple times on your first playthrough.			",2907,1027,99,266,347,21,392

												The concept is simple but brilliant: you're trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you're given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump, or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive, although the game can be completed within a few hours, and the scenery is quite sparse. Nearly everything that GLaDOS says is absolutely hilarious, and the challenges are fun and really challenge you to think. Additionally, they can be completed in several different ways and it is possible to pick up awards for doing certain things, so the game can easily be replayed with great satisfaction.

												It may be short, but boy is it sweet. Portal is one of those rare, perfect games.Playing through Portal, you'll be treated to delightfully subversive dark humor, which slowly gives way to a creepy, sinister atmosphere. The gameplay is rock-solid, too - challenging, but not unfair to the player. And without spoiling anything I can tell you that Portal has one of the best video game characters this side of 2000.Long after you've finished it, this game will stick with you.			",103,6,2,1,0,0,2

Welcome to the Enrichment Center(Sorry, but we've run out of cake-related jokes.)TL;DR:A strange puzzle game that proves a challenging experience eventually brings you deeper into the lore of Aperture Science, starting otherwise innocuous and weird and showing a more sinister side to the events taking place in the game; a fairly enjoyable game with a great sequel and setting. Having its eerie sci-fi elements, this first person, physics-based puzzle game is the spin-off series to Half-Life, taking place in the same universe.OverviewAn overall instant classic, Portal is a first-person puzzle game taking place in the Aperture Science laboratories; the Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. You are a test subject given the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device to participate in the physics experiment through the test course, passing through challenges involving diverse testing elements and techniques to solve the puzzle chambers.PlotThe story begins with a test subject, ""Chell"", being released from a state of suspension in the beginning of a test course in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. She is introduced to the Portal technology and the Handheld Portal Device during the course of the tests, which start otherwise weird, but seemingly innocuous. The story progresses revealing a darker side to the testing course and the whole Enrichment Center.While relatively shallow, the plot of the original Portal game has a certain degree of paranoia fuel and space for imagination of what's manipulating the experiment and the nature of the Enrichment Center. Combined with further content ('Lab Rat' comic, among others), the game lore is carried forward and somewhat explained of how it fits within the Half-Life universe, leading into the events of the sequel.GameplayPlaying Portal on the first time can be admittedly disorienting, but the player progressively adapts to the puzzling nature of the portals and the Device throughout the test chambers. Dealing with test elements such as moving platforms, high-energy pellets, AI turrets and acid pits, each chamber is challenging in its own manner.You can also try the extra challenges in the game for bragging rights and achievements.GraphicsDecent level of detail for a puzzle game, and low performance requirements make this game worth a try for even older machines. Source Engine's versatility remains true in Portal.Music and SoundThe soundtrack of Kelly Bailey, composer of the Half-Life series has the uncanny feeling of both sinister, outworldish experience that Aperture Science becomes to the player, helping the immersion into the strange world of Aperture.The sound effects in the game are fitting to the setting, mainly consisting of sci-fi noises and mechanical machinery.ConclusionWorth a buy if you're into puzzle games or are looking to complete your Valve collection, adds to some story value for the sequel, and is interesting overall. Unsure? Try the demo, it'll give you a sample of what the game might feature.			",76,9,5,12,13,0,10

												Price / hour: 2,2€It's a great game, but like negative reviews say, it's short. But it's part of the story, so I think this shouldn't be left out.Pros:- Story, likely like intro for Portal 2- The idea; unique, this game brought so much, without this we wouldn't have Portal 2 and therefore not fanart, fan vids, fan mods to other games etc.- It's one of the greatest puzzle games, little bit easy but it's good- Speedrunning, see the speedrun vids, this game is pretty decent for it.- Color theme is beautiful, there's so few games with only white, brings the unique exprience this way as well.Cons:- ShortConclusion: Only one con, but shouldn't be ignored. I recommended to buy in sales / bundle, you can see the price / hour.			",164,33,6,18,5,0,2

												Portal, while short, provides a very memorable experience and is well crafted in all aspects of the game.    The levels in Portal often use verticality and gravity to make a more fun experience.  The core mechanic of Portal is the Portal Gun, which creates two linked portals.  Turrets, moving platforms, deadly water, and weighted cubes can often serve as both obstacles and tools in a level.  The way in which portals can conserve energy and create gravity defying feats can be difficult to imagine, but is extremely satisfying.	The graphics are from many years ago, and they can’t be compared to any recent games, but they look good enough.  The visual design of the entire game doesn’t require or would benefit from extra detail.  After all, you’re in an industrial-looking testing facility.	The main story focuses on the silent Chell and GLaDOS within the Aperture Science facility.  You play from the first person perspective of Chell, navigating through and solving puzzles in the facility.  I won’t spoil anything else.  	The main storyline lasts under four hours, but the voice acting and use of dark humor is superb, and something rare in the puzzle genre.  There are also many bonus levels in addition to the regular ones.  The low price, low hardware requirements, replayability, and how fun it is overall make it necessary for any collection.  Should you play this game?Yes:  -If you’re new to puzzle games, the shortness and low price make it a great introduction to the genre.-If you have played Portal 2, and you liked it, or you like puzzle games in general.-If you don’t want a frustrating or drawn-out puzzle game.No:-If you want a very lengthy game.

												Portal Review - Raymond KTI originally played Portal 2 before the first one, since I was only playing 360 games at the time and didn’t own my personal PC yet. But I’m glad I waited, I would not have been able to see the brilliant art  the game presents in a unique fashion. Portal uses a concept that's a bit hard to wrap your head around without actually seeing it in action. The only ""weapon"" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk through the entrance and find yourself at the exit. Walk through the exit and you're back at the entrance.			",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

The Cake is a lie. 9/10 I loved this game, I thought it was amazing, I feel that everyone should play this game because it is extremely fun. This game is the best deal that any gamer can find anywhere. This game has a fun concept, where you solve a series of puzzle chambers using a portal gun which allows you to create two portals that you can then walk through or send objects through to solve puzzles.There is an interesting story to the game, and you will hear this story as you pass through the game, and find new areas. It isn't anything expansive, but it's enough to keep interest.The single best thing about this game is Glados. Glados is a really annoying, and funny ♥♥♥♥♥ that talks to you throughout the entire game, always trying to patronize and put you down. Being able to listen to Glados is enough to buy the game itself. And while I always have a soft spot for her, I will never forgive her for Companion Cube. Seriously, if you don't find Glados' dark sense of humour funny, you have no soul.The puzzles are clever, and fun, but when you figure out what to do, there is no actual difficulty to them. The story can be finished in 1.5-4 hours, depending on how long you spend on the puzzles, and whether you go quickly through the game, or enjoy the experience. There is no need to speed through the game though, I'm not sure why people think they have to speed through every game these days.  And there are also challenge modes that extend the gameplay time past the story, and they worth it.The game doesn't appear outdated despite it's age, this is a game that can pretty much be enjoyed by everyone, and if you're worried about it ending, remember there's Portal 2 which is a huge expansion of this game, with a lot of content. I recommend playing this game, and then portal 2. However if you've already played Portal 2, I recommend getting this game anyway because you will still enjoy it, and both games aren't the exact same.			",173,40,2,21,13,2,32

												Portal is a magnificent puzzle game. The titillating wrongness of every solution and the ""JUSTNOIDEA"" thinking required to get there make you feel like a space-folding genius, and yet you'll almost never get stuck. Skilled players will portal their way through the nineteen levels in just a few hours, but this little puzzle game / tech demo provides plenty of entertainment and makes a great addition to The Orange Box.

Without giving any of the plot away, I will say this is a very fun, albiet easy game to master. It has memorable lines, seen in popular culture today, and spawned a sequel, Portal 2.

												Portal was my first experience with a puzzle game. Initially, I didn’t like it very much. I found it a bit boring and I felt locked up in this environment, unable to explore. Only after my third attempt to get back to the game I realized I was approaching it with the wrong perspective. I changed my attitude and decided to roleplay the character. It became a puzzle, horror, comedy world for me and I love it. The visuals are great for its time, the physics are well implemented and the puzzles were just hard enough to push me to beat them all. It took me less than ten hours to complete the game, but I enjoyed my frustration, discovery and success moments equally. I’m looking forward for the sequel.			",36,22,0,15,1,0,5

												At the time this review is being written, the game is now around 8 and a half years old, and still looks STUNNING! The storyline, in my opinion, is fantastic, and there are plenty of fan theories about it that can be found by a simple Google search. The price des this game justice. The testchambers are put together in progressive difficulty, and the escape is one of my best moments on gaming, although I do play mostly simulators, so there may be better ones.You need logic in this game, think outside the box, but not too far outside the box. I'd also take the things GLaDOS says with a pinch of salt, maily because she is very sarcastic. Need more persuasion, read the other 24, 516 positive reviews. Just BUY IT! NOW! IT'S MANDATORY!

OverviewReleased on October 10, 2007 by the beloved Valve tells a story about a test subject going through a series of experimental rooms involving the use of portals and other various accessories produced in the fictional company of Aperature Science. Solve each room's increasingly challenging puzzles as you learn more about the current conditions of Aperature Science and the twisted pasts of what has happened ever since the inclusion of GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence that maintains the entire facitility.  ReviewVisuals: Portal is presented with a combination of sleek grey and white architecture with contrasts of black, in which enables the industrialized facility tone in which the developers strived towards. The use of lighting from the portals and various other Aperature Science items creates the sci-fi aesthetics that is recognizable very easily. Very polished and refined from the previous iterations seen through the trailers, and is maintained throughout the testing facilities. However, this changes to a very rustic and worn-down tone of bright red and black as the plot progresses to a new section of the game, in which is quite reflective of the change in enviroment. Overall, a very fitting and interesting stylistic choice from the game.Rating: AMusic/Sound: The music used throughout the game goes along well with the entire sci-fi atmosphere that Portal has created for itself. Each of them creates a sense of unease yet also calming feeling, which is quite interesting to say the least. The sound effects used are consistent and matches up with the action that is happening. Some of the sound effects are quite memorable and easily recognizable, as with many aspects of this game. Although the soundtrack is great, it's not used much throughout the game is mostly remained to silence. This might be decided from the developers to further cement the fact that the player is basically trapped inside a testing facility, with no signs of any humans nearby, but I still felt like it could have been used more frequently instead of being in a couple test chambers. The final song in the credits, ""Still Alive"", performed by Ellen McLain and composed by Jonathan Coultan is catchy and a nicely concludes the game.Rating: A-Story: The story seems to be non-existent in the beginning. You're a test subject going through one test chamber at a time, solving puzzles and learning about different mechanics. However, as the game progresses, you learn pieces and parts of what Aperature Science actually is and the history behind it. Still, the story is kept quite simply for the player to learn more about it in the sequel, Portal 2. As a puzzle game, there's not much of a comprehensive story like other games would have, and that is fine. With the amount of story Portal has it's already quite satisfying and makes the player want to learn more about the history of the game they're playing.Rating: AGameplay: As a part of the puzzle game genre, Portal is a rare inclusion as it's a 3D game rather than most puzzle games, revolving around 2D. This gives the game much more potential and the mechanics that the game includes are phenominal. Each aspect revolving around portals are fun and interesting, combined with the other puzzle aspects of this game, creates an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. The developer commentary that can be accessed after playing through the entirety of the game explores more upon how each chamber is altered and created based on previous testings and a progressive learning structure that Portal is based upon. The amount of work put into each puzzle is quite astonishing, and the synergy of difficulty and enjoyment is balanced well throughout. There are also two side modes in addition to the main story, advance maps and challenge mode. Advance maps takes previous test chambers and alters one or two factors of the map to make it much more difficulty. Each of them were quite enjoyable and nicely challenging to go through. The challenge mode on the other hand place the same chambers from before and put goals such as steps taken, portal used, or time taken, to see the performance of each aspect on each individual map. I found this mode to be way too difficult and honestly detracts from the calming atmosphere of Portal, making in quite uneccessarily stressful throughout each map. With that aside, since it's an optional mode, it didn't have much of an impact to the main game.Rating: AFinal VerdictPortal is an extremely well developed game that has the right amount of difficulty, enjoyment, and interests for me to keep on returning to this game. It's almost flawless upon all aspects and I would say my complaints are only small nitpicks that are quite based on my personal taste. This is definitely one of my favorites of all time, along with the rest of the fantastic line-up developed by Valve. High praise for this company and high praise for this game. If you have not bought or played this game yet, I would recommend you do as soon as possible. It's an experience that is quite hard to put into words, and will keep you engaged right to the end.Final Rating: A			",16,5,0,1,0,0,0

												Portal is a fun but challenging game with loads of levels.The game has quite good graphics and is a awesome sci-fi strategy game.Even though portal 2 is out already, portal 1 is just as fun and exciting.The game is based on a person who is a test subject in a gigantic lab with robots and the portal gun which creates portals.This game is only single player but still fun.I do recommend this game for all sci-fi strategy lovers.

												I was really suprised how good, funny and challenging this is. It beat all my expectations. To be honest I did not expect much and in first two three levels I had absolutely no clue how I managed to go through. But then I realized. Then I saw my portal weapon in completely different way and I started to be excited.Maybe it is a pity that there are only 19 levels + bonus in escape, but not only the final chamber was really challenging for my sensorium together with my portal skills.Conclusion: It IS worth playing.

												Calling Portal a breath of fresh air is a huge understatement. Mixing puzzle gameplay, fantastic dialog, and the sadistic yet lovable frenemy GLaDOS, it is easily one of my favorite new IPs in years. Though it starts out simple enough, Valve is quick to remind you of how incredibly smart and inovative they are. Portals begin being used in all sorts of ways I'd never have thought of, and yet it's never the least bit overwhelming or overly challenging. Solving the puzzles is great fun, but it's really the dialog that stands out. This is hands down some of the best writing I've heard in a video game, and it's delivery is marvelous.Graphically it might not be the most technically impressive, but it's simple visual scheme is all it's own, and even the most mundane objects become memorable. To me this is absolutely a must play for each and everyone out there that calls themselves a gamer. It's charming, clever, and left me longing for more!			",845,336,29,79,64,6,112

												What can I say about this so famous game? Well, I guess it was amazing 10 years ago and I can see why people loved this one. Unfortunately my expectations were maybe too high and so I was ""disappointed"". The game is pretty good but I was hoping for a masterpiece and as always happens with expectations I got screwed by my own unrealistic desire. Memo: Live the moment! In fact if I think about the hours I spent playing this I can feel I actually had fun. The puzzles were not too hard, but the sense of wonder about how portals work was cool and I enjoyed that. Too bad sometimes I had to fight the game itself (crates falling, setting portals were I wanted to, jumping). The other big issue was I got motion sickness eventually. The last level was very cool (and way longer than I thougt) but the ""boss fight"" was not excpetional (again expetations vs reality). Anyway this is a very good game, as everybody knows so I would raccomand it to anyone who doesn't NEED to kill stuff to have fun+ Nice story+ Very cool setting+ Cool puzzles- Maybe a little bit outdated- Controls (see description)- The portal sound effect is too loud for the music			",343,177,8,60,37,7,65

Portal ReviewFPS puzzle game with aspects of humour.Portal is an absolute classic, it's sequel even better. The storyline is perfect, little bits of humour, puzzle, action, even some mysterious horror. You play as Chell, a completely mute human who is the only person known to have survived the events prior, where the scientists at Aperture Laboratries all got poisoned by GLaDOS, a robot they had built, which went insane. Now GLaDOS uses you as her guinea pig and puts you through a vast amount of tests, each one solvable using the famous Portal Gun and the many contraptions available in the particular testchamber. This game is surely one of my favorite games. If you're a Half Life fan as well, there's a few mentions of Black Mesa and the Borealis in this game so it's worthwhile getting.The sequel kind of tops this game in my opinion, but that's because I really like storyline and Portal 2 has that plus a bunch of comedic dialogue from some really interesting and charismatic characters. This game needs to be played before Portal 2, though. Definitely.			",338,91,18,24,36,3,29

												This game is innovation and originality at it's best, and feels like nothing I've ever played before nor can I relate this game with another game. The puzzles are jam packed full of fun and figuring out how to finally complete that one level really does give you a sense of accomplishment. It's quite short but was great while it lasted and after completing the game you can test your skills on the bonus advanced and challenge maps which reuses the same levels but with added components to make the experience more challenging. Valve has once again made a great game and it only gets better for Portal from here on. ;)			",40,14,0,2,3,0,0

Since I played portal 2 before I got the chance to play this it may have clouded my judgement, I do  however think it would be a great game if you haven't played the second one this is a fairly short game, it can be beat it in less then half an hour, if you've played portal 2 already and you want to play the first one it's not really worth it, but if you haven't played either I do recommened playing this one first.

												When I first played this I had no idea what it was. Unfortunately, that's nearly impossible to experience now that it is so heavily hyped. Fortunately, the hype is well earned.This is an innovative game that only proves further how amazing Valve is at reinventing genres. It's puzzle, platformer, FPS, and with a hilarious and unique story that you will love. This first game is a bit short, but the Challenges and Time Trials offer plenty of replay value.Much like anything by Valve, if you don't have this already, you must grab it.

A Great Puzzle GameThis game brings in the concept of using teleportation to solve puzzles. It is a great game that plays smoothly and the commentary is humorous to listen to. Although the game is short with only 19 levels, there is the ability to download maps made by other users to extend the playtime. Also, have a look at Portal 2, the sequel to this game, if you want to play more of this great game!			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

												I can't express my love for this game enough. Escapist magazine's own Yahtzee explained it in the perfect sense. Clever, quick paced fun awaits you once you play this most intriguing of games. My one piece of advice to you is don't think with logic...at first. Think with portals , then the logic follows suit. Definitely try out this game if you haven't already. It's worth your money in every way (replay value as well).			",104,18,2,21,11,2,20

												A truly unique experience (and I should know; I played this on the Xbox 360 at one point). More of a puzzle game than a first-person shooter, you use the portal gun to solve puzzles and find the exit for each testchamber. It introduced some innovative gameplay and one of the most memorable (and hilarious) villains in gaming.			",666,79,28,52,37,0,71

												For me is really hard to judge this game because I've played this for the first time now in 2014, after I had played the sequence Portal 2, which is way better than this one. But still this was something new, something exiting, which made me think a lot about Aperture Science Laboratories which I'm really interested in. I love the idea of being a test subject whose quest is to solve puzzles using portal gun. This game is not hard, it's pretty easy, but funny and I enjoyed every minute of it. I think this game was a huge innovation in game industry. 7.5 /10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												Portal was, in short; short. It taught you how to play the game through a series of levels, and when you were finally trained, the game ended. It was much too easy and lacked much intellect. This game was the preparation of what would be the greatest puzzle video game of all-time (Portal 2). It needed to be the first, so that every flaw in it would be ironed out by the time of Portal 2. Even after all these insults, it was still amazing. It was very funny, had a new and interesting concept behind it, it was quotable, and best of all, memorable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I even begin?Well for starters this came out in 2007 and uses the source physics engine which is very powerful. And if you don't know already, it is in the same story line of Half Life.Story: This game has a beautiful story that shows you what can happen when you have a unstable super-computer incontrol of a futuristic science facilty that houses many advanced devices that need testing and that actually sounds bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy. The story shows you affection, signs of insanity, betrayal and much more and has a lot of testing courses. The test chambers are great and have enough things in them to be tough, but tough enough where you want to solve it instead of quiting.Physics/portals: The portal gun is great and really shows off what the physics engine can do. You can also use the engine and do the chambers in different ways using different methods using physics. Also, you may think that ""Well you can place a portal anywhere..."" and well, that's wrong and that gives me a challenge because I always want to shoot less and less portals to do the chamber...Graphics: The graphics back then, were good, but not amazing. It uses textures that look like Half Life 2's, but that is because they are on the same Earth. Everything loads great, but sometimes I'll think to myself and say that some textures need a face lift.Sounds: The sounds are great and I have never thought to myself that one sound wouldn't go with that item/object or device.Voice acting: The voice acting is great. The woman that did GlaDos' voice did a real great job and you really do think that it is a computer talking to you. Same thing with the turrets, since they say things as if what they are saying is what they are programed to say.Final verdict: 94/100 This game is great on so many levels and the only thing that stops it from getting 100/100 is that the story doesn't go in depth of Apeture science until Portal 2 and sure they did go more in depth in Portal 2, but Valve could have done it in Portal.

												This game is very awesome. Seriously how can anyone not like this. Besically, the story goes like this:You play as Chell, a silent but determined test subject who is trapped in Aperture Science. The facility is run by a psychotic AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who makes Chell go through some deadly tests involving a gun that shoots portals(the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or as I like to call it ""ASHPoD""). They're easy as first, but as you progress they get harder. During testing, GLaDOS promises Chell things like cake and grief counseling. However, after Chell discovers some graffitti revealing the AI's true intentions, Chell is skeptical of this so called ""reward"". After dodging adorable but deadly turrets, flinging through portals, and incinerating a cute box, you finally make it to the last test chamber. I would tell you what happens after that, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Portal has a great storyling, great characters, great graphics, and amazing gameplay. I definetly recommend this.

												ok its fun because you do a lot of flying without wings especially if you cheat but you dont have to because its puzzles and you learn by playing and glados has a smixy voice jk shes old sounding but soothing nonetheless but other than that nice game and a lot of portals but you get a gun for the portals and you shoot the portals and you go through the portals and you get places quickly like sonic but not that fast and no fall damage becuase main character is so hawt that her hottness breaks her fall jk shes got like special boots and she cant talk i think and also im not sure if its both or only the second one where shes hot but shes cool because shes the main character and you play as her and you shoot portals around and go through them and pick up boxes and put them on buttons but then theres special boxes which you love them but SPOILERS you have to kill it SPOILERS STOP and then theres turrets that say hello and shoot you and i think crushers and a bunch of other stuff so buy the game i guess if you want.

												This game is very awesome. Seriously how can anyone not like this. Besically, the story goes like this:You play as Chell, a silent but determined test subject who is trapped in Aperture Science. The facility is run by a psychotic AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who makes Chell go through some deadly tests involving a gun that shoots portals(the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or as I like to call it ""ASHPoD""). They're easy as first, but as you progress they get harder. During testing, GLaDOS promises Chell things like cake and grief counseling. However, after Chell discovers some graffitti revealing the AI's true intentions, Chell is skeptical of this so called ""reward"". After dodging adorable but deadly turrets, flinging through portals, and incinerating a cute box, you finally make it to the last test chamber. I would tell you what happens after that, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Portal has a great storyling, great characters, great graphics, and amazing gameplay. I definetly recommend this.

Not only does it offer great gameplay that will make you feel like you're really holding the Portal Gun, and genial puzzles, but it also has a very good story line, to which the main AI (literally) GLaDOS adds humour and irony very needed in some of the puzzles. Good job, Valve!			",15,5,0,5,1,0,1

												9/10 - Must-play title!Since it's an pretty old game by now, i'll make this one quick: This game is simply awesome, and worth playing for everyone!The LOOK of the game is a well-rounded experience. The game runs on Source engine which is know for looking really neat. The graphics are just atmospheric and smooth, nothing to criticise.The GAMEPLAY is simply amazing! Plattforming puzzle are always fun, especially with a portalgun! Those mixed with clever mechanics and well designed levels and enemys, its just a fun game to play.The STORY is pretty simple, yet amazing, but in the end pretty much predictable and not too long. One point deduction here.My PERSONAL OPINION on this game is, that i just love it! The first time i turned it on i finished the game. And after i was done i feelt like i want more of this game! Good thing there more challenge maps awaiting you once your done with the story. Also, it has one of my very favored outros of every game i ever played!This is a game everybody should have played, and the very most of us won't ever regret it!			",217,55,6,35,12,3,12

												Portal is my favorite game of all time, uncontested. I've completed it about 12 times. It's definitly the smartest game ever created, but it's also very short. I like this game much better than I like Portal 2. Portal 2 was almost a comedy game, while Portal 1 is more ambient and dark, and in the last four test chambers  the Ratman Dens makes it feel sort of a horror game, and soundtracks like Self Esteem Fund really makes it feel like you're alone. I had to take a walk after I played the game for my first time, just to see people again. I love this game and I'd really like Portal 3 if/when it comes out to be more like Portal 1 than Portal 2. Don't get me wrong, Portal 2 is an awesome game, but Portal 1 remains the better game. If you've never played this, give it a go, and if you've already beaten it, go play it again!

												An amazing game, with an eery underlying edge to it combined with a gripping storyline. The puzzles aren't too hard that they're not fun, but they're challenging to the point of addiction. Well thought out, too. It's just the perfect length overall to not be too much of a drag, which makes you want more (a reason why Portal 2 is awesome) and so you don't get bored.I'd recommend this for anyone, but maybe not very young children, and only small children playing with an adult to help out.

												The cake is a lie! However, the hype behind Portal is not.  When I first installed this game, years ago, I was too young and too impatient to appreciate the nuanced and intellectual puzzles that are the heart of the gameplay of this title.  If you take a little time, you'll find something very original and stimulating, and funny.   If you don't like to get frustrated, or if you are the type that gives up easily on a puzzle and searches for the answer...you won't find this game to be fun.If you have the patience to inspect, re-inspect, and re-re-inspect a room for that one puzzle element you missed, or didn't think about, and you have the wish to be rewarded and have the ""EUREKA!"" moment when you finally realize that bit of wall hanging at an odd angle isn't there just for show...and you, in fact, have to teleport in a loop of gravitational frenzy to catapult yourself from said wall across an impossible chasm into the hands of awaiting freedom (not), then you'll love it!  It's all about the intelligence.  Artificial, or otherwise.			",156,33,0,23,12,0,33

												Portal review:Having already heard many good things about portal in the form and video reviews and word of mouth, I can confirm that you will not be disappointed. Portal is a challenging physics based game that shows off in the best possible way. Having said that the game isn't very long, having taken about 3:30 hours to finish it. I wasn't, however left unsatisfied. Portal was a simple yet challenging game that really gave me a sense of achievement having completed it. With the addition of bonus maps there is still plenty of work to be done after the main story line is finished.The story line itself is intricately with a lot of hidden secrets that's it is completely up to the player to find, adding another level to the game.All in all a fantastic idea coupled with a fantastic story line..

												Good game.I'm not a fast-reaction type of person, so while I did know how to get to a place, actually getting there was like NOT AGAIN DONT FALL DO THE THING! PRESS THE BUTTON FAST! OH NO! AAARRGG!  but yeah. fun game. I spent more time failing to place a portal in time than actually getting places in some levels, especially the later ones.It was nice. It was..different. Never really played a game like this before. And I've always like the idea of being able to gateway yourself somewere like this.probably...8.5. or an 8. out of 10.Definitely recommend.

												/ Don't believe anything they tell you about the cake. It's a lie. /This game definitely is a must-have. One of the best games I've played so far. I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) playing this. It's a game everyone could enjoy, in my opinion. The storyline itself took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete. The additional challenges and advanced chambers are nice features, great for adding some game time and a challenge for those who like getting all achievements.The chambers and puzzles get harder smoothly as you advance through the game.  However, it can get a tiny bit repetitive. The portal mechanism really makes this game unique. I really love the smooth physics. Good graphics. The music and sound are okay. The dialog is simply brilliant and hilarious. Through the game, there are several nice additions (random radios playing the catchy theme song, messages from other test subjects) which caused me to laugh from time to time.Portal 2, the sequel, is in my opinion even better, but you just have to play Portal before you start on the sequel. Together, they're a masterpiece.I highly recommend buying this game. It's definitely worth the money. If it's in sale, do not hesitate and buy it immediately (bonus points if you buy Portal 2 too)!

												Portal is in many ways a strange game. At it's core it's a puzzle game, not something most people would consider mainstream but through a great sense of innovation as well as some truly inspired writing it somehow manages to pull it off.The concept of Portal is simple enough. You progress through a series of rooms. In each room you must get from the entrance to the exit overcoming whatever obstacles and dangers might be in there using nothing but your trusty portal gun. The portal gun, quite simply, ""shoots"" a portal entrance onto a flat surface which allows you to travel through it.This fairly simple concept does get quite a bit more tricky as you progress through the game as moving platforms, lasers, turrets and many other troublesome entities try to stop you.Throughout the game you are accompanied by the sometimes scolding, somethings taunting and sometimes soothing voice of G.L.A.D.O.S. The AI in charge of your training and who might be a little mentally unstable as you'll soon discover. Although G.L.A.D.O.S is the only voice you'll hear in the game she does a fantastic job of keeping your entertained throughout your journey. The humor is some of the best you'll see in a game and the storyline is interesting enough that you'll pay attention to every little tidbit you encounter.The only negative to be mentioned is the very short length of the game that leaves you wanting more. Sadly, the only alternative to replaying the game and pretending to be surprised is the challenges which are fairly boring rinse and repeat because of their extremely unforgiving nature.Portal is a great game and one that any Steam user should have in his library, not just because it's been given away for free to all users not once, but twice. But because it is a truly impressive game experience.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit. While it isn't long by any means, it isn't supposed to be. Rather, it's supposed to be a game that you can complete within a few hours. Here's a list of some of the things you will encounter/do in Portal within said hours:- Think with portals - Cubes- Incinerators- Buttons- Bigger Buttons- Energy Pellets- Judgemental yet humorous Artificial Intelligence- Remove cameras from walls- Energy Grids- Utilize Newton's Law Of Momentum- Testing- CakeSeriously though, if you are a fan of short yet fun puzzle games, get this one. You will not be disappointed.9/10 (Oh, and great music. Let's not forget that. :3)			",68,2,0,0,3,1,1

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)A great 1st person puzzle game, and a great example of how some glimpses of things behind the scenes can add up to a story with quite desirable emotional content. (That's all I say because spoilers.) Portal's content, graphics, sounds, story, tech deserve a firm thumbs-up with both hands.Portal is a great example of non-Euclidean geometry in a game. You enter a hole in the wall, but you don't end up on the other side of the wall, and even the visual appearance behaves accordingly.OTHER GAMES WITH PORTALS / ""PREY""Narbacular Drop[www.digipen.edu] by Nuclear Monkey Software was the prototype game with user-placeable portals that lead to the creation of Portal, and (most of?) that team ended up on Valve's Portal team. That game is also worth a play.But the first game I know of that used portal technology was Prey[en.wikipedia.org] (2006), a really good 1st person shooter. Incidentally, I bought it for €1 in a German retail store a few days ago (but had played it before; those were the days when you installed a DVD without having to download anything else), so I know that it's sadly not available on Steam.With little config file editing, Prey runs on 1920x1080, at least that's what I set in the file, but what I saw on screen rather looked like 4K for some reason. Maybe it was indeed 4K contrary to my choice because to achieve custom resolutions, you also have to set a screen mode variable, and maybe this leads to the game using desktop resolution.I had to turn off anti-aliasing because the frame-rate was not fluid even though my machine can't be the reason - must be the old engine. Frame-rate is fluid without AA, and I didn't miss the AA, so it probably was indeed 4K.Config file editing allows to set arbitrary FoV.I played a few minutes on Windows 10 with August 2016 anniversary update on a GTX980.So, if you can get your hands on Prey today (2016), you can still play it very well, and it's still a great game. And even though it's the first non-Euclidean-geometry game (that I know of), it's very already very well done.			",1053,464,26,127,134,10,138

												The first time I heard of this game was when I came across a flashgame version of it. It was fun 2D, but it is even better 3D. This game has many puzzles, a talking machine that tries to insinuate something about you every second, and PORTALS. Things just got a lot more awesome with PORTALS to solve your puzzles! That's right, this game will have you playing it over and over and over again. Although this game is really fun and interesting, it is also very difficult. It may take minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years to complete some of the puzzles. After you get to the next level though, you're on top of the world! Glados is there to cheer you up and congratulate you by telling you that you are homeless. The future is here, PORTALS are possible. 8.4/10			",98,7,0,8,3,0,4

												Something about cake and cupcakes or whatever. The cake meme might be the Internet equivalent of a Roman fresco, but this game will forever remain a timeless classic.Portal is a short but sweet first person puzzle game, with great writing, intelligent pacing, and a truly sublime main mechanic that was all the more stunning when it first came out in 2007. It was also one of the 5 titles in the Orange Box collection, which was my personal introduction to Valve games. And it's still good.Advanced levels and level challenges are available once you've finished the main story. There is also rudimentary custom level support (no Steam Workshop here) with plenty of custom levels to be found on the internet.No multiplayer though, and nothing like the gels, lasers and light bridges from Portal 2 - but maybe we don't need those here.Buy this if you like good games and gaming history.

												Excellent, well-paced game. Fairly short, but it offers replay value.Witty humor and clever puzzles make this game worth it. Make sure to check out the developer commentary; it's fascinating to see how they created and planned out this masterpiece. The setting has a unique atmosphere I have yet to see in many other games. 10/10			",12,7,0,1,0,0,1

												Portal is one of those game where are basicly trapped in a area and do tests or something else In portal you use a portal gun that shoots 2 different portals (Left and right click)You use these portals to past 19 tests and then you go to the final bossGlaDos is a robot manufactured by aperture science and (almost) helps you thoughout your tests ",254,36,20,21,17,2,7

												Portal is one of the best... kinda first-person shooter games out there, without actually shooting any bullets. (Is it a fps? Well, that´s debatable.) The game most certainly is a puzzle game, so your gonna have to use your brain on this one. Portal is a game that will challenge your MIND. So unlike in most games, you have to actually think while playing this... and think ALOT. This kinda challenge can be very tricky in a video game and can easily ruin the gameplay, but the Portal does just the opposite: The gameplay is fun because it´s challenging! The game is just enough difficult to be competitive in a good way, the feeling you get when clearing a difficult level without any help is super rewarding experience! Add this with GlaDOS and a portal gun (which is, let´s be real here: one of the coolest ""weapon"" in a world of gaming) and you have a super joyful, challenging and unique game, that is an absolute must-have jewel in your library.4/5 This game has the best credits i have ever seen			",53,22,1,11,1,0,8

												Have you ever wanted to take part in cutting edge scientific experiments that may or may not be unethical? Well then this might be the game for you.First of all the puzzle platforming portal performs plays perfectly……… Um, yes it’s highly addictive and once you overcome every challenge you won’t be able to help yourself but to finish another. The unique portal gun is awesome; creating wormholes through space is amazing fun. When I started playing this game I had high hopes and I was not disappointed. It may be fairly old now but it stands up to the test of time very well.The game is challenging but fair, if you die you know it was your fault. You will on occasion breeze through one room only to be stumped by the next. The peaks and troughs in the learning curve help to vary things up and keep the game interesting, plus beating a room that is difficult feels really good, I had a great time figuring out all the levels and how to get from point A to B. The story is sparse but I get the feeling that was only to add to the constant isolation you feel whilst traversing the Aperture Science Laboratories. The antagonist GLaDOS, whom is really the main character, is fantastic. She has all the witty comments and snide remarks you could want in an evil AI gone mad. Chell the hero remains silent throughout, yet I still ended up connecting with her and her struggle for survival. You should get this game especially if it’s on sale; I thoroughly enjoyed this and the sequel. Have fun ^_^ Oh and the cake is a lie			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												And so it begins...... While this game is technically a continuation of Half Life, that doesn't matter in the slightest. 'Portal' is the beginning of its own franchise and does not dissapoint in any aspect. The game's incredibly innovative 'Portal Gun' system, the amazing background and characters, and the now famous cake. Combines to form a fantastic all-round atmospheric experience. A brilliant story-driven puzzle game (with a nice dose of action splashed in) and ultimately, in my opinion, Valve's best work so far. And the sequel's even better.......			",133,21,1,14,11,2,12

												Anyone born this side of the Second World War should know enough about Portal to make a judgement for themselves on whether to buy this game, and that judgement should, of course, be to do it. What it lacks in content (you could quite easily finish this game, and all the achievements, in two hours), it makes up for in ingenuity. The portal-gun system is a refreshing element which requires you in many cases to subvert typical puzzle-solving instincts and instead ""think with portals"", as the game advises. Once you wrap your head around the mechanics though, the puzzles rarely offer a reasonably-quick-witted individual a sufficient challenge. Occasionally, a curveball will be thrown in, but each test chamber is little more than a moment's contemplation away from ephihany. Regular FPS players will find the quicker-paced sections of portal-shooting fun, but short lived if you're sure with your aim, and frustating if you're not. The game's main strength comes from it's humour, which is plentifully provided for by the game's ""narrator"", GlaDoS, though the story behind it isn't fully realised until Portal 2, which is, overall, a MUCH better game. Still, don't let that put you off. I was glad I bought this, and I'd recommend it.			",48,10,0,0,4,1,2

												Something about cake and cupcakes or whatever. The cake meme might be the Internet equivalent of a Roman fresco, but this game will forever remain a timeless classic.Portal is a short but sweet first person puzzle game, with great writing, intelligent pacing, and a truly sublime main mechanic that was all the more stunning when it first came out in 2007. It was also one of the 5 titles in the Orange Box collection, which was my personal introduction to Valve games. And it's still good.Advanced levels and level challenges are available once you've finished the main story. There is also rudimentary custom level support (no Steam Workshop here) with plenty of custom levels to be found on the internet.No multiplayer though, and nothing like the gels, lasers and light bridges from Portal 2 - but maybe we don't need those here.Buy this if you like good games and gaming history.

It's a great game, with one of gaming's best villains, delicious black humor, puzzles and a playtime length that doesn't drag.I admit I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, which is probably why I rate Portal down, but if you like puzzle games I can guarentee you this is the one of the best.

												Portal is a game that gets you thinking with portals. You are being tested with portals and you have to solve various puzzles. It's a wonderful game, although it's a short one. It takes around an hour to complete.The graphics don't need to be hyper realistic and actually aren't far off from the sequel of this game, 'Portal 2'.The puzzles aren't the hardest things in the world, and are also often based off of momentum, or to describe it simply, ""speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.""Though, the difficulty of the puzzles doesn't mean you won't die. Some puzzles will cause your death on the first try, but when you finally reach the moment when your mind figures out how to do this certain puzzle, the feeling is simply awesome.There are slight tricks that the robotic AI, GLaDOS says/does, one example is the promise of cake. She says ""You will be baked, and there will be cake"", which basically means that she will attempt to kill you with fire.Those tricks are nice and will cause you to listen to that part again to see if you heard it incorrectly or not. Ultimately, this is quite an exceptional game.Short version: Nice gameplay. Good graphics. Awesome sensations, and neat twists. It's a tad bit short, bit is exceptionally grand.

Buying this game by itself would be a waste of money because for only 10$ more you can get the Orange box which has many amazing Valve games.

												A fun puzzle game, with an amazingly executed unique mechanic, and a story which gradually twists as you progress and discover the truth. The main villan, GlaDoS is a amazingly written, macabre thing, and even though you reach her at the end of the game, she makes you doubt yourself again and again. Every line said in this masterpiece is well written. Do yourself a favor by this game.Why does an evil killer mastermind robot, have a shoe for orphans tool?			",157,7,3,7,14,1,12

												Portal is 2007 First-person puzzle game developed by Valve in which you take the role of the main protagonist, Chell, as she tries to escape from Aperture Science Labs.In this game, you, eventually, get the hold of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device aka Portal gun, which, obviously is used for creating portals. Levels are designed in a way that you have to think where to shoot the portals and get harder as the game progresses on. Further on, you will have to deal with turrets and think of clever ways to do that. Portals cannot be created on certain surfaces. Portal's level design is brilliant and players will have to use the environment to their advantage. Story is also pretty good, and there is more of it in the second game. Last thing, there is cake.The only downside I can think of is that its pretty short and can be completed in less than 3 hours, but I definitely recommend this game.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												Portal is probably the best puzzle game of all time.  A short but awesome experience, the usual lack of storytelling and narrative is absent from this game, as you truly wonder about the world you've been placed in.  A great game from any angle you look at it, and an awesome way to get people who aren't really ""gamers"" to become interested in your hobby.Pros:Valve polish and playabilityEasy to pick up, hard to masterFun, challenging, and immersiveEaster Eggs!Good voice acting and characterizationCons:No multiplayerA great puzzle game and fun for all ages and skill levels, definitely give Portal a playthrough, no matter your likes or preferences.

												Words cannot describe what I feel for Portal, but since this is is a review I kind of have to so here goes.When I first bought Portal it was the first time I had ever played a game where I was clueless as to what it's main goal was. It got me asking multiple questins: Who was I? Was there a villain? If so what was their intention?Due to my unawareness throughout playing it gave me a slight nervousness and jitteryness within certain chambers.It's atmosphere is unlike any other game I have ever played. I recommend this game to be played with headphones at a moderatley high volume where every footstep and movement can be heard. There were points throughout the game where I genuinly felt alone and disconected from the outside world (but if you're a skyrim or Wow player you already know that feel). This was all due to the games lack of contact that you have with the games narrator who is guiding you throughout the tests. Because of the on and off again dialogue you really get to be alone with your thoughts and it creates a more chilling design whenever you hear the voice of GLaDoS in levels.The gameplay itself was not dissapointing so much as thought provoking, in some first-person games such as CoD your objective is simple; KILL EVERYTHING. In Portal you can sometimes spend a while thinking what your objective is and how to solve the puzzle (however frustrating it may have become)The challenges can become somewhat tedious at points  but that differs from gamer to gamer.If you want an hour or two to kill I recommend this gameIf you want a twenty plus hour game experience I wouldn't steer clear from it but I would prepare myself for what may seem as a quick game.9.5/10Pros:-Brilliant Gameplay and Design-Excellent atmosphereCons:-Challenges can become tedious-Urge to buy Portal 2 even though I am brokeSuper Pro:-End credit song			",43,6,0,7,4,0,0

												This game was the first game that started my experience on Steam. For those who aren't used to the ""AWSD"" controller on keyboard, this is a good start. Pretty much a Puzzle/Action type game where you place certain ""Portals"" and must make the right movements in order to get it right. It may seem boring at first, but the story and revelation of ""Aperture Science"" evolves, and even the challenges increase. A good game that can get you addicted easily...or a game just to past the time.^_^			",568,354,11,80,58,6,65

												Portal, at it's core, is a great game for those who seek innovative gameplay, intriguing puzzles and a ""Story line"" of which has never been approached before.Although short, Portal is not greatly story orientated, nor is it multiplayer or co-op whatsoever, but it still provides the same entertainment you would expect for a first-person puzzle game (because there are sooooo many of those).In nearly any First Person game you will find a puzzle/maze like section that does not feel as it belongs in the game, but in Portal the tables are turned. Portal has a nice balance between gore, blood and... wait wait, nope wrong review. Portal has a nice balance between puzzling areas and a first person aspect that has been used many times, but with Portal everything just feels...right.In conclusion I definitely recommend Portal for those who have a brain, those who don't, well, you can either see a doctor or buy portal (2nd choice recommended)			",4,3,0,1,0,0,1

												The first time I heard of this game was when I came across a flashgame version of it. It was fun 2D, but it is even better 3D. This game has many puzzles, a talking machine that tries to insinuate something about you every second, and PORTALS. Things just got a lot more awesome with PORTALS to solve your puzzles! That's right, this game will have you playing it over and over and over again. Although this game is really fun and interesting, it is also very difficult. It may take minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years to complete some of the puzzles. After you get to the next level though, you're on top of the world! Glados is there to cheer you up and congratulate you by telling you that you are homeless. The future is here, PORTALS are possible. 8.4/10			",98,7,0,8,3,0,4

The name of the game is to escape, using a fascinating device that lets you open up personal wormholes on special surfaces. Guiding you on your way is a forever omnipresent computer AI that is perhaps a little too interested in testing her subjects.I take that back. The name of the game is to drop yourself into infinite free fall, hurl yourself across giant chasms of acid, and somehow always land like a cat. And damn is that fun.Puzzles, for the most part, involve moving blocks onto platforms so that you can open a door. But thankfully that's not nearly as boring as it sounds. You'll have to get creative, and, while it bothers me when puzzle games do this, you'll need to bring reflexes/timing into some puzzles.My only problem (which is a personal problem) is that the game is entirely in first person. I can't play for too long without suffering from motion sickness. I would have liked it if the game allowed 3rd person without the use of the console. I understand they wanted to keep the player's identity a secret until you look at yourself through a portal, but it's not like this was a major reveal or anything. This is enough of a problem for me that I had to dock some points for the game because I still fail to see how 3rd person would have ruined the experience.Very well thought-out puzzles, good narrative, and a great ending song (which I didn't really connect with until I played the game) that will stick in your head for weeks. 9/10			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												(my old Portal review from dawnbreakergaming.com)Portal to the PastFor the approximate 5 people in the world who haven’t heard about this game, on October 10th, 2007, Valve released this little game named Portal, as part of a package known as The Orange Box. Published and developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on Valve’s own digital store, Steam, and it was also available for the XBox 360 and the PlayStation 3. Originally, I only wanted the Orange Box for the game Team Fortress 2, a game I had been eagerly awaiting the release of for years, as I played the original mod for the game Quake. However, since Portal came with it, I decided to give it a shot. Once I started playing, I ended up staying up all night and completing the game. Portal is by no means a very long game, but it lasted long enough to be a very enjoyable experience without overstaying its welcome. PlotPortal revolves around the player character protagonist Chell, who wakes up from stasis to warnings and instructions for the upcoming tests in what is called the Enrichment Center. Chell then proceeds through these test chambers, which get increasingly dangerous. Despite promises of counseling (and cake) from the AI known as GLaDOS, it becomes clear GLaDOS does not regard human life as very valuable. As the story progresses you obtain the use of a Portal gun, which allows you to project 2 portals on to various surfaces.  Each portal created can be used as an entrance, and after entering either one, you’ll then exit at the location of the other portal.  This allows you to travel instantaneously between them, but you also keep your momentum as you pass through them, allowing you to do a variety of physics tricks that can help you reach various locations.Now it is hard to really go into the plot without spoiling things, so without ruining the surprise, the plot revolves around your fight for survival as you travel through the world alone. The game provides you with mostly inanimate objects and verbal abuse from the aforementioned GLaDOS.  Humans are reduced to guinea pigs as GLaDOS pits you against various rooms that force you to solve puzzles on how to reach certain locations, as well as a variety of other challenges,  such as moving objects around to hold down buttons, all while trying to stay alive.  There are many dangers that you’ll encounter, and they can be as simple as avoiding a deadly liquid, to dodging military droids that track and shoot you when moving within their view.  Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories. By design, you will get attached to the most unlikely of companions. “Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories.” GameplayPortal is a mix of first person shooter and puzzle-platformer, and in my opinion, it is probably one of the best games ever to mix those genres. Instead of shooting things to kill or destroy them outright, you use your Portal gun to navigate a series of test chambers by moving between locations you would not be able to reach by normal means, as well as move objects that can be the key to opening the path to exiting these chambers. Luckily you are equipped in such a way that keeps you from taking any fall damage, or else each chamber would be even more dangerous and deadlier than they already are. There is often more than one way of using your portal gun and items in your surroundings to reach your goals. In fact there are additional challenges in the game, separate from the main story line, that pit you against a time clock, or have you complete specific chambers with the least amount of portal use as possible. After the main story I wanted to play Portal so much more that I went back and played through these challenges as well.  I was surprised that I was able to complete a deceptively vast chamber with literally 2 portals. I'm even fairly certain that I completed a test chamber in the most unique of ways; using a wall that opens temporarily by placing the exit portal on it while it was open. In short, the gameplay is wonderful, with the use of tight controls, physics, and a bit of creativity, the things you can do are amazing. Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling! “Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling!”EnvironmentsThe test chambers feature a very clean aesthetic that starts out simple, but become more complex over time. It seems clear that the chambers were designed not only to convey the situation you were in, but also to allow the player to easily gauge their portal shots to effectively navigate each puzzle presented. They have a mix of artistic style and practicality that I wish more games effectively accomplished. Various things are added to the simple world as you progress, but hidden around the corner from the sleek walls that you see are things that break up the otherwise very similar surroundings of each test chamber. As you progress, and perchance get tired of the solid colors and shapes of many locals, the game changes the surroundings, dramatically keeping you engaged in what is a fairly linear path. The aesthetic is so well liked that it has been copied in many other places, such as a map in the game Killing Floor. I personally enjoy it a lot and seek to play other games that have levels inspired by Portal. Most of the game has a non-lyrical, ambient music that is made to match the mood of the environments, and in the ending credits there is a song called “Still Alive” which many adore. The song’s execution and humor is hard to adequately describe, but I can say that it has been praised and played in various places. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Alive) More InfoPortal is a spiritual successor to the freeware game Narbacular Drop, which was a 2005 independent indie game developed by Nuclear Monkey Software. Robin Walker, one of Valve’s developers, saw the game at the DigiPen Institute of Technology annual career fair, which then lead to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve, seeing the game and offering the entire team jobs at Valve.

 )The Portal universe is actually set in the Half-Life universe, another game created by Valve. There is also an official comic called Lab Rat that connects the story of the original Portal, to its sequel, Portal 2. Portal is now also available to enjoy on OS X, Linux, and Android. The game’s popularity has lead to a wide variety of merchandise associated with Portal, such as coffee mugs and plush toys. There is also an on going internet meme relating to the phrase “the cake is a lie.” PerformanceFrom my perspective of the PC version; the game runs very well, as it should on fairly modern systems due to the fact it is built on Valve’s Source Engine, which has been used in many games such as Counter Strike: Source, Left 4 Dead, and Half-Life 2.  It does not even require a gig of RAM or a multi-core processor, so even older PC’s or laptops can easily play this game. (source:  ) Bottom LineI love this game, and I’m certainly not alone, as many, many, many others also love it. In fact, it received critical reception, as it earned more praise than Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2, which were both included in the Orange Box. It won various awards including Game of the Year, Innovation Award, and Best Game Design at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards.

												I'm racking my brain, trying to think of a reason to say this game isn't perfect that doesn't seem like a petty nitpick.I reject the ideas of length (a choice) and replayability (unavoidable in the genre).  The one-note nature of the puzzles has some merit, but the whole game is about the portals, so that's not it.  The FPS controls will prove a barrier to non-gamers, limiting accessibility, but, again, this springs from a selection of engine that I don't think is wrong.  A couple of the puzzles were a little obtuse, but once you figured them out, they made sense, and anyway, you wouldn't want it to be too easy.  The main reason I don't like physics puzzlers is that their engine is too sensitive or finicky, and even once you figure out the solution, it takes a frustrating number of repetitions to implement it.  This never bothered me in Portal, though (probably because you're not stacking things, it's always just one box and some portals).  Timed sections are a little annoying, and the final boss a tad out-of-place, but that's really minor.  The idea that everyone else thinks it's great, so I should disagree is just childish.Nope, it's perfect (or as close as a game can get).			",42,8,0,5,6,0,11

												English: Very fun puzzle game although it is not as good as Portal 2 it is still good and defenatly worth paying you will defenatly be able to find this game in a Steam sale soon and you should buy it when you do. In my review of Portal 2 I complained about how I thought that the game was too short, well this is also the case with this game, infact it is even shorter and even more limited but still worth playing. This game is a perfect example that Valve's reputation for making amazing games is still true!العربية: لعبة ممتعة جدا اللغز على الرغم من أنه ليست جيدة كما أنها بوابة ٢ لا تزال جيدة ويستحق أن يدفع ديفيناتلي سوف تكون قادرة على العثور على ديفيناتلي هذه اللعبة في بيع البخار قريبا ويجب شرائه عند القيام به. في تقييمي من بوابة ٢ أنا اشتكى كيف اعتقدت أن اللعبة كانت قصيرة للغاية، وأيضا هذا هو الحال أيضا مع هذه اللعبة، حقيقة أنه حتى أقصر وأكثر محدودية  ولكن لا يزال يستحق اللعب. هذه اللعبة هو خير مثال على هذه السمعة صمام لصنع الالعاب مذهلة لا يزال صحيحا			",131,5,1,9,19,0,22

												I was thinking one day, if I was going to introduce one game to someone who has never played a game or had any interest in gaming. I thought about this long and hard. Would it be an old game to show them how it started? Should it be a recent game to show them where were are now? Console or PC, Story driven or arcade-y, and what genre? I thought about this long and hard. Then it hit me. Portal. It starts off slow, but not too slow. It give the player a mystery, letting them be intrigued and keep on going. It doesn't rush them into anything, so it's not overwhelming. The gamplay is unique, and anyone would be interested in the concept of using portals to solve puzzles. The puzzles are designed in such way that they are challenging for anyone, yet you don't need any outside knowledge to solve them. It's not overly anything, there would be no way a new player would get overwhelmed and want to quit. Yet the game drives you to move forward. It's briliant. I don't think any game is perfect. But the closest game to being perfect would have to be Portal. So yeah, buy it and stuff.			",133,25,3,3,5,0,10

												Portal is one of the best... kinda first-person shooter games out there, without actually shooting any bullets. (Is it a fps? Well, that´s debatable.) The game most certainly is a puzzle game, so your gonna have to use your brain on this one. Portal is a game that will challenge your MIND. So unlike in most games, you have to actually think while playing this... and think ALOT. This kinda challenge can be very tricky in a video game and can easily ruin the gameplay, but the Portal does just the opposite: The gameplay is fun because it´s challenging! The game is just enough difficult to be competitive in a good way, the feeling you get when clearing a difficult level without any help is super rewarding experience! Add this with GlaDOS and a portal gun (which is, let´s be real here: one of the coolest ""weapon"" in a world of gaming) and you have a super joyful, challenging and unique game, that is an absolute must-have jewel in your library.4/5 This game has the best credits i have ever seen			",53,22,1,11,1,0,8

												Something about cake and cupcakes or whatever. The cake meme might be the Internet equivalent of a Roman fresco, but this game will forever remain a timeless classic.Portal is a short but sweet first person puzzle game, with great writing, intelligent pacing, and a truly sublime main mechanic that was all the more stunning when it first came out in 2007. It was also one of the 5 titles in the Orange Box collection, which was my personal introduction to Valve games. And it's still good.Advanced levels and level challenges are available once you've finished the main story. There is also rudimentary custom level support (no Steam Workshop here) with plenty of custom levels to be found on the internet.No multiplayer though, and nothing like the gels, lasers and light bridges from Portal 2 - but maybe we don't need those here.Buy this if you like good games and gaming history.

												Portal is a game that is not what it seems. Does it seem like a small laboratory tester game? Well it kind of is, but there's something going on behind the white panels of the testing rooms...Right there behind the panels...Portal has an amazing storyline and simple yet excellent gameplay. The fun that you get from it and the thrill of the storyline together make the game so addictive, like a great page-turning story book. This game had me hooked until the end.Would DEFINITELY recommend, excellent game, such an amazing original idea, absolutely fantastic story. Must buy 10/10.			",124,17,2,16,7,0,14

												Portal is a game that takes a mechanic that has been an interesting concept in video games for a long time and puts some new twists on it. Portal is slow at first when introducing the game and the mechanics, but makes you feel like a wizard at puzzles later in the game. Tactics and intentional exploits make the game sometimes not only have one way to solve a certain puzzle. One thing that I was disappointed with at first was how short the actual main gameplay is. But with other things like the Advanced and Challenge maps, and also the importable bonus maps. The gameplay becomes so much better to give the extra challenge to players that were bored with the original gameplay. This overall makes Portal a great game.			",8,2,0,1,0,0,0

												Portal is a surprise hit. It ended up becoming one of Valve's best games. It's immediately fresh, and is easy to pick up but hard to master. It's such a great game, and is a must own for any PC gamer!Positives- Fresh and original gameplay that uses portals- Surprisingly interesting backstory and characters for such a short story- Good amount of post-story content like challange mode and advanced chambers, which are much harder versions of the story chambers.Negatives- Story is pretty short. I was able to complete it in an hour, but that was because I've beaten the game on 360 twice so I memorized the chambers.SummaryPortal is a bittersweet game. It's short, but so great. It fits in the term ""quality over quantity."" I can easily recommend it!Should you buy it? YES! I recommend buying the Portal bundle that includes Portal 1 and 2, as both games are amazing.My review on Portal 2 ",265,40,12,27,14,2,32

												""Come back to the recovery annex,for your cake""-GLaDOSAfter beating Portal 2(which is also an amazing game btw :) ),I got this game during the summer sale,and recently tried the game out,and I agree with other people who have played this game on the fact that it is an amazing game,despite it's short lengthThe plot(in a basic summary,I'm not entirely sure of plot details myself): You play as a woman named Chell who,under the""supervision""(sort of xD)of the AI GLaDOS,go through 19 test chambers,using a portal gun that creates orange and blue portals,which really play a key role in solving puzzles in the test chambers. Eventually you turn against GLaDOS,discovering GLaDOS's true plans,and destroy her once and for all(except until Portal 2 of course)The music is very good,in fact,in the relaxation vault at the beginning of the game,there's a nice little catchy song that plays on a radio :) While there are kinda few characters in this game(really there's only GLaDOS,Chell,and the turrets,and that's it)they still are very likable characters,especially GLaDOS with her hilarious dialogue(R.I.P. youtube comments section with their""THE CAKE IS A LIE""spam XD)The puzzles aren't as complex I would say as Portal 2's puzzles are,but they still are kinda challenging,in fact some involve timing putting your Portals on portal-able surfaces rightOverall,while this game is pretty short(It should take you about 2-4 hours your first time),the hilarious dialogue,nice learning curve on the puzzles for those new to Portal,and great characters make up for that10/10 from me :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! But it does have some issues. First of all, the storyline is very short. Second, its not very well optimised so I get random lag that lasts for 30 seconds or more. Third, there are a few glitches that haven't been fixed. For example, in one of ratt mans dens if I aim and fire a portal at the door, the portal firing effect stays floating in the air. Apart from those things, this game is worth the money!			",69,10,5,3,4,0,1

												This game was the first game that started my experience on Steam. For those who aren't used to the ""AWSD"" controller on keyboard, this is a good start. Pretty much a Puzzle/Action type game where you place certain ""Portals"" and must make the right movements in order to get it right. It may seem boring at first, but the story and revelation of ""Aperture Science"" evolves, and even the challenges increase. A good game that can get you addicted easily...or a game just to past the time.^_^			",568,354,11,80,58,6,65

												Portal is one of those games that gets you thinking. The game indirectly teaches you new strategies to solve the puzzles, and it feels rewarding when you realize how to solve them. After solving a series of puzzles you are then awarded with cake.I was instantly hooked by the smart concept of this game. Portal comes with great mechanics and style. The levels pace very well; they start off easy and are quick while the later levels become more challenging. Although it can be quite frustrating at times, frustrating enough to the point where you are stuck and must see a walkthrough online, the puzzles are generally easy and you can finish the game in 4 hours or less. Because you will only get a few hours from this game, I would recommend to wait on that discount or go for The Orange Box (bundle). Either way you will not regret buying Portal and have immense fun playing the few hours it serves!93/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is a load of fun, and the game can be completed rather quickly. Not sure if I would spend $9.99 on this game, but with Portal being on sale at $1.99 at the time of this review being written, there is no reason not to buy it. Definitley one of the best games I've played in awhile, can't wait to buy Portal 2.			",28,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Amazing gaming experience that I have ever been through. You just never know for sure how you would pass a certain checkpoint, not to mention the process of finding the solution, is it momentum, or something hidden somewhere that you haven't found yet? And how do those mechanical devices help you get through? Everlastingly new engine SOURCE has never met its limit, making the game itself nothing to be criticized. ALL IN ALL, RECOMMEND GREATLY!!!hahahahaha the end of the game is also TERRIFIC ",103,6,0,6,8,1,14

												Portal is a game that takes a mechanic that has been an interesting concept in video games for a long time and puts some new twists on it. Portal is slow at first when introducing the game and the mechanics, but makes you feel like a wizard at puzzles later in the game. Tactics and intentional exploits make the game sometimes not only have one way to solve a certain puzzle. One thing that I was disappointed with at first was how short the actual main gameplay is. But with other things like the Advanced and Challenge maps, and also the importable bonus maps. The gameplay becomes so much better to give the extra challenge to players that were bored with the original gameplay. This overall makes Portal a great game.			",8,2,0,1,0,0,0

												I first played Portal 2, which was one of the greatest games I have ever played! So, I bought Portal which is just as good, yeah the graphics are a bit outdated, but it did come out on the first Xbox. You are a test subject who has to go through confusing and fun tests to complete chapters, you are given a 'portal gun' which shoots blue and orange portals, you travel through these portals to complete tests, there are also other dodges with jumping off ledges through walls...Portal is a really good game, but if you want a better graphics, get Portal 2, but you will be a little confused with the story.

												8 years later and this game is still a mustplay on PC. The gameplay itself is amazingly thought out and a reason to buy it in and of itself, but let's be real, GLaDOS is what keeps us coming back. I have never played a game quite as witty and annoying, though the Stanley Parable came close.			",20,5,0,9,2,0,0

												A puzzle game that is pretty much one big tutorial, with one of the best villains in a video game ever, made by Valve, with an amazing physics engine. Though it is short, it is more than worth your money. In fact, the game is a steal compared to how good it is. If you can buy, get it, play it, love it, then review. 10/10			",67,4,0,2,5,1,6

												I definitely recommend this game, since it is ten dollars I suggest waiting for it to get at least 50% off. I was lucky to wait until 75% off. I'm now currently waiting for Portal 2 to get to 80% off. Possible? Maybe. Anyways GET PORTAL NOW EVEN FULL PRICED! No joke my wait was so long at least 6 months, now I have to wait another 6 months for portal 2, 'cause I'm broke. Just get this NOW! Good day.			",44,12,0,5,3,0,1

A robot that seems like a voice telling you what to do and giving facts when it's really watching and building a relatenship with you. And challange maps. I recommend this to any one that loves a good gameplay.			",7,0,2,0,1,0,0

												By now everyone has heard of portal in one form or another, songs, memes, artwork, and countless spoofs and jokes. The original game is highly recommended for its sometimes disorienting but consistent challenge and puzzling fun. Its great if you enjoy witty dry humor as well. While its a bit short, its truly a gem of a game, and very unique.If you still want more really great content after beating Portal, check out the ""Portal The Flash Version MapPack"" which adds what is basically another whole campaign worth of linked maps to the game. While it does not rival the original in story, its puzzles and level design are just as good.			",886,295,24,85,60,8,117

												Portal is an amazing puzzle game in which you must use logic and sense to surpass the tests that GLaDOS has prepared for you. A great game which on many occasions gets you thinking and making you think outside the box to use the portal gun to its full potential. If you like puzzle games this is an amazing game that no one will regret buying. Pros- New game concepts that I've never seen before, puzzling challenges, gets you thinking.Cons- May be too short if you don not include the optional tests and puzzles to get all the achievements.IMHO= 9/10 Great game that is a lot of fun!

												Portal, at it's core, is a great game for those who seek innovative gameplay, intriguing puzzles and a ""Story line"" of which has never been approached before.Although short, Portal is not greatly story orientated, nor is it multiplayer or co-op whatsoever, but it still provides the same entertainment you would expect for a first-person puzzle game (because there are sooooo many of those).In nearly any First Person game you will find a puzzle/maze like section that does not feel as it belongs in the game, but in Portal the tables are turned. Portal has a nice balance between gore, blood and... wait wait, nope wrong review. Portal has a nice balance between puzzling areas and a first person aspect that has been used many times, but with Portal everything just feels...right.In conclusion I definitely recommend Portal for those who have a brain, those who don't, well, you can either see a doctor or buy portal (2nd choice recommended)			",4,3,0,1,0,0,1

Pros- New game concepts that I've never seen before, puzzling challenges, gets you thinking.Cons- May be too short if you don not include the optional tests and puzzles to get all the achievements.IMHO= 9/10 Great game that is a lot of fun!

												This is one of my favorite games on Steam. If you are new to Steam, then you should buy either The Portal Bundle or The Orange Box. Portal, and Portal 2 are pretty easy to pick up and play and offer mind boggling puzzles and challenges. If you like physics games and puzzles, then this is the game for you.			",147,19,2,8,14,1,2

												Portal is definitely not the best game I ever played, but I had some fun playing it. An idea to use portal mechanic to create puzzles absolutely got me. I understand that it's a rather old game for today's standards, but I'd like to point some flaws of it. Firstly, it's rather short. Completing the main story took me around 2 hours. Not much comparing with other games. Don't expect a long journey from it, but on the other side, it's the time well spent.Secondly (that's gonna be a good one) - the puzzles were rather easy. I'm not telling it was a cakewalk (oops, that was an accident, I promise), but this game lacks real challenge aside from 6 advanced test chambers. That's only my opinion, though, I'd really appreciate to hear yours.But there is also a thing I'd like to mention too - there are actually very few loading screens. Not like it has a crucial meaning, but it really makes you not die waiting.Overall, I do not regret playing this game. Of course, every game has it flaws, but hey - nothing's perfect. Considering Portal's pros and cons, I can give it solid 7.5/10. See that game on sale? Buy it. Try it out....Graphics? What the hell do you want from graphics? They're good, just enjoy the game itself.			",17,3,0,0,1,0,0

												I think it's hard to find anything wrong with this game. A must have for any Steam Gamer. The game is fairly short, with about 20 minutes required to pass the campaign casually, but it also has challenge modes, and a few achievements to keep yourself busy. Some of them are quite challenging, but I managed to get all the achievements in about 13 hours. Great game overall!			",165,42,3,13,27,0,16

												The cake may be a lie, but the fun isn't.Portal uses a very unique gameplay that wasn't seen in the other Valve games. The only ""weapon"" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though them. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning you'll encounter many brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.You're not the only thing that can move through these portals. The weighted companion blocks can be used to take out turrets by placing a portal over the turret's head and another under a block. Energy spheres are used frequently where players have to negotiate their path using portals to activate a switch. There are some really fun uses of the portals here, especially in all of those strange moments where you can see yourself through a portal across the room entering the portal you're stepping through.While the main game is short, Portal doesn't only finish with one of the best credits songs ever created. After the story is done new challenge levels are unlocked. These extras are six levels that you've already played. The difference is that they have new challenges associated with them. You'll have to see if you can complete the puzzles in a certain amount of time, a minimum number of footsteps, or using only a certain number of portals. These challenges are really interesting because they make you consider puzzles that were somewhat simple to figure out in a different way. The idea behind Portal ends up being more brilliant than Portal itself.			",101,14,6,10,7,0,15

												Portal is a Fun Challenging Original Puzzle Game made by Valve Corporation. It brings Skill, Challenges, and Cake to the Table. At first it starts off Easy but gets Harder as you Advance in the Game. Once you Learn the ways of Portal it will be a Piece Of Cake! (Pun Intended) The Portal Gun will Navigate you anywhere you want. Using Portals you can get anywhere faster then you normally would. The Price of $10.99 is an Amazing Deal for this game. You can spend Hours upon Hours just screwing around with the Portal Gun. So what are you waiting for? Buy Portal, Dim the Lights, and grab yourself some Cake for this Great Puzzle Game!10/10			",94,8,2,8,8,0,3

-Quick Review-Portal is a First-Person Puzzle game developed by Valve and released late 2007. Portal is completely dedicated to solving problems by using two portals to move objects or the protagonist through the various puzzles.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Portal takes place exclusively in the Apature Science Laboratories Enrichment Center. The Silent Protagonist Bby the name of “Chell”) awakens in a small room, she is instructed by the Artificial Intelligence known as “GlaDOS” to complete the various test chambers and then Chell will be rewarded with cake.

Gameplay: The gameplay introduced by Portal was probably one of the most innovative and unique concepts introduced by valve, and easily one of the best games released in 2007.As you progress through the game, you are introduced slowly to new concepts and new tricks that you can implement. You start the game with the extremely primitive concept of “put the block on the button”, but after completing a sequence of Test Chambers and obtaining the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” or just “portal gun”, the puzzles get really crazy.Achievements: There are 15 achievements in Portal, five achievements are normally unlocked on your first play through, another five achievements are very well explained and relatively easy to obtain (Generally by knowing the best location to get them, or preforming specific tricks, or completing some advanced maps).The last set of achievements is the toughest, earning gold medals on all portal challenges, Detaching all security cameras from the walls, and Finding all the hidden Transmissions. (Unless you're going to put an ungodly amount of time into portal, you'll probably need to read guides.)

Price: Portal is priced at $9.99, the value system I use is “Price divided by GameTime = Value”. Generally playing through the Portal story once will be about 6 hours, give or take a few hours depending on puzzle solving skill. This game has enough content to keep the player busy for 9 hours, but most people won't take advantage of all the features, so the price is a bit high. I suggest going for a bundle deal like the Orange Box (Especially if you're interested in the Half-Life 2 games), or waiting for a steam sale before purchasing.Conclusion: Story: Excellent, some of the finest content Valve has ever released. Gameplay: Memorable, enjoyable, and addicting. Achievements: a nice blend of difficulty, but not an easy 100% completion game. Price: A bit higher then what I'd prefer, but on the enjoyable factor, Portal is definitely worth it.I have a personal bias for this game, because the first product I bought on Steam was the Orange Box, so this is among the first games I've ever played on Steam! I easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, but this game can appeal to just about anyone, hardcore and softcore alike.

 Overview Portal is, although short, a really fun game. It's puzzles are not too complicated and are more of a  tutorial  of the game then, really, a part of the game. It doesn't have too good of an aesthetics, as the textures repeat a lot. In the beginning, you are pretty much clueless about the story, it's mostly told when you are nearing to the end of the game. Playtime Portal's playtime is about 2.5-3 hours. If you want to 100% the game (get all the achievements, etc.) it will take about 7-8 hours. Rating   Aspect Rating Description   Story 5/10 The story isn't told very well.  You have to explore the chambers a bit to get small pieces of the story that are       written on the walls. The most of the story is told to the player when the game is nearing the end.   Aesthetics 7/10 The textures on the rooms get a little bit repetitive. All the textures repeat in every test chamber. The only part where you see a bit of change is when the game is nearing it's end.   Mechanics 9/10 Portal mechanics work really well, even though there are a few bugs, it's pretty good. Running and jumping do feel a bit slow, but every modern game does that nowadays.   Graphics 7/10 Portal is a realatively old game. So the graphics aren't that great, but it isn't like that they are bad either.   Overall rating 7/10   ",26,0,0,2,0,1,1

												Ah, the game that makes you ""Think with Portals"". This game is really fun, the puzzles require thinking but you don't need to be a mastermind about it. GlaDOS is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Her voice and temper make for a perfect friendly villain. The gameplay is all around solving puzzles and thinking quick. Really atmospheric, especially with the music, which I liked a lot. Quite short, but totally fun.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												It's a delightfully clever physics FPS puzzler. It's not particularly hard nor particularly advanced, and it's pretty short, but at this price it's a no-brainer: if you haven't played it yet, buy it, play it, and discover why it's such a classic of the genre.			",26,10,3,9,15,1,18

												Portal is a funny game. it gives you the knowladge that graphics isn't everything. The game tells an interesting story; a very good one at that, and the gamepllay is brilliant. Maybe, at times, not the most fast story, but he eerie hints at what is going on behind youre back, the graffiti that- Oh wait. Spoiler alert.Anyway, Portal is a great game. The narative is good, as is the gameplay, and there's a sequal, so it clearly did well.10/10 Worth 7 quid. ",19,2,0,0,3,0,1

												Great game! It is pretty easy, and the flexibility of the solutions to each level makes the timed challenge mode more complex. Also, the ""Transmission Recieved"" achievement makes it more challenging for the overachievers. I have most of the radios, but I still have a headache or two to defeat still. The advanced test chambers demand better planning, timing, and nerve, and are relatively challenging... until you beat the first couple of levels. From there on, it gets easy until level 18, which puzzled me for a while on the first time playing through on the NORMAL version. The game is not very long. I wish it was longer. It needs to introduce the turrets earlier, if you ask me. If not, it needs to have more turrets and it needs to make removing them more challenging. Even the upgraded version of the turret seems almost harmless if you have a good rame rate. Even the final boss fight was simple and easy to defeat. I do not think difficulty was the point of this game. I think the main point of it was to just introduce players to the idea, concept, story, and format of the Portal series. All of these four things are artfully designed and are quite entertaining. I think the point of this game is to prepare players for the sequel, Portal 2. I have not played the sequel, so I do not know that for sure. If you're looking for just a fun and quick puzzle game that is relatively easy to master, then this is the game for you. If you are looking for more action in your gameplay, this may not be the game for you. I am one of those people, but I still enjoyed, enjoy, and will enjoy this game for a very long time. I think everyone can and should do the same, if they have the right mindset.			",39,5,0,1,5,0,8

Honestly, I didnt play it for the first time myself either, I watched a playthrough first, but even that doesn't matter, cuz you see, prtal is a game that's different for evrybody, and the feeling of watching it doesn't compare AT ALL to the feeling of playing it. Portal is a game that- even after playing the sequel first, really touched me and gave me an experience unlike anything else. So yes portal, in one day, you get my seal of approval, good job.

												In my personal opinion: I didn't like Portal as much as it's sequel mostly because it's chambers are more ""stopwatch"" centric, requiring careful timing, patience and careful thinking. Of course this is relatively minor as Portal is much better known for it's own unique brand of humor that has been quoted for years after it's release. There isn't really much else to add here, as I relatively disliked Portal in general. Still to everyone else it remains a classic title that no fool on Steam should not have, because of all the times it was free in the Steam store.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												If you are looking at this review to decide if youre going to get this game then get it, no matter what. This is one of the best games i have ever played. It  has lots of puzzles and its just plain fun. There are also lots of challenges and maps you can play afterword. If youre really good there are really hard levels. In the end its is to me the best game i have ever played and you should experinces it for youre self.			",35,5,0,0,5,0,3

												Portal is a very innovative game. And if anyone has ever told you that games can't teach you anything, they are wrong. Portal helps people with their problem solving skills. This is an amazing game by valve, and it's perfectly done. Now of course I also reccomend Portal 2 along with this game also, but of course you may want to start with Portal. The controls are easy and don't need to be remapped, the slowness of chell helps alot with the puzzles, and the game still amazes me how it could be so good yet an unheard of concept. So, if you want, go down to the store page, add this game to your shopping cart, and buy a copy of portal today!			",43,13,1,11,6,0,0

												A brilliant game. The puzzles are made so you can progressively learn and put together new tecniques, the difficulty progression is linear and overall puzzles itself aren't hard at all, provided you are a human being willing to elaborate about the odds and unusual puzzles(compared to more classic games)... just a bit!Graphic wise the game still looks fine in 2014. For a feeling, It feels closer to Half Life 2 than Portal 2, and the minimalistic graphic style points more to the mechanics than to the plot (but that's where Portal 2 stands out of course). And Glados humor :) although it's not a defined character as much as in Portal 2, it will still make you smile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, before I got this game on PC I played through it twice on Xbox. It is an amazing piece of gaming idealism(that works!). THe beautifly simple yet complex rooms that are embelished with the idea of the portal gun that creates worm holes to travel from place to place in an instant! It's revolutionary and I'm betting that the same kind of computational math will be what future games use for doorway room instance travel for easy transition to another place in games. But really, a pscyho computer out to get you while you jump through hoops(figurative and literal). I think this game deserves an award, oh it has some! Almost all games that get a sequel are worth playing, and this one is at the top of the list, it gets a sequel, and although it looks like the series ended I hope there is another one. A prequel sequel or something! I rate this game a 10/10. Well done creators!			",245,62,4,32,30,3,39

												Portal is one of those games you just would not have the heart to delete from your computer or library. The game carries the sense of wanting to replay and think to new ways to try and solve the already beaten puzzles but the only real con to this game is that it IS short, but you can find yourself lost for what seems like hours on end when doing some of the puzzles which is not a bad thing at all. If you find it over youtube or seen your friend play it, the real experience is in playing it yourself. While it is possible to play PORTAL 2 without playing the original, you really don't get the sense of ""Hey I seen this before!"" or ""Oh I remember this trick I did back in one puzzle"" Yes there would be times you would find yourself lost and confuse on a puzzle, I would only suggest looking for playthroughs on youtube as a real last resort, I have done this for one puzzle and it did lose abet of magic for me playing a new game the first time, but it was still awesome to play first hand.

												This game should be on some kind of Starter Package or something, because just about ANYONE with a Steam account should have this game! It's reputation precedes it, of course, and it's really as fun as people say it is! It's an FPS that doesn't feel like an FPS; more of a puzzle platformer, in my opinion. The game works well on just about any computer and its personality, its relaxing, yet puzzling mood will entertain any gamer the whole way through!			",42,17,2,8,1,0,9

However after just 1hour of playing this game it made my brain felt like its burning and melting as if I was thinking too hard!!!!!! there are other modes like advanced chambers which maks some of the tests in the game extra hard and requires u to think twice as hard!!!!!! this game although it has a short story, I think this game is worth the money entirely!!!!! 9/10                                                                                           By the way if YOU have Portal or you bought it and enjoyed playing it I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to get PORTAL 2!!!!!!

To be honest I just wanted to collect all achievements, so I decided Portal was pretty easy in terms of that.Boy was I wrong about this game. It is supoer awesome and fun.

												This is the Shawshank Redemption of video games. It's like the unspoken obvious best in its class that all other games should be compared to. This isn't just a game to be played, it's an experience to be had! And PC and console gamer alike, it's a must have experience. VALVE: You've outdone yourselves and aren't afraid to show the world that anything is possible in the gaming industry. Thank you for pushing the limits of game engineering.			",19,7,1,1,4,0,4

												Portal is a very innovative game. And if anyone has ever told you that games can't teach you anything, they are wrong. Portal helps people with their problem solving skills. This is an amazing game by valve, and it's perfectly done. Now of course I also reccomend Portal 2 along with this game also, but of course you may want to start with Portal. The controls are easy and don't need to be remapped, the slowness of chell helps alot with the puzzles, and the game still amazes me how it could be so good yet an unheard of concept. So, if you want, go down to the store page, add this game to your shopping cart, and buy a copy of portal today!			",43,13,1,11,6,0,0

												Classic Valve title, not sure what else I can say.With the release of Portal 2, the original might have been put into the shadows. It should not be forgotten however, since it is more forgiving on the system. Original idea... That's what the key is here. There's no dual deagle acog thermal or whatever thing someone has come up with. You only control a simple portal gun and have to use your brain to figure things out. Perfect for someone who hasn't played computer games, or is just starting.Nothing really shocking here, just a solid title worth it's price.8/10			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												""PORTAL"" is the first game I played in years. At first, I doubted the content of the game by looking at the plain and simple but fine graphics. As I proceed to go through chambers of puzzles and challenges, it really is fascinating simply because of the physics applied within the game. The plot is good and with 'GlaDos', it is undeniably exciting and refreshing to play such a unique FPS-based puzzle game. It is definitely worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Valve always seem to think outside the box for FPS's. Portal is a prime example of that. Thrust into a indoor testing facility setting, you begin the game waiting and wondering what to do. The moment the first ever blue portal appears, you KNOW it's going to be a unique experience, which it certainly is. Playing with the mechanics of the portals is a seriously original concept and a breath of fresh air in gaming, not to mention that playing with momentum and physics can be really good fun and put to good use, particularly in the later stages of the game. When people talk about Portal, they'll probably talk about GlaDos, the AI character that guides you and how entertaining she is. Sure, she has her funny lines but she never really seemed as good as what I'd heard about her. Also, this game is pretty short to be honest. It's easy to beat it in a day and the challenges on the side don't extend it too much unless you're a die-hard completionist, in my opinion. However, if you look past the length, Portal is a great game to keep your attention for a while and has some genuinely great moments and gameplay. If you're not interested in the challenges, pick it up during a sale. If you're more of a completionist, pick it up at any time you want. 8/10 (Great)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The GoodPretty much everything.For serious.  The music is catchy as hell, and I found myself singing ""Still Alive"" . . . well, actually, I'm not certain I've ever stopped.  The setting is a wonderful mixture of sterile and creepy before breaking apart and becoming grungy industrial and creepy, which works very well.  The story, while fairly basic, is handled expertly through the amazing characterization of GLaDOS.  The puzzles are amazingly fun to figure out as they tend to involve flinging stuff (including yourself) here and there and everywhere else.  And even if there weren't puzzles to figure out, the portal gun itself is insanely fun to fiddle around with.  You could spend hours in the game doing nothing but trying out all the cool stuff you can do with it.The BadUm.  Hmm.  I would say it's too short, but honestly I felt I got more out of three hours of gameplay from Portal than I've gotten out of a lot longer times spent on some other games.  And there's always more Portal to be had in the form of Portal 2.About the only downside I can really think of has nothing to do with the game, in fact.  It's really just that so much of it had been spoiled for me before I ever even got to play it.  For at least a few weeks after it came out, it seemed like it was the only thing anyone was talking about.  But even then, when those moments that had been spoiled popped up while I was playing, they not only didn't feel any worse off for my having known about them beforehand, they simply shone all the more for now having all the proper context to enjoy them in.OverallNot the best game I've ever played ever, but by gum, it's way up there.

												Fun, smart and addictive. Pity its so short, the ARG radios are a nice addititon and so are the bonus maps. That helps make up for the shortness. Its story although short is great, the puzzles are great and work well but not in a way you'll end up pulling your hair out. This game takes the cake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The primary reason I finally got Steam was so that I could play the game that all my friends had been telling me to play for years: Portal. I had hyped the game up in my head due to all the positive things I had heard about it. Having played the game today, it definitely lived up to all the hype. The levels were so much fun and the puzzles got increasingly challenging as I went. I already can't wait to replay it, and to play the sequel game. At this point I doubt there are many people out there who haven't already played Portal, but if I find any I will definitely recommend this great game. Cheers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originally included in Valve's Orange Box, this short puzzle game is solid proof that you don't need hundreds of hours of long-winded gameplay to tell a complex story. It's a genre-defining game which shows us that Valve games don't need a '2' at the end to be good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal was a triumph, or was it? Time to see if this cake is also a lie.So just to start off I originally played portal about 5 years ago and I thought it was amazing. So I have nostalgia for this game, fair warning before you assume this review is unbiased. Portal is a game that revolutionized the puzzle platformer genre, with its new and unheard of, space bending mechanics. But I find that its story is pretty average. The humor is on point, but really all we know throughout the game is that we are in some sort of testing facility where everyone died and a supercomputer known as the GLaDOS (genetic life form and disc operating system). Even at the end of the game, our victory seems hollow as a robot drags us back in, but those brief moments of sunlight are memorable. In the end it’s the clever humor, and light themes about freedom that make portal's narrative matter. But that doesn't exactly mean there IS much story, some test chambers and silent and the environment (normally) doesn't really give much more then setting a mood. The game hints at some other person living throughout the halls of Aperture in some of its secrets and collectables, but it leaves more questions than answers. In the end the story feels like a test and a set up for a sequel, which is exactly what it ended up being. (*portal 2*).Portal's presentation is actually pretty good. The lack of color in the walls makes the environment seem sterile and like a laboratory, and the maintenance tunnels are shaded in a red light to add to the danger and scale of the environment. Each use of color has purpose that tells the plays how to interact with the environment. For instance the red light of the turret means get the ♥♥♥♥ away. Graphically the game still hold up today and has aged pretty well. It’s quite impressive given that the game was a mod of half life 2. Seriously: I have no complaints about the way this game looks. Mechanically however it's clear that Portal 1 was a test. The portal mechanic, while smart and innovative, glitches out constantly. You can shoot portals through portals, push portals through walls, actually glitch out of the environment with the portal gun, etc. And that doesn't mention the other glitches. Objects will disappear spontaneously on occasion and you'll have to reboot the game to fix it. But in spite of these flaws the game play is still the most memorable part of this game. Manipulating space is really enjoyable and the other challenges like turrets, energy balls, moving platforms, and cubes are all simple but have their own personality and come across as very well implemented. In short, the game play is clever but in need of major refinement, The sound of Portal 1 is in some ways great and in others, completely unremarkable. Sound effects of turrets talking, GLaDOS's voiceovers, portals launching, doors opening sound fresh and vibrant,. They can even make you laugh simply with a well designed sound effect. However the OST is completely unremarkable. Every track, while feeling sterile and empty like the environment, is really just not memorable. I simply remember all the test chambers as silent. There is one exception of course: Still Alive. Still Alive is one of the greatest songs in gaming history; a hidden gem among a pile of broken turrets.So to summarize:PROS:- Good mechanics- Clever level design- Personality/creativity- Working story (no plot holes)- Thematically fantastic Presentation- Graphics aged well- Still AliveCONS:- Unremarkable OST- So much glitch- Story begs for a sequal- Still feels like a mod""But Damself"", you say, ""I'm a completionist, should I..."" no. no. no. no. no. no. First of all In order to complete this game you have to jump through a lot of literal hoops. Completing the story is a good start, but then you need to go back and detach all the cameras from the walls and collect all of the radios and move them around the map till they start chirping with sound that can be decoded into images. That part really isn't that unreasonable and honestly is still pretty fun as an additional puzzle component. Next there are the advanced maps, which take the maps you've already played once and turn them on their head by putting acid on the floor or something. These are also pretty easy, and challenging, and fun. They are a great addition to the game for people who want a little more challenge without feeling like they're wasting their time. The Challenge maps however are horrible. They are difficult as hell and often require you to use the game's glitches or mechanics that the game was not even designed to have in order to beat them. The worst are the least steps challenges, because Chell slides a little when she walks, so you'll be tearing your hair out when you get 51 steps and the goal is at 49. Worse than that is the fact that there is no completion bonus, so all your hours (and I mean HOURS) of trying to beat the challenge maps with glitches and poorly designed box throwing mechanics, net you nothing. In the end I'd give Portal a solid 7.3/10 and a completionist rating of FINISH IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal, if you have never heard of this game, you must be living under so many rocks, your probably smelling brimstone. If you have never tried this puzzler, you will find a fairly easy going and fun experience. The Characters are simple, but at the same time, present a quirky attitude which will give you the sense of more going on behind the scenes. Even after you beat the game, there are very challanging extra rooms to show off your bad-assery. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes physic puzzlers and hilarious dark humor.

If you don't remember things well, you can go back and play this game over again.

There are many aspects of this game that I liked and few that i didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Gameplay is stunning, I had a lot of fun finishing this game.+ Puzzles were tricky and kept game fresh.+ Story was good but was short.+ Sounded good, i loved the computer voices.+ Graphics were nothing amazing but aged well.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- Very short game, left me dissapointed that it was over so quickly.- Not too much replayability after finishing the story.- Play Portal 2 for a much better overall expierence Overall this is a great game and I fo sho recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★☆			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game for players who enjoy Comedy, FPS, Puzzle like games. The game is equally as fun as it is challenging. Portal 2 is much more difficult than this game. I don't have any issues with this game.Story: You are a test subject with an interesting past that is explained throughout Portal 2 mostly. You are to complete puzzle after puzzle for the A.I. named Glados. In Portal, after you complete the tests, your character realizes that she has to get out. Although you do escape, you are dragged back in by a ""party"" bot back inside to an ending cinematic with a song from a friend you make in the game. Play the game to find out more, because I tried to prevent myself from giving any huge spoilers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal offer a very good gameplay with decent graphics, but it also offers one of the most breath taking stories with many eastereggs. You get to challenge your brain in hard puzzles or try ot find eastereggs. The franchise has a kind of hidden story behind it.So if you have the money and time, BUY THIS GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok so I wrote a review on this before and I must say I wasn't very far through the game! Now I've basically completed the game, if you don't count the secrets. Now if you like a good puzzle game but like a bit of a story this is WITHOUT A DOUBT the game for you. This has some seriously nice story and good puzzle gameplay aspects. If you're easily scared (like myself) this game may give you the feeling you're bieng watched...which technically you are. But if your worried about it being scary it's not. You will have a great time playing this! 9/10 for me!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal is a  very simple but yet advanced game. It is probably the best puzzle game i have ever played with an amazing story filled with hard to solve puzzles. Buying portal today is going to give you around 4-5 hours of main story puzzels and probably another 5-10 hours of co-op gameplay and custom maps made by players. Portal is probably not the longest game ever, but it is for sure one of my top enjoyable ''mini-games'' out there. I will forever remember some of the items and characters in this game. Portal is worth every single dollar i paid. I recommend this game so highly. overall rating - 9/10Portal <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: i've played mostly on xbox 360 back when it was released around 2007-08. I got the game for free a couple years back on steam and I only recently replayed it on PC. Portal(both games) are the best 3d puzzlers i've ever played in my life. The game is challenging, has a great story-line (mostly the 2nd one) and has this oppressing feeling all the way through that makes it all the more interesting. The main attribute of the first Portal is the gameplay (the 2nd game keeps that and adds in a great story.) The game is fluid, it will make you think inside and outside the box in every way possible and the humor is very nice at times.I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a unique gaming experience with high production quality, even if you don't think you would enjoy the puzzles at first. I would also recommend getting both Portal games because you would be missing out if you only got one of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was a triumph. *making notes here* A huge success.Anyway, still great. Even after years. Guy who knows Portal's mechanics can run this game in about 90 minutes. In case you're a speedrunner, you can do it in less than 15 minutes. Short, but great. And every single Steam library doesn't exist without Portal (and Portal 2). Big recommend for everyone!

												Oh hi.This is one of the best games I have ever played. I would like Starlight Fox (PuppyCuddler666 currently) for giving me this amazing game which with no doubt, I can say very confidently, is very fun to play and is a pleasure to review.Yes, it can be very challenging in some tests, but it is totally worth a try. For me the graphics weren't so good, so Still Alive showed up in the cake room which appears at the end. But the song is amazing. (SPOILER ALERT) The anger core GLaDOS drops near the end is a challenge to get, but after a few tries you can destroy it, and beat her. If Valve asked me if I wanted to recommend this game, I'd obviously say yes. And that's what I'll do right now. Let's hope I can get portal 2 someday ;P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The combination of the music changing according to where you are and what you're doing and the villain being a disembodied voice that has the power to crush you at any time makes it feel as if there is someone constantly following you, but there isn't. Afraid to open doors in fear of a jumpscare only to remember you're the only living thing in there. And then a turret notices you. But when you finish you get serenaded with a lovely song about how much you suck. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rather than making references to cake or lies or cubes with hearts on them, i'll just say that Portal is an enigma of gaming. This is the game anyone can point to when ever the topic of ""Video Games as Art"" comes into play (yes that probably sounds pretentious). It's short, sweet, and uterly brilliant. It's a puzzle game that makes you think outside the confines of puzzle games before. It's often free or on sale, so I strongly suggest picking it up if you come across it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Portal. Everything that could be said about it has probably been said 100+ times, so I will only say it's every bit as fantastic as people make it out to be and more. That said, it is essentially a game of one trick and it might not offer so much in terms of replay value unless you're the 'challenge mode' type - or, like me, you fall in love with GlaDOS' character writing.

The effects are awesome, the stress is extreme, and the story-line is profound!The game seems like it could be predictable, but it really isn't. It's the perfect mixture of fun, mystery, and suspense!After finishing the game, you almost won't be able to help but buy Portal 2 - so that you can see the solution to the mystery in the game.I really recommend this game. It's awesome! Don't wait for Santa Clause to buy it for you, do it yourself - and while you're at it, buy a copy for Santa, too!P.S. The Cake Is A Lie! (Want to know what that means?

												Wow, just wow. For a title that’s only two hours long (give or take), Portal is an exemplary game that keeps drawing you back to play it through again and again. The simple and yet brilliant premise of portal-based puzzle solving plus a simple and yet brilliantly well told story dripping with black comedy is an odd combo that somehow works to turn this game into a modern masterpiece, one of the first for the gaming world. A must have for everybody, not just gamers. This game not only is fun, but it also tests your mind, something that even parents can get into. Dive on in, and get ready for a portal-hopping good time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The music, story, gameplay mechanics, and general quality all shine and make the short playthrough acceptable in my eyes. This is a game anyone on Steam should play at some point. If not for it being developed by Valve, then for it simply being a great all around game. Enjoy it, because it's over quick (depending on your skill).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After hearing about the cake being a lie all these years I never actually knew why until I /finally/ played this game. Now I can say the cake is a lie and know why it is.Portal's a wonderful game and I don't regret a single moment playing it. It has great mindbending puzzles and a somewhat dark atmosphere. At least I felt that nearing the end of the game and I knew it wasn't gonna be good news. The music is fun, the puzzles are fun, the game is great. I'd recommend it to anyone, even if they're late getting into Portal and playing it like I was.10/10 would lie about cake again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I physically don't have the means to descibe my love of the Companion Cube. It's perfection wrapped up into a single cube. Unfortunately, it never got to taste the cake. . . . But neither did I. You see, the Companion Cube and I share a very strong bond of love, which the Companion Cube . . .Um, yeah, the Companion Cube is the most loveable item/character in all of video games. Yep.So, fan service out of the way, here's a small review.The game's amazing. You know how you see a nice game, but being someone that doesn't have money to burn, you read some reviews to see what the game's about. You eventually just read the negative reviews to find out reasons why you wouldn't want the game. After reading, you'll probably make a desicion based on what you read some time later.Well . . . it's a bit different from that when the game has 98% positive reviews (might vary as time goes on past this review). It's kind of just:  So, do I want this game now, or later? But if it's a game that's really good, but you're not particularly fond of (some people just don't like Counter-Strike), then maybe you won't buy it.But Portal is a game for everyone. Should take 10-15 hours to 100% the game. It's probably the most innovative puzzle game. Playing through the whole game multiple times is still entertaining. The game is so exceptional that you shouldn't even be reading reviews; instead, eat cake or aquire more affection towards your Companion Cube.I fully recommend the game.Like, to everyone.There is nothing greater than the Companion Cube. Cake is less than the Companion Cube. Companion Cube love.Companion Cube.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rather than making references to cake or lies or cubes with hearts on them, i'll just say that Portal is an enigma of gaming. This is the game anyone can point to when ever the topic of ""Video Games as Art"" comes into play (yes that probably sounds pretentious). It's short, sweet, and uterly brilliant. It's a puzzle game that makes you think outside the confines of puzzle games before. It's often free or on sale, so I strongly suggest picking it up if you come across it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal was the first game I played on Steam, and what brought me back to PC gaming after a childhood of Nintendo. Its dark humor and soundtrack give it a distinct tone that can't be found even in Portal 2. The puzzles are fairly good, with the challenge mode versions requiring more thought. The character of GLaDOS is what makes this game fantastic. The portals are an interesting puzzle mechanic, but without GLaDOS this game would have little character. Its spiritual ancestor, Narbacular Drop, is what this game would be without its story. And Narbacular Drop has almost nothing. The story arc is compelling and draws you into the game.Please get this game. It's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is easily amongst my top 5 favorite games, and is my second favorite game on the PC (after Civilization 5). This is a unique game; a 3D, first-person puzzle game revolving around portals, as the name would suggest. These portals, unlike those in most games in the world, are not the kind of stationary portal that glows green and causes you to reload the level when you go through it. No, these are more akin to holes in the wall. Holes that don't go through the wall, but do have another side; a side on another wall. Think of it less like a magical teleporter and more like a high-tech doorway.Not only can you see through portals and walk through them without having to stop and load anything, these portals are also physically accurate: momentum is conserved between portals. For example. if you fall a long way into a portal on the ground, and the other portal is, say, on the ground next to it, you'll be launched upwards out the other portal. This consequence of accurate physics is used to complete many levels in the game, so they also worked in acceleration due to gravity and terminal velocities, both of which are accurate to a surprising degree. The end result of this is one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had, based around something that had only ever served to break a game's immersion in all prior games and most subsequent games.SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't played the game, do not read the rest of this review!In addition to the seamless physics, this game also has a compelling story and an amazing atmosphere. The game makes you feel lonely. GLaDOS seems not like a person and more like a simple computer program. It's like someone put Siri on the intercom system. Even as the game progresses and you realize that GLaDOS is not just malicious, but also sentient, she still doesn't seem human. She seems more like an AI gone haywire. Not to mention, you've already left her control when she starts acting intelligent. And she is the only voice you ever hear in the game. The only other human is Ratman, who you never see or know by name; all you get is the occasional graffiti arrow or warning outside of the testing chambers when the goal or path is unclear.Speaking of Ratman and his helpful hints, may I just say that with the exception of one incident, the game gives you just enough information to progress. Not so much information that the puzzle is rendered simple, but not so little that you have to spend half an hour trying every possible option until something works. That one incident I mentioned, by the way? It's my only fault with the game. In conclusion, Portal is not perfect; no game can be. But this is as close to perfect as a puzzle game of this nature could get, and this game is worth every penny. I give it a 10 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PORTAL,portal is a physics based puzzle game, that turns games that you would think to be boring (in a category so) and makes them fun. there are 19 levels in portal each with its own fun and excitement.i think this is a great little story game and is deffinetly recommended 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game! Was blown away with not only the gameplay and game mechanics, but the great back story to this game. Not going to spoil much since I hate spoilers, but its amazing how valve has the creative mind to link two of thier best franchises together to create a great product! I think everyone should at least give Portal 2 along with Portal 1 a chance to see why it is people RAVE about this game. I can almost guarantee it is better than any Call of Duty or Battlefield that people may consider to have ""a good story.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really into Valve here lately and the latest game by them that I've finished, something I've noticed from valve is they like to keep things fresh and Portal is an exact example of what I mean. Like Half-Life, Portal really just throws you right into the game with really no expaination of what's going on, and at first I was like alright, I've seen gameplay, I know what to expect in the way of brain teasers and what not, but what I wasn't expecting was that there was a story shoved into this 3 to 4 hour game, and it just added to the already great experience of what is Portal.It's innovative, beautiful, and just all around fun if you wanna give your mind a challenge and the game is just a great example of how cool the Source engine can be. It's definitely recommended if you love any of Valve's other games, it just has that same charm as Half-Life, L4D, and TF, and the splashes of humor in the game really make it even more enjoyable.Even though it's short it's still got the replayability value to it and I'll be sure to check out the advanced stages and trying to unlock the developer commentary and get to Portal 2 soon!

It has loads of... Well... Portals, enemies, vil threats that can't be stopped tilthe end and lots of thinking involved. Usually fast thinking, you need to do things right or 'OFF WITH HER HEAD!' Yes, that's right, in this game, it may be not that changing though, you play as a girl. The only way to really see yourself is through portals and such.

This first game in the series really kicks it off, it is very short and it seems that there is a lack of content shortly after beating it with only a handful of bonus levels you can play. If you want to get into the series, I would buy this game, but if you want a longer puzzle game with lots of content, I would go ahead and buy Portal 2 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you have never tried this puzzler, you will find a fairly easy going and fun experience. The Characters are simple, but at the same time, present a quirky attitude which will give you the sense of more going on behind the scenes. Even after you beat the game, there are very challanging extra rooms to show off your bad-assery. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes physic puzzlers and hilarious dark humor.

												Easily one of the best games I've ever played.  I should have played it when it came out, but better late than never!  The ending song was stuck in my head for days after I finished it.  It combines two of my favorite genres - puzzles and FPS - in a wonderful way.  Instead of shooting bullets, you use your gun to create portals that you must use in creative ways to traverse to the next level.  There are a few secrets, too, that can net you some achievments, and one of them makes the game more challenging since you have to find an object and bring it to a specific location before completing the level. The best part about the game, however,  is GLaDOS, who is by far one of the best video game characters ever made. Considering that you mostly hear her voice, that's pretty impressive.  She has more of a personality and background in the sequel but I like the first one a little better since you aren't aware of what she's really like at first. Like Half-Life 2, the game tells its story during the action instead of using cutscenes, which gives it more subtlety.  I'm not against cutscenes unless they are too long, but they do tend to make the game less immersive.  I can't really say anything bad about this game, but if it weren't so short (it was originally part of The Orange Box package, so that's understandable) it would have been my #1 game on Steam.  I like System Shock 2 a little more, so I guess that means I have a thing for evil A.I.s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recently purchased Portal 1 & 2 through a bundle sale and I have to say I'm incredibly glad I did!I personally prefer puzzle games that challenge me, and make me utilize objects or logistics in order to progress. This game does that and then some. It bends the laws of physics in a brilliant (and not-too-confusing) way and even throws in some cheeky humor. There are times when you can't figure out how to get past an area for the life of you, but juuuust before you chuck your computer through a window, you figure it out and feel the sweet satisfaction as you move on to the next level.Even though Portal is a short game (I beat it in 5 hours my first time round), it is definitely worth playing. Especially to see the ending. No spoilers here, but lets just say that it ""takes the cake"". ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Portal is the original game of the Portal series. It is a single-player puzzle-based video game developed by Valve and released as part of The Orange Box on October 9, 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360...""  This game is a unique classic and It's hard to find a gamer today who has not heard of it or some of it's references in our culture. It focuses on several key elements which make this game a masterpiece of it's time:  - Short gameplay set in an unknown and intriguing environment that sets perfectly with the story's theme. - A unique and fast paced plot filled with humor that gives little to no answers and raises a mountain of questions. - It offers advanced and bonus maps as well as achievements that act as a challenge arc that complement the main story's somewhat simple puzzles.  Most prevalent critique of this game is that it's gameplay is too short and the obstacles are too simple. This is true, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing, because after the release of it's sequel this game should not be observed as something separate from it. We should judge games and the content they brings based on the era in which they were developed and the intent of their release. And the original Portal should be considered a 'Tech demo', and something that is intended to be build up on with a sequel.Something that should also be mentioned is that this game has Controller Support which means you can play it comfortably with a gamepad. It also includes a Level Editor and welcomes native modifications since it includes a Source SDK.  With all that being said, I would recommend this game as it is an excellent introduction into the Portal series and you will finally find out why the cake is a damn lie!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think I could really find anything I don't like about this. Maybe the fact that it only takes a few hours to finish the main gameplay but in this case it's an advantage, because it fits the narrative and it makes it a game everyone should have time to play. It's one of the most inventive games I've played, and what I'm sure will be one of the most memorable classic games in the future. Even if you don't enjoy games involving puzzle, I think you'd be able to make an exception for this game. Also, you're missing tons of references by not playing this game. Look at you still reading this review when there's game to play. What are you doing? Buy this game if you haven't, and start playing it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												        The more I played this game, the more I liked it. The more engaging it got. The more curious I became about what was going on in these test chambers. It only took me 4 or 5 hours to beat, yet somehow Valve managed to compress a truly remarkable amount of content into those hours. I didn't expect for a puzzle game to have such a fascinating story, which I won't tell you about for fear of ruining it. Nor did I anticipate the hilarious dialogue (or really, monologue), or the unique gameplay, or the unsettling atmosphere. Graphics are nothing special, but trust me when I say it doesn't matter: they don't bring down the game as a whole.        Before playing this game, I read on several websites that it's the best game of all time. I'm not sure I agree with that bold statement, but I was so unprecedently stunned by Portal, I can understand how someone could make a case for it.        Outstanding game that everyone who owns Steam, or just exists, should play. 9/10, think with portals!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For The Cake:1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour1 1/2 cups granulated sugar2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda1 teaspoon salt1 1/2 cups buttermilk1/2 cup vegetable shortening 2 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 cup Kirsch (cherry liqueur)For the filling:¼ cup Kirsch2 cans sour cherries3 cups heavy whipping cream¼ cup confectioners' sugar3 tablespoons cocoaFor the Garnish:1 semisweet chocolate bar, frozenAt least 8 maraschino cherries (no stems)One white candleDirections1) Preheat your oven to 350°F.2) Grease and flour two 8 inch cakepans, or line with parchment paper.3) Sift together the flour, the cocoa, the baking soda and the salt. Set this aside.4) Beat the shortening and sugar together until they are fluffy. Add the eggs an vanilla and beat thoroughly.5) Slowly beat in the flour mixture, occasionally alternating with the buttermilk. Beat until combined.6) Pour the batter into the cakepans.7) Bake for about 35 or 40 minutes (or until a a fork or a wooden pick comes out clean when inserted into the cake. Let the cake cool completely. The cake will be easier to cut if you keep it in the fridge for a few hours before cutting.8) After the cake has cooled, cut each layer in half (horizontally) to make four total layers. Sprinkle the layers with the 1/2 cup of Kirsch.9) Drain the canned cherries in a colander to remove most of the juice.10) Beat the whipping cream with confectioners' sugar until it thickens to desired texture.11) Put a small amount of the cream/sugar mixture aside for garnish. Mix the cocoa powder into the remaining majority of the whipped cream frosting.12) Place one cake layer on the serving dish you wish to use. Spread about one 6th of the whipped cream on the layer, and strew a third of the cherries on top of the whipped cream.13) Add the second cake layer on top of the first. Spread one 6th of the whipped cream on the second layer and 1/3 of the cherries on top.14) Add the third cake layer. Spread 1/6 of the whipped cream on that and add the remaining cherries.15) Top with the last cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with remaining frosting.16) Use a potato peeler on the chocolate to create thin shaves. Gently pat the chocolate shaves on to the sides and top of the cake, completely coating it.17) Use the whipped cream you set aside earlier to place eight small circles around the top of the cake. Place your non-stemmed maraschino cherries on each one.18) Place white candle in the center and light. Congratulations, you have made the cake a reality!- See more at: http://www.geekychef.com/2010/09/delicious-and-moist-cake.html#sthash.LFNH9Csl.dpuf ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even that I just played this game for 3 hours, I have to admit, it's a nice ♥♥♥♥ing game.-SPOILER ALERT-You, Chell, wake up in a little cube, then a robotic voice starts to tell you some advices (GLaDOS) about the Portal-Gun, safety, etc.Then the fun begins, you have to pass some tests with the Portal-Gun, being guided by GLaDOSBasically, the whole game is in that way, besides some secrets that you find in some areas and the ♥♥♥♥ing epic end of the game. The more tests you pass, the more harder and dangerous they become. You can also notice that GLaDOS, after every test, starts to get more and more maniac.In my opinion, the thing that makes this game so awesome is the big mystery after all that tests, that you discover in the end (I'm not gonna tell more spoilers xD) and in Portal 2.--The game is very fun to play, with a nice soundtrack that fits perfectly to the tests that you have to pass.Even that it's not very long (I spent just 3 hours) it's awesome, and reminds me about The Stanley Parable (I dunno why)I really recommend this game!

												Let's be honest: You don't need my opinion of this game. If you know what Portal is, you already know that it's one of the most celebrated games of all time. Portal is so tight and so polished that there's really nothing I can say at this point that hasn't been said. It's phenomenal and it's absolutely worth your time.If I had to critique it at all, it's simply that this version isn't 100% accurate to the original. Specifically, the transmission achievement that hamfists a radio into every chamber can get obnoxious -- not because the radios are difficult to get, but rather because they're difficult to avoid. Hearing the salsa version of Still Alive so frequently cuts the ambience of the game  and ungracefully extracts you from the mystery and intrigue. If you aren't able to ignore it, it's a mood killer, and I wish it had been a game option I could turn on and off rather than an automatic addition.But it's clearly not enough to stop me from playing the game. GLaDOS is enough motivation for me to play pretty much anything she's appeared in, and she should be for you, too. Portal is only a couple hours long even for a beginner, so take it for a spin. If you like puzzles and love a good story, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most original puzzle game out there, super fun with an awesome antagonist and one of the saddest moments in gaming (if you played this, you'll know what it is). Although I'd personally recommend the second one as it has more puzzles and even more awesome characters, the first one is a test of two things: one, did you enjoy the game? And two, are you able to start thinking with portals?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal is a puzzle game in which you go through chamber after chamber of puzzles that need portals to solve. You play as the female protaginist Chell who just so happens to be the lucky test subject for the story. The puzzles may seem hard but once you figure out what you have to do (trust me ive been stuck many times before as well) its really easy and really fun. You wont regret buying this game i guarantee it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game due to the sequel. The game is well made! Super entertaining to play and solve the puzzles! The characters are forming very well already in the first Portal game. If you as much as think about playing the second game before the first - forget about it! You will gain much more positive experience from playing the first one first :D Enjoy the cake!

The challenges and achievements are fun, and it's always a treat to accidently catch a view of Chell while playing.

												Portal is a fast paced, great game with an unpredictable storyline full of awesome twists, to the extent of false foreshadowing:Test Centre -> Partygoing -> Escape + RebellionThe visuals also complement the storyline, from the clean, crisp test chambers to the rusty metal of the facility's skeleton.However, this game is a plot-motivated game and upon completing the storyline once or even twice, the player loses interest to play as there is nothing left to discover except playing the fun levels again. That's why users play the game for a significantly shorter duration than other games such as Team Fortress 2Granted, this game is amazingly great in conceptual and perceptive aspects, with awesome graphics and mechanics, but it's a one-time thing. May not be worth a buy if you plan to get a game that you can play forever, so take my advice:Wait for the sale			",8,0,0,0,0,0,0

												----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*WARNING* THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE GAME TO BE SPOILED!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gentlemen, first lets organize this by category, shall we?Gameplay -A fun and creative game making your brain bend by solving these horrificly hard puzzles, and using the quantum tunneling device (portal gun) to transport yourself, or items that will be vital to your success. Also, the easter eggs is also what makes this game fun, and the glitches, like portal bumping for instance, and portal edgeing, is cool too.Atmosphere -An eriee yet, halairous game, what makes this game so eriee are the ratman dens. The ""ratman dens"" are drawn and lived in by one the psychopathic employees, Doug Rattman. The halairous part of the game are the turrets and GLaDOS (Gentic Lifeform and Disc Operating System) from both of thier voices.Puzzle Mechanics -This is what makes Portal, Portal.The puzzle mechanics are amazing! I would have never though anything like this in my entire life. From Momentum, Turrets, Portals, Buttons, More Buttons, and Energy Spheres, you just can't get enough of it.Okay, sorry about this, is now time for the absolutely terrible things about this game.1. SHORTEST. GAME. EVER. I've done speedruns SO. MANY. TIMES. On each speed run I get 15 minutes on my timer.2. Some of the puzzles are so easy they are even more simple than a square.3. Some of the puzzles are so hard to do, I sometimes give up on doing them.4. GLaDOS turns evil, which made me very sad.But, anyways, go ahead and waste ten dollars on this game, it's worth it, and you will absolutely enjoy the crap out of this game. ",25,4,0,1,2,0,1

This puzzle game, while only having one- albeit interesting- character besides the player, is a perfect example of how gameplay and story should be intertwined to fully capture the player's attention. Only two hours short, Valve made sure that Portal would strike fast and hard, giving players complex and brain-teasing puzzles to solve while slowly but surely revealing the story through GLaDOS, a passive-aggressive yet humorous AI whose phrases and disposition towards the player make her one of the most memorable antagonists in gaming history.TL;DRValve has created another masterpiece; buy it now!

												Portal is a very good and addictive game I bought it when it was on sale in a bundle with Portal 2 and so far it was worth the money that I paid. The game is just really fun to play and has a very good story line but the only downside to the game is that it only took me around 3 hours to complete but all in all it is a very good game.

I completed the game in maybe 90 minutes or less. It is too short... but I believe it was meant to be like that as it was just an addon to the Orange Box. Still waiting for ""Portal 3""...

												Portal was the first game I played on Steam, and what brought me back to PC gaming after a childhood of Nintendo. Its dark humor and soundtrack give it a distinct tone that can't be found even in Portal 2. The puzzles are fairly good, with the challenge mode versions requiring more thought. The character of GLaDOS is what makes this game fantastic. The portals are an interesting puzzle mechanic, but without GLaDOS this game would have little character. Its spiritual ancestor, Narbacular Drop, is what this game would be without its story. And Narbacular Drop has almost nothing. The story arc is compelling and draws you into the game.Please get this game. It's worth it.			",61,14,0,10,16,0,8

												This game impressed me by how motivating it is. I easily get frustrated with puzzles these days, but the way the challenges are designed, you just know that it's not really a task of managing intellectual complexity, but you just have to look through the illusion of complexity and see the simple solution. It's fun to analyze a problem step-by-step, often in reverse order, with the confidence that eventually you'll overcome it.When trying to complete Antichamber, I was tempted to use guides for solving one or two of the problems, but not in Portal. In Portal, when I spent too much time on a puzzle, I just gave it a rest and continued the next day.So this is a very good game for cultivating mental resolve without overburdening you. I wouldn't want to miss my play time of Portal.			",181,65,2,17,12,4,26

												Portal™ is a new single player game from Valve. Set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories, Portal has been called one of the most innovative new games on the horizon and will offer gamers hours of unique gameplay.Release Date: 10 Oct 2007I find  portal a real something. It has loads of... Well... Portals, enemies, vil threats that can't be stopped tilthe end and lots of thinking involved. Usually fast thinking, you need to do things right or 'OFF WITH HER HEAD!' Yes, that's right, in this game, it may be not that changing though, you play as a girl. The only way to really see yourself is through portals and such. This girls name is chell, not like this should matter. ",31,6,0,2,3,1,3

												A brilliant game. The puzzles are made so you can progressively learn and put together new tecniques, the difficulty progression is linear and overall puzzles itself aren't hard at all, provided you are a human being willing to elaborate about the odds and unusual puzzles(compared to more classic games)... just a bit!Graphic wise the game still looks fine in 2014. For a feeling, It feels closer to Half Life 2 than Portal 2, and the minimalistic graphic style points more to the mechanics than to the plot (but that's where Portal 2 stands out of course). And Glados humor :) although it's not a defined character as much as in Portal 2, it will still make you smile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												        The more I played this game, the more I liked it. The more engaging it got. The more curious I became about what was going on in these test chambers. It only took me 4 or 5 hours to beat, yet somehow Valve managed to compress a truly remarkable amount of content into those hours. I didn't expect for a puzzle game to have such a fascinating story, which I won't tell you about for fear of ruining it. Nor did I anticipate the hilarious dialogue (or really, monologue), or the unique gameplay, or the unsettling atmosphere. Graphics are nothing special, but trust me when I say it doesn't matter: they don't bring down the game as a whole.        Before playing this game, I read on several websites that it's the best game of all time. I'm not sure I agree with that bold statement, but I was so unprecedently stunned by Portal, I can understand how someone could make a case for it.        Outstanding game that everyone who owns Steam, or just exists, should play. 9/10, think with portals!			",280,74,8,17,17,3,17

												I don't think I could really find anything I don't like about this. Maybe the fact that it only takes a few hours to finish the main gameplay but in this case it's an advantage, because it fits the narrative and it makes it a game everyone should have time to play. It's one of the most inventive games I've played, and what I'm sure will be one of the most memorable classic games in the future. Even if you don't enjoy games involving puzzle, I think you'd be able to make an exception for this game. Also, you're missing tons of references by not playing this game. Look at you still reading this review when there's game to play. What are you doing? Buy this game if you haven't, and start playing it!			",97,12,1,12,8,1,8

												For The Cake:1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour1 1/2 cups granulated sugar2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda1 teaspoon salt1 1/2 cups buttermilk1/2 cup vegetable shortening 2 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 cup Kirsch (cherry liqueur)For the filling:¼ cup Kirsch2 cans sour cherries3 cups heavy whipping cream¼ cup confectioners' sugar3 tablespoons cocoaFor the Garnish:1 semisweet chocolate bar, frozenAt least 8 maraschino cherries (no stems)One white candleDirections1) Preheat your oven to 350°F.2) Grease and flour two 8 inch cakepans, or line with parchment paper.3) Sift together the flour, the cocoa, the baking soda and the salt. Set this aside.4) Beat the shortening and sugar together until they are fluffy. Add the eggs an vanilla and beat thoroughly.5) Slowly beat in the flour mixture, occasionally alternating with the buttermilk. Beat until combined.6) Pour the batter into the cakepans.7) Bake for about 35 or 40 minutes (or until a a fork or a wooden pick comes out clean when inserted into the cake. Let the cake cool completely. The cake will be easier to cut if you keep it in the fridge for a few hours before cutting.8) After the cake has cooled, cut each layer in half (horizontally) to make four total layers. Sprinkle the layers with the 1/2 cup of Kirsch.9) Drain the canned cherries in a colander to remove most of the juice.10) Beat the whipping cream with confectioners' sugar until it thickens to desired texture.11) Put a small amount of the cream/sugar mixture aside for garnish. Mix the cocoa powder into the remaining majority of the whipped cream frosting.12) Place one cake layer on the serving dish you wish to use. Spread about one 6th of the whipped cream on the layer, and strew a third of the cherries on top of the whipped cream.13) Add the second cake layer on top of the first. Spread one 6th of the whipped cream on the second layer and 1/3 of the cherries on top.14) Add the third cake layer. Spread 1/6 of the whipped cream on that and add the remaining cherries.15) Top with the last cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with remaining frosting.16) Use a potato peeler on the chocolate to create thin shaves. Gently pat the chocolate shaves on to the sides and top of the cake, completely coating it.17) Use the whipped cream you set aside earlier to place eight small circles around the top of the cake. Place your non-stemmed maraschino cherries on each one.18) Place white candle in the center and light.

There can be challenges along the way, such a drones that shoot at you or green goo that kills you. Parts of the game can be very hard, and you can be stuck on a level for quite a while.

												I wa literally shocked to see this game, so many things to do, so much brain power you have to use to get through every chamber, i was astonished. And i would like to thank VALVE™ for creating this. Basically it's a game where you are trapped some kind of a laboratory and there's a big computer telling you what to do and where to go it's almost like you are her laboratory rat, and you are given portal gun in the game, it's a device that makes 2 portals go in first one go out from the other one. physics are also good (in scale of 1 to 10 i give 9.9). Recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although short, Portal is a very fun game to pick up and play. It is a nice transition from most FPS games nowadays and will get you thinking. I certainly enjoyed this game, and I was really sucked in when the game transitioned into a more ""Fend for yourself"" kind of game, trying to frantically escape and, most importantly, seeing the ""unpolished"" areas of Aperture, so to speak. From there on it seemed more realistic and a bit eerie (the rat man) up until the final boss battle. I would very much reccomend this to anyone, but I do warn you, if you dislike puzzles this game is definately not for you!			",30,4,0,7,1,0,2

												When this was released, it instantly became a cult classic. The combination of storyline and a brand new method of puzzle solving make this a very rememberable experience. The progression of gameplay concepts is very smooth, to avoid the player feeling overwhelmed. Included with the game is some developer commentary going further into how they developed the game. Also, there are advanced alterations of main puzzles as well as interesting challenges for some of them as well. The storyline is one of the great highlights of this game. At first, you think it's just moving from one puzzle to the next. However, your ENTIRE view of the gameset begins to change at a certain point, and reveals the truth about what is really going on. Personal Rating: 9/10 - This game is definitely worth your time, money, and appreciation.			",544,129,25,90,73,9,162

												Portal has become one of the most popular game in the past decade, and it definitely deserved it. It's a fast-paced puzzler with decently good writting, and it always has new things to test your thinking. The Bonus Maps and Advanced Chambers add a bit of Replayabiliy, and it's fun seeing how fast you can do chambers. Definitely worth the Money. ^u^			",36,9,0,9,4,0,2

												Portal was the first game I played on Steam, and what brought me back to PC gaming after a childhood of Nintendo. Its dark humor and soundtrack give it a distinct tone that can't be found even in Portal 2. The puzzles are fairly good, with the challenge mode versions requiring more thought. The character of GLaDOS is what makes this game fantastic. The portals are an interesting puzzle mechanic, but without GLaDOS this game would have little character. Its spiritual ancestor, Narbacular Drop, is what this game would be without its story. And Narbacular Drop has almost nothing. The story arc is compelling and draws you into the game.Please get this game. It's worth it.			",61,14,0,10,16,0,8

												This game is easily amongst my top 5 favorite games, and is my second favorite game on the PC (after Civilization 5). This is a unique game; a 3D, first-person puzzle game revolving around portals, as the name would suggest. These portals, unlike those in most games in the world, are not the kind of stationary portal that glows green and causes you to reload the level when you go through it. No, these are more akin to holes in the wall. Holes that don't go through the wall, but do have another side; a side on another wall. Think of it less like a magical teleporter and more like a high-tech doorway.Not only can you see through portals and walk through them without having to stop and load anything, these portals are also physically accurate: momentum is conserved between portals. For example. if you fall a long way into a portal on the ground, and the other portal is, say, on the ground next to it, you'll be launched upwards out the other portal. This consequence of accurate physics is used to complete many levels in the game, so they also worked in acceleration due to gravity and terminal velocities, both of which are accurate to a surprising degree. The end result of this is one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had, based around something that had only ever served to break a game's immersion in all prior games and most subsequent games.SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't played the game, do not read the rest of this review!In addition to the seamless physics, this game also has a compelling story and an amazing atmosphere. The game makes you feel lonely. GLaDOS seems not like a person and more like a simple computer program. It's like someone put Siri on the intercom system. Even as the game progresses and you realize that GLaDOS is not just malicious, but also sentient, she still doesn't seem human. She seems more like an AI gone haywire. Not to mention, you've already left her control when she starts acting intelligent. And she is the only voice you ever hear in the game. The only other human is Ratman, who you never see or know by name; all you get is the occasional graffiti arrow or warning outside of the testing chambers when the goal or path is unclear.Speaking of Ratman and his helpful hints, may I just say that with the exception of one incident, the game gives you just enough information to progress. Not so much information that the puzzle is rendered simple, but not so little that you have to spend half an hour trying every possible option until something works. That one incident I mentioned, by the way? It's my only fault with the game. In conclusion, Portal is not perfect; no game can be. But this is as close to perfect as a puzzle game of this nature could get, and this game is worth every penny. I give it a 10 out of 10.			",23,4,0,6,7,0,2

												Really into Valve here lately and the latest game by them that I've finished, something I've noticed from valve is they like to keep things fresh and Portal is an exact example of what I mean. Like Half-Life, Portal really just throws you right into the game with really no expaination of what's going on, and at first I was like alright, I've seen gameplay, I know what to expect in the way of brain teasers and what not, but what I wasn't expecting was that there was a story shoved into this 3 to 4 hour game, and it just added to the already great experience of what is Portal.It's innovative, beautiful, and just all around fun if you wanna give your mind a challenge and the game is just a great example of how cool the Source engine can be. It's definitely recommended if you love any of Valve's other games, it just has that same charm as Half-Life, L4D, and TF, and the splashes of humor in the game really make it even more enjoyable.Even though it's short it's still got the replayability value to it and I'll be sure to check out the advanced stages and trying to unlock the developer commentary and get to Portal 2 soon!

												To call Portal anything less than one of the greatest games ever would be an injustice.  I finally played this, years after it's humour had become pop culture, and I can attest to it's magnificence.  Highlights of a flawless experience include the puzzling gameplay, a masterfully crafted and voiced antagonist in GLaDOS and humour and cleverless that is unsurpassed.As the credits rolled (which are a masterpeice in themselves) I was ready to do it all over again in an instant.  If you have somehow managed to avoid playing Portal until now, like I had, do yourself a favour and dive in - there will be not regrets (just cake*).*The cake may be a lie.

Occasionally I will boot it up just to try and beat some of the achievements that remain unearned... but then I remember why they remain unearned. Portal 1 has some very tough puzzles, tougher than most found in Portal 2. The final battle with GlaDOS is great from at the very least a character development point of view. You should definitely check this out if you have any interest in the world of Portal... it's still a great game that you can knock over in a few hours.But seriously - did you not buy the Orange Box?

No enemies to shoot, just puzzles.Years went, and then I decided to give it a go again. To be honest I just wanted to collect all achievements, so I decided Portal was pretty easy in terms of that.Boy was I wrong about this game. It is supoer awesome and fun. It really has a good sense of humour!Just try this game, try playing it for at least an hour, you will get the idea and fun will come.			",115,10,5,14,8,0,4

												One of the finest games ever made. Overshadowed just barely by its spectacular sequel, Portal is an example of game design done right, a puzzle-based FPS without enemies whose interesting core mechanic forces you to rethink the way you approach platforming.If you haven't yet played this, I'm jealous. Treat yourself.			",243,42,1,37,12,0,56

												Portal - the names describes it all... Well, almost!Never before have I experienced a game so intense, mind-bending, and entertaining as I have with Portal! The effects are awesome, the stress is extreme, and the story-line is profound!The game seems like it could be predictable, but it really isn't. It's the perfect mixture of fun, mystery, and suspense!After finishing the game, you almost won't be able to help but buy Portal 2 - so that you can see the solution to the mystery in the game.I really recommend this game. It's awesome! Don't wait for Santa Clause to buy it for you, do it yourself - and while you're at it, buy a copy for Santa, too!P.S. The Cake Is A Lie! (Want to know what that means? Buy Portal, and I promise you, you will find out!)			",42,1,1,0,5,0,7

												I liked the new take on the FPS genre mixed with puzzles that leverage the Steam engine. I bought the Portal pack when it was on sale, and I recommend it for anyone who has not played it. The game has a great twist in the story line, and you can tell that Valve paid a lot of attention to crafting the introduction of mechanics to the player. Once you've finished the game, the challenges and advanced chambers lead to more replay opportunities. I'd love it if there was a Community Test Chamber added like the one found in Portal 2.

												Portal is one of those games you just would not have the heart to delete from your computer or library. The game carries the sense of wanting to replay and think to new ways to try and solve the already beaten puzzles but the only real con to this game is that it IS short, but you can find yourself lost for what seems like hours on end when doing some of the puzzles which is not a bad thing at all. If you find it over youtube or seen your friend play it, the real experience is in playing it yourself. While it is possible to play PORTAL 2 without playing the original, you really don't get the sense of ""Hey I seen this before!"" or ""Oh I remember this trick I did back in one puzzle"" Yes there would be times you would find yourself lost and confuse on a puzzle, I would only suggest looking for playthroughs on youtube as a real last resort, I have done this for one puzzle and it did lose abet of magic for me playing a new game the first time, but it was still awesome to play first hand.

												""PORTAL"" is the first game I played in years. At first, I doubted the content of the game by looking at the plain and simple but fine graphics. As I proceed to go through chambers of puzzles and challenges, it really is fascinating simply because of the physics applied within the game. The plot is good and with 'GlaDos', it is undeniably exciting and refreshing to play such a unique FPS-based puzzle game. It is definitely worth playing.			",106,23,5,7,13,2,11

												Classic Valve title, not sure what else I can say.With the release of Portal 2, the original might have been put into the shadows. It should not be forgotten however, since it is more forgiving on the system. Original idea... That's what the key is here. There's no dual deagle acog thermal or whatever thing someone has come up with. You only control a simple portal gun and have to use your brain to figure things out. Perfect for someone who hasn't played computer games, or is just starting.Nothing really shocking here, just a solid title worth it's price.8/10			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												This game is a great game, the second one is better but i'm talking about this one. In this game you play as a girl named Chell, and you use a thing called a quantnam space hole genorator or something like that aka the ""portal gun"". In the game you have to deafeat the homosidal robot: GLaDoS (yes, you have to capidalize those letters). GLaDoS will place you in rooms with the portal gun and in those rooms will be filled with the folowing items: buttons, cubes, lasers, acids, doors and diffrent colered walls. White walls you can shoot portals onto and black walls you cannot. The rooms you will be put into are called test chambers. They are each filled with different puzzels and they get harder as you progress. Also just to note there are things that shoot you: Turrets, and anamate objects that are freindly: Companion cubes.The game isn't perrfect so I give it an 8.5 out of 10			",24,5,0,0,4,0,0

												A really long time I had wondered what's so great about this game. I thought it was some kind of shooter and well..I'm not a big fan of that kind of genre.I was wrong. SO WRONG!Portal is far away from a shooter. It's a really clever puzzle game with a lot of (mostly black) humor and an unique gameplay (first person). Each level is great to play and challenges your brain. You have to solve challenges by shooting portals to maneuver objects or even yourself through each chamber.I'd recommend to play it with a gamepad, since some stuff is easier to do with. In particular if you are an achievement hunter.The only negative point for me is; it's too short! There are 19 chambers, 6 advanced chambers and 6 bonus chambers. And if you got the hang out of the game, well, it can be over quickly. (But luckily there is Portal 2 and some nice Mods.)So if you like puzzle games and got a glimmer of black humor, Portal is perfect for you.			",48,55,1,6,10,0,5

												If at first you try but don't succeed, you fail.That sums it up in a nutshel, the best £7 I have ever spent.An amazing concept where you are given a portal gun and you are tasked to get from place A to B. There can be challenges along the way, such a drones that shoot at you or green goo that kills you. Parts of the game can be very hard, and you can be stuck on a level for quite a while. Thankfully, there is an amazing community where you can find help, and do many other things. This game is amazing.11/10 (can I do that?)			",80,14,1,8,21,1,9

												Adds to what makes The Orange Box great.Portal is a first person...puzzle game? That's right. Not only is Portal unique in being a first person game with virtualing NO ""shooting"", but it's first person POV makes its puzzles all-the-more emersive. Portal's story is set in the Aperture testing labs, a tie-in to the Half-Life series lore, where a rogue AI with a morbid sense of humor is attempting to off its latest guinea pig. You control Michelle, a test subject who slowly uncovers just what went haywire, why trying not to join the previous test subjects in oblivion. With some very clever puzzles and a twisted sense of humor, Portal builds upon the lore of the Half-Life series in some really cool ways.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ten years later, and Portal still has growing nubers of fans, including myself. The game is rather short, but has a good replay factor with all of the easter eggs and bonus testchambers. GLaDOS is hillarious with her robotic-voiced jokes and dark humor. If you're looking for a game that will make you laugh, this is the game. If you're looking for a game that will give you that ""I solved my math homework"" acomplishment feel, this is also the game. If you're looking for cake, this is not the game.			",6,0,0,1,2,0,0

They rather play golf like Michael Ironside and Kevin Sorbo. The movies they are in, are action packed. But this game is not so. The more you play it, the better you get at solving the tricky parts.Do they understand that, I doubt it. This get 9/10, less than 10 for the time it takes sometimes like 3 weeks to get past the tough bit.			",77,1,0,4,0,0,0

												This game is seriously mind blowing fun, love how you can get to the other side just by placing portals though sometimes the mind game can get a little hard and requires a lot of thinking, but thats what make this game challenging. Just remember to take a short break if you are left with a puzzling chamber because it can get quite lethargic to figure out the ways to get through the chamber. Definitely try Portal 2 too.

												Great puzzle game from Valve. Campaign is short (about 2h) and straightforward, good writing with some excellent dark humour. Glados is a top character. The main draw in the game is the replayability in trying to beat the test rooms again on the special objectives mode. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Play a game that will mess with your mind. Your a prisoner that's forced to do all these skills and challenges. An amazing story line with an epic twist at the end teleport through endless portals fly everywhere do what you want. For a price of $10 or you can buy it in the Orange Box in which you will recieve other games as well as TF2 Premium the game is worth it. You can also just wait for it to be on sale and get it with Portal 2.  Not much replay value though and can get fustrating doing a puzzle over and over it's not really my type of game but i still had a good time.Fun puzzle games 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Introducing a simple mechanic and making it an unforgettable main feature is something common to video games.  We've seen it in the past with such simple things as leaping, turning back time while on a limited clock, and other innovators.  Portal, somehow, makes leaping from one location to another near-instantaneously - simple teleportation with two exits - an amazing experience.  While the game is fun and the puzzles brainwracking, it's Valve's writing that'll keep you coming back for more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												portal is a great but is short. thats the down side, well if u think about it, it is super hard and that adds up to make it a long game. it is realy fun and just when u think u get out of the bilding u don't. and u die. o well big deal it still is lots of fun. the controls of the game are forwrds 'W', right 'D' back 'S' and left is 'A'.to shot blue portal is your left mous botton and orang portal is right mous botton. space bar is to jump and control / ctrl is to crouch.I'll give it 4 and a half stars out of five stars.I reeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaly recomend it and the cash is totaly worth it. it is a great game and i recomen you buy it,and if you do have fun.

												I was wanting this game for a long time and when I got it I was not disappointed! The puzzles can be hard and enjoyable at the same time. If there is any negatives it's that the final battle was kinda underwhelming, I did not die even once and I DID die during normal game play so yeah. Overall this game is EPIC. It has its own physics and custom rules which it nice. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles and adventure!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal is classified as an FPS, but it's not really a shooter since your gun can only fire portals. Portal is more of a first person puzzle game. You go through several test chambers to solve puzzles, usually finding a way to get a cube on a switch to open a door. It's a really short game, but an amazing experience. Something I think every gamer should play at least once.			",100,31,2,3,4,2,5

												Portal has a great story, game mechanic and it's very fun to play. I recommend playing the first game before portal 2 although it is not necessary for learning the gameplay, the story makes a lot more sense after playing portal. For the people that want something more difficult than the campaign afterwards there are modes and rooms that are extra hard to solve. My advice is that you play the first game and if you like it portal 2 will definitely be a game that you will never forget. My rating for the game is a 10/10 because its an amazingly good game and for only €8,99!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal is a puzzle game released by Valve in late 2007 along with The Orange Box, it was intended to be something of a stocking stuffer as an apology for there not being a Half-Life 2: Episode 3. It wound up becoming the most successful game of the lot.The game was developed by a small team whom Gabe Newell imediately hired after seeing their previous work ""Narbacular Drop"", The precursor to Portal.Spoiling as little as possible: You are a woman named Chell who has awoken from what can only be assumed is a cryosleep in the Aperture Science Enrichment Centre. You are greeted by a voice called GLaDOS or ""Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System"" who tells you that you're about to take part in a serious of tests involving the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. (Or just the Portal Gun.)The gameplay is simple. You guide Chell through a series of puzzles contained within the game's 19 test chambers with naturally progressing difficulty, though, the difficulty of the game as a whole isn't that bad, the puzzles aren't mind boggling and the closest thing you'll come to common enemies are these adorable white spherical turrets. The game runs on the Source Engine and it's acurate physics simulations. This is shown off in many of the game's mechanics most notably momentum based puzzles which like the rest of the game is sound. The game is quite easy once you know the solutions to the puzzles, beatable in just three hours on the first playthrough and if you're like me can be beaten in as little as 35 minutes when you decide to try and speedrun it. (or even less if you're persistent enough, I've seen people do it in as little as 9 minutes.) Don't worry about that first playthrough though, as you'll miss out on the game's fantastic writing and pacing if you do. Ellen McLain gives a brilliant performance as GLaDOS with well crafted dark humour anybody can enjoy.SPOILER TERRITORY AHEADAfter all is said and done and you reach the end of Chamber 19 you're sent into an incinerator. Most of GLaDOS' dialogue up to this point sounded as though it could have been pre-recorded but it now becomes aparant she's been watching you the whole time and is aware of your escape after you... do that. You make your way through the less sterile maintenance areas of the facility with GLaDOS trying desperatley to convince you to go back with promise of cake. You eventually come across an office area after a turret battle and become ever more convinced that GLaDOS is the reason you've not met any other humans. You then cross a bridge into her chamber. The hulking machine now resorting to death threats. You then do battle, redirecting rockets through portals and into her body. You then incinerate some important pieces of her until she's destroyed. You're shown a brief glimpse of the outside world before being dragged back into Aperture's walls. The credits roll to ""Still Alive"" written by Jonathan Coulton. It's a sweet little tune, I'll leave it at that. Go listen to it yourself after beating the game.NOW LEAVING SPOILER TERRITORYThe game has 15 achievements for you to get in order to claim you've 100% complete the game. To get some you'll have to play through the game's extra modes. Challenge mode puts you back into a few chambers except trying to beat it under one of three conditions: Least Portals, Least Steps, Least Time. Getting every achievement will require some very good knowlege of the game's mechanics and the way the chambers are designed. Good Luck getting the Vanilla Crazy Cake achievement, this requires getting the highest rank for each challenge and for each chamber. The other mode are the Advanced Chambers. You're dropped back into chambers 13-18 except they've been made much harder to complete. To get the Aperture Science achievement you will need to beat all six.After you've done it all? Well. I'm kind. I shall now list some notable mods and map packs for Portal which you should definately give a look:MODS:Very hard logical puzzles: Portal ProBullsh!t flinging puzzles: Portal PreludeSomething Different: Portal UnityGreat Aesthetics and New Mechanics: Blue PortalsJust... More Portal with little in terms of new mechanics: Gamma EnergyEnergy Pellets, Just... Energy Pellets: RexauraAcid Trip: Hetzchase NailwayMAP PACKS:Another.Test.SubjectPortal: The Flash Version Map PackPortal: Underground Story			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This seems like a game for people that don't get vidagamez.  When they look, at a puzzle game with physics. Gravity is a part of the fun. They rather play golf like Michael Ironside and Kevin Sorbo. The movies they are in, are action packed. But this game is not so. The more you play it, the better you get at solving the tricky parts.Do they understand that, I doubt it. This get 9/10, less than 10 for the time it takes sometimes like 3 weeks to get past the tough bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, amazing. Best storyline from a game I have EVER played, and the puzzle mechanic with portals is AMAZING.This might be long, but here I go:Think with PortalsThat is what you are always encouraged to do, and for good reasoning. You are being tested by a demonic AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who took over Aperture Science and forced it into a infinite testing cycle, where the character you play as, Chell, is no. 1498 on the to be tested list. That is, until a scientist who survived the neurotoxins (more on that later) Named Doug Rattmann, or The Rat Man, noticed she was the one who could end all of this, and switched her to the number one spot before GLaDOS could notice. Although the Rat Man is never in the Portal Games in any form, he does leave little dens for Chell to find, and they usually include hints that will be needed later on like...The Cake Is A LieThe Cake is a LieThe Cake is a LieThe Cake is a LieThe Cake is a LieThe Cake is a LieThis is one of the many scrawlings/writings that The Rat Man will leave for Chell to find. This hints that GLaDOS is encouraging Chell that there will be cake after the testing is over, but Doug is telling Chell to ignore GLaDOS.GLaDOS's ActivationThe only reason why GLaDOS is there is because the original founder of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson, was about to die. So the Aperture Science team had to gather moon rocks to set up a AI for Cave Johnson to be inside, so he could control Aperture Science from there. But Cave Johnson soon realized that the moon rocks are speeding up the ''inevitable'' so he told his workers that he wasn't going to make it, and instead to make the AI so that it would be more feminine, and have a personality more like his assistant, Caroline. So on the annual bring your daughter to work day, GLaDOS was activated, and INSTANTLY became self-aware, and flooded ''The Enrichment Center'' with deadly neurotoxins. Doug Rattman was the only known worker to have survived, along with Chell.OK, now you know the events before and during the Portal game, back to my ratings.Graphics: 95/100Gameplay: 99/100Lasting Appeal: 90/100 (However replay-ability is near 0)Storyline: 100/100Humor/Dialogue: 99/100My rating: 9.66/10.A must buy. But if you like it (Which you should!!) Make sure to buy Portal 2.Just one last thing, make sure to remember:THE CAKE IS A LIE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game was a triumph.I'm making a note here: TIME WELL SPENT.It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.The original Portal.It's short and sweet; just like a cake.For all of the enjoyment,That everybody gets.But theres no sense crying cause of a little hate.You just try for yourself; see if it's really great!And when the game gets done, and you put away your gun,You'll be happy that you have survived.I'm not even lying;I'm being so sincere right now.Even though this game is short, and quirky.And innovative.And has a really cool, evil villain.As it ended I smiled because, I could play Portal 2!Now these thumbs and fingers point towards the sky.And I'm pretty sure not one of them was a lie!So I'm GLaD I bought this!Its on my ""favorites"" list!I recommend this fantastic game.Go ahead and play it...I think you'll enjoy this puzzle game.Maybe you'll buy Portal 2.Maybe PS:Mel.Mel's a good game, but it's fan made.Anyway this game is great!It's so clever and dark.Look at me still talking when there's science to do!When I play co-op, I could maybe help you!You've got puzzles to do.GLaDOS is waiting on you!Get in there and complete some tests!And believe me this game is just great.9 years later this game is just great.I've speed-ran it; this game is just great!And when your dying this game will be great.And when your dead this game will be just great.Portal 1.Portal 1.

												After finishing this game, I wanted cake.I went to our local bakery to buy some cake. They said my order would be ready in about an hour. So I come back an hour later, eager to eat my double chocolate cake. I couldn't wait to get home, open the box and enjoy that fat slice of cake.So I go home, and I have a ritual of opening the box and closing my eyes and taking a small scoop of the frosting. But when I tasted it, it didn't taste the way I wanted to. In fact, it didn't taste like chocolate at all.I opened my eyes, and saw an abomination. They had given me VANILLA cake.11/10 The cake was a lie.			",43,3,0,1,3,0,2

												Thought-provoking and darkly humourous, Portal represents a fried-gold moment in gaming. A simple yet mind-bending puzzle dynamic, presented in a subtle and engaging 3D world, had me laughing out loud, scratching my head and clapping my hands with respect upon the game's completion. A true masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though Portal is short, it still provides a challenging experience to the player. The boss fight is actually easy once you figure out what to do. If you want a quick challenge that you can beat in one day, get Portal. After beating the game though, there is challenge maps to try out, and Portal overall is a great buy for you and your friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal was a great game, and still keeps its greatness, while being bit old. I run on a pretty slow laptop, and this game still ran fast, which made the gameplay smooth. The game isn't too hard, but it's not a cakewalk, because the cake is a lie. The game was mostly linear, but did require some searching around as well. Fun dominates frusturation while playing Portal, and some scenarios give you a frantic feeling, but it doesn't do that too often. Portal is cryptic, but not too cryptic to scare the pants off of players around the age of 13. I really recommend Portal, this game shouldn't take you too long to complete, and is a great game to experience.Check out Portal 2 as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a classic, even though i never played it before now, it is referenced in so much and has so many tribute videos, art, webcomics, etc. Needless to say that my exceptations were high when i started it and in most cases expectations are never fulfilled.Not with this game. It is simply in its own class of greatnes. It is one of those games you must have played.The concept is simple and effective, it's a FPP (First Person Puzzler) and while the puzzles are not that hard, you do need to stop and think about them once in a while, which makes it just all more compelling (whats the fun when there is no challenge, right?).Is it all good then? No, there are some lesser points to the game. First, it is really short and over before you know it. Second, some of the puzzles require this second perfect timing or pixel perfect jumping to complete and that can be frustrating sometimes (or perhaps i didn't solve them right?).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came to this franchise very, very late. My first experience in the ""Portal"" universe was playing co-op in ""Portal 2"", which I finished, and enjoyed, albeit more for the satisfaction of finishing such a complicated game than for the story.I did enjoy the game, although it is quite difficult. The story left me with a lot of questions. GLADoS' voice acting was beautiful, the game looks quite polished, and I like it a lot more than what I've experienced thus far in ""Portal 2""'s solo campaign, although I do enjoy that game, too.I also had the luck to completely miss hearing (within my recollection) any version of ""Still Alive"" before finishing the game, so when the credits rolled, I was quite pleasantly surprised to hear it for the first time. I adore the song, so that was a treat. Probably the first time I've sat through the entire credits of a video game. Considering how much fanart and memes of the cake references, ""It's a lie!"", GLADoS, Chell, the companion cube, and stuff from ""Portal 2"" I've come across, that's surprising.All in all a nice puzzle game. If you haven't played either of these, wait for the sales. They go on sale pretty much every time there is a sale, and they're often sold together pretty inexpensively.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
