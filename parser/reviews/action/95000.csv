Note: Video review embedded below.Few games are as happy to be here as Super Splatters.Its delightfully tongue-in-cheek writing and happy-go-lucky characters are quite literally bursting with charm, flinging their jelly-like bodies around the stage before exploding into gooey cascades to the cheers of their insatiable audience. Super Splatters is so unconcerned with being taken seriously, so committed to making you laugh and smile, that it’s hard not to forgive some of its more frustrating parts for the sake of how much fun it’s having.Super Splatters is all about skill in an environment you wouldn’t expect to demand it. Your goal isn’t to do good yourself, but impress the audience watching you and in turn earn fans to help propel you to the next level of splatter stardom. You do this by making an absolute mess, shooting your wiggly body toward small balls you need to cover with your explosive fluids in order to clear a level. The challenge is you’re only given a limited number of goo-people and balls are typically spaced out so as to require a lot of tricky maneuvering to catch them all.For a game seemingly aimed at more casual players, Super Splatters has an abundant amount of depth in its scoring system and outrageously difficult level designs later on. Different shots activate stunts, the more of which you chain together the higher your combo gets and the more fans you’ll receive. This becomes fiendishly complex when you have to deal with multiple colors, required stunts, and an increasing number of spikes ready to prematurely split you open.Issues only arise when Super Splatters’ somewhat luck based design begins to feel as if it’s working against you. As you’re required to clear every level entirely, it’s not uncommon to end up with a single ball remaining do to you goo somehow not penetrating a stack enough, or slipping through the floor faster than you’d anticipate. Later stages are positively infuriating at times, testing my patience with little in the way of direction, and losing much of the cheerful dialogue that made earlier levels such a joy.Maybe that’s a bit of a baseless complaint though as there isn’t ever a reason you’re forced to play past a comfortable difficulty. Super Splatters is fully focused on giving you as much or as little a challenge as you want, so outside of completionists there’s never a forceful urging to push you outside your comfort zone. And that’s something I find really refreshing: a game so completely devoted to having a ridiculously good time that you can’t help but enjoy yourself.

												Super Splatters is a fun physics game that is suitable for all ages. The goal of the game is to set of fireworks by shooting blobs of liquid igniter at them. This is a fairly simple concept, but can be hard to achieve when you reach later levels. As you work your way through the levels, you will unlock new tricks to help you complete your goal. Depending on which gamemode you play on, the tricks will add another layer of challenge to the game. In my opinion, the gameplay is cute and nicely done.The graphics are very bright and clear. The game is vibrant with color, which makes is very fun to watch the blobs explode all over everything. I don't really care for graphics as much as most people, but I find these ones great to look at. They gets two thumbs up from me.The music and sound for the game is adjustable, so if you grow tired of it, you can always shut it off. The blobs do make unintelligible noises when they talk in their quirky ways, which I find to be really cute. For most games, I tend to turn the sound off, but I leave it on for Super Splatters, since it's enjoyable to listen to.The reply value of Super Splatters is moderate. You can go back to finished levels to try to acheive even better highscores than before, which is a definite bonus. And while it is fun to watch the little blobs hurl themselves to certain death, it can become repetitive after awhile. I would recommend picking Super Splatters up during any sale.

												Super Splatters is a fun casual game that reminded me a lot of Peggle. Why ? I think because of the graphics. They're colorful and there are lots of explosions, and the game zooms in when you set off the last fireworks pod. You also have to think about your moves.The game has several gameplay modes, all rolled into one big mode. You'll be playing levels where you have to set off all of the fireworks pods, or have to perform stunts while setting these same pods off.  Especially the last one is tricky but fun, because it adds depth to an otherwise simple looking game. Levels can be reset quickly so if you mess things up you can start right over. And you'll be doing that a lot, trust me.There's not much to tell really, it's all fairly simple. The goal is to blow things up while performing stunts, and all of that will increase your popularity. Sounds simple, I agree. But you'll see what I mean soon enough. Just give it a try.Super Splatters is a fun game that definitely deserves your attention.[Rating: 74/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A great and enjoyable game for some quick action fun. The graphics, even though they appear simple, are quite stunning and all the goo and particles fly off your screen. Amazing!The level progression is a bit strange and it seems, at first, there is no real logic to them. First you unlock all stages and then go back to each of them to try levels on an increasing difficulty level. You also learn a lot of new tricks that make for even more awesome tricks, combo's and MORE goo and particles!The game plays great with the Xbox controller. It makes aiming, changing direction mid flight (air strike or repositioning) and the time shifting a lot easier and more enjoyable.			",32,24,4,3,8,1,1

												Really fantastic stuff here. It's a puzzler in it's own right, while still being casual enough to mess around with. Once you start watching the ingame replays of some of the better players, it makes actually doing the harder tricks seem more achievable. Really well put together, and beautiful graphics.

												Fun and Fast Arcade Game, it has a nice learning curve and simple enough mechanics to get through the game, tho it can get frustrating when you are just not doing what's expected and one needs good deal of skill for harder levels. Its graphics are sharp and colorful, explosions are always amazing and the music complements the game quite a bit. Leader board'sadd something to aim to in freeplay, the addition of the videos for some of the best spot show some interesting maneuvers to learn how to beat some levels.			",139,38,1,9,13,0,17

												Humble Bundle, thank you.Picked this game up a while back... Now lets go to town on it.Pros:SimpleFunColorfulEasy to controlCons:This game will hold your hand like your mom in a supermarketYou will have to sit through dialogue. This is a game that does not need dialogue.This game will become extremely easy.Analysis:Super Splatters. I picked this game up in Humble Bundle 14. Pretty nice bargains so I decided, why not?Got this and a couple of my favorite PC games in it. Lets get back to this game.There's not much to say about it.You point and shoot. Not like FPS point and shoot. You literally click where you want to go and shoot that way.Not much else to it. This game is a game that you wouldn't really play to get good at.It's more like what I'd like to call a ""pick up, put down"" game. Meaning, you just pick this up when you're bored and put it down when you've found something better to do.The bright and flashy colors will keep you entertained for maybe 15 to 20 minutes. That's as long as it will take. It's pretty much a flash game, but made for people who are too lazy to search on Google.This game holds your hand. Like literally. I get that there are tutorials, but sometimes I just like to throw myself into a game and learn on the go. Not like this one needs explanation, but still. I feel like I'm 5 whenever I start a new stage.Dialogue is not a thing that needs to happen in this game. I've played flash games just like this and some of them still stick out more than this. You know what they didn't have? Dialogue. You don't need it. It's just sort of a break in the game. You want to start moving, but here comes yellow splatter to tell you how to impale yourself on a spike. Yippee. I feel as if it's an intentional thing. Maybe the creators are trying to psych us out.This game gets super duper easy. How easy? I'm going to answer this question with a question. How easy do you think it is to breathe? I'm quite sure (Unless you have asthma. If you're reading this and you do have asthma, I'm super sorry) breathing comes naturally to most humans. This game will teach you to flip and say it's gonna get challenging from here on.It doesn't. I've found myself just flipping multiple times for a better score/3 stars. It almost seems as if all of the tutorials, dialogue and handholding were unnecessary to even include within the game.This game, as I said earlier, was most likely not made for extensive periods of play. It's a game that you can pick up and put down at will and forget about.With flashy colors and simplistic controls, this game handles well and looks great.The dialogue will seem a bit unnecessary. You'll have to deal with it sometimes.I'm gonna give this game a gracious 6.5/10.			",38,4,0,8,6,0,1

												Super Splatters is a super fun and challenging puzzle game. The game first starts off simple and is easy to learn, but later you will return to the earlier levels with new challenges awaiting making this game very difficult to beat all the levels. The goal is to have your splatters splat across the levels and touch firework pods, touch all the pods in every round and you beat the level. The levels become more difficult and varied requiring you to use different stunts in order to light up all the pods and past certain obstacles. If you're looking for a crazy and fun puzzle game then give this one a try. The graphics, sounds and music are all well done making this game feel very light-hearted and goofy, but do not let that fool you - the game sounds simple but is very challenging. I was only able to complete all of the easy and medium challenges, the hard ones will require patience and practice!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This little gem is hilariously fun. With it's quirky, cute graphics and clever humor this game had me at 'hello'. Or should I say, first splat? With various stunts and combos your job is to clear out the pods of each level. Sounds simple, right? It isn't! The game can get quite tricky but as you progress you will unlock new stunts and combos to help you along the way!It's a great casual game, especially if all you want is to sit back and disconnect from the world and just.. splatter around! I really love this game - it was a big and welcome surprise for me.			",1065,477,54,178,148,12,257

												This game reminds me of being a child and seeing another kid with a toy you don't have.I watched people play it. I thought it looked so fun. I watched the advertising, and got excited. I read reviews that are pretty darn positive of this game outside of the steam store and thought,wow! maybe I've stumbled on a hidden gem!So i finally got it at massive discount in a bundle, and i was almost immediately bored with it. Which with the few other negative reviews on here seems to be the common connection. It looks colorful and exciting and everything you'd expect from a Nintendo offering, but then you play it and it's like your brain and your eyes are having opposite reactions. It looks like fun but it's just not fun to play. Also like other reviewers, I didn't care for the dialogue and I also felt like the tutorial was kind of clunky, which put me off from first boot.but hey. I know this review will get at least 3 thumbs down because apparently there are 3 steam users (or 1 with 2 smurf accounts) down voting every negative review for this game, which ALWAYS looks suspicious with a small game.

												Super Splatters knows the definition of fun. The colors are vibrant making the overall presentation very energetic. The game-play mechanics are spot-on; figuring out the best ways to perform stunts is the heart of the game and it is challenging to finish but never frustrating to master. The dialogue is entertaining due to the funny back-and-forth banter. It will hold your hand whenever it needs to instruct you a new concept of game-play (which is actually fine by me) but it also allows you to let loose on a lot of upcoming and previously finished stages with everything you know.Super Splatters deserves to have a bigger audience because it is one of the most entertaining “stunt-action"" puzzles I’ve played so far.

			The giveaway has ended, thanks to everyone who entered! :) Thanks so much for watching, if you could take the time to ""LIKE"" the video, and maybe even comment in the section below with your thoughts...		

Super Splatters is an odd combination of arcade and puzzle style gameplay that will keep you competitively trying to raise your score by exploding harmless little globs for the sake of the show. Your goal is to make these globs of goop fly across the screen doing different stunts and combos building up the highest score possible so that you can flaunt your score on the leader boards. A quick 15 minutes of playing somehow flashes before your eyes as you realize you have been playing for a few hours making a strategy and properly executing it for an attempt on the top score. The are different game modes if you'd like to mix it up, and it's an overall fun and solid game. It is easy to get hooked on it and get 7-10 hours of gameplay out of it, which is well worth the 10 dollars. You can definitely get more gameplay time through actively playing through all of the different level layouts and missions if you really get hooked on the game.You can even record your gameplay ingame so that you can post it on the leaderboards for the ultimate boasting of your skill. It really reminds me of that type of competition you would get at the local arcade as you battled your friends indirectly for the top high score. If a good mixture of arcade and puzzle games sounds appealing to you, this is a great purchase. Have fun!			",351,111,8,27,25,2,20

												I hesitated about recommending this game. I got it in a humble bundle, so it cost me next to nothing and after half an hour I can safely say that will get quite a bit of play time out of it as it is a cute, colourful, daft and funny game. It does seem fairly repetitive from what I've seen so far and I think it will be the sort of game I'll go to to play for a few minutes inbetween doing other things because although it's a nice slice of fun, I wouldn't say that it's particularly addictive and I personally wouldn't have bought it at full price, just because I'm not sure there's enough content to warrant the price tag.So I suppose I should finish by saying that this is a fun little game, but i'd recommend keeping an eye out for it in the sales if you're looking for something to sink a bit of casual fun into.

												I'm a fan of this title.SpikySnail's Super Splatters seems to be the only game so far by the developer, and it shows a lot of promise.  Through no fault of the game's own, it doesn't seem like it's found the player-base or market I feel like it deserves.  If you put this thing in a time machine and sent it back to the mid-90's, this would be exactly the kind of game my sister and I would sit and play for hours, trading off a controller and trying to one-up each other.As far as gameplay goes, you have several stationary characters, Splatters, situated around an arena also filled with multiple small colored bombs, usually strung together or packed into clusters of tight formations.  When your Splatter smashes against a wall or other object, it will dissolve into a massive gush of liquid.  It's very physics-based, and you get lots of different effects by playing with different speeds and angles of approach, Your goal is to coat all of the bombs with the liquid.  However, the real goal is accumulation of points, which is accomplished by taking advantage of new game mechanics as they're introduced: stunts like sliding around curves or initiating secondary strikes in the air, manipulating time, combining smaller blobs to make larger more powerful blobs, comboing; all this stuff really comes together in ways where there's no one way to approach a levlel.Here's why its worth your time:First; it's polished!  Colors pop off of the screen!  Satisfying sound effects!  It's everything you would want in a casual title like this.  All of the controls are smooth on keyboard+mouse and even smoother with the Xbox controller.  There's a nice progression mechanic that keeps adding new stuff as you unlock new levels, and different level types to keep things fresh.It's challenging!  Levels look simple, but you'll find yourself messing up or just scraping by an awful lot.  Until you practice.  There's always a way to get a higher score, and replaying levels until you get that one perfect shot is addictive.It's fun!  It's perfect for dipping into for 20 minutes and then out again.  Never fret about the tutorials or unskippable story segments, just hold ""F"" or the bumper to major fast-forward through the whole thing.  This even works during level resets, too.The verdict:  This game was given to me and I'm glad it was.  It's really good, and I wish I'd had it years ago.			",154,112,2,28,17,3,20

												I'm fond of games that use liquid physics, and this one does it well. The tutorials ease you into the gameplay well, with most of the stunts being just plain fun to do. Each level has three bonus objectives, which you can do one-at-a-time if you wish.This game is actually pretty great.			",2439,766,93,291,276,30,350

												Fun physics based platformer, where you steer blobs of liquid around to hit targets. Imagine if Peggle had a more physics oriented engine and more aftertouch controls for your moves. Sliding your blobs around the level, switching directions, ramming them into spikes and making them spray their lovely goop all over the targets face is what should get you going. Other goals include having as high a combo multiplier by the end of the level, meeting stunt targets set out on the field or just getting as high of a score as possible.			",403,67,19,49,130,5,134

YouTube™ Video: MOB Reviews: Super Splatters 

			Views: 63		

			Super Splatter is a physics puzzle game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/95000/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Super Splatters is a casual physics puzzle game, in which you play as a pile of goo with the single goal of explodingall of the spkiy balls provided in each level.  You utilize combos,slides, swings, and different stunts to increase your scoreand increase the 'views' of each level.  Each level gets progressively harder with its' physics and challengesThe game is entertaining, and relies heavily on leaderboardsand encourages you to beat high scores as you complete each level.  It would be a good game to play with your friends andcompete for high score.It can get a little repetitive as you replay a level several times as it increases in difficulty, and I found myself wishing that there were more variations in level design.When you accomplish your mission, the game does a good job ofmaking you feel accomplished with its' rewards and achievementsIt's a cute game, has a simple, solid game mechanic, and thoughI would have preferred that it had more levels, but for what it is, I can recommend this game.  See the video review for amore in-depth review.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												The easiest franchise to draw a parallel to here is Worms, because both games absolutely refuse to be serious, even when your little squishy dudes are blithely hurling themselves to their apparent doom.  Like, that red smear on the landscape? That was Kevin.  He wanted to be a dentist.Kevin? Wake up, Kevin.  Pull yourself together.Look how many Youtube hits you got.You're a star, Kevin.A star...

												This game does a lot of things right, but not in a way that makes me want others to play it. I can understand why other people like it, but its not up my alley. The dialoge is too over the top cutesy, the interface is clumsy, and I am honestly not a fan of the back and forth mechanic of trying to get your slime/juice onto the fireworks. The graphics are pretty, and the sounds seems to go along with, but I still cannot recommend this game. Definitly not for $10,  maybe for $2.			",351,113,9,47,50,5,76

												Although I havent finished this game, I don't think it matters. Super Splatters is a platformer/puzzle/point n' click chysics game with some great visuals. There isn't much to say about this game. It's fun, it's addictive, halarious, and just outright awesome. You play as some sort of contestants for a TV show, and the more stunts you do, the more 'views' (points) you get.Extremely fun, endlessly re-playble, I give it an 8 out of 10.(Side note, it does have crashing problems on my mac laptop, but runs like a charm on PC)			",113,33,0,4,11,0,9

												I always feel like I'm kicking a puppy when I give an indy game a bad review. So I'll try to be as fair as possible. By no means is it a -bad- game. The puzzles and mechanics are rather simple, but entertaining in their own right. it's just not a game I can recommend for people in my demographic. I'm sure this would be a great game for children or on a mobile device.The graphics rub me the wrong way. If I were to explain why, I'd probably say the out of focus background and super high resolution foreground are a problem. I also disliked how they handled the tutorial sections. They were far-far too wordy and they tried to characterize the blobs. Let me explain, when I play a puzzle game or platformer I'm not interested in the story or reading at all. I'm merely looking for a game to play to keep my hands busy while I day-dream about other things or listen to a podcast. When I'm forced to read it requires my attention to be taken away from what I'm listening to or thinking about.On the bright side the sound track was pretty hashtag dope!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is extremely simple and strangely satisfying when you succeed. But at the same time is is easy. Completely point-and-click based. It would make for an awesome tablet game.			",100,7,0,11,6,0,6

												I'm going through my Humble Bundle backlog of games and I'm writing first impression reviews for all of them. So these reviews are based on anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay. This review may be updated later on, should I put in more play time and change my mind about certain things.As stated: I got Super Splatters as part of a Humble Bundle. That said, 9,99€ sounds a bit steep to me.I would have toned down the graphics and asked 4,99€. I would also have released it on Kongregate and mobile, instead of on Steam.The graphics are really nice and it looks like a nice physics puzzle game, but it also looks like it would get boring really quick. It's not for me, certainly not on PC.			",92,36,6,3,18,5,6

												This game is dreadful, its not worth 10 dollars. Now I know some people like this game and that is their opinoin, and this is mine, the game is poorly built and not what I expected at all, I have to give it some bad and good credit on the scoring system, its unique, but I don't like it at all, when i first started up this game and started playing, I already hated it, I wish that when you play, you stream to some central hub where you can whatch people play, but its just a stupid scoring system, the game is like a flash game and there are so many games that are slime based now adays, we don't need another one,dont buy this game, its dreadful2/10			",70,16,0,9,14,2,4
