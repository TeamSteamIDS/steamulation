												The QUAKE series helped define what video games are today and the second installment is No Exception. Completely different from the original gritty medieval feel of the first QUAKE but nevertheless amazing, with an interesting twist on the staple alien landscape of other sci fi games.The storyline is fairly simple but strong, giving you one main objective per level leading up to a very epic end battle against the Strogg leader.The game had impressive graphics for a FPS from the 90’s but still keeps a worthy atmosphere today, being the first game to use modern sky boxes.Same goes for the AI of all the enemies, it was superior back then but is still comparable to some current games.The Multiplayer is really good (being a predecessor to QUAKE III as well as everything else) but either the system was too old or Valve and id software did not play nice but at any rate it has not been updated to today’s standards.It is still possible to connect to a server via manually typing in a IP address but there’s only a few rogue Russian servers left and they will destroy you.QUAKE I is known for its technological breakthroughs, QUAKE III (ARENA) is known for its vast bot improvement and virtually seamless multiplayer fragging ability so QUAKE II has ended up as a sort of middle child.It is a fairly underrated game on Steam today due to the similar, slightly higher quality games from the 90’s that overshadow it like the HλLF-LIFE duo.Which is also ironic because HλLF-LIFE 1 was originally Valve's plan to rival the release of Quake II in the first place but was ultimately released a year later on a separate, ""more advanced game engine"" which was actually a heavily modified version of the QUAKE I engine........Is that double Irony?Ultimately if you enjoy Retro games or are a big fan of FPSs this will be a crucial part of your collection.As a Die-Hard QUAKE fan I have played thousands of hours of the original CD-ROM box set and was delighted when I saw all of the quake series and DLC’s on Steam.I’m Secretly An Expert On This GameOne last selling pointThis game contains one of the most 0rg@$m1c intro cut-scenes in video game history.I would personally buy an HD version of the cutscene and have it loop on a photo frame by my bed if that was a real option.......but its not......................Buy the game.

												When I played Quake 4, I discovered a second disc in the game, which featured Quake 2. Out of curiousity of trying, I have to say I loved Quake 2 more than Quake 4!As a person who's been playing old school first-person shooters since Duke Nukem 3D. It is horribly addicting, fast paced, intense, and overall fun! Like a Typical FPS before Half-Life 1, it was a satisfyingly ultra-violent game where you take down cyborg aliens know as the strogg, and given lots of weapons and kill them however you want. Each weapon has a pros and cons. For example, the BFG 10k is a devastating weapon, but could hurt you if you are too close and consumes lots of ammunition.In the story, you are BItterman, a soldier from earth invading Stroggos to destroy the Stroggs invading humanity and prevent them from turning humanity into cybernetic slaves. While landing with the army, you got hit by a cowboy, and you land somewhere else. Thankfully getting hit saved you when all the soldiers were pinned KIA or MIA.Also, thanks to steam, we still have a dedicated audience of multiplayer to this game! Like the single player game. Super addicting! All I can say about the Multiplayer, it is a total blast with deathmatch, team deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and so many other modes! Especially Co-Op!Also, try to find the Ultimate Quake Patch for the soundtrack! Sonic Mayhem has made the best soundtrack for the Quake series.Amazing game, get it!Totally not updating for that Steam Award badge!			",254,22,3,24,30,1,33

												Best Game EVAH!Been playing this gem since it came out. Started out in Junior High playing Deathmatch on Laptops on lan. Ive played more than +7000 hours of this game before I had it on steam! Well yes Quake 1 was good and all. It had amazing mods like TF, Airquake, Rune Quake, Headhunters and so on, but Quake2, is really an epic expansion were Quake 1 left off.They made a mod addon CD called Quake 2 Extremities, which has many popular Quake 2 multiplayer mods, etc. I played them all!, listed herehttp://www.quakewiki.net/archives/modcentral/extremtiesfaq.htmMost of these mods are dead but the mods on my profile are alive and kicking! I really got into CTF when I was younger after deathmatching got old, then it itself, I moved on to mods. Ive never really seen a game in its time to have so many mods and content as it did. If this game had steamworks workshop, and all its content if not lost somewhere on broken old links from years ago, it might be as massive as Skyrim's steam workshop today.Single player has its replay value to the max. Graphics mods and coop mods will have you coming back for more playing the campaign over and over again. Iv'e played it countless of times. Numerous graphics mods are listed here to download to make game look amazing.http://fps.maros.pri.ee/index.php?event=610I recommend Beserker@Q2 or Quake2 Evolved for and amazing Singleplayer experience!Think Quake 2 campaign is easy on hard+? Play Strogg Gone Mad!http://www.inside3d.com/sgm/Updated AI. The strogg follow you and hunt you down on the levels for a real challege.Two of my favorite mods have to be...

												The generation of first-person shooters that followed the original Quake represented an enormous leap forward in many ways. Consider that in the span of a single year, from December 1997 to November 1998, the world saw the releases of Quake II, Unreal, and Half-life. This was also the first generation to support graphics accelerators (what we now simply call video cards) right out of the gate, which doubtless helped make the hardware an industry standard. Unreal and Half-life obviously brought new features to the table by virtue of being new IPs but Quake II advanced the traditional iD shooter experience in ways that can still be appreciated now.One great leap forward from Quake is the presence of an actual plot, as well as gameplay that integrates with the story beats. Earth has been sucker-punched by the Borg's trailer-trash cousins the Strogg, and humanity elected to return the favor in fine Starship Troopers fashion. The delightfully 90s CG opening shows Earth forces in orbit around the Strogg's dirtball planet, raining drop-pods of hard♥♥♥♥♥♥♥marines that get mysteriously wiped out. Your pod avoids destruction, landing far outside the enemy's nerve center, and it's up to you to frag an entire planet of cyborg things for the fate of humanity.The way this plays out is in clusters of interconnected levels that you move between to complete objectives. Arriving at the Strogg supply depot, for example, you make your way to the upper levels of the Ammo Depot to access the Supply Station and Warehouse. The Warehouse is powered down so you head to the Supply Station, blow up the logistical train, and take power cubes back to the Warehouse to advance to the next hub. F1 brings up a helpfully succinct summary of your current objective so you know what to look out for while you blow Strogg into tiny meaty bits.This, of course, is the meat of the game, blowing Strogg into tiny meaty bits. Here the game borrows from its lineage with high movement speed and vicious weapons that dismember your many enemies. There's a greater spread of guns than in the previous Quake, including classics like shotguns and launchers, callbacks to Doom like the chaingun and BFG, and a few new inventions like the railgun which itself has become iconic of the series. You have a wide array of options when approaching enemies, and the mix of foes in large battles can call for different weapons, especially once you factor in the varied terrain.Your enemies follow a similar vein as the original Quake enemies in that they have unusual combinations of threats and quirks that must be learned. The Enforcer, a common chaingunner foe, can duck projectiles and fires wildly in certain death animations. The Gunner packs both a machine gun and a grenade launcher. You'll also face flying enemies, several flavors of melee enemies, a foe that can revive dead enemies, and more. Unlike original Quake all of these are thematically connected as Strogg, an alien race constructed from the biomass of other races (mainly human, it seems) and cybernetic enhancements. This theme is touched on not just in the monsters but in the levels themselves, with adventures through the Strogg factories where they are produced and reared.And that's really the thing I want to commend Quake II for, the effort made to weave the storytelling into every aspect of the game. Levels aren't just halls and platforms to frag around, they're designed as recognizable, functional places for the Strogg war machine. You'll break captive marines out of prisons, sabotage power plants, and shut down factories of war. All of this is done under radio chatter from your side reporting on efforts underway, while you come across corpses of fallen marines almost every time you locate a new weapon or supply cache. It feels like a cohesive world you're besieging, made all the more compelling by the soaring, brutalist architecture and detailed, identifiable rooms.The look and feel of Quake II is unique even now, and really deserves to be experienced. The palette for the game is surprisingly warm, with rich orange skies, red-flecked concrete, and glowing golden particles everywhere. Special effects rely heavily on the chunky particle system, giving lasers a visceral sizzle and the railgun a thick, gratifying trail of annihilation. Enemies burst into meaty chunks and aerosol sprays of blood with the smallest provocation. There's something quintessentially 90s about the whole presentation, almost like a Rob Liefeld comic book come to life. Your guns are huge, your enemies are weird and lumpy, and everything is over-the-top fast and brutal and saturated. It can be an intoxicating experience fragging through dense battles and leaving trails of gibs through the sprawling levels.The only nits I can pick are similar to the technical issues Quake 1 suffers from, that the CD soundtrack is absent and you're not really going to be playing the multiplayer out of the box. Both of these can be corrected with a little research and modding, but unlike Quake 1 it's not really that necessary. Quake II was a huge landmark for multiplayer but the singleplayer campaign should not be ignored, for reasons I've rambled on enough about already. The graphics are plenty clean for their age (your Vaseline-smeared weapons aside) and the sound design is that special sort of unique that sticks in your mind years after the fact. I will freely admit a little bias here because I've finished the singleplayer multiple times and got my original FPS chops in the multiplayer, but if that's not an endorsement in and of itself I don't know what is.

												A review for this game is long overdue... I'll try to keep it short and sweet.Quake II is without a doubt one of the greatest FPS games ever created. It was ahead of its time in so many ways when it was released in 1997 and almost 20 years later it's still a great looking game and fun as hell to play. This game, along with duke3d, was basically my teenage years (I know, I know, biased review, eh?). Between 1998-2001 I'd say I spent 80% of my gaming time on Quake 2. I was there for the q2_test.exe release, before the deathmatch maps (Q2DM1-8) were released, before player models had viewable weapons (this was created by the modding community), and when LMCTF[lmctf.com] (the original/first CTF game mode also created by the community) was released. Quake 2 was THE game and you couldn't escape it;[www.bluesnews.com] it was everywhere and for good reason too!I have yet to find an FPS game today that has such a great single player campaign and amazing multiplayer with some of the best balanced weapons ever. The movement is fluid and fast. The look, feel and sound of the weapons are top notch. No one can touch the Q2 Railgun, it's THE pimp gun to use and FEELS powerful as it should. Where the game really shines though is in the maps. I cannot stress enough how amazing and memorable the level design in Quake 2 is. Every single map is a work of art. At the time I craved city style maps and environments like the ones found in Duke Nukem 3D but now the tables have turned; those kind of environments are practically in every FPS currently being released and I long for the sci-fi and gothic based fantasy worlds of Quake. As I'm writing this review I searched online to find out just who exactly is responsible for creating these amazing maps. I almost gave up until I found one of John Romero's archived .plan files. Apparently Tim Willits created the bulk of the maps in Quake 2. Romero himself praised the level design by saying Originally posted by ""John Romero"": I'm a map designer at heart and the levels in Quake 2 are the most beautifully architected alternate realities i've ever experienced. They are so much better than Quake 1's maps that i'm almost embarassed to see my earlier work and say that it's still good.  So I'm not alone or crazy when I worship these maps :) If you're interested in reading Romero's full thoughts on Quake 2 scroll down to December 11, 1997[dk.toastednet.org]I believe this is the game developers should study when aiming to make an old school type of shooter today. Primarily for the level design/layout but also for enemy placement because hordes of enemies coming at you in waves gets boring very fast. Out of all the Quake games I think this is the best looking one to date. The atmosphere in it is just awesome especially with all the environmental sounds masterfully placed throughout the game. If you're a fan of the FPS genre you need to play this game. Forget Half Life, this was the game that took the world by storm. This game is a masterpiece. I would recommend playing Quake 2 as vanilla as possible. For that I would HIGHLY recommend using the Yamagi[www.yamagi.org]  source port which supports in-game music through .OGG file format so you can listen to the soundtrack (which you can download here[www.dropbox.com] since Steam doesn't provide it) while playing as intended. All sorts of custom resolutions are supported but the best thing about the Yamagi source port is their GL renderer which displays Quake 2's colours beautifully and authentic just like in 1997. It also has an active development on  Github[github.com] and over 1000 bugs fixed, making Yamagi one of the most bug free Quake 2 ports available.Vanilla Quake II (no source port) screenshots

												This would be the one game I played in its entirety more times than I can remember. From the first time I played it on the PlayStation back in 1999, I come back to it every now and then when I just want to let myself loose. And it feels great every time, no matter the platform - Nintendo 64, PlayStation or PC. Although, many people were disappointed it's not a true sequel to the original Quake - it is the first entry in the Strogg saga.Some time in the future, the Earth has been invaded by the Strogg, a race of cybernetic aliens, whose past and origins aren't quite clear. They don't take prisoners, they take unwilling recruits. Dead or alive, they will serve as an extension of the ever growing Strogg army. The Space Marine Corps have decided to show the Strogg they won't just sit around while our planet's population is being decimated by the alien forces, and have launched a massive counter-assault on Stroggos, the invaders' home planet (or, at least, their current home planet).As the operation goes downhill the minute it started, the player assumes control of Bitterman, one of the few marines left alive on the surface of Stroggos. Armed with whatever he finds along the way (and he will find a plethora of weapons), Bitterman must cut his way through Strogg defenses all by himself, and try and bring the Strogg forces down.The unique atmosphere of the game will keep you on your toes all along, as the Strogg fall under your sights one by one and you complete objectives sent by the Earth command.The only downside of the Steam version is the lack of the original soundtrack, a very strong heavy metal score composed by Sonic Mayhem, which really gave the game a unique feel. This is something that should really be rectified in an update or a patch, as playing Quake II without the Quake II music is like riding a horse, naked. It just doesn't work. Since the original game read music directly from the CD, I don't think it's such a big problem to have the OST in a compressed format, along with the game. Or at least have the CD image of the game available for those who purchase it, so they can burn it and enjoy the full Quake II experience.			",67,1,1,16,4,0,1

												Warning: This review will contain d**k sucking and circlejerking. Proceed with cautionQuake 2 is my favorite shooter. I love (almost) everything about it. From the opening level to the final boss there is always something that I appreciate and love every time I play. Progression is something that is important to me, a feeling of a changing world as your move through the game. Quake 2 is easily in a whole different world with this. Every ""Unit"" of the game is spearated into a hub world and connecting levels that you go through to complete a variety of objectives. As you continue through the hub world and complete the various objectives, the hub level changes. The best example is in the power plant Unit at the the half way point of the game. As you turn off the coolant for the reactor and turn on the pumps for the toxic waste the actual Reactor Factory you go through falls apart as you run quickly to the exit. It is honestly one of the most sastifying feelings knowing that you are literally changing the world as you go through it. The hub structure of the game does more than just provide a look into your progression, it also serves to make the world feel huge and expansive. From the mission briefing screen before you are put into the Unit until the exit button at the end of the unit it all feels like one huge level. Sure, there are loading screens throughout it but they are so small and come at predictable and understandable times that it makes everything feel seamless. The combat is also satisfying. The AI (While somewhat silly in some places) is suprisingly complex for the time. For example, the Berserker enemy will activley dodge your grenades that you throw at him (sure it hits him sometimes but he tries to dodge) and other enemies like the Enforcers duck from your bullets. The enemies also give out unique sounds so you know exactly who you are facing against, and if you are about to face them. For example, the parasite (a dog/spider hybrid looking freak) makes a very weird tapping sound while you are near him (but doesn't see you) so you can easily activley know that you will not only be facing a Parasite shortly, but also that he is hiding. With 11 weapons there is always something that takes out certain enemies better than others. This game even introduced the now legendary Railgun. The level design is top notch. Every Unit of the game (of which there are 10) have unique designs that let you know exactly where you are. Sure, they mostly are inside factory areas, however they all look different enough to let the player know exactly what point in the game they are at. For example, the Bunker unit (2nd) is a very storage facility type place with boxes everywhere and a very storage type feeling to it. Meanwhile the Power Plant unit (6th) uses very bright powerful colors to show that you are in a place that powers your target, Big Gun (one of the main objectives in the entire game) Secrets also litter the levels which give players goodies, some are harder to find then others but they are all imensly satisfying to find. There are even three levels that are hidden from the player, each varying in length but all have somthing unique about them, from low gravity to a very harsh timelimit to grab as much ammo as you can. The only issues I can thing of are the boss fights. There are 3 total bossfights in the game and they are all awful. The bosses do not have enough health to provide much of a challenge. The final boss is pitiful. After being built up as the ""Big leader"" of the Strogg the final boss, Makron, takes as much as 10 seconds to beat if you have the right weaponry (which you will since they bombard you with ammo before the fight) it really just seems slapped on and I would have much prefered other enemies there protecting Makron (Like in the 2nd expansion pack) or just a better boss fight (this too was fixed in the 2nd expansion pack)The only other issue protains to the Steam release. The Steam release is the base game as it was in 1997 so the resolutions are low and the overall build of the game is dated. However, you can go online and find many source ports which fix the various issues with the game and allow you to customize it to fit your needs, Quake 2XP (my favorite), KMQuake2, Berserker, and others that I can't name off the top of my head. Do I recomend Quake 2? Hell yeah. It may not be as indepth as Half-Life or any modern shooter, however what is here easily surpasses most shooters in quality (so much so that this still remains my favorite over 15 years after I first played it)			",174,25,4,10,16,1,18

												This is a game from the past. As mean old game. I bought that game for nostalgia, but this game is still good how I remembered it!  I think to the other players do not share my nostalgia, but I guess the today's player would enjoy this game as me did!  This game like a hack-and-slash with guns. Because, there is a very short story detail and there are only two video animations. At when you start the new game and at when you end the game.  I know the story is really short. For example; You are a soldier and you have got down an alien planet for kill the 'Stroggs'. You gets many of short missions like; go there, switch that, get that, destroy that, etc.. It sounds like boring, BUT NOT! Not those thing gives to this game fun, the atmosphere do that what consists the strange good yellow tone, the sci-fi place, short of story and that strange rock music what seems like does not match the game, but though it is still good at the playtime.  Only one thing! You must install the [Ultimate Quake II Patch] for the original-full experience.  Good things: -Strange good atmosphere. -Low hardware requirements and runs well. -Seems like hack-and-slash.  Bad things: -Must install the [Ultimate Quake II Patch] for the original-full experience. -Can not disable the mouse accelerate. (I used to it)  


Ultimate Quake II Patch 
A Guide for Quake II
By: MOOK

			This patch utilizes the KMQuake2 engine developed by Knightmare, the music patch originally hosted on widescreengamingforum.com and the NSIS install system developed by Nullsoft.		


 I recommend this game those who like the FPS style, old games, sci-fi stories and the less details story. P.S. I suggest play 'Hard' difficulty for more fun. This 'Hard' not like hard as you expected. If you use the [Energy Shield] item then it becomes more easy.

Quake II				* 9/10One of the most badass and scary games I've played in my childhood. Period.Quake II is a classic FPS, which was famous because at the time it supported 3d Graphic Acceleration (the good old 3dfx), the enemy AI was very improved from the classic ""runandshootatyou"" (enemies had different kind of attacks and behaviours, and the most dangerous ones will crouch to avoid your projectiles), many of them will still try to shoot you a couple of times before dying and... flies will gather around fresh corpses of enemies you've just killed... XDAt its days this game held a huge amount of innovations and, considering the title, one of them was the completely different setting from the previous chapter. No more dungeon-medieval themed levels and enemies: now there are stroggs, cybernetic aliens that create their army by taking enemies corpses and reviving them with cybernetic improvements. Scary enough? Not until you see the levels with your space marine comrades captured, tortured and gone completely crazy. Definitely on a different level compared to Quake.The arsenal is more interesting than the previous chapter and even bigger, considering there are 10 weapons, and there's a BFG again.Another huge innovation is the level structure. It was confusing at the time because in certain areas you had to solve certain puzzles in order to proceed, and they required items or explorations in other ""dead end-levels"".As a metalhead I can't help but mention the badass soundtrack, something rare to hear nowadays.Another interesting thing is the possibility to play in Coop the main campaign.Long story short, this game is the definition of ""Old but Gold"".+++PROs+++ ENGINE. The Quake II Engine is quite old now, but it still is enjoyable nowadays. SOUNDTRACK. Very Badass Soundtrack. 'Nuff said... INNOVATION. Nowadays it may look quite a common game but for the time this title was so full of innovation from the Enemy AI to the Level structure. SETTING. The stroggs are quite scary considering their ""nature"" and the levels we find them in, not to mention the tortured marines we find around in the most advanced levels.---CONs---....... ehm.... OLD. It's old. It's not a DX12 game. Is this a good reason to ignore this game? COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. OK, seriously, as usual this game presents compatibility issues due to its age. Luckily there's the Steam community with various solutions and patches that will make this game run flawlessly, as if your i7 with your GTX 970 was an MMX with a Vodoo 3dfx... And, seriously, if you want to exploit more your hardware you can always look up for some Port that will load the game for you with enhanced graphics. STEAM RELEASE. This is supposed to be the classic garbage steam release, with no particular updates and some compatibility issues, as mentioned before. I am told there's not even the music in this release. I never noticed as I HAD to use the patch to make it run and this patch includes music as well. So no particular harm was done to me... Still there are some Old game bugs that I still remember since its original release, such as missing power cubes, unopened doors holding data spinners or loop levels, where you follow the objectives, go to a level, follow your objectives, then it tells to go back and once you're done there's a barrier blocking you, asking you to do everything again (Reactor and Cooling facility)... Meh... Nothing that a good old noclip can't fix... XD ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												Out of all the quakes i think this one is the best, this game is the last game ID makes that advances the FPS genre which Valve take over with their Half-Life series.This game is AMAZING for it's time and consoles would have to advance a generation or two just to play this classic. It adds outdoor lighting, slightly more realistic lighting from Quake 1 (since Quake 2 uses a completely new engine the IDtech 2 engine instead of an improved version of the DooM engine the IDTech1 V2) and instead of fighting the DooM-style hellish creatures like in the origenal you fight agenst a cybernetic faction thats just as crazy if not more so, they're called the Strogg.The weapons in the game are very similar to the weapons in DooMs 1 and 2 (NOTE: i say 2 because the super shotgun isn't on DooM 1)Also the character animations are better and the AI are smarter and In multiplayer it actually shows which weapon your character has out.Player models are handled differently to previous IDTech games, instead of everyone having recoloured versions of one player model there are different model sets, unfortunitly you can't recolour them though, but you can add new ones or possibly variants of the default set.And there is a part that feels like a part that Valve used in Half-Life, just thought i'd mention it.

												Quake 2 is FPS developed by id and released in 1997 for PC, on their new id Tech 2 engine. It's not really a sequel to Quake 1, but instead it was developed as serapate title and then at the end was given such name. It also had PS1 and N64 ports. I didn't play them, but they are probably inferior ones. Though, from what I seen, PS1 has best usage of colors.So, how Steam version was handled? In id style! Which means no soundtrack for you. It just wasn't included, once again. You will have to track down (soundtrack) CD of a game. And then deal with music looping issues. _inmm software helped me here.Game also doesn't support widescreen by default. But I am sure you can find a way to tweak it. Or just use sourceport.It also was stuttering for me by default. Strange enough, once I would go into Video setting and exit, it would get fixed for me.It also refused to save configuration for me, so I had to change things back on each launch.Multiplayer community is small but still there. Now, I may not be good enough to tell away bot from human, but I belive that you will at least find one Deathmatch with 5-10 players. Though yea, Free For All Deathmatch is the only gametype you will end up playing. Small.The plot follows Bitterman as he is one of the marines that were sent to planet of flesh-hungry cyborgs - Stroggs. As offense is the best defence. He ends up being possibly the only one surviving the first human attack on planet and now has to destroy and disable all the important strogg structures, alone.So yea, sounds like another Rambo vs World. Though, you can actually meet some captured marines in the levels, but they all went insane. It addsa  nice touch to the setting, though it still feels a bit too gamey to see that you can't interact with them in any way. Or just that there are no sane ones, just crawling around.It also has CGI cutscenes. Which would be awesome, but it's a wasted potential, as almost all of them are nothing but a fancy intermission screens. Hexen on PS1 made better use of them, really.Manual is nice though.And well, to be honest, Quake 2 is the last title in Quake series that I played. I heard that it was a classic and heard many other good things. And once I got to play it, I was amazed... at how awfully generic FPS title it was.I mean, sure, it's better than Quake on theory. Because more realistical levels. Or better enemy AI. Or just better engine from technical standpoint, with smooth animation and colored lighting.Yet the game as a whole it creates a fairly dull single-player experience.Setting isn't exactly interesting. It's nice that levels are connected into small hub and that they are bigger. And that you are given missions that explain what to do next. But level layouts are still linear, so it hardly matters. There are very few interesting levels, mostly factory and research labs, where you can see what Stroggs do with humans. Terrifying.But outside of them they don't have anything interesting going on, while also not being as abstract as Quake or Doom ones. It also doesn't help that game looks awful. Whatever technical improvements engine may have, they all are supposed to just improve art design. And art design here is quite bad, consisting of red and grey. Grey and red. And more red than you will ever want to see. Even Hexen 2 which used Quake 1 engine looked better. Or Quake 1, which still used more colors and it was contributing to gritty atmoshpere.Gameplay isn't exciting either. It's much more slowed-paced. It makes use of more hitscan enemies attacks. It just feels like it promotes more of cover-based tactics. Sure, there are few different enemy types with slightly different attacks, but in the end it still doesn't make a big difference. You peek out, you shoot, you hide from machinegun bullets back around corner. Or from railgun. Quake 1 had Ogres and Fiends, one would spam grenades around room and was often placed in interesting spots, while fiends were dangerous enemies that easily charged at you, all of which making you strafe and navigate, being more interestign to fight against. Quake 2 is just plain not exciting. Even melee enemy, Berserker, isn't threatening here, being slow, attacks while standing, easy to get out of attack reach with a single step, easy to knock down.On more positive note, Enemy AI was improved. While they don't provide as much of fun as Hexen 2 ones, they still show more life to them. Mostly just ducking here and there. They get covered in blood as you shoot them down and some of the common enemies can even give the last few shots before dying. Don't worry, they don't aim when they do that, just shoot straight, so it's not annoying and looks awesome. Can always gib.Not sure what to say about equipment. Yes, you got more weapons than before. They got some interesting ideas behind, I like that recoil on Machine Gun, back before recoil was a common thing. You can also choose whether you want to have weapon on left, right or in center, which impacts where shots come from too (it's in multiplayer setting, but affects single as well). And heck, it has railgun. Which even does extra damage on unaware enemies. It's still feels like you have too much ammo and that weapons aren't too specialized in single. But still, nice.Quake 2 also adds inventory. It wasn't implented good. There aren't so many items to use. Sure, being able to use Quad Damage whenever you want is nice, radiation suit and rebreather help with secrets. But that's about it. It suffers because developers decided that they have to put weapons you have as inventory items as well, making it harder to navigate while bringing nothing. Even worse is that they put grenades between all this mess that you can't select otherwise.EDIT: Was wrong, grenade are easily selectable with ""G"" button. Items have other keybinds, but not something I want to always remember.Bosses are quite meh. You can quad-damage them anyway.Soundtrack is quite nice. At least great when you listen to it serapately and some memoriable rock. Or whatever genre this is. It gets a bit monotonial after a while. A nice touch is that music suddenly ends when you complete all goals on the level, showing that you got nothing to do there anymore. It somehow ends up being awkward though, when you still got something to do.Multiplayer on other hand is a big improvement over Quake. Now, it's still old-school and will not interest many, especially seeing how Quake 3 Arena is out. But you got to say that's it's quite a little fun. It's slower-paced, sure. But it finally got balance in weapons. The one who has rocket launcher no longer dominates whole arena, as other weapons are viable alternatives with their own specialization, mostly range difference. Better for those who prefer a bit more thinking and a bit less reflexes. I do have a bad feelign that railgun may end up being a bit too good, penetrating and killing unarmed players in one shot. But I didn't play for long.And well, I wrote some bad things here, sure. Yes, I think that this game is generic and missable. But you know, it's still a fine generic FPS. With very few bright spots. It's not something I would call a classic, but you can still have fun with it. And it doesn't do anything way too bad in gameplay. No cheap deaths or such to frustrate you. So, feel free to check it out.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												Quake II is a long and rewarding journey through a Strogg installation where you must shoot your way to dismantle many key components to disable the Strogg attack force. Featuring a really long campaign and a wide arsenal of weapons, items and many enemies, this game brings back the Quake experience in its essence, this time more brutally and with a re-imagination of the Strogg anatomy. Part of the Quake Collection, which every FPS fan should have in their accounts.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

What I liked about the game •	I liked the Sci-fi setting.•	The gameplay is still very addictive and enjoyable. •	A great selection of weapons. My favourite weapons were the Hyperblaster and the railgun. •	Larger levels. Each level has a number of goals you have to complete.    •	Plenty of secrets to be found and there are also secret levels. •	The game is quite challenging.•	Plenty of awesome looking enemies to turn into big chunks of gore.What I disliked or was disappointed with•	You have to download a patch to restore the music. (link below) •	Power ups weren’t that useful this time round. I didn’t feel like I needed to use them. Conclusion Better than the first quake in my opinion. Highly recommend to any fps fan. 85/100  Ultimate Quake 2 patch (Download this to restore the music in the game)

												Do I recommend? Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun Yes, Yes I do.If you only need one reason: Rail GunOtherwise:This game is why we have such aweaome GPU's today. It made people realise 3D acceleration was the future of gaming and made us the Master Race.If they made a true HD version of this and changed nothing in terms of gameplay and mechanicsphysics I'd buy it again in a heart beat.Some of the best straight forward KoS twitch shooting multiplayer action to this day, and I still love the campagin, a campaign that could be played in co-op with as many people as you could jam in, and allowed back tracking to previous levels.Find a modern game that does that!Free ""DLC"" as thanks for supporting the devs, a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of modding. Custom skins and players models. Paid expansion that were entire new games and content, not just one or two new levels and a skin.Games like Counterstrike were spawned by this because of mods like Action Quake 2.Solid multiplayer online even over a dial up modem.Honestly for me one of the highest point in design by iD Software.I got years of gameplay from this game, was still playing it past Half-Life, Unreal Tournament and Quake 3's releases, especially thanks to mods and addon bots. Quake 3 was just Quake 2 MP with the gladiator bot.Years of gameplay, something modern games no longer have.This is the one game I can honestly say yes, I am a ♥♥♥♥ing fanboy. But justifibly so. At the time this for me was the real DOOM 3, SciFi Edition.If you can look past the dated visuals, it is still one of the best action FPS in history.I'd love to see a new sequel set in the Quake II Universe. No not Quake 4 (felt more like a Doom 3 expansion). I want a true Quake 2 successor.(Ignore my game time, I played this for about 6-7 years and it's expansions back in the days of CD.)

												The first game my dad bought me on our windows 98 pc. Replaying this game for the first time since I first played it 14 years ago was just one massive nostalgia trip. The game also still holds up today and doesn’t feel dated. My only problem with the game is that it did get repetitive when I played more than 1 hour because you are doing the same thing throughout the whole game with no variation. I couldn’t marathon through it like I was hoping to, I played 1-2 hours a day to keep myself entertained throughout. More variety visually would have helped I think it’s what keeps games like doom 1 and 2 from being repetitive.8/10 (Great)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												You play as Space Muhreen Bitterman and you shoot and explode your way through the planet of Strogg - abominations of stolen flesh and robotics. You basically take their planet apart, little by little, all on your own, with one of my favorite final bosses as the cherry on top.Quake invented FPS.			",238,71,17,37,23,2,25

												While not what people were expecting from a sequel to Quake, it still keeps to the Quake roots, and I enjoyed it very much.Quake II adds an actual storyline to the Quake series. In this game, you're fighting against the Strogg, once again all by yourself. The levels are objective-based, however they still play pretty much the same as original Quake levels, but less maze-like for the most part. This may put some people off. The game has been given a complete graphical overhaul; more or less every texture and model in the game has been completely remade to fit the look of Quake II. I would write more, but I haven't played this game in a long time and my memory of it isn't too good. What I will say, though, is that it's still a fantastic shooter well worth your time. It's not what you were expecting, but it's a good game in it's own right. Oh, and yes, multiplayer is still there in all it's glory, but it still uses the direct IP method of the original so you must scavenge the internet once more for servers that are still alive			",108,3,0,5,3,0,3

												one of my favorite classics out there right beside half-life 1, I play this game on old computer's from the late 90's to the very early 2000's when I'm home. i mostly play it on steam when I'm traveling. Playing it on older computer's kinda reminds you about playing it back when it first came out, I personally watched my dad play it since it came out around the time i was a little kid. The computer I mostly play Quake II on is a Compaq Presario laptop made in 1998.edit  : if you want to know the PC specs on the Compaq Presario that i use to run this game, here they are: Intel Pentium III @ 1GHz processor316MB ram(256MB PC133 card with 60MB on-board memory)Trident CyberBlade i1 8MB AGP video card10GB HD spaceWindows Millenium edition			",145,13,5,5,8,2,4

Legendary Quake II from legendary id Software! It was the best innovation of 1997-98.Ok, pros and cons.Pros:LoL, if you kills enemies, they can continue to shoot, then die. I never saw so AI.I somehow can't stop to finish the game... Too exciting!It includes cutscenes, making story cool.Story about space battles. Classics!The game is atmospheric.Nice difficulty level system. Easy level makes it too easy, hard makes it hardcore and normal level is ideal.Bosses and bossfights.Cons:Now to play this game a bit sick due to bad graphics, but you can fix it with help of numerous modifications.Story though nice, but short. But there is Quake II: Ground Zero and The Reckoning in the Steam Store.Problems with the online.It's chef-d'œuvre!!My mark is: 9 crappy Parasites out of 10. ",24,2,0,1,2,1,1

Any true gamer must have at least one copy of this game on them at all times. A revolutionary game that blows even Doom out of the water. Buy this and it's sequel, Quake 4 right now. I'm not nostalgic, because it implies that there were flaws. By the way, this unofficial patch helped as my pc wasnt running it and makes the sound word (I've heard this was a problem).

												Quake II. This right here is my favourite PC game I have ever played. The graphics are good, the sound is loud and powerful and the mutliplayer is fast and challenging. Quake II was released in 1997 but that dosen't mean it's not good to play. I'm a old school gamer, so I play stuff way older than this. Truly the best Quake game in the series that cost me hundreds of hours even before I brought this on Steam. From a long single-player campaign (that can also be played with a mate) to the fast-paced action of deathmatch this game will never die. I definitly recommend this game, it runs well on most modern systems as well. Keep those frags coming! ;3The GraphicsThe engine in the game is called ""Id Tech 2"", or you can just call it ""The Quake 2 Engine"". It's opengl support is fantastic. The lighting in the game is superb, better than what Id Tech 1/The Quake 1 engine could handle. The textures are good as well. And, a little secret. In the console type ""gl_shadows 1. It allows realistic shadows into the game and shines light over objects, enimies and other things. It's quite amazing. In the Id Tech 2 engine, unlike the Id Tech 1 engine, you can puch some objects around. And, Id Software, yet again brought back the exlposive barrels. But, you can move them, but be careful. They are highly explosive.The SoundWow, Quake II has some pretty amazing sound. Most of the weapons are load and I love them that way. The Super Shotgun is big and delivers a huge blast to make you feel satisfied. The BFG 10K Is the biggest out of all of the guns and damm, I just love that BFG noice. The Strogg noices for me (when i was about 6) were creepy.			",104,8,1,9,7,2,4

												Out of all the quakes i think this one is the best, this game is the last game ID makes that advances the FPS genre which Valve take over with their Half-Life series.This game is AMAZING for it's time and consoles would have to advance a generation or two just to play this classic it adds outdoor lighting, slightly more realistic lighting from Quake 1 (since Quake 2 uses a completely new engine the IDtech 2 engine instead of an improved version of the DooM engine the IDTech 1.5) and instead of fighting the DooM-style hellish creatures like in the origenal you fight agenst the Strogg (which by the way you do fight in Quake 1 they just arn't the main villains).The weapons in the game are very similar to the weapons in DooMs 1 and 2 (NOTE: i say 2 because the super shotgun isn't on DooM 1)And there is a part that feels like a part that Valve used in Half-Life, just thought i'd mention it.

												Oculus Rift owners, try Quake 2 VR. One of the best Oculus experiences.I have fond memories of this game.  While Quake had good multi-player, Quake 2 had good single player and multi-player. Still to this day one of my favorite games.When this game came out, graphically it was amazing.  But it reigning as ""King"" of graphics was very short lived. 6 months later, Unreal came out.  But it's multi-player and mods kept it one of my favorite games. I played this A LOT. I fondly remember people always accusing me of cheating thinking 'Nobody could be THAT good'.This game had so many mods that you could play this for months and not get tired.  Like Half-Life 1/2, it was a great game, but the mods is what make it one of the greatest games of all time.			",525,175,18,38,47,5,64

												Quake 2 is simply a classic, and one of few games I've personally mastered. Quite literally, the moment achievements come out on the game, if they ever do, I'll be among the first to get them all.Quake 2 is basically a game where you infiltrate and alien world in order to kil their leader and make way for a larger-scale attack, while deactivating defense grids and blowing up a giant gun battery. You also kill things.The game has very little story, delivered in the manual of the game (which i don't think comes with the game), but basically you're a soldier who deploys in a drop pod to the world named Stroggos. Your pod gets hit hugely off-course, and you land in an outpost of not much consequence.You are totally alone. No buddies, no air-support, all you have is your blaster, and your PDA which give you stat readouts on the area (like how many people are still waiting to die, or how many secrets) but more importantly, your objectives beamed down from the capital ship in orbit into said PDA.The game is essentially as good as FPS adventure action games get witohut going into arena FPS territory, and is (in my opinion) the only one to do this to date.The game has level stats exactly like in Duke Nukem 3D, Quake 1 and even Doom 1, and the secrets are always really good and memorizing their locations can become second-nature and are even instrumental on Hard+ difficulty.Quake 2 is an FPS that can be played mainly as a singleplayer game, but has Multiplayer and even Co-op, and lived in the days when Balancing wasn't even a matter that was at all important in the eyes of Developers.Multiplayer is essentialy arena-FPS and that's awesome.The game has 3 mission packs, 2 of which are on Steam (and i think the 3rd is too).For anyone who likes FPS games that doesn't easy-mode the experience by giving you regeneration, checkpoints, and newly refreshed ammo and weapons at the beginning of every new level, Quake 2 is a must have.

												Quake II was another great installment in the Quake generation that was not actually a direct sequel to the first Quake. In Quake II, you crash land into an area controlled by the Strogg and have to fight your way through thousands of enemies whilst completing objectives along the way. Quake II definitely delivered in the amount of fun you'll have as well as all the great guns in the game. A must have for fans of the original Quake!			",138,0,1,0,3,2,11

												I feel like an outcast when I say this at times. But I don't like the singleplayer to Quake 2.The original Quake is one of my favorite first person shooters ever. It features a great sense of speed and flow. Levels are completed relatively quickly, the enemies were very original and forced the player to adapt to the levels, and the game had this spooky haunted house aesthetic combined with an excellent OST by Nine Inch Nails.Quake 2 however always felt to me like a step backwards. A lot of the enemies are much more generic cyborgs with hitscan weapons that mostly just stand as obstacles before you get a keycard to open a door. There's no sense of flow to the levels where you're expected to prioritize enemies by how dangerous they were and how much they required you to dodge their attacks. Here I just go into a room, shoot 3 similar enemies standing still, repeat. It makes the game feel very dull and for many years I never understood why I could never finish Quake 2 until I started to notice that.However all that being said the biggest thing Quake 2 does well is it's multiplayer. Quake 2's multiplayer in many ways is a lot better than the original. It features great diversity with weapons like rocket launchers and railguns. Complete with a great selection of levels. The high octane heavy metal soundtrack Quake 2 has suits a multiplayer game much more than Quake 1's spooky haunted house music did.It's one of my more polarizing opinions on the game. I don't really hate Quake 2 since there are things about it I like. But it's easily the Id singleplayer game I've played the least of.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												QUAKE II is one of my favorite games! I think this game was made in id Software's (DOOM, Wolfenstein, RAGE) prime, when  everyone knew them and played all of their games. Before they had any games less than ""really good"". The designs of levels, guns, and enemies are great! Plus I love the death animations! This is a must play for any id Software fan or anyone wanting a really good classic. I would highly recommend QUAKE II!!!10/10My 1997 Game of the Year!			",51,2,0,2,1,0,1

												This Game is really, really, really, really Awesome. The game is fun, fast paced while being strategical, and really shows how to make an FPS game. the only problem I have with the game is the music doesn't work when I play the game. Other than that, Quake 2 is another one of my favorite First-Person Shooter to have.			",14,0,0,1,0,0,0

												A great classic FPS game. One of the funnest games I've ever played. Very fast paced. All the maps have a maze like set up to them. A very large arsenal with each weapons having an advantage and disadvantage. And enough baddies and different types of baddies that you need to learn to use each of them just to save enough ammo for that one (or several) big guy that can't be killed easily. The game rewards your efforts to explore locations with many bonuses like quad damage or extra armor or even a gas mask to help you stay underwater alot longer or a fancy new weapon.A word of advice, If you ever plan to get the quake series off of steam you will need to install a patch or two. The game that steam releases itself looks very clunky, with very few options to modify the game properly, and worst of all no gameplay soundtrack (which is one of the best features of the quake series).http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756937 This includes the patchs that I installed for Quake II. It has made the game more playable and much much better than the base I've been given from steam. Including but not limited to smoother gameplay, better overall control (for me at least). The graphics are still in the same manner like that of when it was first released, but it will now look like it has similar graphics to the steam version of half life 1. And the best part of the patch.....MUSIC!!!! Yes you got your awesome music that only makes you want to be a bad a even more in a game like this. Now get out there and kill yourself a couple hundred cyborgs that use the bodies of your former marines that are out for your blood.			",132,6,0,7,8,0,14

												Quake 2... Such good memories. Anyway, I won't judge the game because I played it all day and all night as a kid, but will judge it because of what it is. Compared to Quake 1 I'm sure I will be killed for this, it has a better story. Instead of an alien invasion of supernatural creatures like in Doom and Quake 1, this is an invasion from an Alien from outer space. Which is what I like more from Quake 2. Instead of recycling the idea from the Doom games, they made something new. They gameplay, is what makes this game my all time favorite game. Fast paced non-stop action all the time. And the music is just perfect, it gives you courage to kick those alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s♥♥♥♥♥ I recommend it if you liked the original Doom games.			",96,4,1,4,6,0,8

												The Quake Series -  These games focus on Gameplay and they do it well.  Fun weapons, fast gameplay, rocket jumping, and mosters from knights to demons.  Always focused on speed and Mutiplayer Gaming.Quake II - basically took what the original Quake did... and made it even better.  This one aged a lot better than most of the 90's games released.  Infact I'd still play it multiplayer occasionally if other people did.  Just down right fun!!  However the single player feels less interesting to me, perhaps I played it too much as a kid?That being said:  This game and some of the other Quake games really pushed the FPS genre into mainstreme and as a competetive sport.

												I have a soft spot for Quake II - it was the first FPS game I ever played online, way back on our old 56k router. And it was playable at those speeds, too!Quake II is a classic shooter. There's no hand-holding here - you're plopped in the middle of a war-zone with nothing but your pistol and wits to get you started. Enemies are plentiful and in some instances, tough. And if you don't do some exploration to find extra ammo and armor, you'll find yourself in trouble quickly.The graphics don't look too amazing when set against 2013 standards, but they certainly deserve to be appreciated, for a game originally released in 1997. Sound is sparse, a bit like what you'll find in games like Doom, but without the constant ambient music.I enjoy playing this game every now and then for a little nostalgia, but I usually end up playing for longer than I thought I would, just because the simplified, raw experience can be so much fun.

												This game is better than the original. If it doesn't work, you'll need to do some research on how to start it up since its not optimized to work on modern Windows PCs. You'll also need a program to play online too. Otherwise, this is a great game with great graphics, cool weapons, challenging gameplay, well designed levels and an awesome heavy metal soundtrack. I'd highly recommend buying this classic, it doesn't have as much popularity as it used to sadly.FINAL RATING: 93 out of 100			",128,10,0,13,2,0,16

												As someone who was born too early to enjoy the '90s first-person shooter craze, series like Doom and Quake were something that passed over me.  Arena shooters (Painkiller, Serious Sam, etc.) were what started my old-school fascination.While both Doom's and Quake's games are timeless, I find that the Quake series is something more familiar for newcomers than the original Doom games. 3D level design of Quake is hardly something new compared to the sprite-based 2.5D design of Doom.Even with programs to enable mouselook and higher textures/better effects for Doom, the Quake series feels like a game that has only aged by its looks. Not the core gameplay.Audio Problems: Get Ultimate Quake PatchFor some technical reason, Steam's version of Quake (and Quake 2) do not have the soundtracks included. Before you go to GOG, you should know that their version also lacks the soundtracks. If you type in Ultimate Quake Patch (for one or two), you'll find Steam pages where you can download a specific patch just for Steam which will run the game on some other engine with the soundtrack fixed as well as larger font for messages. (It also has controller/joypad support).I cannot stress this enough: You need that patch. Playing this game without the soundtrack is so boring. Admittedly it feels more atmospherc and horrorish, but having the soundtrack will ease your nerves and keep you going. (The texts also seem more abundant to let you know what to do next.)Why You Should Play Quake (and Quake 2) in 2015The main reason I think Quake is much easier to get into than Doom is not the visuals nor the lack of freelook (without any mods or programs like GZDoom, obviously). No, the main reason is because of Quake's sense of verticality and the 3D level design.The level design of Quake games are these open-ended, yet linear, maps where objectives require you to move from one place to the next. These involve different transitions to new areas or multiple floor areas with secrets hidden plenty. And backtracking rewards you with finding secrets or alternative routes through the levels.It's also important to note that these games being linear is not a bad thing. In fact, it's how the game obscures its linear nature that makes it feel rewarding. The 3D level design makes the game never feel like an 2D labyrinth where you have to exhaust all means to find the exit, and the ways the levels twist-back on themselves makes the levels have a nice sense of cohesion and thought put into them. That attention is made clear with Quake's sense of verticality. It's not just having multiple floors; Doom has several levels with elevation changes. The game relies on the one thing that breaks Doom: Jumping.Even if you enable mouse-look for Doom to make it play like a modern game, enabling the ability to jump will break the game itself. Secrets, manueverability around enemies, etc. were built around that limitation, and it feels like an artificial limitation to not use the jump button yourself.Quake, however, rewards exploration with the mechanic. It enables you a viable means to fake-out the enemies or dodge a projectile. It encourages you to explore above you and below for items you may need. All of what I'm saying is Quake's demand of the player's spatial awareness goes a long way to distract the player from what is otherwise a linear experience.Forget the NumbersThe differences between Q1 and Q2 are too numerous to state here. They play similarly enough, yet they both look and feel far removed from each other that you could consider them two seperate games. I think it's personal preference for which is superior.However, there are several things about Q2 that I think would make it a better introduction than the first game.For starters, the enemy abilities and telegraphs are much more obvious than in Q1. While I love the Lovecraftian/Gothic Horror vibe of Q1, the Strogg are simply a better enemy type because they all stand out and they all have better visual cues for the player.Compare the Strogg with the chaingun and grenade launcher hands from Q2 to the chainsaw guys in Q1. It is much clearer to know what to do when the arm with the grenade launcher aims at you than the chainsaw guy's other arm. A lot of enemies in Q2 have visual cues that you'll learn without having your hand held by the game. The enemies' designs are varied to not become confusing when you have to handle more than one.Another reason why Q2 is a better place to start is that the game isn't relentless with its enemy mobs. Q1 is more relentless with its nonstop action; Q2 relies on pacing out the fights to guide the player in the ""right"" direction. There are also gameplay means to ease the difficulty. Things like the Power Armor (charged by cells for some guns) will improve your odds at the cost of not using up your more powerful weapons.  (And then you have the power-ups you can ration out.)These will encourage you to not save-scum your way through the game, which will help you get better at other old-school games (like Quake 1).""Where do I go? What do I do?""Backtracking is one thing about Quake 2 that may make or break you, and unlike Doom there is no map-screen.The game is full of backtracking objectives, but you will more often know where the next objective is if you're thorough with your exploration.For the most part.While I have gone into great detail for how Quake relies on the player's awareness for their surroundings, I found one part of the game impossible to solve on my own for my first and second playthrough: Mission 9. Normally, you can usually check your Mission Objectives to nudge you into the right area to be, and there is usually some visual clue on what you affected with a switch or button. (Besides the text prompts or map names.) And the levels usually feature some visually themed objects or names of facilities to let you know what you are walking into.Even with a year's difference between my first and second playthrough, I found most of the direction of Q2 intutive and not time-consuming. Except for Mission 9: the Inner and Outer Palace. This level is an absolute mess of switching forcefields off, transitioning between loading screens, and other means of backtracking. Some rooms feel like Escher staircases, and some rooms will take you to areas you didn't think would be there.Solution for mission 9: Bring an FAQ or find a video guide to help.An Unoriginal ClassicThough not as groundbreaking or ""new"" as DOOM and not as favorited as the original, Quake 2 is still a well-polished game despite the aging years. Brown-grime color palatte and the lacking Gothic Horror tone aside, Q2 is a classic old-school first-person-shooter that deserves to be played by modern audiences.It's a game that has not aged well on the eyes, yet it has retained all its vigor in its design.

I owned this game when it was ported over to the PSone, I loved it then, even with the terrible ported controls, the fact that a giant portion of the game was cut out and the multi-player was limited.  I still love it now, I can't recommend this game enough to people who love FPS games, and especially those who grew up in playing games from this era.  This is a must play in my opinion.

It was known for the introduction of colored lighting.Again, like the first game, this is a high pace action 1st person shooter with probably the best level designers in history.The negative:The didgital version on Steam does not come with the original soundtrack since this originally came with the game as regular CD audio on the game disc. And the soundtrack was a real adrenaline boost.			",279,118,12,29,18,2,44

When i was browsing i came across Quake 2 on Steam and got it. I loved it. So many levels, controls well(with right control fig and such) and awsome weapons, yay railgun.

												Quake II was always a bit strange for me. I was expecting Shambers; I found cyborgs. Yet, when I consider the co-operative experience of Quake (1) versus Quake II, I always find myself saying that Quake II was a real turning point for id Software - a plot, objectives, and level progression that made sense. I love shooting Vores and Ogres as much as the next guy, but Quake (1) had a decidedly single-player focus.Missing out on Quake II is missing out the adolescence of 3D graphics accelerators in the PC world. With both software and hardware (OpenGL) renderers, it bridged the gap in the PC space at the time and showed the power of 3D accelerators to me: the atomospere looks significantly more immersive with OpenGL at 60 FPS.

												The first time I've played Quake 2 was in school. We used to have this midterm fair every year and for some reason, someone decided to assemble this LAN with this game on it. I had no internet back then, so there's no way to explain how exciting it was to have the opportunity of playing a FPS with other people on the PC. Anyway, although I had a lot of fun, I didn't have a good hardware back home (neither the game), so I had to wait for a couple of years until I could eventually manage to do it. Well, although the gameplay is surely fluid, for some reason I couldn't let to compare it with the previous game (which was so much better in my own opinion), so in the end I was quite disappointed with the single player mode. Then a few years later, I've tried to play the coop campaign via Hamachi with my friends, but still we've never played to the end. If it wasn't for Steam, I confess that I wouldn't ever consider to play it again. Don't take me wrong though, despite the fact that I think that the first game was more interesting, this one isn't really bad, it just takes time to get used to it.			",409,101,12,62,39,7,46

There's some graphical mods to help the game out a bit, but don't expect Crysis. Runs a bit rough on modern systems, be prepared to fiddle with it a bit to get it running how you want.

												Quake II is a sequel in name only. It has nothing to do with the plot of the original Quake as far as we all know. id Software delivers yet another great shooter. You play as a marine who is part of an operation to invade the planet Stroggos. Your task is to complete various objectives while killing any Strogg that get in your way. You get an arsenal of weapons such as the iconic i.d Super Shotgun, Machine Gun, Chaingun, Hyperblaster, and even a BFG. I would recommend this game to fans of the original Quake or any 90's FPS fan. This one is quite the ride.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game from an epic era of innovtion. The 90's was packed to the brim with games that played as games, not interactive on-rail movies. While it did not age gracefully as the AI is pretty much the suicide-prone variety and the graphics looking very unpolished, its still an action packed and fast paced FPS gem that should be played to remember that once upon a time the gaming world was ruled by brutal fragging, secret levels and rocket jumps, not premium guns and perks. Its art style is some of my favorite theme;, a horryfing mash of alien technology and human corpses as your enemies and level design that is militaristic yet barren. I wish they would've gone with the action-horror theme they went with on the first game but this one surprisingly works. Highly recommended for retro gaming fans.			",37,3,0,3,6,0,8

While it did not age gracefully as the AI is pretty much the suicide-prone variety and the graphics looking very unpolished, its still an action packed and fast paced FPS gem that should be played to remember that once upon a time the gaming world was ruled by brutal fragging, secret levels and rocket jumps, not premium guns and perks. Its art style is some of my favorite theme;, a horryfing mash of alien technology and human corpses as your enemies and level design that is militaristic yet barren. I wish they would've gone with the action-horror theme they went with on the first game but this one surprisingly works. Highly recommended for retro gaming fans.			",37,3,0,3,6,0,8

												I remember playing this when I was 7 years old. It was on the PlayStation and boy, was this game hard! Being my first FPS ever, I would have to say that this is gotta be the best FPS game I've ever got to play. I mean, nowadays you have.... *shudders* CoD.... and *shudders again*... Battlefield... Those games are great and all, but they wouldn't be like they are without Quake or Doom. Not to mention, to me personally, this game has a TF2 or TFC-ish feel to it. If you haven't played this game or if you're new to FPS genre, I would recommend playing this. It's a good game when it came out, and it's still a good game today!			",111,23,3,3,6,0,0

												Quake II was always a bit strange for me. I was expecting Shambers; I found cyborgs. Yet, when I consider the co-operative experience of Quake (1) versus Quake II, I always find myself saying that Quake II was a real turning point for id Software - a plot, objectives, and level progression that made sense. I love shooting Vores and Ogres as much as the next guy, but Quake (1) had a decidedly single-player focus.Missing out on Quake II is missing out the adolescence of 3D graphics accelerators in the PC world. With both software and hardware (OpenGL) renderers, it bridged the gap in the PC space at the time and showed the power of 3D accelerators to me: the atomospere looks significantly more immersive with OpenGL at 60 FPS.

												Quake 2 was and still is a hit success by ID Software, the folks who brought us epic shooters such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D! This game has it all! Epic soundtrack, big and deadly weapons, variously stunning enemies, classic visuals, great level design and a fantastic and simplistic storyline!Personally this game was one of the first games in my childhood (yup, it was a pretty gory and voilent childhood) yet it shall always have a place in my heart, personally.I rate this game a solid and awesome 8.9/10			",409,34,5,27,12,3,7

												Back when I was about 7 or 8, i remember playing this with my sister on the Nintendo 64, and when i found our old console, i went to a local game store that still sells Nin64 games,and got Quake 2. wellll.......back then we had the controls down,but now...it controls like crap.the levels were bad and nothing was explained. When i was browsing i came across Quake 2 on Steam and got it. I loved it. So many levels, controls well(with right control fig and such) and awsome weapons, yay railgun. I recomend it if you like old type games with a little challenge in them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												        Even without any mods, the vanilla gameplay still holds up two decades later. The level design is very claustrophobic due to the limited hardware it was designed to run on. I would higly urge anyone planning on playing this game for the first time to download the Quake II XP mod. It completely overhauls all the game's textures, sounds, lighting and patches several glitches. This game isn't as good as the first, but it's still a damn good game given it's age. 8/10 ",39,1,0,2,2,0,2

												THE FIRST Quake game I played was quake 2. Being around since the dawn of video games, I first started with a new Atari 2600 untill they abandoned the platform, but I had an investment that wouldn't play on the Atari 5200. After I got over that I moved onto Nintendo 8 bit. It had been around long enough, and had an extensive library, and even started adapting some Atari titles. after they started making forward compatible consoles, without allowing my Atari library, I'd had it with the consoles. I finally got my first computer from a neighbor, and the first First Person shooter I got was Quake 2 in the cheap bin not realizing I would get hooked on a last generation computer game. I sought for Quake (1), and the add on packs, and it has kept me playing and replaying- which I like to do. They upsated Wolfenstein, didn't they? And as Quake became unplayable with Windows upgrades, I was glad sream offered it AL in a package for the same price as Quake 2 cost new.They could upgrade Quake again. I still like first person shooters that don't blind me with speed, explosions, and glorify criminals. Everything now seems based on Quake amyway, and zombies just bore me, but I still like to go back to Quake, and try different routes, or play through with just one weapon, and so on.I am still hoping to find Quake World mods that work on Steam though-so far they have been relatively unstable...

												First off, don't assume the ""hours played"" listed is accurate, the mod I'm running (quake2xp) has a seperate launcher so my play time isn't being tallied correctly...Anyhow, having not touched this game in YEARS, nostalgia slapped me in the face when I saw it listed so cheap - so I thought, ""why not?"". I couldn't be more pleased. For one, the modding certainly did freshen it up, so hats off to the mod devs, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are plenty of group servers available - Quake2chaos for example. So just like the first time around - don't bother me for a while.FYI: Im using the self installing Quake 2 Patcher which speeds up movement, allow video editing and intalls your music without any need for cutting and pasting, etc., and if you use quake2xp which installs directly into your quake folder, you will not have to run Quake 2 Patcher again.

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 9.7 hoursQuake II is a fun game to come to when you want to experience the old-school gameplay again, but frankly it's quite short for games of its time. I'm thinking it's because of the new things introduced with the second iteration of the franchise.First off let me say that Quake II has probably much more in common to the original Half-Life than the first ever did. From the feel to general looks, let me save you all the detail and sum it up as follows:* Gameplay (the way the mechanics feel, not the get-bring-key concept we're all familiar with)* Weapon models* LightningNow it is highly probable that most of these changes originate from Half-Life (and the series, as a whole) using the same, modified engine but the similarities are obvious.Gameplay-wise it is great, the battles feel great and some of the early weapons which could be considered obsolete after a certain point only become less useful, still allowing the player to take down several weak enemies spread throughout the level. The game doesn't forget what it started from and as soon as a new enemy is introduced it always appears throughout places.The boss fight however is probably one of the most underwhelming fights I've ever seen. The story is only told through several cutscenes which are at most ambiguous and details which will need to be looked SPECIFICALLY for. It still allows, however, for some context of why you're shooting things up so it doesn't get boring.I strongly suggest you play this with brightness to medium or as low as possible because the game looks infinitely better, from back in the day to even 2001 at some points, looking in places as better as Half-Life.Overall Quake II is a fun old-school game though it is quite short and after the fun it's only mods that keep it alive. Other than the message at the end of each unit (I forgot to mention that levels are spread in units, semi-open world type) there's nothing cataloguing for whatever you've collected and it feels a little pointless to return and get the rest unless you plan to replay the whole game again.

												Once again Earth is in danger, but this time its from outer space in the form of the evil cybernetic race known only as the Strogg who have come to the planet to take all its resources and take people for to be transformed into horrific cybernetic monsters to be used in their armies.After the initial attack, the Strogg's homeplanet, Stroggos, is located and a massive counter attack called Operation Alien Overlord is launched where thousands of marines are dispatched to the planet's surface.However, something goes terribly wrong and most of the marines are either killed or captured by the Strogg defences and only you remain as your pod crashed way off course from the original landing zone you were supposed to land at with your teammates.It is up to you to destroy several key installations in the city AND also kill the Strogg leader called the Makron in an effort to cripple the Stroggs for good.This is a must have for those who loved the first Quake and generally love any FPS that has sci-fi and plenty of awesome weapons and powerups in it.

There's also the quake 2 server browser, similar to zdaemon but not as in depth.Also there's always the option of typing ""coop 1"" then ""map base1"" in console, and getting some friends to play the single player together! :D.

												If you're looking for a good, classic run n' gun fps, you won't be disappointed with Quake II. A word of warning, though: the original cd soundtrack is not included in the Steam version, so if you don't want the atmosphere to be ruined by the lack of music, you'll have to manually get the soundtrack files from the internet.

												It's loud sci-fi to quake 1's subdued industrial/medieval themes. A solid late 90's fps that brought a groundbreaking engine to the mainstream. Be sure enable the music through the steam patch to get the sick jams running. A tad easy on normal for any decent fps fan and totally devoid of any sort of plot. 7/10, grab it on a sale.

												A First Person Shooter classic, and a personal childhood favorite of mine, Quake II is a fine example of how to show off your cool 90s lighting effects and jello-gun physics. The riveting storyline reminds me of the delusional fever dream I experienced after ingesting two five-hour energy shots back-to-back and playing on Halo 3's Sandtrap map nonestop for 48 hours. The color pallets range from vomit-brown to deadbeat-gray, and the gun types range from ""useless ♥♥♥♥ing grenade launcher"" to ""shoot big, kill everything"". This game serves as a constant reminder that the youthful innocence we experienced in our younger years about the perceptions around us is actually dead, and all of the things we liked are now mediocre and boring. tl;dr: Must have.

												Quake II triumphs in many ways compared to it's original predecessor, Quake, or as of nowadays ""Quake 1"" because that's what happens when a game series ♥♥♥♥♥ out sequels like how a housewife in Victorian London ♥♥♥♥♥ out children.However, the story is completely seperate from Quake Juan (implying Quake Won had any story whatsoever) being set on an alien planet where you're some burly white dude going to kill the aliens and their boss because ""they're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.  The intro cutscene has that whole mid-late 90's animation feel to it, which seems quite nostalgic for me for some reason.The graphics have improved nicely - I mean I suppose if I don't have to go have my eyes checked after playing a game, I think I can safely say its graphics are acceptable.The soundtrack is... mostly forgettable.  There is only one piece of soundtrack that stuck out to me and that was 'Descent into Cerberon'.

			Descent Into Cerberon - Sonic Mayhem. Quake II Soundtrack.		

Gameplay, especialy the gunplay, feels a lot more satisfying and much more smooth, although it still sounds like your character has had something shoved up his anal cavities every time he jumps.  However, it falls into the same problem Quake-Wan Kenobi had in term of enemy variety in the sense that you end up having to shoot the same armored guy in the corridor over and over and over again for the good of 5 hours.The level design is unfortunately pretty maze-like, after you wander around the same corridors for over 10 minutes, you often find yourself wanting something different to show up, at the very least something to shoot at.  I ended up having to look at a walkthrough and the guide told me, at the point I was stuck on and I never like doing this, it doesn't feel like I got the full experience from wandering around the Alien's depiction of a Nazi gas chamber aimlessly until succuming to my own insanity, pulling the trigger of the shotgun resting it's beady little eye on under my chin.So basically, that was my experience with Quake II, however unless you're a Caveman and live under a rock and/or are living in Iraq then you'll have to download a patch off the internet to make sure the game works properly on your PC!  The cavemen and Tusken Raiders don't have to because they're still using their prehistoric 90's PC to get the full experience and you're not. And just for you, being the benevolent Yoshi that I am, I will give you a link to where you can download the patch, because you're worth it. :D http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=20806550.Overall, 6/10.  ♥♥♥♥ the mazes.

												Quake II may not have aged as well as the other Quake games,  but that doesn't mean its not a good game. The gameplay, like all the Quake games, is the main attraction. Guns still feel satisfying and enemy designs are still unique, but the attempts to show off the graphics go over just as poorly as you would expect. Lighting up rooms with your gun feels unessicary  and the shots somee enemies take at you while dying barely make a diffrence. While I do appreciate the detail, these additions don't add to the game and I have mixed feelings about their addition. Also, the great feeling of using the guns is migitated when they killing someone makes them spin around like a Saturday morning cartoon. But, despite all this, Quake II is still a great game that is certainly worth buying. 8/10			",44,17,0,4,5,0,3

												Gun-metal grey and dogshit brown: the Video Game.Rating: 7 out of 10, complete with a decent campaign, enjoyable gameplay and striking art style, this id classic has definitely earned its stripes. However the dated graphics, inoperable multiplayer, and the lack of OST is of genuine concern.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you believe the stories, Quake 2's debut at E3 '97 was the point at which John Romero realised that Daikatana was seriously behind the 8-ball technologically. The following delays as he moved the game to the Q2 engine, the over-hype, and the under-delivering final product ended John Romero's time at the forefront of game development. In other words, this is the game that killed John Romero's career. If that isn't a good enough reason to play it, I don't know what is.			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

												First thing, Quake is ace and everyone should play it one way or another, just NOT the steam version unless you enjoy buying games with the soundtracks removed! Yeah its fixable but why not just buy a copy that has the soundtrack, like the GOG versions.The soundtrack in Quake 2 is half the game. Its not Quake without it.So if I haven't made it clear, steam version is bad. Avoid ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The music is missing from this version of quake 1 and 2(I haven’t tried 3 yet). When I buy something. I expect to get the complete experience. Especially when the product is this old.  I don’t mind tinkering around to get the game working as long as it is complete. But if the game is not complete and I need to find another source (the internet for example) to get the missing component. I cant really be ask to bothered with it. It’s like buying a puzzle. But you need to download(or by other means) to get the last couple of pieces. It is just frustratingly. On the up side the gameplay is excilent. As long if you like old nineties fps games.

												This could of been a good game, the shooting is good, the game has a good level of challenge and the enemy design is great but what lets it down for me and kills it are the levels, it makes it a chore walking around these massive levels with nothing to do after you shot the place up. It's a game full of ""Where do I go?"" moments that will frustrate new players. (Just to let you know I gave up around the 4th or 5th level) A massive let down for me...

												DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE. This game is not complete in this version and just a money grab... They did not buy the music license for this release. The music in this game was one of the best things about it and really added to the overall gaming experience. I started up the game and prepared for the GLORIOUS TRIP DOWN NOSTALGIA LANE but only played for 5 minutes... tried messing with my sound settings to figure out the problem, tabbed out to look for some support help, and found out I'd have to illegally download the music and missing sound files. Very disappointed.EDIT: Of course Quake II is a good game, but this version earns a negative review because it was not what I paid for... buying this version on Steam is a waste of money for those wanting the original Quake II experience.

												Beyond bland without the soundtrack, luckily you can easily google a fix for that...the music is awesome. Sadly the game still did not seem as satisfying as the original Quake. The shooting felt sloppy and never gave the feeling of packing a punch. Story elements fell a bit flat. Environment tilesets were noticably repetetive but level design was reletively good. Enemies were interesting but their potential to be terrifying was not realized. Overall the setting was a bit of a letdown, not remarkable or immersive in the slightest. Still fun but I recommend the original Quake, Doom, or Unreal over this installment any day.			",627,196,20,94,67,7,113

												7/10compared the Quake 1 this is a HUGE disappointment. I played both Quake games in 2014 for the first time and while I had a great time with Quake 1, Quake 2 was okay, but never really made that much fun.The weapons sound and feel very weak, the enemy design is just random and boring, levels look all the same, soundtrack doesnt fit the game at all and is annoying so that I had to turn it off.Its not a bad game, but compared to the masterpiece that Quake 1 is, its a very bid dissapointment. If you skip this game you miss nothing, if its cheap and you have nothing else to play then grab it.			",301,32,3,20,9,0,16

												tl;dr be mad this game is poopoo and aged like trash kidHello, today I'll review QUAKE II. I'll look at PROS and CONS of it's existence, throw in some fun personal notes and impressions, and then throw down my verdict on whether you should invest money into it.-----Firstly, QUAKE II suffers from a very serious problem. It's boring. Sloggy. Tedious. Clunky.Normally, taking the age into account you can look past all of this and cheerily stroke memories of you getting it for Christmas from your none-the-wiser parents when you were 8 or 12 or however old.The thing is, this game aged like trash and so did the engine. Though lets get on with a fun section with bullet points!-PROS:It has a story, which is something QUAKE was almost entirely without.Guns. It sure does have them!Particle Acceleration. Wow! Those 124MBs of RAM will come in handy.CONS:The guns are vomit worthy, in function and appearance.When bullets don't instantly hit, their speed can be described as a light saunter.Gray. Brown. Tannish Orange. Gunmetal Gray. Red. There was more color variation in the first Borderlands.Any thought that went into the level design is completely lost on the mind numbing tedium of actually getting through one.Everything looks fat and stupid and clunky. Just look at the basic Strogg infantry's run, there's nothing threatening about these enemies.-There was a serious problem of not taking advantage of what the engine had to offer. Even with Dai-Katana, there was concept and variety with things like weapons and stages. There were also colors and things that could be seen as ""interesting to look at"". Just look at, say, JonTron's review of it. It looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but god dammit it's colorful♥♥♥♥♥♥In all, this game is nothing but a showboat for the QUAKE II engine and should be treated that way.This is a terrific series, QUAKE is, but this iteration never failed to bore me to quitting not even 2/3rds of the way into a level.-SHOULD YOU BUY? THREE SITUATIONS...1. If you love the QUAKE series, if you've always loved it and played them when you were a wee chitlun then yes, but this review is not made with nostalgia-goggles or whatever edgy term we're using for fond, clouding memories detailing our days of yore. Though I'm not sure why you don't already have several cds or flash disks with it already.2. No, I say if you're looking for something interesting and fun to challenge yourself with then this most certainly is not the game for you as there are arguably more appropriate things for that. I recommend QUAKE or QUAKE III: Arena, it's predecessor and successor respectively.3. I also say that if you are new and have an interest in the QUAKE series of games then by god go for it and learn some lore or be completionist or whatever.---With that I'm done. If you've already disliked this just based on the fact it's a negative review of a game you like. Eat a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Eat twenty. Without any milk.If you disagree and have something coherent to bring to a discussion comment and see if your infallible reason can sway me about giving this game more chances.Good day.

												Graphics suck donkey balls by todays standars but the golden gameplay makes up for it. Go download some mods so you can better graphics if you can't handle the original ones. Plus you will need a mod to hear the soundtrack, because by default there is none, i don't know if the porting process to Steam ♥♥♥♥ed it up or what.			",218,23,16,17,5,0,24

												A very solid shooter. Graphics have sure aged nicely, despite it looking like♥♥♥♥♥♥there's no confusion over what blurry low res texture is what. Very possible to play with friends too with the use of hamachi. There's also a overhaul mod that gives one more graphics and audio settings to play with in the menus as well as re-adding the incredible soundtrack by Sonic Mayhem. If you played it when you were younger, buy it. If you didnt, buy it.			",374,71,3,28,28,5,65

												It's Quake II. Spent countless hours beating this game again and again, and even nowadays if the textures look terrible (and if the music is missing?) you can always download patches and graphical enhancement mods to make it look 10 years newer while maintaining that metal soundtrack and gameplay we all love.

												Quake 2 when it first came out disapointed me.. hear me out on this..so i loved quake 1 and its dark gothic medievil setting.. when i saw this game for the first time it was on n64and i wasnt keen on the new technology and time in which this game took place.. quake 1 was like zombies undead etcand now we have the strog, an advanced race of cyborgs.. needless to say i never played it muchhowever thats where this version and the n64 are differntthis one has the modding community behind it and this game is great with mods... like all ID gamesi currently have beserker booter for this game and it makes it look so modern and impressive with hi res tex , great lighting and new shaders etc. all while running at great fps i might add... it has made me a fan out of a 15 year old game i originally didnt like and makes this game just as relevant as any other moderen day shooter.Grab this one for sure... just like quake it has more episodes 2 it8 out of 10 (must own for fast fps fans)			",27,1,1,17,2,0,3

												Caught Right In The Asscrack Between Old And New, Quake Is An Odd Hybrid Of Quake 1 And Half-Life Style Gameplay. A Lot Slower Paced Game, With The Lovecraftian Monsters Replaced With Borg Wannabe's, And Weird Dimensions Swapped Out For Orange Tech Bases. While The Gameplay is Still Solid, You Can Feel The Lack Of John Romero.COOP SUPPORTED			",193,7,4,4,4,0,23

												I remember scared kid progressing slowly but being surprised by almost everything like free aim, shooting arms off the enemies, fantastic graphic quality, impressive level design with many clever secrets, atmospheric sounds with fitting music.......... more than 15 years later it's all still there!!! Well, I might be a little bit less scared and not kid for sure anymore. This game does not age at all tho.  I tried to replay it with no mods and enhancements, just resolution upped to 1920* and enjoyed awsome ride. The work of old ""id Software"" deserves big respect.			",767,192,32,76,65,5,93

												This is probably the game that got me hooked for life on PC gaming. This version is improved over my original CD disks because the keyboard/mouse controls actually work like they should. So yeah, no need to mess with a controller. Whereas my disk version is frustrating to play with a keyboard/mouse and still a bit awkward even using an Xbox 360 controller. In 1997 my very expensive brand new Dell desktop with its 266Mhz Pentium II rendered choppy/glitched game play with this game even after I upgraded to a pricey Voodoo3 3000 card. This Steam version plays smooth as silk on my least game friendly recent home-build with an inexpensive AMD Athalon 5350 APU with Radeon R3 graphics and Win 7 sp 1 64 bit. I dare say it would probably play nice on nearly any modern PC. There's even a widescreen mod called ""ShamHawkes Lazy Quake 2 Patcher"" which works fairly well. So, after nearly two decades I finally get to enjoy this game as it was meant to be enjoyed. That's life I suppose. Anyway, better late than never. All in all still a great classic FPS.
