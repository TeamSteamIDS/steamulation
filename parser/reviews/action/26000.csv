												A cute little puzzle/action game where you play an escaped alien convict and befriend a blob that will eat everything else.  I found the controls a bit loose but still very playable.  Virtually no story, no real depth and cartoony graphics may make this one better suited for the younger crowd but it's a decent game to kick back with after an aggravating day for the older folks.

												I had no idea this game even existed, or what it was, until Steam had it on sale.I read some of the reviews, and downloaded the demo to give it a try, still not really knowing what this game was.Turns out, it's kind of a puzzle game. I say ""kind of"" because the puzzles aren't particularily puzzling. It's just various ways that the Maw can eat things.You play as sort of an escaped alien convict, and the Maw is like your pet. You feed him, he gets bigger. You feed him special creatures, he gets special powers. Use the special powers to get to things to eat, so he can get bigger, get big enough and he can finish the level. It's not overly complicated, but it's fun. It reminds me a little of Katamari, only with eating, instead of rolling around.The good:-Adorible graphics that aren't really out-dated, even though the game is old-Simple game design/game play if you're looking for a very casual game-Eat various creatures and see how large the Maw can getThe bad:-Clunky controls. Half the time it feels like you're trying to wade through molasis. And the other half you're wondering why the mouse is so sensitive.-Too much hand-holding AND not enough. Sometimes it'll tell you the stupidest things (like press ""space"" to dodge) and keep throwing it in your face. Other times you'll have no idea what to do (like press ""space"" to use Maw's ability) and you'll be struggling to figure out what to do, not because the puzzle is hard, but because you didn't know what key to press. When in doubt, press space.-Camera angles..... the camera angles are just SOOOO frustrating sometimes. When you turn, the camera decides to turn in random directions, and you can move the mouse to turn the camera, but it only moves about a centimeter at a time, more often than not it'll take you more time to turn the camera than it will to complete the puzzle.All-in-all it's not a bad game. But it's certainly not worth it at full price. I  got it on sale for $2.39 (including the DLCs) and that's around what this game is worth. It's fun, but it's not very engaging. And if the controls were less infuriating I would probably be feeling differently about it, but as it stands, I would not recommend this game at full price. Buy it on sale, and it'll be worth your few dollars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You find me captured by some aliens or humans and caged like an exhibit. Luckily their piece of crap ship crashes and I find myself next to a big glob looking creature who just loves to eat everything. Oh ya looks like I’m getting off this rock.The Maw is the story of an alien and his new blob pet, Maw, trying to get away from their captures and get their freedom back. Maw is kind of like a garbage disposal but with large teeth and gets bigger after feeding him so much stuff.You can feed him little pink fuzzy creatures as his basic food but once he’s a certain size you can feed him a variety of other things you find around the levels. Fire lizards that will change him into a fire breathing Maw. Flying worms can let you jump higher, float around for a bit, and slam down on things. A crazy peacock will let shoot lasers out of your eyes. Last a rhinoceros beetle that will let you charge into rocks and things to destroy them.It’s a casual game with lots of humor and fun to be had. You’ll go through a total of 8 levels which aren’t to challenging and you can also download 3 deleted levels to add to your playtime. Not much wrong with the game except for length but it is a small indie title which started out as a XBLA game. So if you want to laugh a little and burn some time then pick this game up and enjoy.Bear Rating: 9.5/10 ",2438,1021,85,323,253,20,376

												I may have played through this game like 5 times.  It's such a fun, tightly crafted little game.  You can blast through it in a few entertaining hours.  Because the characters have such great humor and heart to them, you may end up replaying it again a few months later when that feeling of ""Maw Separation Anxiety"" sets in.  Also, the Maw reminds me of that monster in the old B-movie, ""Terror-Vision"".			",522,114,23,40,38,5,38

												I played this game years ago when it first came out on the 360, and at the time, I quite liked it.  I picked it up again on PC because I thought my four-year old would enjoy the cute characters and simplistic gameplay, and I'm happy to say that she did.  However, this is a terrible PC port.  The game often fails to launch on the first try, Maw and his handler occasionally freeze up, and one particular enemy in a later level, whose ramming skill was needed to pass an obstactle, despawned for no apparent reason.  When the last two glitches happened, we were forced to restart the entire level from the beginning.  It is a real shame that an otherwise enjoyable game like this should be marred by so many bugs.

The Maw is an light action-adventure with very minor puzzle elements. You are controlling Frank, the blue alien and use your pet-like helper, the Maw to eat everything standing in your way. Depending on what you eat you will gain some new abilities like fire-breathing or floating althought they disappear with the start of a new level.Yea, it is a bit repetitive and easy. The graphic itself isn't also too awesome but it fits the game itself pretty nicely. On the good side The Maw has something I personally can't find in too many games: A really charming main character (The Maw, not Frank). I find it especially impressive how much emotion the Maw can show which basically consists of only a giant mouth (hence the name) and an eyeball. A compliment to the animators of the game.All in all the game is probably more suitable for children (especially since there is nearly no in-game text) since it is hardly possible to fail in the game and the puzzles aren't really puzzly. But between most modern and also more hectic and stressful games  The Maw is an enjoyable change of pace in a colorful world.			",91,44,0,11,1,0,7

												Fun third person platform.  Mostly simple without too many difficult areas to get past.  This game took me many years to get back to so that I could finish.  But now that I'm done, I enjoyed it.  I felt the artstyle was really good and gives the game longevity in the great changing world of computer graphics.  Usually can be found cheap and if you have little ones playing games, this is very appropriate.You play as an alien who has a ""pet"", the Maw.  Your pet can help you destroy obstacles, eat creatures in the world and also change into different types of attributes.  One type is the ability to electrocute.  Another type is to be a rhino and another type is to allow you to jump really high and float as if your pet was a balloon.  Finally, you will also have the opportunity to turn your Maw into a fire breathing monster.  All of these are used in a sort of puzzle like manner to get through the levels which are short, but good.Overall, it's a cute, fun adventure as your character and the maw plow through each level.

												The Maw is a pretty fun little action/adventure game in which you are a cute little alien that is imprisoned on a space ship next to a giant mouth with an eyeball. The ship crashes on a planet and you proceed to throw every living creature into that giant mouth.While the Maw seems pretty light-hearted and not all that-challenging, the game has a darker side behind its cute and seemingly innocent exterior. The first adorable little creature that you see (and hug) is eaten by the Maw, and your character is noticeably shocked by this, but those feelings of sadness and disbelief at the Maw eating that cute little marshmallowy alien baby are quickly forgotten as you try to fill the Maw's insatiable craving for adorable little creatures. This game, in short, is about addiction. Possibly also genocide. Why am I throwing cute babies into a bottomless pit filled with teeth? I don't really know why, and I don't care about their feelings anymore, I just need to throw more alien babies in the pit. I could stop any time I want. Really.The control scheme is pretty good - I can't speak for the keyboard functions, but the game handles very well with an xbox 360 controller, providing button prompts in the game where needed.I was pretty disappointed by the DLC for this game; it's simply just some extra levels that should have been included in the game anyway given how short it is. Having said that though, if you are going to buy the Maw, I would recommend getting the Mawesome pack because without the DLC there just isn't enough game here and it doesn't cost a whole lot more than the game by itself.The final verdict? The Maw is short, but sweet. The game is fairly easy, but it's somewhat cathartic to throw helpless creatures into your own pet monster.7 out of 10, would throw more cute alien babies into a bottomless pit.

												The Maw is a delightful action platformer released in 2009 by Twisted Pixel Games, who has gone on to release a slew of really tight, inventive downloadable games. The game centers around space adventurer Frank who comes upon a cute little one-eyed pink monster (heh) while being held captive on an Imperial ship. After making their escape, Frank becomes tethered to the Maw by an electrofied gauntlet, allowing him to guide the creature around like a guard dog. It becomes clear pretty quickly why the Maw was imprisoned, for he has an insatiable appetite for anything and everything, with each new meal causing the Maw to grow in size.This game was an absolute delight, combining all of the elements that I love from the action platformer genre popularized by Nintendo, Rare, and Sony’s third party studios. The gameplay is really fun, introducing new enemy types and abilities at a pretty frequent clip, such as Frank learning to use his arm tether to sling enemies, hijack ships, and grappling-hook his way around the beautiful alien landscapes. Who doesn’t love a grappling hook, am I right? The Maw also sees quite a bit of progression, not only by growing in size, but also by absorbing the powers from defeated enemies during boss fights. This game is really charming, and has a refreshingly colorful and bouncy animation style. The characters are undeniably cute, and have funny interactions during cutscenes. The game is not an incredibly long experience, as it can be completed in under 10 hours — including all three DLC expansions. Despite its short running time, the game is full of content, and keeps the game progression moving along at a comfortable, natural pace. It’s not often that we see new platformer franchises being released these days (with the exception of the mildly well-recieved Knack on the PS4), and although The Maw is by no means a spring chicken, it is still as fun and refreshing as the day it was released.Highly recommended.

												I earned all but one achievement for no in-game reward.  I never try that.  And I usually hate platformers.  However, The Maw is (largely) frustration-free puzzle platforming with a charming theme.  It's more about using the abilities of the titular creature than dodging spikes and lava.  I had fun exploring and collecting.I recommend most of the DLC and it integrates nicely into the default level progression.  Speeder Lane, however, felt like a way to poorly justify the rare vehicle sections by making them more common.  Though I had infinite lives, I recall getting a headache from the grind.

												What is here is good and a few puzzles may make you stop and think for a while, but more variety in activities and some gameplay corrections could help. A run button so you can move faster over extensive terrain, getting to play as The Maw a few times would have been appreciated, a first person camera so you can get a better perspective of where things are and where to go next and the game could have taken advantage of the fact that the main character is eventually smaller than The Maw and can fit in their mouth or perform actions like take advantage of the size difference.I do like how the game aesthetic is at odds with The Maw's vicious activities. Everything looks cute and cuddly but The Maw eats people WHOLE, sometimes more than one at a time. The cutscene at the end of the speed bike DLC level is a great example of this.I get the feeling that the entire galaxy is eventually eaten up by The Maw and his friend eventually falls victim to his appetite without The Maw knowing. If this game ever gets a follow up, the threat of that could be a place to start the story.			",206,45,2,5,12,3,8

(this review is based about 70% from when I originally played it) Though this is a kids game, some of the objectives are barely clear what you need to do. I've spent a good amount of time wandering around looking for a solution for the puzzle they've put forth and have found nothing, forcing for me to look up a guide or video. With that being said, I did really enjoy it back then, and I've had a pretty good experience with it my 2nd time around.

												I always avoided indie games as I assumed low budget meant low quality. This was the first indie game I played (back on the xbox 360). I was really amazed by the cute cartoon graphics, the fantastic characterisation without using any voice acting, the humour and just the originality of the game. I knew nothing about the game when I bought it and so when you first discover Maw's main skill I was taken by surprise and instantly fell in love the characters and the game. The Maw opened my eyes to indie games. Indie games like this are just wonderful original experiences that you don't get from big budget AAA titles. They may not have the best graphics, physics or cameras but they can be really well crafted experiences that you remember for years. The game is great for kids, and adults, and although the graphics look a bit dated in places it is still a great game to play now. It is easy to complete the levels but it is a challenge to get 100%.Some people complain about the camera, but with a controller the game plays very well and you can control the camera. Using the controller I never had any camera problems.p.s. If you are trying to get 100%, don't let Maw use the tongue move. Always feed Maw one at a time. I am pretty sure that sometimes the tongue move does not give you the full count.   ",706,300,18,107,68,8,113

												Kinda like a 'Reverse Pikmin' game. You lead a thing around, make it eat things, and sometimes a thing that the thing eats makes it do a thing, then you use the thing to solve puzzles created by other things. It's cute and it's fun and it's just short enough not to get repetitive, even when going for 100%.			",502,68,17,39,21,9,54

YouTube™ Video: My Thoughts On... The Maw [Critique] 

			Views: 8		

			After finishing my LP of it I couldn't stop thinking about the game, and the wild turn it took in it's later stages. So I decided to write out all my thoughts and create a review.

												This is a very basic game, one of those where you can't really fail to progress. It's short; I did three of the eight levels in one lunchtime. There's not much point in an adult playing this; it tracks your completion time, but movement is so slow it feels like it'd be hard to know whether you're doing well. It doesn't hold up now, anyway, even if it did on release.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												Only a short review this time around. I have only played for a few minutes, and I am giving up, simply because I cannot turn up mouse sensitivirty enough to be able to enjoy this game. i have to sweep my mouse across my desk 3 times to turn 360 deg. I have a small desk, but not that small.I have played FPS games for 25 years. I think I know how to mess with mouse sensitiity. I have a 2000DPI mouse. Don't bother insulting me with ""did you turn you mouse up"" or ""did you change the ingame settings"".Seems like a cutesy, kid-friendly puzzler.For the game size and look, it's a very compact download (350mb) which shows excellent coding by the programmers.

												Meh.  Not giving this a thumbs down or anything, but it's a little too cutesy kid like for me.  Probably pretty entertaining for a 10 year old if they want to drag around a strange purple gellatenous carnivore alien while it eats everything in sight.  Not for me though.  All I care about is Dark Souls!  Have you heard about Dark Souls?  Let me tell you about Dark Souls!It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good.Yet, it's so incredibly easy.Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective.Dark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you.It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It does't want you to give up.Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying ""clunk"" sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!The world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that ""adventure"" experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called ""Humanity"" to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to ""invade"" the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of ""honor"" code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What ""honor"" or ""etiquette"" should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.			",673,205,22,54,51,9,81

												I only know of this game because it was made by Twisted Pixel. Splosion and Ms. Splosion are SOOOOOO amazing, I am a huge fan of those. Fast-paced action all throughout, and great co-op play too (I played with my dad :D)The Maw, on the other hand, is a whole lot slower. Almost too slow; I wish the maw moved faster. It's not at all what I was expecting from Twisted Pixel, but if you want to just chill and eat stuff, it's a good game. Not amazing, but good. It's easy, and the kind of game where you literally can never die, but going for 100% Eaten is harder and pretty fun, and is what you should do. Next time The Mawesome Pack is 75% off, you should maybe get it.			",180,30,3,14,14,3,26

												Before I begin my review let me suggest you that if you want to give this game a fair chance, please bear in mind that the game was released in 2009 so expect some limitations.This is a short and entertaining game, the mechanics are very simple but the pace of exploration + puzzles  works most of the time. The Maw can be entertaining for an adult but it reaches another level if kids play it. I reckon that they will love the characters and find the game to be very funny.The Dlc levels offer an extended playtime, because they are mixed with the main campaign.In conclussion, if you decide to buy this game and its dlc during a sale you will discover an enjoyable experience, but keep in mind that the game is old by today's standards and it offers a basic challenge.

												The Maw is an adorable platformer game about a little blue alien and his purple alien pet/friend that eats everything.I think this game is geared at children and families and casual gamers... which isn't a bad thing.  The reason I think this, is that there was no way of really dying in the game... You can make mistakes, but they're forgiving and generally reversable.The characters and world are charming and cute, and are something that I wouldn't mind sharing with a 5 year old... or their grandmother, believing it will be received well by them both.

												Before I begin my review let me suggest you that if you want to give this game a fair chance, please bear in mind that the game was released in 2009 so expect some limitations.This is a short and entertaining game, the mechanics are very simple but the pace of exploration + puzzles  works most of the time. The Maw can be entertaining for an adult but it reaches another level if kids play it. I reckon that they will love the characters and find the game to be very funny.The Dlc levels offer an extended playtime, because they are mixed with the main campaign.In conclussion, if you decide to buy this game and its dlc during a sale you will discover an enjoyable experience, but keep in mind that the game is old by today's standards and it offers a basic challenge.

												A delightful... did I just use that word?  Sure... why not... delightful game for all audiences.  Clean cartoony graphics, challenging yet accessible puzzles, and cute characters.  Also, the download is only like 230mb, it's not a bloated piece of crud with pre-rendered video everywhere.  I respect that.			",535,192,10,48,37,3,46

												This game is cute.It's a puzzle game with very bright and pleasing graphics.  Nothing too intense, but colorful and vibrant.  Basically during each level, you find things to feed Maw.  Different creatures provide different effects and you need to find your way out of the level.The controls were a little quirky when trying to jump, but all in a all a fun game worth the dollar or so I paid.

												Can't save within a level. Only important when you have to leave 75% in for a pet (or, I guess, chiled) emergency then you have to start the level all over again. Otherwise, a thoroughly enjoyable, diverting, and yes, let's face it, adorable game. Great to play with a grandchild on your lap, cheering you on.  :-)			",44,2,0,14,5,1,14

												The Maw is unique and fun. You will be emotionally attached to your alien by the end of the game!			",450,106,11,37,34,5,54

												A charming little game that is brief and fun, but the lack of a moveable camera makes some of the puzzles far harder than it needs to be.			",117,24,0,15,30,0,24

												This is a great platformer/puzzle game and really enjoyed my time with it.  It is a little bit reminescent of a great N64 game, the way it plays.  I would not recommend the Speeder Lane DLC, but the other two were great.			",577,144,16,64,42,7,116

												Very cool game. I played it before and now i bought it. It's fun to see how Maw from very little grow to that size! :O And its cute how he likes Franky(Or something like that i dont remember his name XD). Ending was awesome and the only bad thing about this game is that it's short :<			",55,3,1,3,2,0,6

												Fun for the whole family! This 3rd person puzzle/adventure game has cute aliens and a good engine. Not much in the way of combat here. The last few levels may get a *bit* repetitive. All in all, a great game if you're not advese to new things.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
