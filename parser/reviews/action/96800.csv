												This arena shooter is so much fun and looks delicious.Sadly the developers dropped support for it and it wasn't playable online for a long time.Now the game got re-released in the Steam Store and the player base is gone.Seriously, either no soul is online or the servers are not reachable.I sadly can't recommend this game, because the developers are obviously not capable of maintaining it properly.I'd like more people to own this, so the player base grows, but first there should be functioning servers...Developers, fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thanks.

												If you're a fan of old-school Arena FPS such as Quake you will absolutely love this.The movement system is possibily the smoothest and nicest one I've ever seen since Quake CPMA. You have an extreme control of your trajectory in mid air, for example you can rotate by 90 degrees in mid air and change your trajectory with a sharp turn. You can accelerate slightly by jumping (similar to bunnyhopping minus the strafing).Did I mention it supports custom workshop maps?While the graphics can reach quite a level of detail, I prefer keeping them down to the minimum to prevent any distraction.

												If you love fast paced first person shooters then look no further!This game has been released once more and I am happy it can finally be played by people who may have missed it the first time round. It plays a lot like UT and Quake but has its own unique style and it looks beautiful when maxed out, the way Cryengine 3 is meant to be used. Hopefully the online community comes back to this as it desperatley misses it. I also highly recommend Duel Mode with a friend, 1v1, Instagib with the Nex; prepare for one frantic butt clenching game!Welcome back Nexuiz!			",68,14,1,4,3,1,15

												Amazing game, really faced fast arena shooter in similar vein of unreal/quake with sci-fi setting and varied levels. The game looks good and the audio is crisp and clean, the mutators are a integral part of the game and makes the game so much fun, you chose from 3 different random options and there are plenty of those to keep it random and fun at the same time.This game was relaunched after a long time due to the old publishers (THQ) shutting down the servers as they went bankript which is a shame, the problem still with the game is that it still has optimization issues and the biggest problem of populated servers, the game literally has 8-10 people playing at during its peak while has even zero during down time which is a real shame coz this is one of those highly underrated titles that i am sure many people would love to play as we dont have many mp games in the similar genre these days.

												A few friends and I were part of the Beta for Nexuiz and we truly enjoyed it. We played the original Nexuiz (Nexuiz Classic, still amazing) and really loved the mutators, the level design, and the fast-paced arena action (grappling hooks were freaking COOL). Once the sequal/reinvisionment went live on Steam we bought copies for all of our other friends and played the hell out of it... until THQ went under and the servers disappeared. With no LAN option the game was a total waste of HDD space.However! Once the THQ dust settled the folks working on the game promised to get things back up and running and they have! Years later the game is available again on Steam and I can whole heartedly recommend it to anybody who has a few friends they want to enjoy a great and gorgeous arena shooter with. But! The game is only any good if you coordinate with your friends to have an online match or LAN party as the playerbase is nonexsistant. But yelling at your friends across the room and throwing empty Dew cans at them while pizza spittle flys from your mouth is the proper way to enjoy these types of games anyway so I see no problem with this.

												I used to play Nexuiz classic all the time, and remember packed servers and fast paced UT-like action, was excited to see the re-release on steam.After almost a week of logging in and searching here and there i STILL havent found a single multiplayer game to join, and the bots are just boring.  I even sat in an empty server for 3 hours waiting for someone to join but it never happened, without players there's no real point in picking this up.Aside from that there are some other issues too, the weapons all kinda look the same and hud  (especially the weapon indicators) are in a really bad spot.  The mutators feature while interesting for about 5 minutes gets annoying fast and i can't really see keeping that on ever.  Visually the game kinda looks cluttered, not nearly as bad as most modern fps games but still a huge step down in visual clarity from nex classic/UT99-2004 (think oversaturated overdetailed maps like the stock UT3 ones where the details just end up getting in the way of playing)Might be worth picking up cheap if a community ever starts to form, but honestly it seems almost too late at this point.

												As a remake from a 2005 MOD, NEXUIZ got revamped on CryEngine 3 and re-released in May 2012 with DX11 graphical upgrades.I played the game a bit and from what I did played, the game didn't really impressed me much. Sure the graphics are obviously great but the ""arena shooter"" elements aren't that good compared to past games that did it right, namely Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament 2004. Guess Nexuiz is a b@stard child of Quake 3 vs UT2004.Currently, I can't find myself to like Nexuiz. The weapons are uninspired, the maps are not memorable and very tiny 4vs4 arena. Since the game doesn't have a map editor, I bet MAP PACKS will be the CoD standard.OVERALL:Nexuiz is a bland game with cool mutators that save's it from mediocrity. But you'd be better playing other alternatives instead which are far from lacking from F2P FPS games to older arena shooters like Quake 3, Quake Live and Unreal Tournament (any edition would do).RECOMMENDATION:The best recommendation I can give you is play QUAKE LIVE, which is FREE and the gameplay is much better than Nexuiz... and with MORE MAPS and Players!RATING:5.0 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												(It's a bit weird that steam claims that I have 0 hours on record, I guess the record resets after a long while and after re installing steam/using it from a diff computer?)Not a very good game. It's the kid that tries to dress like Quake and Unreal Tournament and hang out with them... but he's way too immature to pull that off.It tries to call itself a competitive shooter bringing the MP arena fighting back however it falls flat on it's face.It relies too much on random events to be a serious competitive shooter. A competitive game should have as little randomization as possible so it can be mastered through hard work and not ""luck"".Graphic wise it does look good, which tells me that they should have paid more attention to the gameplay than the graphics.I don't recommend this game at all. It's not even that fun to play it with friends... Just go play the original Quake Arena , Unreal Tournament or even Shoot Mania.This one is trying too hard.			",420,129,7,33,29,7,46

												A game highly reminiscent of Unreal Tournament with more modern looks and almost dizzingly fast pacing. Level designs are more than adequate, and there is no singleplayer campaign besides playing against bots. Player base is pretty low, as it has just been re-released for Steam. However, granted influence and enough exposure, that might be remedied. Had this game since 2012 before they docked off Steam. I recommend it if you're looking for the same experience as UT, with much more advanced graphics, and a fast pace. (Sometimes, running through levels with speed ups and jumps, I feel like this game might be slightly faster than UT, if that was possible, and possibly to a detriment.) ",74,9,1,17,10,0,11

												A fantastic arena style FPS - a variety of levels, weapons, low gravity modes - really resembles the new Doom (2016). Can use Directx9 or Directx11, and the levels are graphically superior to most first person shooters. It's frantic and fast so be prepaired to think on your toes. There are hardly no hiding spots in these levels. Highly suggested and cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game. Where to start?Well I guess first off is to say, honestly this game isn't bad, it's just dead now. In a nutshell Nexuiz is a Unreal Tournament clone, and in and of itself it does the job well enough. At the time this was released, I do believe the gaming industry was in an arena shooter desert where they were far and few between, so we needed this game. However, it never picked up any real momentum due to not having enough marketing, and, well, Cryengine. Cryengine looks pretty, but back then it could alienate alot of your userbase just due to needing so much more power than other engines. Nowadays, I don't think that's as much of an issue unless you're running a 10 year old rig, you should at least be able to play on minimal settings. Then THQ went under. Due to issues with that, the master server list for this game went down. This game will not start if it sees the master server list down. So for a couple of years it was completely dead in the water. I think you could start up stupid mode or the beta exe and still be able to play, but that would only be with bots, and you could only run stupid mode if you had a really high end rig, it was the same game, just in super graphics mode. The master server list is back up, and if you are extremely lucky you might see a server, but more than likely it will be no humans, and all bots. This game has been dead for so long, and didn't have enough of a following to start with, that everyone who owned it has all but forgotten it, and any new owner will more than likely give up because all there is to do, is play against bots.If you don't mind playing against just bots, and you are a fan of arena shooters, it really isn't a bad game. It's a UT clone, and in that regard it does it's job pretty well. It's just dead for players and I don't see that aspect changing anytime soon.			",249,31,3,30,21,4,22

												Final Impressions:The Medal Master achivement appears, presently, to be unachiveable, as no medals seem to be produced from bot matches and there are insufficient players for proper pvp/quick matches.The issue with speed vs. fire rate for several weapons still seems to apply (not a lag issue) and this is unfortunate and makes, at least for me, a handful of the weapons totally useless.I would recommend this game if it were picked up in a bundle and/or certainly if it becomes free. As a standalone purchase however, this game has an insufficient player base to justify the expense.I suggest to the developers:1. Hold some Nexuiz events to better market this older title2. Decrease the stand-alone price and/or add in some additional DLC (between your more active projects) to increase it's cost vs. benefit rating3. Actively seek to include the title in other bundles to increase availability and perhaps expand the player base (I acquired the game via the Cryengine dev pack on Humble bundle for example).I am changing the rating on this review to a positive one--as I do find myself playing the game and that, unto itself, speaks volumes.Third impressions:Nexuiz is slowly growing on me. No real online multi-player (lack of population). Still having issues with aiming--given run/jump speeds etc. I have yet to receive any medals--so I believe this remains glitched and may have to be worked around for the achivement to trigger for pokemon purposes. Fun for short bursts, but still can't recommend it as an individual purchase at this time.Second impressions:CTF is definately the best match type so far--such has remained enjoyable.Hitbox/accuracy remains an issue--the raw/base movement of characters still seems to surpass actual projectile speed (does not seem to be a lag/graphic setting issue, but more play is needed).Mutators are enjoyable and afford an excellent, and in a couple instances--funny, variation to some of the other arena games I have played.Tried some online quick matches. Player population remains very limited. One game was fine (albeit a loss) the other has me questioning how prevalent hacking is amonst the minute player base (1-2 shot kills 8 times in a row within 10s of respawning, and whilst on the run, seems a tad high--but then I am new to this product. However, such was not noticed in any bot matches or my other online/pvp matches to date).First impressions:Acquired via the Cryengine Humble Bundle.Maps are generally well designed. CTF is fun, however, DM is, unfortunately, quite bland. Both CTF and DM suffer, from what is intended to be a feature, by the ADHD style of movement within Nexuiz. Yes it is fast paced, but so much so that it is more about ""spray and pray"" than actual aiming/accuracy.The frequency of powerups/drops et al. is also very high on the maps I've explored to date. This makes resource conservation of little value, thus far, and further supports the ""spray and pray"" style.If you want arena combat, akin to Speedy gonzales running around with a rocket launcher, then Nexuiz fits the bill.I remain hopeful I'll see some value, beyond achievement collecting, in Nexuiz and I will update this review accordingly as additional play time is logged.

												Nexuiz is a fast paced arena type shooter utilizing cry engine 3 giving it a beautiful graphical display. There are several unique weapons rannging from the nex, your classic railgun sniper to the rocket launcher. Thus far the game has 3 modes. Capture the flag and team dm being the standard modes with a DLC that adds in 1v1 duel mode. Ontop of that you can pick up mutators which change how the game is played by making everything black and white, making your opponets mute so they cant hear and adding in the dev's floating heads that shoot lazers. Around the map there are armour pick up sort of like in quake which are essential to your survival.All and all I enjoyed playing this game, there are a few bugs and the lack of a community and difficulty finding a game with more then 3 people but if you have a friend to play with i reccomend this game though if your looking to play online I wouldn't bother picking it up due to lack of community.

												Nexuiz wants to be Unreal Tournament but is not very good at at it. No one is really playing this game therefore if you like bot match you may enjoy it. I got this game with my gfx card HD7950 a while back but never gave the game a review. The only positive is the Cry Engine and beautiful graphics. 5/10

												If it was popular back at release,well nowcommunity is dead. Nexuiz is a Quake 3 style game, you are put against other team of 4vs4 players and can play TDM or CTF modes. There is also about 8 diffrent maps and some weapon arsenal which is cool. My only problem with this game is that it has unnessasary Cry Engine 3 thing. This game doesn''t need it. If it was a blast back then now it's dead. All in all it had pottential to beome quite a good brainless shooter just to chill. 4/10.			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

												this is the version of the game built up from a theft of source code and name of the original Nexuiz which was open source and since reforked into Xonoticthis game is all shiny but has tons of annoying mutators (though you can set your own rules, but better stuffs would have been preferable) and bots are annoyingly buffedsome weapons play pretty well, but overall it could use of some polishingi had pre-ordered this years ago and it was released late, and even then the game was uncomplete and non-functionnal. they eventually took the servers down to be released again today and it's still very bad, full of bugs (some options like bot difficulty can't be changed unless i switch to windowed.. really ?) and with no player online. also it seems like ranking system is mandatory in public online games and that sucksjust play Xonotic it's way better and it's free, and it runs very smoothly and is not full of ugly blurry and shiny effects like in this ""Nexuiz"" steam game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love so much			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has cooperative gameplay through different types of game modes like Capture The Flag, Deathmatch, Free For All, Survival, and more.What is great about this version of the game is that it uses the awesome Crytek Engine that is used in games like Crysis and other. The Crytek Engine has great graphics and it looks absolutely great for this classic game from 2002 inspired by Unreal Tournament.			",132,9,2,4,7,1,7

												Nexuiz is a competent futuristic tournament combat game with demanding although attractive DirectX11 graphics.  As is often the case with tournament combat games, the backstory is paper thin and serves only to briefly explain the futuristic setting.  While the combat is quick paced, and there are a variety of fun mutators like super jumps or unlimited ammo, the game unfortunately looks and feels almost identical to Unreal Tournament 2004.  This may not be a bad thing for fans of the genre because the game will immediately feel familiar, but I found myself growing bored quickly and the lackluster weapon effects and HUD did not do much to encourage my enthusiasm.  That said, it is a competent entry in the genre but the lack of a single player campaign, steep system requirements, and rather lackluster gameplay should keep all but genre diehards away.

												A FPS that tries to be Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Halo all in one and it fails miserabley at it. This game was made to be a competitive arena shooter but yet it uses a random mutator system. That would be like a pro baseball team playing competitively with a  random chance that the opposing team could hit a grand slam off of a base hit. If 8 friends want to get together and just blast and have goofy fun, then ok but serious competitors, steer clear. Now that a patch has been released the gameplay is smooth and the weapons work well. All and All not a bad game just confused at what it wants to be. My score is for  the BOT or playing with friends side of the game. Rating 6 out of 10			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												An arena shooter with a bit of a twist. In Nexuiz, matches are punctuated by the use of mutators which change the flow of the game. For instance, there is a mutator that lowers gravity allowing you to jump great distances, another that gives everyone sniper rifles and enforces one hit kills. In total, there are 100 mutators. They are the best aspect of Nexuiz, making matches unpredictable and exciting.It is a multiplayer game at heart (you can only play bot matches single player) which makes the problems with the online all the more confounding. The hit detection is very suspect; you can be unleashing on an opponent but seemingly do no damage. There is a fair bit of lag usually, so it exacerbates the hit detection issues. The player base is tiny too, thus it can be very difficult to find matches.It's good for a couple of hours play, not much more.			",398,90,13,61,43,10,90

												A great, super fast paced arena shooter. Very good graphics, tons of settings to tweak, and as far from a console port as you can get. If your looking for something along the lines of Quake 4, or UT3 then this is your game. LAN party support built in. Only downfall is the 4 player per-side limit making this game only support 8 players at a time.			",569,115,25,61,31,6,84

												A FPS that tries to be Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Halo all in one and it fails miserabley at it. This game was made to be a competitive arena shooter but yet it uses a random mutator system. That would be like a pro baseball team playing competitively with a  random chance that the opposing team could hit a grand slam off of a base hit. If 8 friends want to get together and just blast and have goofy fun, then ok but serious competitors, steer clear. Now that a patch has been released the gameplay is smooth and the weapons work well. All and All not a bad game just confused at what it wants to be. My score is for  the BOT or playing with friends side of the game. Rating 6 out of 10			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												An arena shooter with a bit of a twist. In Nexuiz, matches are punctuated by the use of mutators which change the flow of the game. For instance, there is a mutator that lowers gravity allowing you to jump great distances, another that gives everyone sniper rifles and enforces one hit kills. In total, there are 100 mutators. They are the best aspect of Nexuiz, making matches unpredictable and exciting.It is a multiplayer game at heart (you can only play bot matches single player) which makes the problems with the online all the more confounding. The hit detection is very suspect; you can be unleashing on an opponent but seemingly do no damage. There is a fair bit of lag usually, so it exacerbates the hit detection issues. The player base is tiny too, thus it can be very difficult to find matches.It's good for a couple of hours play, not much more.			",398,90,13,61,43,10,90

												The Steam version of Nexuiz has got better graphics than the original, free to play -client for sure, but having played the original game for several years, I found the new commercial version to be a bit of a miss for me.These graphical improvements have made the game feel less tactile in my opinion. The Quakeish feel is still there, but it feels somewhat bloated now. It is however more likely to attract the new generation of gamers with aforementioned in-your-face graphics and dubstep-filled loading screens.If you're looking for yet another reaction shooter and don't mind recycled content or just have the desire to pay more for the polished look, go for it. I'd recommend getting to know the alternatives first though. Unreal Tournament 3 is definitely worth the extra dough.			",223,22,7,12,15,3,29

												A big shame the game died, it's a perfect FPS for twitch shooters. Even comes with Ugly mode so you don't need to quakify the gfx. As you play in the match you randomly get modifiers that can work for you or act as a disadvantage. Everything is so fast paced that if you aren't into Quake/PK:B/UT or FPS speedrunning you really won't enjoy this game.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												Fantastic game concept, like the Quake III and other twitch shooters of old... But it's dead. No one plays it because it was broken for about a week. This is true as of 19/07/12 and may have changed with the Steam summer sale, but for now, you'll be getting it for bots only. Real real shame, it was so much fun.			",132,14,5,15,11,0,19

												If you dig Quake 3 and UT99 (Or UT2k3/2k4 and UT3) and want a new spin on SUPER FAST Twitch Shooting (Quake Speed; so faster than UT) that uses 2012 Tech; Cryengine 3 (is built on PC with DX11 first unlike Crysis 2) stunning Arena game for 8.99! - It's big draw is the contantly changing mutaters; and they have 100's of mutaters from changing everyones controls to inverts; to black and white /  ""15"" years ago (Looks like your playing Doom 2)/lowGrav/InstaGib/PogoStick & they change every 30 seconds or so; then you have personal Mutaters; and 3 tiers of them you achieve as you spree etc; you set these for your character and use them as strategy things like turnign your shutgun into a super shotgun; to having all bullets reflect off of you onto enemies; etc; Absolutely GORGEOUS PC Ultra setting graphics. The second highest graphic setting says ""2010"" and the highest is just named ;]   Just a smiley letting you know ""Hell Yeah"".  All weapons have UT style Alt Fires; A+ for the price&Fun!

												It was a good effort. I think the devs were trying to make a modern-day Quake Arena, but it doesn't play well. It rendered very slowly, even on low, and the game is supposed to be fast paced. There's also a lot of motion-blur that you can't really turn off, and motion-blur combined with low framerates is just a mess.I liked the weapons, and the graphics were nice while you were standing still. That's about all, unfortunately.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

Unfortunatly meanwhile the game is not even on steam or any sale anymore since the Dev`S having some problems with the publisher.			",172,24,6,5,10,4,7

												Have you tried Unreal Tournament? If not then you might have played Quake? Wether it was UT og Quake this game will give some of the nostalgia that was 10 years ago. It has cooperative gameplay through different types of game modes like Capture The Flag, Deathmatch, Free For All, Survival, and more.What is great about this version of the game is that it uses the awesome Crytek Engine that is used in games like Crysis and other. The Crytek Engine has great graphics and it looks absolutely great for this classic game from 2002 inspired by Unreal Tournament.			",132,9,2,4,7,1,7

												Nexuiz is a competent futuristic tournament combat game with demanding although attractive DirectX11 graphics.  As is often the case with tournament combat games, the backstory is paper thin and serves only to briefly explain the futuristic setting.  While the combat is quick paced, and there are a variety of fun mutators like super jumps or unlimited ammo, the game unfortunately looks and feels almost identical to Unreal Tournament 2004.  This may not be a bad thing for fans of the genre because the game will immediately feel familiar, but I found myself growing bored quickly and the lackluster weapon effects and HUD did not do much to encourage my enthusiasm.  That said, it is a competent entry in the genre but the lack of a single player campaign, steep system requirements, and rather lackluster gameplay should keep all but genre diehards away.
