												Lugaru is about ten percent of the most brilliant game I've ever played.It's really, really unfinished -- the levels are piles of cubes and trees sitting in the middle of vast, otherwise featureless plains, and the story mode has nasty visible scars where all the player choice was removed -- but what's there hints at a huge amount of unrealized potential. When you find yourself paying attention to the direction of the breeze and cleaning the blood off your knife so you can avoid detection by a wolf's sensitive nose, you know you're playing something brilliant.Or, rather, a slightly broken demo for something brilliant.

												This game is underrated as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean. Have you ever heard of it? No?Well then.This game is a hidden jewel. I can't believe it was overlooked.Well.Maybe because of how much skill you need for it.This game is like fighting an actual person. You need fast reflexes and a way to take them down easyEither if its stealth, or brute force, you need ways. And sometimes the game makes you change your tactics and get used to new ones. And you need to be VERY calm during all of this. Spamming isn't an option.But still. I can't believe Overgrowth is praised so much, and this is an outcast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I downloaded this in a fit of boredom the other night, having acquired this game in the first Humble Indie Bundle. I'd heard a bunch of negative responses to the game, with implications that it's some kind of ""furry"" sim. That's not the vibe I'm getting at all. Story-wise this game is a pure revenge tale that grows into story about betrayal and conspiracy. But forget about all the fluff for a moment and let's take a look at the meat of the game; The combat system. This is Batman Arkham Asylum with the difficulty cranked up to 11. And that's on Lugaru's Easy mode. The reversals and context sensitve hand -to-hand and melee combat  feel very much like a prototype for Rocksteady's Batman games. But you won't find enemies timing their attacks for you here. They will gleefully all attack at once, pounding your rabbit head into a sticky paste. Timing, stealth and smart response are absolutely necessary for success. If you want a great 3D brawler then this may be your game.			",961,222,15,134,84,5,161

												KungFu rabbit from times when pixels were large and distributives - small.It is a little game, and it looks even older than it is... But it doesn't matter at all. The game offers experience comparable to nothing else. It is a hardcore test of your will and skill.You play as a fighter rabbit who is securing his island from anything dangerous, bare-handedly. In basic terms, it's a 3D beat'em up. Fighting system is simple, but very addictive. Because of this - I highly recommend ""Lugaru"" to all who have a taste for old games and especially in fightings and beat'em ups...8/10 dead rabbitsupdate: It has a little disadvantage: every time I play the game my internet connection is cutting off itself. Probably for the reason that I shouldn't be distracted when fighting to death.			",725,238,45,156,102,5,232

												Choosing a good and simple game to do my first review, I choose this one. Why ? Since it's a Beat'em'Up style game, you fight against a good many enemies, needing to be fast on attacks and defenses/counter-attacks to stay alive through the levels, and heh, it isn't easy as it looks. This is a pretty simple game, with a good batch of combos and punchs & kicks to fill up your fight.This game don't has pretty graphs, neither good effects (and unfortunatelly the resolution option don't work), but honestly, it's a worth game for those that like games that's tough and old, with fighting mechanics. And then the history goes, that isn't really big, turns around Turner, an adult rabbit that lives in the forest, among his family and friends, but life is hard over there, principally when there's Raiders (the bad rabbits) and the Wolves. But there's still more to play than the campaing, there's 14 levels of challenge, and it can get difficult, very difficult.So, after all the text, I can pretty much say that I do recommend alot this game. :3			",98,17,3,11,3,3,3

												The really cool predecessor to Overgrowth. It's EXTREMELY fast-paced, difficult, and quite honestly some levels are nearly impossible. I've been trying to kill 3 wolves for like 2 hours.If you're into extremely punishing games and just spamming keys over and over again in slightly different combinations, go for it. It's definitely a novel idea and even though barebones, you can see it's got a good foundation.I'd recommend it if it's what you're looking for, but not if you're just a casual gamer.

												Okay, imagine bunnies. Now imagine human bunnies. I know it's weird, just try. Now imagine human bunnies with weapons. Now imagine human bunnies with weapons that know martial arts, fighting each other and wolves and doing stealth takedowns...Yes, this is Lugaru HD. It is sadly very short, but one of the most memorable games I have played. The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and Lugaru lights it up with stylistic bunny combat (maybe rabbit, I don't know the difference). There are many bugs, and the wolves make for a cliff face of a difficulty curve. But every minute was a blast. It is equally fun to play, watch, and tell embellished stories about. Invest a couple of hours in it. You will be highly amused, I promise.			",411,97,17,51,27,6,44

												Lugaru is an extremely tight control arena-type fighter set in a bizarre world of humanoid animals who often find themselves beating the living crap out of each other due to reasons.The combat system is fairly unique as well as surprisingly in-depth despite being very simple input wise (one attack button, a couple inventory buttons, the movement keys, duck and jump): There are aerial attacks, wall jumps, suplexes, finishers, jabs, a variety of kicks including an insanely powerful roundhouse, reversal moves, anti-reversal moves, weapon throws, you name it. Movement feels incredibly fluid. Attacks are triggered through context sensitive timing (ducking while under attack will perform a reversal move) and combining keys (jumping, ducking and dropping a weapon in midair will cause you to air flip launch it into an enemy) which make for a very satisfying experience when you get the hang of it as the game does not let up and will constantly challenge you with scenarios that allow multiple ways of approaching whether it be through stealth for facing few enemies at a time or barging in and kicking everyone into space with your leg cannons while avoiding being counter-struck.The campaign story is fairly simplistic and borderline cliche; You're Turner, a fairly chill herbivore, who then gets messed with, by not-so-chill herbivores that go out of their way to murder your family and friends, for an obscure purpose. With nothing to lose, you go out on a quest seeking  ＲＥＶＥＮＧＥ  as well as answers which are nonetheless secondary to the brutal rear kicking that ensues. There are optional challenge scenarios as well, which don't seem to have any story behind them but are still fun. In case you haven't noticed it yet, it's not a very plot-heavy game.The graphics are fairly dated, but they get the job done. They're at best nostalgic, despite being a PC exclusive, and at worst disturbing, due to the admittedly bizarre art style. The soundtrack is rather atmospheric and give the game some much needed spirit depending on the situation you're facing, but it isn't anything to write home about. TL;DR:It's a title focused on its fighting gameplay and challenges. Everything else in it is there to either accompany or support it, and not the other way around. If you're looking for a decent challenge, fluid Mouse+Keyboard gameplay or unconditional genocide of bunny rabbits, do consider checking it out.You may find the demo for it here: http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru ",241,31,4,22,22,1,22

												Even if you don't read any more of this review, just read the next sentence. The GAMEPLAY of this game is INCREDIBLE.Lugaru is pretty much my favourite game. I was gifted it in Humble Bundle 2 and I spent at least thirty hours playing it before I added it to Steam. The combat is absolutely awesome and I keep finding little tricks and moves I had no idea about even after playing 25+ hours, like spinning and throwing a weapon at the same time. The campaign is pretty straightforward but the challenge levels are where I've spent the largest amount of time. Because the gameplay is so excellent, I keep coming back again and again and again because it's so much fun. The hand-to-hand combat requires different strategies depending on whether you're facing off against a rabbit (easier) or a wolf (harder) and the weapons are a lot of fun.The graphics are a bit deceptive of the game's overall quality at first, and there's a few things that could be done better (HD resolutions, ironically because of the game's ""HD"" label), but overall I absolutely love this game and I highly recommend it. Incredible value for money too.			",146,28,3,23,9,0,11

												Lugaru comes from Wolfire Games, the company that spawned the Humble Indie Bundle.  Their idea revolutionized the digital games market, and drove millions of copies of excellent games into the hands of users who otherwise would have never played them.  Lugaru was their first release as a developer, and it’s an interesting, although rough, experience.  It is a game about loss and revenge.  It is a game about morality and justice.  It has brutal hand-to-hand combat.  And rabbits.You might think a game about anthropomorphic rabbits would be cute.  You would be wrong.  This game is dark.  The combat is visceral, tight, and bloody.  After Turner the rabbit sees his entire family♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and slaughtered by bandits, he sets out on an island-spanning quest for vengeance.  The vast majority of the game consists of different combat scenarios, with different numbers of enemies equipped with different weapons like staves, knives, or swords.  Kill them all to progress.  In between these fights are text cut scenes, and dialogue is harsh like an 80s action movie. “I swear, I will kill them all,” etc.  This is a little tough to get past when you see a rabbit with huge eyes and a cute chirpy noise for a voice say this.  Immersion is not the strong suit of this game.Where this game really shines is the combat.  The developers were wise to not depend on lengthy combos or meters; your only commands are simple punch, jump, and crouch. Combining them results in different attacks.  There is no health meter, you can only tell Trevor’s condition by the blurriness of the screen and how he will pant and slump after hard hits.  There is no on-screen notification of your enemy’s actions, and even if there were, you wouldn’t be able to react to them fast enough.  You’ll have to watch your enemy carefully, and parry at just the right moment to disarm or incapacitate them long enough to get in a solid hit.  You can perform instant kills by stealthily approaching your opponent from behind (and in the case of wolves, from downwind) and snapping their necks.  Failure is not punished heavily, as you will restart at the beginning of the stage, most of which last only a few minutes.The music matches the tone of the game well; a slow, unease will set over you on the main menu, letting you know this is not a game for the faint of heart.  When combat starts, your blood will get pumping as drums drive you to commit acts of rabbit violence.  The sound effects when you land hits are crucial, as they inform you of what’s happening in the hand-to-hand scrum faster than your eyes can probably process it.  Often, when delivering a killing blow, time will slow down and you will see that perfect kick to the head or knife throw in glorious slow motion.The graphics are sparse, and the polygon count is low, even for the main character.  Structures are basic cubes and rectangles, and the ground is little more than a few rolling hills populated with the odd tree.  However sparse things are, though, it is impressive how much the team was able to build.  The graphics are lacking, though mildly impressive when you read Wolfire’s blog where they detail all the work that went into it, and the spiritual sequel that is still in Early Access, Overgrowth.  Everything in both games was built from scratch by the small development team.Lugaru is a fast-paced game, and while the tutorial is thorough, the fight design leaves little room for error.  Oftentimes a well-placed hit by an enemy will send you flying, not only doing direct damage, but leaving you at the mercy of the ragdoll physics.  Land on your head, and you’ll potentially break your neck and have to start the fight over.  Aside from Trevor’s campaign for revenge, there is also a challenge mode that pits you against groups of enemies, and you can compete to achieve a high score against each group.  This is good practice for campaign mode, letting you quickly learn the systems and effective strategies against certain enemies and how to use different weapons.While the graphics are unpolished, and the story feels “adult” for the sake of just being edgy, instead of in service of a grander point, the quick and weighty combat is entertaining.  For $9.99, it is a good few hours of entertainment.  I think of it more as a preview of what Overgrowth will offer.  Perhaps Overgrowth will deepen these systems while overcoming Lugaru’s faults, but I will wait until it is out of Early Access to find out.			",302,110,8,54,32,6,75

												This game's story can be finished in exactly 67 minutes according to my playtime. Overall it was pretty meh. Gameplay was interesting, story was a bit pulled by its hair, wolves were annoying to deal with until I realized you can jump and spin and they stop moving so you can ezy pezy backstab them lol, the actual fighting felt a bit clunky to be honest.Overall I'd give this game a 5? 6/10. Somewhere along there, mainly because it's short, some fights are really imbalanced when it comes to numbers so you gotta be careful to only draw one of your enemies towards you or else you're screwed by 5 enemies around you continuously, I've had this game for a few years now, probably since I got my steam account or something, I actually forgot how I got it mainly because it was so long ago, probly in a bundle or something, anyway, point is that I've never been interested in playing it and today I finished it in an hour, the story at least, and I can say that I haven't missed anything interesting. I'm gonna recommend this because from the hour I spent in this game I actually hadfun.			",301,66,4,25,21,2,45

												Played this game long before it was on steam and loved it a lot. It has a very fast paced fighting mechanic that is very flexible. An enemy is jumping over you? Grab him and slam him into the ground. There are many hidden techniques to discover and master. The game is full of physical details that you may not expect.The health system is very interesting because it is a mix of heal over time and permanent damage mechanics. A series of blows can weaken you a bit but you can recover from it if you get out of there. Being cut by a sword though will permanently hurt you and you can eventually bleed out.Weapons can give you an edge but there is still a lot of detail in their use. You can throw knives but your enemy can catch them if they notice. A sword can end a fight quickly but the AI is pretty good at countering it and even stealing it right out of your grasp.The levels are a series of missions that involve killing all the enemies. You are offered many choices in how to approach a level. Whether you stealthily take them on one by one, or jump into the middle of a group and mostly likely get wrecked. The story is a revenge story which is simple but presented very well.Enemies vary in strength with wolves being the most powerful and can kick you across the map if they hit you right. Mostly you will be fighting other bunnies.Graphically this is an old game and looks a bit like Morrowind but it does have some cool graphical tricks. Blood splatter is one that will attract your attention. Characters bleed realistically when cut or have their faces smashed. Models are great and the animation is pretty fantastic.The sounds of the game consist of lot's of natural animal sounds with good impact sounds. Fight music is really memorable and gets your blood pumping.Overall this is a very fun 3rd person brawler and the next game Overgrowth is a great successor to the game.			",89,29,0,15,11,0,4

												This is SUCH a good game, however: It is just a little too short, sure there are challenges and the game is SATISFYING but my only true gripe IS the length *The hours you see on Record is HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO BEAT IT*If you like this and want to play it more, then hey go right ahead, more power to you. Personally I feel it was too short to truely keep but I DO recommend it for anyone who wants a fighting system that feels GOOD to use and want to use weapons that actually are as vicious as they seem.

												While the game is fairly entertaining, I can't say I enjoyed it very much myself. It's a bit too fast paced for me. That doesn't mean it's a bad game or you won't enjoy it, though. I'm just not into fighting games like this that much.Good points:-Furries-An interesting story-button mashing (if you're into that, but I'm not.)-combos-realistic blood and damage-real stealth-ragdoll physics-optional tutorialBad points:-Only 2 or 3 songs in the whole game-very fast paced-Can be difficult.-No large resolution sizes and almost no wide screen resolutions-creepy title screen image-Anime type scenarios: ""Hello!"" ""YOU MUST DIE!"" *intense fighting*I only recommend this game because I know people are into this sort of stuff.			",99,41,2,18,42,0,5

												I'm recommending this one sort of on principle, though the game it-self if quite original and well designed. It hasn't aged too well, with very sparse environments, but it does have some pretty strong story telling. Combat is fast, and by fast I mean *blink* YOURE DEAD! The difficulty is sort of unforgiving. My real reason for recommending it is two-fold, however. Firstly these guys that developed the game are also the ones that host the Humble Indie Bundle! They are just a small indie company with like 2 full time developers. Secondly they are currently building the sequel, Overgrowth, which is available in pre order alpha and looks AMAZING already. There aren't any triple A titles with combat and platforming this swift and fluid or with all the great effects going into it. OMG the blood effects are better than any game I've ever seen. Cut a guy and it not only creates a wound where the blade cut him, but the blood runs down his body, and blood can also drip and spray onto others.			",267,47,3,52,18,3,52

												This game is a lot of fun to play. I've picked it up having played it a few years ago, and man the combat is still slick and awesome as it once was. For me the challenges are probably the most fun, with some of the story levels being pretty good in a sneak and kill style. The staffs are fantastic.Even though there are bunnies killing each other it is quite grizzly, similar to Watership Down. The story is quite brutal and quite adult, so I don't recommend it highly for children.One thing that really sucked though was that my game save got deleted as soon as I completed the story. It's a shame, and I have no idea how it happened. Still, I recommend this game for being a lot of fun.			",216,54,1,21,21,2,37

												Lugaru is a strange one. It is a good indie title by Wolfire Games which I was led to by interest in their follow up title Overgrowth. The game follows a humanoid rabbit fighting other humanoid animals in the name of revenge. The graphics are bad. There is no getting around that so lets move on. The 'story' is more so a collection of stages or arenas linked together loosely by some narrative and text which isnt so much of an issue since the actual combat (the only gameplay mechanic) is very satisfying if not a bit difficult.However at the end of the day this game feels like a tech demo considering its short length and shallow story. The animals and combat system do indeed make for a charming experience but with a price tag of €8.99 I simply cannot recommend this game despite my positive memories of it. 6/10			",54,3,0,2,1,0,0

												Lugaru is an interesting game, something that I only recently discovered, and even more recently purchased.The primary focus of this game is the combat system. Overall, it is fluid, genius, and really quite special. There are situations where the combat seems highly imbalanced (wolves on hardest difficulty), but otherwise, you always feel in control and the ability to smoothly transition from attack to block to counter, to reversal, or even evasion at a moment is wonderful.The animations are pretty solid in this regard, with subtle cues indicating what your attacker is about to do. If you learn to read and anticipate, you can perform some really awesome moves.I wish there were more weapons in the levels, and that the ability to use more than one stance/weapon at a time was explored. For instance, being able to use two throwing knives or perhaps to be able to keep a throwing knife to quickly throw while you've got a staff or sword equipped (obviously not being able to swing while you throw). The campaign is very, very short and you should blast through it fairly quickly once you get a handle on the combat. Revisits of beaten areas are not possible on the same profile, so you'll either have to progress to the end and start over, or have extra profiles to screw around on.The graphics are... well, reasonable for a mostly single-person project. However, they would have been poor in 2005 when it first came out, and they've not aged gracefully since. There is a fixed texture size limit of 1024x1024 for most everything, and with a fixed-function engine and no support for things like bump mapping, it will always look fairly flat and bland. However, they serve the intended purpose and they are certainly playable.Sound effects are a bit on the sparse side, with tons of repeat. However, they serve the purpose and get the job done.Environments are overly simple and small. Much more could have been done in terms of exploration and different level types. It is a shame because some of the basic ideas of some really unique worlds are in here.So, should you get it? Absolutely, if you're curious about the origins of Overgrowth or want to try a really unique combat model. Can I recommend it at full price? No, not this late in the game. If the poor graphics sound troublesome, get Overgrowth. It appears to be better in every conceiveable way than Lugaru and is under active development. Also, the art direction has gotten a MASSIVE boost, the engine is way more refined, sound effects are great, models are great, tons more variation, etc. Overgrowth seems to be the culmination of every idea that went into Lugaru.

												Lugaru HD is a free form fighting game that truly emphasizes on the phrase “everyone is kungfu fightin.” At a quick glance Lugaru just looks like a subpar indie game with horrendously bad looking animation. Start playing and your tune will change significantly. I have never played a game where combat dynamics play such a big role. In lugaru a premature punch can leave you wide open for a devastating enemy assault, while a late punch can get you disarmed and dead. The controls is intuitive, you will have no problems picking up the mechanics within 15 minutes. While the main game itself is short, the game has a debug mode which lets you build your own level. Since this game is only 2 hours long, I don’t recommend getting it at the insane price of 10 dollars. Get it on sale! Even if you don’t plan on modding, you will have a blast throwing rabbits and wolves around for a few hours! Nothing is more satisfying than tossing or getting tossed across the map.

												Well, its a simple game.you're a rabbit... commando...kung fu.... thing.you fight other rabbits/creatures. defeat all of them on a level, you progress to the next level.knives, pole arms, swords, etc.controls are simple, yet... pretty clumsy. button masher feel... kinda automated.if its dirt cheap and like... cheap. on sale. etc. yeah.I wouldn't pay full price for this or have any grand expectations out of it, however.graphics... are fairly decent. not amazing. sandbox/over the shoulder fps feel.Does this game stand out? not really. lacks a lot of ... presence? I think it might be the really... dull... however atmospheric soundtrack.kinda boring b/c of the music I think. maybe that's what drew me away from it?kinda gave me a bit of the old Karateka feel, except, without any real control over fighting moves. or, at least thats how it felt first time through.I will say, It was decent enough that I can't give it a bad review. Will I still recommend it? Actually... yes. I couldn't find any extraordinary features about this game to call it ""Bad"". all around, simple. to the point. Praise worthy? not particularily. But you can't hate on it either. It is what it is.cheap game. cheap time killer. cheap. Graphics are pretty decent though. for how cheap it feels.however, I will give it the benefit that it had no problems installing and playing right off the start.(unlike a lot of other games on steam where it takes like an hour of troubleshooting config setting, drivers, etc just to fire up the game).5/10. its passable cheap 3d run around fighting.also, did I mention you're a bunny?

												I played Lugaru on OSX years and years ago. I know there's a story or something, but mostly I modded the game and did fun as hell jump kicks.This is sort of the kind of game I wish Zeno Clash was. The controls are loose, but not frustrating. Just the right amount of control. And the physics is hilarious. You also feel really cool and empowered when you're jumping around, doing flips and kicking wolves in the face.But I wouldn't recommend the game to anybody. It's very very bare bones, almost like a demo. If you can get a demo, give it a spin, it's really an experience you have to feel out to know if it's for you or not.			",118,57,0,39,7,2,8

												Nothing says lost potential like Lugaru HD. You can see traces of what this game could have been, but it is old, buggy and left a lot features out. Combat basically boils down to luck, so there is much frustration it what basically is a 3d fighting game. There is a reboot on the way with the name of Overgrowth which will cover a lot of the problems with this game. I'd say buy into the overgrowth alpha rather then buying this.

												Lugaru HD was very good. I wont lie. The combat was great and the parkour (more like free running) was ok. The only big issues with this game was the fact that the graphics are VERY outdated. there are quite a few glitches in the game, big lack of story, and it is VERY short. Also, if you are looking for real combat, dont go with this game. Yeah, i know i said the combat was great, but it is just not realistic. the controls are good though. If you are looking for something like this, get overgrowth. It is a great game and is much more recent. it is a little overpriced though :/			",124,24,0,10,9,2,10

												This is some kind of weird fighting game involving humanoid rabbits.  It's different at least.  I don't just mean the rabbit thing, but the genre is unlike anything I've seen.  You're a rabbit and you have to do multiple long fights (sort of like in Street Fighter) in an open 3d environment (like in Mario 64) against other beast/man hybrids.  At least I think that's what the game is like.  I never played it much.  I remember the graphics being pretty bad but it's an indie game and from a good few years ago.  At least they tried something different.Pwninator score: 3/10			",40,2,1,3,4,0,5

												Lugaru really grossed me out.It's a bunny martial arts game that starts by introducing you to a village, for the sole purpose of the emotional reaction of having those characters killed off by bandits offscreen. You pretty quickly run into bandits that remark on the fun they had with a cfamily member.I felt like it was a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ narrative arc to throw at a person and I have never loaded it up since. I'm hoping folk can learn about the scene before they encounter it. I really feel like some concepts shouldn't be thrown around willy nilly in media where folk are seeking entertainment and not cheap plot switches.			",140,76,2,53,18,0,57

												With HD in the title, I really expected Lugaru to look better.  Playing as a kung-fu rabbit didn’t really interest me, but then the poorly-written story and high difficulty of the campaign made me like it even less than I expected.  The tutorial teaches you 10 or so combo moves all at the same time, which for me meant I never really learned any of them.  It probably would have worked better to introduce them throughout the campaign, but it seemed more focused on the fighting engine than a game.			",857,380,26,121,102,9,190

												LOL. OK so once you figure it out the game it gets easier. Each opponent has only about 100HP at first. You can take out enemies in one hit sometimes. Once you use your knife you cut them down in seconds. I got stuck when I had to fight a wolf. It is a hard game and does appear to be based on skill...mostly. But without any tips on how to fight better, it feels like you are being cheated. It would just be nice if the tutorials (and some tips!) were attached to the gameplay instead of front-loaded. It is a lot to take in, and it doesn't really tell you how to be successful. This game is hardly worth $1. It functions more like a short unfinished prototype for a portfolio rather than a game. I can admire prototypes, but the current price tag is $10 which has got to be a joke.			",51,11,0,2,0,0,3

												Lugaru is one of the first games I acquired through the Humble Indie Bundle and I can honestly say one of the finest. This game has a very unique combat system. The controls take some getting used to but mastering them is a very rewarding experience. We've all played beat'em up type games but very few actually make you feel like a martial arts expert. Lugaru gives you one set of skills from the very beginning and then forces you to think and to strategize while you fight rather than just button-mash: a quality that is greatly appreciated and hard to find in gaming. +Unique Combat+Strategy and Stealth+Emotional Story -Glitchy At Times			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9
