												Twin Sector is a strange game. Not because it's bad, but because it's pretty underrated and pretty poorly done AT THE SAME TIME.I will try to explain it.The Story: I think that was actually a good point in this game. While i thought it was somewhat pretty generic, it had some hidden potential. But i really think the story is more conceptual than a thrilling exciting story. It follows the same pattern of Portal 1 (which i will be using as a main comparison for this game). But...Worse.The voice acting is bad. I mean, BAD. Look, i can't ask good voices on a indie game but, at least, couldn't they put a little of EMOTION? I mean, the voices looks like robotic. And not robotic like GLaDOS or something. The characters just doesn't have any trace of personality or anything that make us feel attached to them. Not even the main antagonist or the general that tries to help us. And guess what? We have been following the machine instructions when we shouldn't. We should fight the machine and escape from its rage. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. Story was a good point because i see they tried to do something here with things like only putting talented people to sleep for years and about what future the humanity will face, but i just couldn't be bothered remembering the characters nor the story. At all.Graphics: For an indie game, they are actually pretty well done. But since the texture variation is not present, you will see more white or grey rooms than anything (again, exactly like Portal). And i swear that i could see more focus on doing models like Turrets and ""the balls of death"" (as i call them) than anything else. And i have to admit that it's a bit strange when you look and see something is more textured than another. If feels a bit strange, but i can forgive that.Music: Non-existent. Aside from the game's menu music, there's no music. They tried to follow Portal and put you in a linear path with an narrator, with no song. But as i said, since the characters have no personality whatsoever, it just feels empty. And even Portal 1 had music often. This game just doesn't have AT ALL.Gameplay: Now, here's the big deal. The concept of Twin Sector is pretty simple: You have gloves that pull and throw. Pretty simple. You also have limited energy, so you have to make a fair use of your gloves to get through puzzles. In puzzles, you will have lasers, explosives, fire, turrets and etc. And that's where things gets pretty bad. This game is like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"" in 3D. You die from fall damage. You die if the ""death ball"" keeps touching you. You die from explosions if you are not too far away. And mostly important, YOU DIE FROM FALL DAMAGE. That was the worst thing they could've done to this game. Sometimes the falls are not THAT big and you die anyways. And that wouldn't be bad if the checkpoints weren't a mess. They're just too far away from one another. And there just like 3 or 4 checkpoints per stage. And that wouldn't be a problem if the design of the stages WEREN'T A HUGE PILE OF CLUSTER♥♥♥♥. Seriously. Dying in this game is WAY TOO EASY and FRUSTRATING. I can think why games like Binding Of Isaac or Super Meat Boy are frustrating too, but at least they are fun frustrating. This game is PAINFULLY FRUSTRATING.ANGRY. Angry is the definition of this. Your character is slow and it's easy to ♥♥♥♥ up. Puzzles are bad because the physics in this game is bad. 90% of times you will die because of bad physics. And the other 10% you will die from the enemies that had to be, like, the worst enemies ever. They kill you with 3 hits and only die with 3 hits too. Easy, right? WRONG! Hitting them with objects is painful. They have a ""recovery time"" and they recovery way too fast. And also, if you don't grab them in time to hit them a second time (which makes 6 total hits to kill them), you WILL get hit by them. They are just boring to fight and are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥most of the time. Mostly because there are times when they are ENDLESS. YES! They keep spawning again and again...Now, i think they wanted to give you a challenge. But then i ask: in Portal, did the turrets needed to be endless to make sure you die to them at least one time if you ♥♥♥♥ up? Couldn't them make the enemies like ""if you ♥♥♥♥ up and don't play the game in the right way, you lose""? Because, the enemies are just something YOU CAN'T WIN. It's frustrating and keeps you away from getting past a mission, and so, from progressing the game. I never finished Twin Sector because it's way too hard from the half of the game on. I just can't win. Really. I gave up. I finished Super Meat Boy 100% but can't do the same with this game. I just can't win it...But, remember: i said it's underrated and very unpolished. Why? Well. I liked how this game was supposed to work. The puzzles, enemies, and even the story. All of them could've worked better if they spent a bit more of time polishing it. It COULD'VE been a good game. But it just isn't.Now: I like challenges. And for me, Twin Sector is a good challenge. It's like playing Spelunky from SNES all over again. And for me, it feels great. I like raging. I like failing. It means that i'm not perfect. But i'm almost sure that almost no one is like me. Believe that.So, my final warning is: if you want to challenge yourself, buy this game.If you want to find a good puzzle with a medium challenge and a great community and stuff to do, buy Portal 2.

												Twin Sector is an Indie Portal wannabe that took the very few bad things from Portal and based a game on those, while throwing away all the good things from Portal.Twin Sector presents itself as a puzzle game, but it is not. The puzzles it offers are ludicrously easy to solve as an intellectual challenge, yet mindboggingly hard to pull off as far as physics are concerned. That is the fault of the way the game handles the physics, the slowness of the main character, the unresponsiveness of the game to input, and the fact that you have to be very precise in how long you press a mouse button without there being good feedback on that.Twin Sector is a death simulator. You die. A LOT. You die several times on each JUMP. You die several times when confronted by each of the numerous turrets and tracers. You die every time you encounter another laser field. You die even when you jump off a platform that is three meters above the floor. That would still not be too bad if the game had a good autosave system and quick loads, but it loads terribly slowly and its autosaves are rare. You have a quicksave (not a regular save, unfortunately), but you should be very careful in using it because it is surprisingly easy to maneuver yourself into a position from which the game is unsolvable.The voice acting is godawful, the animations are stiff, and the environments look like they were taken from a standard Unity library. The background story is not a bad idea to base a game on, but the background of the heroine is deploringly annoying (""Oh, Ashley, you are such a big hero, we all admire you so much."" Bluergh). Those elements are all acceptable if the gameplay is good. Unfortunately, it is not. Twin Sector is a frustrating mess.I cannot recommend Twin Sector. It is too bad, because a lot of effort of several reasonably talented people was invested in creating this game. However, none of these people seemed to have any insight in what makes a game fun. I played half of the game before giving up. I do not like to repeat over, and over, and OVER again section after section because I die constantly. If you have no problems with that and are not interested in puzzle solving anyway, you might like it, but there definitely are better things to play.			",205,125,1,56,43,3,46

												This game might get bad reviews, but I really enjoy it and just finished my 2nd play-through of the game.I think this illustrates that you shouldn't listen to reviews, and try games out for yourself if it looks interesting to you and/or an interesting setting/premise.Specifically some thing I like about the game:1) Setting and back story about the ""surface going to hell"" and humanity waiting it out in cryo tubes2) Texture work, for 2008 the graphics are pretty nice really imo. People also normally complain about this and it being bland, but I think it fits the feeling, setting, and mood of the game3) The voice acting, a lot of people give it crap, but I actually like it and think it makes things more believable since they sound like regular people not Hollywood heroes.4) The characters, I really like Ashley, Kevin, and Oscar are all very well doneSadly, preconceived notions probably ruin the game for many people, even if they give it a chance they are going into with the view that it will be a bad game, and then of course they self-fulfill that prophecy because of their negative attitude from the start...

												Twin Sector is a true work of art, sadly it is also a very, very well hidden gem. It is highly reminiscent of Penumbra and Portal in how it plays, with it's highly intricate puzzle design and excellent horror setting. You will spend many hours working to solve the puzzles, just so you can reach the end of the thrilling storyline. At this low price you would be doing yourself a disservice not buying this game. I give this game a 10/10 for leading the entire medium forward.I have even go so far as to provide you all with a personally recorded video supplement in case you find reading the review troublesome.

												If there was a title field, I'd to call the review ""Prepare to die.recurrent"".Despite some players considering this game a bad copy of Portal, it's not. You don't even have a portal gun! Well, definitely it's poor made. Looks like HL1 age game. With better textures.But.It's good game if You like puzzler FPS. This game lacks of balance, and the chance of Your death occurance converge to 1 while You being progress to ending. Mobs will kill You, traps will kill You, You will kill Yourself. So, prepare to die. Make sure You have enough of savepoints. (Maybe this cause of my hand growing from pelvis, but You a definitely 'god' if You can beat it w/o any death from the start.)Game for 'fans', and for people who know what and why they are doing.

												There's a reason this game only gets a 49 on the Metascore board. The controls are bad, the dialogue can break glass, the lack of continue points (until WAY later in the game) combined with long intervals between deaths, the annoyingly unforgiving short height in which you can fall to your death, and many other things made this game feel more like a chore to play than an enjoyable experience. To be honest, I'd rather do work because I'd at least get paid for that. The idea of the game was what enticed me to get it; 2 gloves that control the enviornment by either pushing or pulling stuff or yourself around. But the idea only goes so far and most of the time, doesn't even work properly. Seriously, a platformer game with fall damage. SERIOUSLY.			",65,3,0,9,18,0,2

Repetitive Puzzles3. Insane fall damage.(fall 7 feet and you will die)4. Dated Graphics5. Horrible Voice Acting. 6. Little to no instruction on how to play what so ever. They teach you movement and how to push/pull objects after that your on your own.7. Level design is horrible. Dozens of dead end corridors and you will walk up and down the same pointless damn U shaped hallways which serve no purpose other then to stall you for 30+ seconds about 4+ times every level.8. Constant Load Screens. 15+ second load screens everytime you die.9. Officially ran out of room to furrther state how horrible this game truly is.			",354,80,15,55,39,1,61

												It's copycat of ""Portal"" but not bad at all. It has a lot that resemble to Portal so if you feel like to play puzzle game this is what you are looking for.

												Definitely an interesting puzzle game. You have two gloves, one pulls objects to you, the other repels them. This sounds simple, and it pretty much is, but learning how to properly use the gloves takes some time. The difficulty of the puzzles increases over the course of the game, and by the end you'll be doing tricks that weren't readily apparent, but it never feels impossible. The pro's are the neat push-pull mechanic, the often well-designed puzzles, and the fact that some puzzles can be solved in different ways. The con's are that you'll die in seemingly arbitrary ways, the clunky combat, and a forgettable story (Think Glados without any of the charm).Had this developer had a large enough budget and enough staff, this game could have given Portal a run for its money. Unfortunately, this game doesn't reach its full potential, and I'm really sad that it didn't. It's fun, it's definitely an interesting idea for a game, but it just falls a bit short. I recommend this game on the basis that you don't go into it expecting something as great as Portal and that you're willing to accept dying often. If you're willing to be patient, this will be a fun way to spend a weekend, just keep your expectations in check.			",500,125,9,34,30,2,37

												Rough around the edges and wearing its portal inspiration a little too obviously on its chest this game replaces portals with the power to manipulate push and pull objects and excert physics forces on the world around you.The dialog is horrible and the low budget nature of the game shows however when the game is good it is good. The plot is ignorable and to be honest besides an AI called oscar i dont remember anything of it. The game shines through though with each sucessive level of the game introducing interesting puzzles and object manipulation potential which proved to keep me very entertained for my hours of play.I particularly enjoyed the puzzles combining object manipulation and enviromental traversal using the power to pull my self Towards objects or pushing my self in order to cancel the momentum of a fall.

												Holiday sale time and Twin Sector is one dollar. The generic looking title, tepid looking screenshots and low metactric score taunted me to play this to see just how bad it is...In the emerging genre of first-person-puzzlers enters Twin Sector. Sporting a 49 on metacritic, Twin Sector wishes it was Portal, but it's not.  Twin Sectors sins are numerous but chief among them is it's lack of inspiration. Filled with flat voice acting, second rate graphics and a theme that's about as generic as you can get Twin Sector  simply fails to motivate the player.  Twin Sector does pace the mechanics reasonably well but the actual gameplay is average as best. Twin Sector's metactric score is deserved(Also - this game crashed-to-desktop about  every 30 minutes)A dedicated few say they like this game, but for first-person puzzlers there are better options. Try the Portal games or Anti-Chamber.Score: 4/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												Managed to survive an hour of this game.Let's get the parts of the game out that I thought were ok:The graphics - while not state of the art, do not interfere with the game, and set a decent enough moodActually, that's about all of the game I think is ok.Now for the bad:Voice acting was terrible - computer was neither monotone enough to be a computer ai, nor was it interesting enough to be a normal person's voice. Main protagonist's voice was passable.Gameplay - ugh, where do I start? The most important part of a game in my opinion is the gameplay. The special powers you have are so integral to the game, but because they were performed so badly, I feel this alone kills the game. I can forgive bad voice acting, bad animations, shoddy sounds, but if the controls suck, even the most common parts of the gameplay suffer. Why should I have to wait for the glove to charge up when I took just as long to power it up in the first place? I gave this game an hour to get used to the controls, but I can't. I really can't play anymore. I play games for entertainment. A little bit of frustration is ok, but not an entire hour of fighting with the controls. I gave this another hour putting up with the controls, but enemies that spawn from nowhere and don't die/hard to kill?If you got this far, and still don't believe me, you are a sucker for punishment. Go ahead, buy it, play it, pull your hair out, throw that mouse into your monitor, then turn off the computer. Find that book you were meant to be reading, or that movie you bought and never watched yet. Are you feeling better yet?			",1569,695,73,134,55,17,121

												Riding on the heels of the portal and the half life games(you can pick up items), here we have a game called Twin Sector. Released in 2009, by german developer Dns, and I believe published by Head Up Games. This game has/had an interesting premise;The earth has fallen to apocalypse, and is not safe yet. You play the character of Ashley Simms, who had been awakend by an AI Overseer, named oscar. Apparently, you are the only human being who has been awakend, as all the other humans have been frozen? hmmmmm, intersting plot, I may add. Believe it or not, I got the game for 99 cents here on Steam. No kidding. I am at the half way point with this one. As I said earlier, this game rides on the heels of Portal and half life, as you can pick up many items in the game, but the game itself gets tedious, really fast. You wear energy gloves in the game, which can save your life by jumping from high places. In the first part of the game, I had to carefully jump onto some pipes, and then jump down using my energy glove at full max, so I would not die, and have to restart the game. There's many puzzles in this game, which is not a bad thing, and you will have to learn to get through them, at times with Oscars Help. The puzzles are ok, but those also can get tedious. Overall, this game as I said had premise, and potential, and while I kind of like it, I can't recommend it to anyone else. If you like these kind of games, then great, if not, there are better games to play. That's it.			",107,5,1,0,0,0,0

												I would not recommend this game. While the puzzles are mildly interesting, failure has too high of a price with few checkpoints and a surprising distance between them.Often times when trying to solve a particular part, some silly thing would kill me and I would be set back 5-10mins. This is only excacerbated by the crippled speed at which your character moves. This leads to a game that is a lesson in frustration and patience, which makes it feel less like a game and more like work.			",310,46,2,38,25,1,32

												Millennia ago, before the advent of Steam Greenlight or even user reviews, it was rare to find a title on the platform that was just outright bad. There was a small selection of underwhelming titles to be had, though, and Twin Sector could always be found circling the drain of that particular tub. I never knew why or even what it was really about, other than being a first-person puzzle game akin to Portal. A small part of me held out hope that it was just misunderstood or interestingly flawed (I foolishly hold this hope for all of Steam's Weeklong Deal underclass). Now that I've spent some time with it I understand exactly why it has the reputation it does, and why I can tell you to stay the hell away from it.Twin Sector casts you as Ashley Simms, a lumpy Poser vixen that just happens to be cool and good at everything, from professional sports to saving orphans. The six and a half minute cutscene the game opens with has her being fawned over by some future space military before being shipped off to cryosleep in a station orbiting Earth to wait out the end of global warming or whatever other MAN-MADE disaster boned the planet. She awakens face-first on the floor, suffering from plot amnesia that the station's gormless AI is happy to selectively fill her in on. The place is falling apart and she just happens to be up and about, so get ready to flip a lot of switches in inexplicable positions.""Gormless"", by the way, is an adjective that describes something ""lacking intelligence"" and also happens to be the perfect descriptor of this game. Twin Sector is ostensibly a puzzle game, equipping you with glowy space gloves that can push or pull things at a distance and expecting you to negotiate puzzle rooms with them. In practice this means three things: Force-jumping up to high ledges, cushioning long falls so falling damage doesn't kill you, and hucking barrels and garbage balls at switches. None of the halls or chambers of Twin Sector present much challenge in sussing out WHAT you have to do or HOW you have to do it, only in getting your stupid gloves to do what you HAVE to do. Puzzles tend to be little more than finding the hatch or pipe or switch you need to get to to proceed, sometimes requiring boxes to block deadly lasers or explosive barrels to break doors with.I really cannot overstate how dull and unengaging every aspect of Twin Sector is but by God I'm going to try. Every single one of the game's 17 levels is comprised entirely of featureless concrete or featureless metal, with the occasional pipe or fluorescent light to give any sense of immersion. Rooms make absolutely no sense as actual places, with elevator buttons stuck to 20-foot ceilings and computer consoles on ledges with no perceptible access. Your AI assistant guides you through these depthless halls like he's directing a kindergartner, devoid of any sort of identifiable personality. Ashley is no better, giving vacant responses to simple commands and facts. Your movement is slow, your powers are finicky, and the physics are going to be working against you for most of the game.There is no compelling reason to subject yourself to the vapid puzzles on display here. There's no compelling story to follow, no impressive designs to behold, no environments to marvel at, and no great puzzles to tax your brain. The only thing you'll get more of as you progress is frustration as the puzzles introduce more and more ways to kill you for not doing exactly what you have to do. It's all the more frustrating when the answers are apparent and the execution is what, well, executes you, and that's the case for almost every challenge. Twin Sector has certainly earned its reputation, managing to fail every possible test of quality that a fully-realized game can fail.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Twin Sector: Graphics are very Nice, Sounds are good and Music is So So. I found myself wanting to like this game but it is missing something and I'm not sure what that might be without playing it more. It does have a pretty female protagonist Ashley with a cool idea of Glove's that Push or Pull. That remind me of the Portal game's, the dialog was Bad and some of the fall's kill you when it should only hurt or hurt you a little bit. But hey it is a Five buck game that is kind of Fun, at time's. Now down to business I would give Twin Sector a 6 out of 10			",154,8,0,19,3,0,10

												You could probably tell from the trailer that the animations and voice acting are a bit dodgy, but maybe you thought that that could be charming at times, or that you could overlook it if the game was fun otherwise. At that point, you'd be close to making the same mistake I did. The short of it is, it's a nice idea, but the horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE controls ruin it completely and utterly. Unless you're into games where the solution to a puzzle is obvious in seconds, but you'll be wasting countless, endless minutes just fighting floaty, clunky controls, give this one a pass. I don't normally review games I didn't finish, but in this case, that'd be irresponsible. I mean, I don't know what's wrong with me, I always buy these flawed things like Hydrophobia and whatnot because I *want* to believe, but this is the worst one yet. Trust the reviews.

												This game is frustrating primarily because you can see the base of what COULD have been a very good game.  Unfortunately, it fails in execution at just about every step.  The main character doesn't feel fast or agile.  The gloves are an interesting mechanic, but charge slowly and thus lose a lot of dynamicism.  The levels are plain, sometimes make no sense, and can be quite frustrating even when you know how they're supposed to be solved.The animation quality of the cutscenes is incredibly stiff, and the voice acting has set a new standard for me in terms of how bad it can be, although the subtitles can be hilarious (some are badly translated, and I even spotted a ""u"" - as in, ""what are u doing"").  The story premise is actually something that interests me a great deal, but the antagonist's motives are never explained.  The end cinematic likewise makes no sense.About halfway through the game I just turned on the god-mode cheat and blasted my way through, which proved to be wise because the end level  was indescribably frustrating even WITH the cheats.

												While the trailer may make it seem interesting, this game falls VERY short. The collision is bad, the gameplay mechanics are worse, and the puzzles are boring, they're either super easy, or stupidly difficult. Controlling this game is like walking through tar and sitting in the sun, you are very slow, crouching sucks, and you die from falling 4 ft. And by the way, checkpoints are VERY rare, which means if you mess up barely, it's back to 6 minutes ago potentially.The only thing that partially redeemed this game are it's graphics. Clearly the developers thought to spend mroe time on the graphics than the gameplay. The voice acting in this is also terrible, and can take you out of it instantly. I do not reccomend this game at all. It's a disgrace to the puzzle genre.			",325,99,3,30,33,3,19

												This game is like a reverse Portal where you manipulate the environment by pushing and pulling objects and yourself. The story is sparse and the voice acting is weak but the character is smoking hot so what more reason do you need to save her? The puzzles are much more difficult than Portal and the enemies are definatly something you won't find in any other games. I think it's a steal at $5.			",206,85,0,41,17,1,29

												This game isnt exactly crap, but it isnt very good either. Very Portalike and very tedious in tasking.  Would  i recommend it, only on discount as something to kill time on. Graphics are crap though the main chick is rather hot. Mechanics are iffy considering the game is based around her gravity gloves. Sound is fine, though its really not atmosphere, just the girl and the Ai talking back and forth like shes a complete idiot and he is an amatuer Spark(Destiny). Fun Factor: Depends on your level of aggravated annoyance and patience for retrieval and obstacles. Only have to play the first part to know the layout, repetitive. Get it for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles or pass on it,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the first 10 or so levels are okay they provide chalenge. the later levels tend to vear away from the puzle element and have more platformer feel.with the last level being a suspence action theme and a chalenge that frankly put it beyond my skill.While the plot was decent I felt it needed more rounding out, and the voice overs could used more expressive direction. Ultimatly they reveal everything at the last second and gear up for a sequel that I feel should be included in this game as it is integral to the plot and may be a renewing element. The story over all is bland. but the concept is solid in both story and game mechanicI personally feel this just needs a lot of polish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is... interesting. While the concept is kinda neat, the gravitaional gloves and all, that is the only real neat thing about it. The animation is stiff and disjointed which is the only real thing one must worry about in animation because if you have that down, then you could get away with anything otherwise. It tries to be realistic which holds it back terribly. The puzzles were fairly decent, but you may end up doing them over again a few times because many rely on luck rather than skill. Course, there's the story. People frozen for years? Okay. One woken up to fix things? I can get behind that. Totally lame plot twist? Wait a minute... Hilariously bad plot twist at the end leaving room for a sequel? Quit it. It's all only worse due to the incredibly bad voice acting of the main character.Basically, if you have extra cash and you've made sure you've already played every other game on steam, go ahead and pick this up. But I suggest you just pass it by.			",51,12,0,14,5,2,27

												This game is bad. Maybe not on purpose, but, there are many things that could and should have been better.Graphics: The hundreds of gray, metal corridors aside, the game doesn't look terrible. The character models on the other hand are all robot-stiff and the cinematics look like they were made over 20 years ago.Gameplay: You will be fighting the horrid physics more than the puzzles in every corridor, most of which can be cheated/skipped/worked around due to the previously mentioned HORRID physics system. The controls are frustrating and can't be changed.Audio: Audio? What audio? Oh, that! Yeah, there's a hugely loud dull hum consistently throughout the whole game. The voice acting is bad. Specifically because it sounds like the three people are just reading a page and using absolutely zero emotion/effort. I think there's a song or two in the menus, that's about the only redeeming quality.+ Some of the puzzles are interesting+ What little (back)story there is, is mildly interesting if completely unoriginal- Everything from the puzzles, the story, gameplay and just about everything else is executed so poorly that it muddies what could have been a neat indie Portal-clone.TL;DR: I bought this out of curiosity (the gloves reminded me of a much better game, Q.U.B.E.) and because it was a dollar but I wouldn't recommend you pay any more than that. Even so cheap I find it hard to recommend the game. Though, if you're like me and must touch the hot stove for yourself, at least don't pay full price.			",308,43,8,23,15,5,21

												PROS:This game combines some good physics ideas (although poorly executed). CONS: • This game looks horrible. • Plays horribly • Voice acting is so bad takes you far from the story andf makes the game very hard to get into. • The story itself id pretty bad also.REVIEW:I was only able to play this game for around 20 minutes as it is so badly made. It seems that every post-Portal physics-based strategy game is the same: there is a few cool physics elements which make the game look interesting, however the game(s) always fall far below the standard that Portal/Portal 2 have given us. To some up If you think this game would appeal to you by all means try it however you are probably better off buying Portal or Portal 2; if you have already tried these there are a few Community-made Portal mods that might appeal to you such as ""Thinking with Time Machine"" and ""Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun testing initiative"", the latter of which I haven't yet played (but it looks pretty good).I would not recommend buying this game, not even if it's on sale.

												This game could have been better.  It's frustrating that it did not fulfill its potential.The good: - nice 3D- interesting puzzlesThe bad:- humorless- boss drones that are nearly invincible.  I got killed a lot by the drones.  Maybe players who are quicker, have better hands, and a faster system would fare better.  Defending against the drones was way too hard and ruined the game for me.- you can die from low falls.  - mediocre physics: not bad enough to hinder you but it's distracting and it breaks the immersion when objects don't behave realistically.I would only recommend this if you can get it cheap and the above shortcomings don't bother you too much.

												Twin Sector is a fascinating title. Many would be quick to compare it to the Portal series, and I can understand why. The premise is you being stuck in a facility with an AI buddy navigating you through puzzles, while you make use of a dual functioned device. However, the more I played Twin Sector, I increasingly found that most comparisons between Twin Sector and Portal are merely ignorant, pointing out only very slim similarities, while ignoring the bigger picture.Twin Sector is really a game about isolation, delving into the mind of a woman thrown into a strange, cold world that does not look inhabitable whatsoever. All the while, she is being bossed around by disembodied male voices, bossing her around but without having any warmth or liveliness to them. In a world where she is the only person, she has to solve all of the problems in the facility. But... do these problems even exist? The only evidence of their existence is the robotic men who speak to her through the intercoms. For all we, the player, know, these issues may not even be real, and they may be lying to her, to exploit her and to display power over her. This is where Twin Sector shines. Just the dilemma that it presents, the horror of the situation, is enough to set it apart from Valve's shoddy competitor.			",42,8,1,5,3,2,2

												Tell me if this game sounds familiar: a young woman wakes up in a futuristic environment, a maze of corridors and chambers. As an AI offers unhelpful advice, she must escape through the use of a physics-powered tool featuring red and blue effects. It's Portal, right? Except this game doesn't have half the charm and humor of that seminal title. Twin Sector is an extremely bad copy and even the excuse of it being an ""indie"" game can't excuse its poor quality. From its  level graphics that look on a par with the original Quake, to its terrible voice-acting,  twitchy physics and sluggish controls, the puzzle-solving is an unenjoyable chore. There's nothing to redeem it; the gameplay is sloppy, the graphics are terrible and there's nothing new about it. It's a bad game all around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I lack the patience to retry after the fifth time I died because I misjudged the perfect position to aim the attractor glove.There seems to be no save system, so you get checkpoints.And while her face is cute, I don't really want to see it for half a minute every 10 seconds because I'm unable to pinpoint the perfect spot to jump or aim.What do you know, there IS a way to save. Quicksave/Load only, though. So if you look in the main menu for an entry ""save/load"" you won't find it, but the keys(F5/F9) are listed in the settings.Doesn't make the loading time any less annoying, though. Or the re-trying things endlessly.Makes it easier to try again from the same spot, though.It looked interesting enough, so if you can get it cheap - go for it.Note: german audio seems to be better than english - somehow the english voices don't fit the characters, IMO.

												Twin Sector is a first-person puzzle where you have ""force push"" and ""force pull"" powers, and you had to make your way throughout this ""colony"" while combating an unseen menace after having been awakened from cryosleep. The puzzles are somewhat interesting, but many have serious time limits, as well as requiring good coordination (and avoiding ""enemies!"") By chapter 5 or 6 the game gets very frustrating as you need to go around enemies, and the final battle is f***ing impossible to survive. This game is just not quite balanced for prolonged play, and best serves as a ""novelty game"".			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

Quick save keep frustration level at a minimum.Option Menu: Very limited on video and audio.Recommend Buying Price: $5 or lower for general public. $7.50 or lower for puzzle lovers.---It's not a bad game. A 1st person platform puzzler game similar to Portal but use gravity glove (gravity gun from Half Life 2) to help platforming and solve puzzles. Puzzles aren't hard. On a scale of 10, 1 being the easiest and 10 the hardest. The puzzles are rank 5 and below. No puzzles are at expert or master level. If you can beat Portal you will have no problem with Twin Sector. Platforming isn't difficult. There is no racing, timing, or trick jumps. It's straight forward. There are a lot of platforming in the game.You will die a lot in Twin Sector. Deaths comes from bad jumps, falls, lasers, sentry bots, fire, explosions, and turrets. Frustration in the game can be kept to a minimum using quick save. Quick Save and Quick Load is your friend in Twin Sector.The plot is similar to Portal. A crazy AI wants to kill you. It first befriend you than later on want to rip your guts out. Voice acting for the crazy AI is pretty bad. Voice acting for rest of the casts is decent.			",2670,1143,99,304,381,29,449

												This dull physics-based puzzle game is neither charming nor exciting, and most importantly, it isn't fun.Twin Sector suffers from a lot of problems such as wonky game play mechanics, questionable physics and terrible voice acting, terrible story and level design.As you have probably guessed by now, I don't care for Twin Sector. And I think I'm even more aggravated because, at its heart, the game actually does have quite a bit of potential.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												An interesting physics puzzler. You have two gloves, an attractor and a repeller. You have to balance use of the two gloves to move yourself and other objects through the game world.The level design is bland, the voice acting is stilted, and the story can be somewhat trite. However, the game was still enjoyable enough to play till the end. The final battle is absurdly unfair and I gave up & just watched someone else on youtube.Overall, an okay game.

												This game could have been decent, but there are so many things holding it back.  The overall game mechanic really isn't interesting enough to keep my interest long term.  You spend about 10% of your time figuring out how to solve an area, and then 90% of your time battling the physics engine to get everything in place.  On top of that they put enemies in the game.  These are giant balls that follow you around and bump you.  So while you are battling the physics engine, you are simultaneously playing bumping cars with floating balls.  Also, there's falling damage, and if for some reason your timing is off on one of your gloves, you very likely will die.  Be prepared for lots of quick saves and quick loads.  The quick loads aren't exactly ""quick"" either.  With a non SSD expect to spend a lot of time looking at a portrait of the female protragonist while you wait to do some more trial and error.

												A waste of four perfectly good pounds. The cutscenes are visually pretty but the voice acting is horrible. The gameplay is hideous. You can't remap keys, so the game doesn't work properly without a wheel mouse. There is no save function. When you die you go back to the last fiddly little puzzle you already solved. The main mechanic of lifting stuff with rechargeable telepathic gloves is maddening. For instance: pull a crate towards you, you now have no energy left to grab it. Lame. I'm pretty patient when it comes to games but this made me quit after forty-five minutes. Thank god it was cheap so I didn't waste too much money on this complete turkey.			",140,28,0,10,13,0,14

You are unable to reassign mouse buttons.Instead of being able to save your game there are checkpoints. You made one little screw up? You have to start from the last checkpoint.Voice acting is pretty weak. When characters talk I envision people standing in front of microphones reading scripts. Kinda breaks the fourth wall.

												A lacklustre attempt at a profound first-person puzzler, the game falls apart on controls, puzzles and getting you to care about finishing the damn level. By the time you've been through four or five puzzles you will likely have no further desire to complete the game or even play the game.The puzzles are interesting but hardly fun. It's so easy to make fatal mistakes, given the controls, the unforgiving fall mechanics, and the lasers. Frustration will be your constant companion, as the consequences of failure make you repeat already frustrating tasks, only with the added impetus that you Must Not Screw Up. Else you will have to do it All Over Again.The plot, on its surface, seems compelling (and partially motivated my purchase of the game), but once you dig past that surface it's just bland, banal, and uncompelling. Many plot elements are stock-standard with absolutely no sense of inspiration or even wit. The plot utterly fails to compel you to complete the game, and the characters are nothing to write home about. Certainly they are not companions that you would draw you to spend more time with them. They don't repel, but they also don't inspire any kind of attachment to them at all.With frustration, uncompelling gameplay, and a lacklustre plot all failing to motivate a person to play on, I strongly caution any person against buying this game at anything but the most discounted price. Even at a discount, I'd recommend you not even bother. A waste of time unless you want to see how these developers screwed up first-hand.			",407,121,3,76,114,3,132

												What is a cool concept, namely the manipulation of yourself, and not the environment (as it is the case in other games), is ruined by several flaws. You are the single awake person, after the few survivors of the human species have been put to cryo-sleep. You awake to the voice of a security programm that starts to guide you to save the other survivors from a catastrophe that is about to occur. A glove allows you to pull yourself towards the environment ,or to throw objects, or push yourself away from environments. While all of this sounds cool in theory, the relatively interesting story was ruined for me by the horrid voice-acting. The graphics are functional but not really interesting or varied and have a fairly low resolution, the field of view is extremely narrow. It'd be fun to mess around with the glove, but as soon as you fall from a tad too high, you simply die and the game restarts you at the last checkpoint. This can mean that you have to replay the same section of the game over and over because there is such limited space for mistakes. It'd be cool if the interesting idea of pushing and pulling yourself around the environments was supported by gameplay that'd allow you to do this in quick sucession and to fall from high places. Of course this would mean the level design would've to be very different to still provide a challenge and be interesting to navigate.All in all, I can see the potential of a game like this - the adaptation is too fundemantally flawed to be any fun for me though.

												Lets get this out of the way: It's not a Portal clone. Similar kind of first-person puzzler, but it's not Portal. I really wanted to like Twin Sector. I'd swallow the budget feel and the terrifying facial animations and just enjoy the puzzling.I tried, I really did, but eventually it wore me down. The physics were wonky, the puzzles unintuitive, and failure was frustrating. In a word, it was a grating experience. Not worth your time or money.			",455,119,14,67,34,5,92

												Pleasantly surprised by this $1 sale game from 2009. It has its flaws, and some can be easily enough written off as difficulty points. The voiced cutscenes and dialogue between Ashley and the computer are a bit dry at times, while altogether palletable.  Now, some of the puzzes in this game are rather unintuitive. I feel that well designed puzzles generally aren't intuitive and cause the solver to dive into some deeper analysis, which this game does rather well.			",140,27,3,19,12,2,8

												- Controls feel sluggish, as if walking through molasses. This is amplified by the footstep sounds the devs chose - big fat stompy boots. Walking backwards is like half the speed of walking forward. Mind, this character is supposed to be a trained athlete.- The cutscenes are terribly long-winded and drawn out. Especially during the tutorial, the computer keeps taking control away from you to tell you what is actually completely obvious in sight. Even afterwards, the computer keeps talking to you as if you were a child with special needs, and I don't mean in an AI-with-an-attitude-like manner.- The physics are dodgy - objects sometimes bounce around as if they weighed nothing, were made from rubber AND had no air resistance whatsoever.- Falling threat, the immediate experience how dangerous your current fall is, is nonexistent. There is not enough feedback (cam shake, wind noise) to give proper impression on your fall, so you die, die and die.- All sounds and voice-overs are completely void of reverb. At no point in the game (read: the half hour or so I managed to hold out playing this turd) does the sound of voices and noises match the room they happen in. Even a large metal corridor will make the same impression as a sound-proofed cell.- The glove mechanics is pointlessly slowed. There is absolutely no reason for the ""recharge time"" other than to draw this game into a tedious crawl.- Loading times. With the low quality of graphical assets, resetting to checkpoints should take the blink of an eye, especially from an SSD, but instead one waits for what seems like the regrowing of an eye ... absolutely abyssmal.All of the flaws above could have been fixed with proper game testing which would have made a cool game even with the low-budget mocap or intro cutscene or texture quality.Sorry, but this game sucks salty monkey balls, and you don't even get to marvel at Ashley's butt.

												I had hopes with the intriguing premise, but tons of bugs (or simply poor design) completely destroys the imersion.  Once that's done, you realize there really isn't that much here to begin with.The key problem is the game's interface.  Controls are slow, imprecise, and laggy as all hell.  Given how often the game is designed to require good timing, fast reactions, and careful item placement, this is a huge strike against it.  I'm not sure if this is just poor design or horrible quality control - when I first started the game up I wasn't even able to move due to being spawned inside the floor, and even though they've fixed this the entire screen is constantly shaking (except, occasionally, when I jump and it snaps into stability) and there's a persistent damage indicator on the screen flickering on and off with varying levels of intensity.  Unfortunately even if this were patched, it would not be enough to make Twin Sector a good or even passable game.  Frankly if you were to fix the controls, get the screen to stop shaking like my character is having a constant seizure, and speed up the response, you'd be left with a series of puzzles that are disturbingly easy.  All of the difficulty in the design comes from the fact that you're fighting against the controls, and this frankly is not acceptable these days.As for the visuals and atmosphere, I was left sadly unimpressed.  Environments are blocky and I'm pretty sure frequently using textures ripped straight from Half Life 2, with nonsensical machinery designs that seem to mock the very idea of immersion.  It's obvious that Portal's influence is showing here in the level design, but sadly the devs didn't seem to realize that a key reason that the whimsical insanity in Portal worked was because it was in an environment intended to be a puzzle, and nothing else.  Once you left the testing chambers, the world was almost disquietingly normal.Unfortunately there is no such conceit in Twin Sector.  This is the real world - a real world where apparently engineers felt you should design a life support generator with a computer console you can only get to if you walk up three flights of stairs, turn off 2 superflous lasers on a catwalk that seems to serve no purpose whatsoever, and then jump 20 feet straight into an open topped cage over the generator's core.  The best part was that once this was done the floor dropped out of said cage so as to let you back out into the room - making that sole console completely inaccessible.  Just a little bit of creative set design here could have fixed this.  Sprinkle in a few broken consoles, dress up the lasers a bit more to make them look like they're actually part of the reactor rather than just arbitrary obstacles, and you actually start forming a cohesive, functional world for this story to be told in.  The makers of Twin Sector obviously either didn't know how, or simply didn't care to put in the effort.			",137,74,0,31,16,4,19

												Twin Sector was a fun game. However, if one were to purchase the game here are some things to know.The game isnt as bad as many people have made it out to be. The story is interesting and the voice acting is indeed terrible, but the gameplay is fun. The levels all take place in a specific area not unlike Portal and the player uses left and rightclick to pull and push objects with gravity generating gloves. Also, the player can crouch and jump as well as pick up an object without applying force to it which could be better than having to pull or push. Walking instead of running can be utilized against turrets and allow the player to control their sound. One IMPORTANT thing to note is the player can QUICKSAVE or QUICKLOAD which is very useful if you die and do not want to start from the last checkpoint.Using a combination of the enviroment and mechanics from many enemies including: motion sensitive turrets, homing bombs, floating orbs of doom, lasers, and much more the player can overcome obstacles and progress the story. Small tactics like using barrels to block lasers or throwing an object to hit a button become key to passing obstacles or solving puzzles. Some puzzles even have multiple solutions. The difficulty can be anywhere from easy to ridiculous depending on progress into the game. Overall I was impressed and enjoyed getting turrets to fire at each other and strafing with canisters to shield myself from lasers. The final boss was a challenge as well.Why has this game had so many bad reviews? First off, I dont believe the game was meant to run in fullscreen mode. The screen flickered madly and I had to edit a specific file to return it to windowed again. Secondly, the voice acting is terrible! I could somewhat understand the emotionless voice of Oscar (I kind of liked it actually) but Ashley's voice did not fit at all. I couldn't give an example but once heard you do not want to hear it again. It is too cutesy and princess-like. Unfortunately, I had to listen to it all game. The cutscenes were a good length, short and sweet. They were not very interesting though. Also, I would like to mention the enviroment. Half the game the player is navigating through a dump, literally. Personally I do not mind a game that has metal interior walls the whole time but I can see it being annoying for other players. Another thing to point out- the game is ambient with little soundtrack. This allowed me to hear what was going on beyond walls, such as approaching enemies, but it may be annoying to hear silence in the background for some players.  In the end, I would not recommend this game to another. It was fun and challenging. It had a story that made me keep playing and wanting to know what happened next. Also, the game has good graphics and I enjoyed the physics. If you are looking for some challenging puzzles based around fun mechanics then this game is for you. Just endure the voices and short-length. Also don't expect an explosive ending and DO NOT put the game in FULLSCREEN.			",79,6,0,7,2,1,8
