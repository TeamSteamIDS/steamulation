The thing is, it's quite bugged and if you dont tweak the graphic settings you'll get a blurred image..Also, change the damn FOV, and remove things like motion blur! and ignore the ironsights!

												Basically an expansion set disguised a sequal.  This game offers 10 more levels, some new weapons, and some vehicle sections where you get to use a tank and a plane.  But that's it.  Other then that it's just the same as the first game, with an even weaker story and much less interesting main character.Thankfully the first game was so good that a copy of it with the above mentioned features is still worthwhile, but dont' expect this game to be any more then what it is:  A small extention of the previous one.

												A prequel presenting the story from the Jans, the German veteran soldier who is the archnemesis for the first part of Necromancer. More or less same graphics, same setting, same gameplay.However, I found this prequel more entertaining than the original one: fewer bugs, better performance, interesting level design and more variety.Pros:1) WWI setting with fantasy/horror twist2) interesting level design, variety in enemies3) multiple weapons + shadowhand + control of tank / biplane4) better atmosphere than the first one5) less bugs better performance (at least for me) than the original6) historical accuracy in weapons etc as of WWI7) more emphasis in WWI setting than the vampire/demon place8) interesting idea to revisit known places from another perspective in the last three chaptersCons:1) short duration, about 40-50% less than the original one2) game has aged and it clearly shows3) bugs still exist4) if you did not like at all the first one, this will not change your opinion I did not reccomend the original Necromancer, but I think the prequel is an improvenment. Buy when at discount.			",609,272,14,86,47,5,125

												Necrovision: Lost Company isn't a well-crafted game. It's flawed, riddled with annoying bugs and weirdly implemented gameplay systems and yet I enjoyed its 6 hour long campaign (Steam didn't keep track of my whole playtime). It feels like a B-movie and has its own charme.You are playing as Jonas Zimmermann, a German scientist who is apparently really old (as NPC often mock him because of his age), trying to get to Fort Stern to find a cure for the undead who are roaming through the battlefields of WW1. Oh and vampires or something... the story has no depth at all and that's not what I expected of Lost Company to begin with. You can find letters of fallen soldiers along the way. For some reason, the narrations of these letters will continue to play even after putting them away, which is quite annoying. The voice acting is terrible but fits the game perfectly, I adore the silly battlecrys of the undead and NPCs in particular.Necrovision: Lost Company is running on the Pain Engine and it shows. The game runs fine but the graphics are quite ugly. The original Painkiller from 2004 manages to look considerably better than this game. Body models look blocky and lifeless, texture quality ranges from barely acceptable to crap and animations look really unnatural, which on the other hand benefits the enemies. I really like their designs, especially those barb-wired zombies running on stumps, creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Sound design is decent at best. You can understand what everyone is saying and the weapons sound powerful. The soundtrack is very well composed and some tracks stuck with me for a while.The game features elements from modern shooters (such as regenerating health) but plays more like Serious Sam or Painkiller, albeit with a slower pace than those. Gunplay feels satisfying for the most part but the way weapons are handled in this game is mind boggling. You see, Zimmermann acquires an absurdely large arsenal of firearms on his way to Fort Stern and some of these are simply not needed. Why am I carrying a BAR when I already have a MP that is just as useful? Why do I need to carry 3-4 Gewehr 98 rifles (standard, grenade launcher, scope, bayonet) when I could simply have one with all these attachments? Why have a normal MG and the same one with a flamethrower? It makes switching weapons really cumbersome. Same with melee weapons. I maybe used 2 or 3 grenades during my playthrough because switching to them is unintuitive. Necrovision: Lost Company is a fairly easy game on normal difficulty since your character tanks through damage like a champ. It isn't necessarily a bad thing since you're not forced to take cover, thus keeping the pace up. You can also level up your ""Fury"" level, either by finding secret vampire artifcats or performing combos on enemies. I only found it useful when using the MP, since headshots would make me perform reloads much quicker and it would also stun enemies nearby.Despite all the issues I had with the game, it was worth the purchase. I suggest picking Necrovision: Lost Company up when it goes on sale.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Necrovision: Lost Company ist kein Meisterwerk. Während meines Playthroughs bin ich auf zahlreiche Bugs gestossen und musste mich mit einigen fragwürdingen Gameplayelementen rumschlagen und dennoch habe ich die 6-stündige Kampagne genossen (Meine Spielzeit laut Steam stimmt nicht). Es fühlt sich wie ein B-Movie an und versprüht seinen ganz eigenen Charme. Man schlüpft in die Rolle von Jonas Zimmermann, einem deutschen Wissenschaftler der schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat (wodurch er öfters von NPCs auf die Schippe genommen wird) und sich zum Fort Stern aufmacht um ein Heilmittel für die Untoten zu finden, die die Schlachtfelder des 1. Weltkrieges unsicher machen. Oh, und noch etwas mit Vampiren oder so... die Geschichte besitzt keinerlei Tiefgang, habe dies aber von Lost Company nicht erwartet. In den Levels ist es möglich, Briefe von gefallenen Soldaten zu lesen. Allerdings hört die Vertonung dieser nicht auf, sobald man die Briefe weglegt, was zeimlich nervig ist. Das Voiceacting ist eine Katastrophe aber passt zum Spiel. Besonders gut gefallen mir die unsinnigen Kampfrufe der Untoten und NPCs.Necrovision: Lost Company läuft auf der Pain Engine und das zeigt sich bemerkbar. Das Spiel läuft zwar flüssig, sieht aber sogar im Vergleich mit Painkiller aus dem Jahre 2004 schlechter aus. Körpermodellen sehen blockig und leblos aus, Texturqualität pendelt zwischen gerade noch akzeptabel bishin zu Augenkrebs und Animationen sehen sehr unnaturell aus, was aber den gegnern zu Gute kommt. Ich mag deren Designs, mein Favorit ist der von Stacheldraht umwobene Zombie, welcher einem  auf blutigen Stummeln zurennt. Gruselig, der ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Sounddesign geht in Ordnung, Gespräche sind gut hörbar und die Waffen klingen gewaltig. Der Soundtrack gefällt mir sehr gut und einige der Titel blieben mir noch lange nach Beenden des Spieles im Gedächtnis.Auch wenn das Spiel sich im ersten Blick eher auf die Spielprinzipien von modernen FPS aufbaut (z.B. Healthregeneration) spielt es sich eher wie ein langsameres Serious Sam oder Painkiller. Das Gunplay fühlt sich meistens sehr gut an, jedoch kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, warum das Waffensystem in diesem Spiel so schlecht ist. Während seines Trips nach For Stern eignet sich Zimmermann ein absurd riesiges Arsenal an Feuerwaffen an und einige dieser Feuerwaffen werden nicht gebraucht. Warum trage ich eine BAR mit mir rum, wenn ich schon eine MP habe, die genauso gut ist? Warum besitze ich 3 bis 4 unterschiedliche Gewehr 98 (ohne Ausatz, Granatenwerfer, Zielfernrohr, Bajonett) wenn eines mit allen Aufsätzen ausreichen würde? Warum ein normales MG mitschleppen, wenn sich dasselbe mit einem Flammenwerferaufsatz in meinem Waffeninventar wiederfindet? Das Auswählen der für die Situation erforderlichen Waffe verkommt zu einem Geduldsspiel. Dasselbe Problem findet man bei den Nahkampfwaffen. Ich habe während meines Playthroughs höchstens 2 bis 3 Granaten benutzt, weil das Wechseln zu diesen nicht intuitiv ist. Necrovision: Lost Company ist ein relativ leichtes Spiel auf normaler Schwierigkeitsstufe, da der Hauptcharakter einiges an Schaden wegstecken kann. Dies ist nicht unbedingt was Schlechtes, da man dadurch nicht gezwungen wird, hinter Schutzwallen zu verharren, was dem Spielfluss zu Gute kommt. Letzendlich kann man auch seinen ""Wut""-Level erhöhen, in dem man Vampirartifakte findet oder Combos an Gegnern ausführt. Genützt hat es mir nur im Zusammenspiel mit der MP, da Kopfschüsse mich mit einem schnelleren Magazinwechseln belohnt haben und nahestehende Gegner betäubt wurden.Trotz den Problemen, die ich mit dem Spiel hatte, hat sich der Kauf gelohnt. Ich empfehle euch, das Spiel bei einem Sale zu holen.			",212,7,2,1,6,1,3

												Not even finished with the first level, but I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys trying to break a game throught glitches. Something I figured out in the first thirty minues was that the character bounces off of boxes and other stuff in-game. This can be easily manipulated with running and jumping to send the character flying. Its really fun to do in open areas and get outside the level. I spent an hour trying to jump over things and get places I shouldn't be. The gameplay is decent and the graphics are nice, but I recommend to mess with the physics if you are patient enough.

												More polished than the first NecroVision. It starts strong, but then drowns in a routine. Always too many allied AIs helping the player. But it was overall very enjoyabled, more of the same but since NecroVision was already good.... A few new enemies (Werewolves) and a few new weapons (Spiked club, Flamethrower).My main grief is that when it starts to be good (finally the Vampire/Underground part), it's already the end!So to sum up, it's not a must-have, just an extra adventure for those who enjoyed NecroVision and want a bit more. It's a shame it was not more ambitious.			",298,94,0,14,14,0,29

												(Note: I put closer to seven hours into the game, most of it was offline and was not recorded.)Necrovision is so bad it's good. Necrovision: Lost Company is the same thing, except it's late to the party and the joke hangs in the air like a wet fart in a sauna. It's buggy- really buggy. Animations, sounds, the fact that your American escort will spontaneously start shouting in German as soon as he starts shooting at things, it's all there. New from the original, you spend probably 80% of the game running around with at least one invulnerable mook to watch your back; good or bad, the interpretation is up to you.Y'get a flare gun and a flamethrower machine gun as your new weapons- the former is useless, the latter can mop up everything with just a tuft of liquid conflagration.There's a tank level and an airplane level. Considering the previous one had a mother-loving dragon level, I'm not particularly impressed.To put it simply- if you played Necrovision, don't play Lost Company unless you really enjoy the flaws of the series and you're willing to put another eight hours of your life through them. All the ham, grit, hilarity, and horror of the first are replaced with recycled or vacant memories of either, and there's only enough exposition to barely fill the gaps in the previous one without enhancing it at all.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hate myself a little bit for ragequitting the final boss on the highest difficulty. I like a challenge almost to the point of masochism, but I'd have more fun drinking my own tears than gargling that can of nails.			",175,30,0,23,7,0,24

												While somewhat more cohesive than the original Necrovision, this expansion/prequel has the same problems of the original game (bad aim, bad hitboxes, enemies clipping through player, englishman yelling in german etc) it tops it with an OS-crashing bug that happens if you die on the tank level - script error happens that crashes the game, Steam, and Windows as well. (to prevent it, either don't die with the tank or use ~(tilde), then""nvngod"" for invulnerability to prevent nasty surprises)the game is considerably shorter, 10 chapters where multiple ones take less than half an hour to finish.I can only just repeat myself, based on the original game as well - don't force yourself to play this unless you're sure that you can take a weird/bad story game with bad voiceacting that's weak in the technical department.  Though keep your eyes open, because if a proper remake/reboot would happen, it would have serious potential, as the idea is great, but the implementation is lukewarm at it's best.

												I'm not saying that I don't agree with those that won't recomend it. they are true in most parts.(A solution for the crashing is that you go into the settings in steam, go then to 'IN-GAME' and turn off steam overley that will probably do something about the crashing)Anyways. I'm going to recomend this game, becuse the gameplay is pretty funny, and it doesn't get boring doing the time you play it. And I actually quit liked it, may be hard at some points but that makes it more interresting.If the game is on sale for cheap, I'd recomend it.

												Like its predecessor, ""NecroVisioN: Lost Company"" is comparable to a monster truck rally... with actual monsters. It's loud, obnoxious, brainless, but you knew that when you paid admission. Much shorter than the original NecroVisioN, this game puts you in the boots of the original game's secondary antagonist. The novelty of playing as a weary veteran of the Kaiser's army wears off fairly quickly, though, because (in true NecroVisioN style) the voice acting is laughably horrendous. There are a handful of new weapons, some new enemies, two pilotable vehicles and a cameo by old Blood-and-Guts himself, George S. Patton. However this isn't enough to downplay the fact that this game is a lukewarm rehash of an interesting concept that was shoddily executed the first time around.			",41,3,0,4,1,0,0

												This is a pretty short game, and not very good at all. It's also pretty buggy. I experienced a bug where whenever i got shot, my screen would become blurry, and would not go back to normal until the level was compleated. I dont recommend that you buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Legal o jogo. Joguei até o final e achei muito bom. Tem seus bugs, mas qual jogo não tem? Só que usa muita coisa do outro  revisitando alguns mapas do anterior - o que é legal - e usando as mesmas músicas também - o que não achei legal. As novas armas são legais também como a pistolinha sinalizadora e metralhadora mais potente. É mais curto que o outro. Assim como o primeiro tem partes de simulação de transporte como a fase de pilotar o teco-teco e dirigir o tanque. Chefes e inimigos legais também, como o lobisomem e a enfermeira. E a história é interessante porque a gente joga com o cientista que ao decorrer do jogo vai ficando cada vez mais maléfico depois de absorver o poder da semente do mal. E isso explica a árdua batalha que tivemos contra ele no anterior - Adiciona algumas coisinhas de novidade e mantém o bom resto com o mesmo ritmo, e algumas vezes até melhor que o antecessor. Resumindo gostei bastante, e pareceu ser menos bugado que o outro, porém menor - se bem que o outro enche linguiça demais.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pretty trashy WW1 zombie shooter game.level design is a mix of call of duty 1 and left for dead. the graphics, sounds and animation are pretty low quality and old school.the story:""Player is now one of WWI German troops that discovers the evil forces unleashed by the war, starts to fight against them and leads soldiers of all nations gathered on the front through the massive battles against the zombies and demons""well, what can i say ... its probably fun for a few hours, but only when you can laugh about the cheap effects, bugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies.on the other hand if you pay the full price of 14,99€, the developers probably laugh about YOU!

												NecroVisioN: Lost Company is a standalone-add-on-like prequel to the original NecroVisioN. For a more detailed review, watch my review on NecroVisioN. The story of this add-on tells us about one of the original NV's enemies, Jonas Zimmerman, who we play as. During the playthrough, we will visit familiar places from the original game, as well as new places, and find out why Zimmerman has gone so evil. The add-on introduces some new weapons, which include a german machine-gun with a flamethrower. Brutal.  Overall, Lost Company is a worthy add-on, and, if you liked the original, this one won't leave you indifferent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is surprising good.  It is a fun horror FPS that I picked up in a bundle and decided to play on a lark. Even at $10 the game is well priced, but if bundled or on sale I would highly recommend.PROS:Graphics have aged wellSatisfying amount gunplay and gearThe story is decent. Nothing amazing but interesting and a little different. CONS:Some graphic glitchesA few tedious levels ",339,61,4,64,49,4,102

												This is quite a fun game. I loved the original as well. It's bascially Painkiller meets WWI and a bit of Wolfenstein. I have seen nothing but bad reviews for this series, but it's so much fun!			",56,13,0,6,2,0,0
