												F.E.A.R is up there with Half-Life and other classics for its sheer level of detail, polish and chaotic fun.Even as we approach 2014, the visual fidelity of F.E.A.R is still something to behold. Firefights explode in a shower of particles and dust quite unmatched in most other games. You will rend various levels apart with bullets as you play as The Point Man, a member of First Encounter Assault Recon, and each encounter will have a level of cinematic mayhem that time has yet to have dulled. The inclusion of a bullet time mode really makes this shine as the chaos unfolds in slow motion, as well as being a useful tool in the games later, more challenging levels.The game's AI is fiercely on-point, something which evokes Half Life 1 most strongly of all. Enemy soldiers will communicate with one another and actively work together to seek you out, relaying your position over radio and reacting to your strategies in compelling and exciting ways. This is a game with better AI than most modern shooters.The horror elements of F.E.A.R are a little on the nose - sudden flashing images of a corpse are not exactly ways that the game 'earns' its jumps - but for each cheap shot it takes in this regard it generally more than makes up with a tense, often surreal, atmosphere and a solid number of ""gotcha!"" moments that aren't cheap at all. Alma has become quite the icon in horror gaming, and she does her part in providing the occasional terrifying moment.With rock solid shooting, wonderfully dramatic effects - including great ragdoll physics - and servicable story, it's hard not to recommend F.E.A.R. Its quality and attention to detail set a high benchmark for its sequels, and indeed all other action titles.			",330,32,8,40,22,3,23

												With most horror games, they blow their load early and show you the scariest stuff in the first ten minutes. Over the course of the game, the player becomes desensitized to it, having to repeatedly encounter zombies and monsters across the span of 7-10 hours.F.E.A.R. on the other hand is a game of build-up. It doesn’t start out especially scary, but as I kept playing it, it very gradually started to creep me out. I would hesitate to say that it outright scared me, because it takes a lot for a game to legitimately scare me. But as you creep around its desolate office complex, an unsettling feeling begins to seep in to your brain. It’s like being in a supermarket after hours - a place so obviously bustling with people and noise and life, now empty. You can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong and you really, really shouldn’t be here. Everything’s too quiet and you feel a little vulnerable.Eventually the tension mounts and the creepy atmosphere pays off. The end of the game could’ve had a bigger finale with some sort of climactic boss encounter, but ultimately it doesn’t need one. The ending is unforgettable even without a big scary monster to kill - and maybe that’s for the best. I’d complain that F.E.A.R. ends on something of a cliffhanger, but all the best horror movies do, and so too does F.E.A.R.			",444,83,23,36,20,4,52

												Fear was one of the best FPS ever, and to say its years old it still looks great, the lighting and shadows were amazing and few games can still match it today and the AI was second to none, firefights in this game were fantastic. Story was well done and weapons, enviroments and sound effects were top notch. It still remains one of my favourite games to date and set the bar really high for FPS games to follow which in my opinion have failed to do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon, is a first-person shooter (FPS) survival game developed by Monolith Productions (known for such games as Shadow of Mordor and the Condemned series) and published by Vivendi back in 2005. During its time, it was one of the most graphically and system intensive game overshadowed only by the release of Crysis (1) two years later. F.E.A.R. features a unique game play mechanic which makes use of what it calls the 'Reflex' ability or more popularly known to players as 'slow-mo'.  It also features advanced enemy AI, and a story that blends Japanese style horror with intense FPS action in a single gaming experience.PLOT (No Spoilers):The F.E.A.R. Team was sent in to investigate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic military commander who, using an army of clone soldiers known as the Replica Army, started an uprising against Armacham Technology Corporation (Umbrella Group of Companies). The player takes on the role of 'Point Man' (whose real name was never revealed), a new member of the 'First Encounter Assault Recon' (F.E.A.R.) Team.PROS:+ Graphics that aged well+ Great Atmosphere (Lighting, Sound Effects, Particle Effects, Soundtracks and overall presentation)+ Game Mechanic (Reflex skill and varying melee attacks)+ Good overall voice acting+ Fairly expansive levels which maintain their linearity while at the same time allowing for exploration for...(See next PRO)+ Collectibles that enhances the player (Increase in health or reflex)+ Great gun play+ Advanced AI that knows how to employ basic tactics (Flanking, suppressing fire, grenade flushes, covering fire etc.)+ Great story with good lore, backstory and world building+ Good game time (around 7-9 hours depending on playstyle)CONS:- Physics (Physx), lights, and particle effects can sometimes be glitched- Multiplayer is no longer available- Combat may feel repetitive- Too much ammo, health and armor lying around. It is in my opinion that horror games should encourage caution which would add to the scare element of the game- No weapon mode switching: Most weapons are burst fire for some reasonNEUTRAL:+/- The game features a 'one shot kill' mechanic if the enemy was unaware of your presence.  Personally I feel that this made the game easier than it should have been, but then again, other people might like the idea.+/- Intro cinematic is completely glitched with low resolution quality if the game resolution is set to, or higher than 1080p. (not game breaking since the only 'pre-rendered' cinematic is on the intro sequence.)CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. F.E.A.R. is a game that offers a great first-person experience that blends both horror and action in one perfect match. Overall, despite its age, F.E.A.R. is as fun as it was 10 years ago (2005).WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since its only $9.99 or your regional equivalent with the added bonus of the non-canon alternate universe expansion packs 'Extraction Point' and 'Perseus Mandate' which are also good games in their own right.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												F.E.A.R is a first person horror shooter that was released in late 2005 and is the first game in the F.E.A.R series. The game's story is set around a supernatural phenomenon, which a special forces team is brought in to deal with. You play the role of the team's pointman, you have super human reflexes yourself as well!The gameplay in F.E.A.R while has no new and creative elements to the shooting genre, it is easily one of the most satisfying shooters I have played. All of the guns feel as if they are perfectly balanced, there is a good mixture of guns too; from the non-fictional type in pistols and sub-machine guns, right the way to the fictional weapons, such as laser beams. The way the game feels as you play it just ticks all the boxes.  The super human reflexes act as like a 'bullet-time', giving you the chance to setup a couple of head shots while also running back to cover; it is very useful at times in tricky situations.  There are also times when you actually can use melee to take down your enemies, normally melee in fps games causes you more problems than it's worth, but in F.E.A.R if done correctly, melee will instantly kill enemies. Even though this game was released little over ten years ago; you would never be able to tell from the graphics on show. You are able to play the game in full resolution, at a perfectly smooth 60 frames per second (most of the time...). It looks amazing; the lighting is again key in horror games and it is done very well here. Even though F.E.A.R is supposed to be a horror game; I unfortunately have to say that I was not scared at all when playing, and I am normally a bigger wimp than a little girl. There are very little if any at all jump scares; all the scenes which you expect to be scary are predictable so you loose the shock value from them.We have a number of different difficulty levels that you can play on here; so you can choose how hard you want to play the game; I have played through twice now, the first on easy mode, and I didn't die once so I wouldn't recommend that if you are looking for a true experience/challenge. All of the 12 levels in F.E.A.R are perfectly designed, all of them can end up being a maze if you don't concentrate on where you are going, and some of the latter levels actually have some tricky puzzles to work out. There are tons and tons of rooms to explore for ammo, medipacks, increased health pool and bullet-time packs, and new weapons. As well as the laptops which you can hack, and phone voice mail messages to listen to, so you can flesh out the plot even more. A full playthrough of F.E.A.R on a regular difficulty took me roughly thirteen hours to complete; I also spent a lot of time finding all of the power-ups, finding the extra story bits as well. After you play it through once though, other than playing again on a higher difficulty; there is no real need to playthrough again. The story is linear and will always end up being the same. I had a couple of technical issues while playing; the smallest would be the auto save feature. When you get to a check point in the level, the game will auto-save, this can sometimes take 3 or 4 seconds, while this doesn't sound like much, it really impedes on the gameplay - you get no warning that it's coming and it really knocks you out of the immersion. Secondly, is an issue which had my puzzled for a while; every so often my frame rate would tank to single figures, obviously I knew this wasn't right - so I was checking nothing could be causing any problems in the background and there was nothing running. After a little digging around online I found this article on the Steam forums that fixed the drops in frame rates - I would recommend anyone wanting to play the game implement this fix before they start. (I don't have a Logitek keyboard, and it still fixed the issue).http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1279444F.E.A.R is in my opinion, one of the best shooters out there and one that everyone needs to experience. I can safely say I enjoyed it from start to finish and will be looking forward to playing the extra  (DLC?) packs as well as the rest of the series. 1) Stay away2) Only buy when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												This game is old, it's true. But if you want a challenging game with an advanced A.I., and a particular atmosphere, play it !Talking about replayability, well, let's be honest: this is probably the kind of game you'd play once or twice. F.E.AR. is a good mix of horror and action, but the horror part will fade away after the first time you beat the game, simply because the scary parts are scripted and not random.TL;DR - this game is a must have, even if you play it only once. Perfect artificial intelligence, nice atmosphere, even for a corridor FPS.			",875,246,32,90,58,8,101

You don't know who you are, don't you?The girl in the red dress says. You awake in cold sweat, alarm droning inmonotone as you see it's the interim timebetween 31st October and the 1st ofNovember. Halloween night.You stretch and boot up the computer asyou yawn. Close to two months withoutyour girlfriend, Ms. Novocaine. But thethought of your classmate, a beautifulgothic girl by the name of Summer-Rainlingers in your mind's eye.Steam has now queued up a selectionof Halloween-themed games one can play, and a shooter from your past staresat you, a game calledF.E.A.R.You stare at it, remembering througha dream haze of when you played ityears ago, in the heyday of 2005,when it was the horror equivalent ofthe previous generation's Crysis.Nostalgia and curiosity overtake yoursense of reasoning, and you make thepurhase of F.E.A.R. which includes itstwo expansion packs, the first beingExtraction Point, which ramps up theHorror factor 21 out of a scale of 10 and Perseus Mandate, a paralleladventure to the main story that starsthe equally-silent protagonist of the F.E.A.R. Sergeant as compared to theseries' main Point Man.To your shock, you already own thegame(s), despite having no memoryor recollection of ever buying it. Youblink for a moment, before your thehairs on the back of your neck standon end. You download the entiretyof F.E.A.R. and you expect it tofinish within an hour. F.E.A.R. is already downloaded, the logical explanation be damned.Suddenly, your phone rings. At 2am on Halloween night? You answer.Static greets you before a familiar voice,sweet as honey, gives you a warning.""...she's watching you.""Your eyes widen as the line goes dead.F.E.A.R. stares back at you, when youhear a soft giggle. Spinning round, yousee nothing, but the scent of Ms.Novocaine's sweet musk has overtakenyou.The light in your room goes out on itsown. You click 'Play.'Immediately, you now remember whyF.E.A.R. takes the cake for one of themost immersive shooters of not justthe early generation, but anygeneration. Although badly renderedand quite horrible-looking from a graphical standpoint today, the immersion, ambience and dynamic lighting of F.E.A.R. still holds up after all these years.The audio is stellar. Guns sound likethey are discharged next to you andyou swear you smell the gunpowderand scraping metal. The enemies ofthe game, Replica Soldiers, have some of the most complex AI in anygame, adapting to your tactics andtrying to outflank and outgun you atevery turn. Tables are flippedand doors barricaded as youattempt to mow down their ownranks with a mixture of gunplayand melee strikes, with F.E.A.R.being the only FPS you've seenutilize scissor and roundhousekicks in its game engine.But F.E.A.R. sets the mood earlybefore the action with its pervasiveHorror element, with jumpscares and twitch imagery galore. The girl in the red dress, Alma, serves as some sort of overarching, supernatural presence throughout the game.The story of F.E.A.R. is a strangebut refreshing mix of both westernaction and military movies alongwith eastern-influenced horror.Some gaps in logic or pacingaside, the game's story on itsown is solid B-movie fare, butthe infusion of its clearly asianhorror roots bring a welcomenew element to the regularformula of grey and drab FPSin corridors and sewers.F.E.A.R. is constructed around 12levels, but by Level 6, you feel tiredand spent by the sheer amount ofmental energy required to prepare youfor the scares and horror which havebecome taxing. With the gunplay andaction having made you feel fulfilled,you turn off the computer when youhear muffled whispering from outsideyour window.You peer through the blinds and seea bloodied girl in a red dress staringback at you, Ms. Novocaine's eyesleak blood as she opens her mouthto speak. Everything goes black.After a time, you feel the warmtouch of someone ruffling yourhair, the smell of strawberries together with a soft light which feels reassuring.Your eyes open slightly and yourealize that it's dawn, November1st. You're in your room and the sun's rays shine in from the open window, while a girl in black petticoat and apple-green accents greets your view. She looks lovely, and even lovelier is how your head is in her lap. Your eyes widen in disbelief.""Hey. You're awake..."" Summer-Rainsays, sliding her hand down your face and holding your cheek. Your eyes half-close in bliss as the scent of strawberries overtake you. ""W-what happened...?"" You ask,and Summer-Rain tells you thatwhen you didn't turn up for themorning class, she huffed to yourhouse, broke in through the openwindow and found you on the floor,out cold, door ajar and sweating profusely.""Didn't know you cared."" You start,as she pouts and looks away, blushing fiercely whilesnapping at you. ""I couldn'tleave you like that, even if I wantedto. I thought you might've died.""You smile and thank Summer-Rain,before apologizing to her for makingher skip the morning class with herbeing here. You offer to buy herbreakfast but her hand stops youfrom leaving her lap, while her otherhand still holds your head steady.""Summer...?"" you begin, realizingthat she's looking down at you witha pensive, serious expression.Her voice is hushed now, sweet ashoney. ""Tell me something."" Shebegins, and you are instantly enraptured, enamoured with her even more.""...anything. What is it?""Summer-Rain glances at the doorway of your room to see the bloodied Ms. Novocaine vanish out of sight, before looking back to you and smiling her signature smile,reassuring you like no one ever has.""What do you fear?""

												People junk this game for repetitive levels, bad graphics, and lack of enemy diversity. I just don't see any of that except maybe the bad level complaint is valid. Although who cares about how the levels look when the gameplay is so solid. I just played this game now in 2015 and it's still an awesome game. My one complaint with this game is even on the hardest difficulty it is still a bit too easy. The reason people love or hate this game is because its focus is the same gameplay over and over in different variations so if you don't like the shooting mechanic you will pretty much hate the whole game.

IntroductionI just added FEAR in my steam library, altough i own the game since it's release. I completed the storyline (for the 10th, at least, time) and it's time for me to write a review.  To be honest, the only reason i started playing again, is that i am a nostalgic guy, and after so many years i wanted to play this game again. But now i think about it again, and i figure that this is the most irrelevant reason to play it  ;)Story(No Spoilers)The protagonist is the ""Point Man"" (no real name) of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon),a secret unit of the US Government, specializing in dealing with paranormal threats. The mission is to take down Paxton Fettel, and his clone army, known as Replica.Game TimeIt takes about 8-10 hours to complete the campaign (depending on the difficulty)In detailIf you get this game, it wont be about the kickass graphics or its realistic gameplay, If you expect something like that, i bet you will be disappointed. However the atmospheric gameplay, created by the well-designed maps and the awesome light-shade effects, the enemy AI, which is far more advanced than even some today's FPS and the great storyline totally compensate the game's drawbacks.Additionally, the multiplayer was awesome and made me spend many hours playing. When i found out that MP doesnt' work anymore i got sad. Pros+ Great graphics at the time of release+ Atmospheric gameplay created by the lighting and shade effects, with the addition of even greater sound effets+ Advanced enemy A.I. which can make the game challenging + Interesting storyline and plot similar to an action-horror movie. The well created cutscenes add to that.+ Variety of weapons and grenadesCons- No multiplayer ( T.T )- Some glitches may occur due to specific graphic combos.- Usually repititiveConcluding, worth buying it since it's considered a classic!10.0 / 10.01. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8 / 10] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]  ",94,3,1,10,6,0,15

Abandoned branch of shootersMan, I love F.E.A.R... It is one of those old school FPSs that I miss today and that remind me of my childhood filled with both children-friendly games like Crash Bandicoot and Gex and mature ones like Prince of Persia, System Shock and, of course, F.E.A.R.Looking at everything you loved being a kid after growing up, you start to notice that everything you admired does have problems (and sometimes severe ones). This game is no exception: - Mediocre plot with few memorable charactersThat might be weird to ask for a decent plot in a shooter, but this one would have been much better if the allies had been much more memorable (antagonists are wunderbar though)- Repetitive surroundingsI ain't talking about level architecture, but office and labs interior, which starts to get you bored to the end of the gameBut this is nothing compared to everything that makes dat gaem rock:+ Shooting mechanicsOne of the best ones you may find in games which concept was abandoned by game industry (I'm looking at ya, filthy casual who creates demand)And level design (forgetting about interior) is perfectly made for such mechanic supporting severe close quarters combat+ Enemy AIIt is harsh, believable and unforgiving. When did you last experience a game where enemies were trying to flank you, suppress, surround and surprise♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you without giving you a breather since 2005?+ Slow-motionA great addition which can be turned off if you want a real challenge+ PhysicsEverything is well-made from bullet traces and particle effects to lighting when a lamp shakes after an explosion+ AtmosphereEven though plot's not as wunderbar as it could be, the paranoid and claustrophobic atmosphere will crawl right under your skin and won't leave you alone till the creditsAnswer me this, prijatelj...Would you like to see how FPSs could have changed if developers had chosen the path of interesting shooting mechanics, atmosphere and challenge? I wouldOverall: 9.5/10 - one of the most significant events of gaming historyP. S. You ever thought of making a modern FPS player launch F.E.A.R.?

												The first F.E.A.R. is an absolute classic. Everyone must play this game at least once because in my book, this game is one of the best games ever made. Its atmosphere is its greatest strength and the devs absolutely nailed it. The whole atmosphere of the buildings, offices, corridors, lighting, level design, enemies, and sounds perfectly creates a great feeling of DREAD, ISOLATION, and FEAR that keeps you on the edge and hooked to complete the game. Its atmosphere was way far ahead for its time and it still currently holds up as one of the greatest atmospheres in video game history along with Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and Layers of Fear. Another huge plus about this game is the A.I. of all the enemies. They are one of the best programmed and intelligent enemies I have ever seen. The combination of the A.I. and bullet time manipulation is insanely bonkers which provides you some of the greatest gameplay experiences in gaming. The execution of using sounds and music with the action and well-written story was perfectly well done which gave me a tremendous feeling of terror. I cannot figure out how the heck the devs managed to do this part so well. You need to play this game to fully understand that.Overall, the game is a must play and is my second favorite game of all time. 9.8 out of 10			",1120,414,21,58,47,7,61

												To be completely honest, it's weird for a game like this to actually be pretty scary. When you think about it, there are no real horror like enemies in the game. No weird monsters or mutated freaks. Just Replica Soldiers. But god the atmosphere in this game, along with the audio can be so thick that you can cut it with a knife. The environments are dark and sometimes in states of complete ruin. The noises you hear are just terrifying, and ugh, don't get me started on the late game stuff.You can sorta put this game into two parts.The first is the action part. Where you're shooting enemies and trying to stay alive. Whilst it's mostly standard shooting stuff, you have a feature called Reflex, witch pretty much acts like bullet time from Max Payne. And like Max Payne, it helps to elevate this game, and even the odds against your enemies. Plus they actually give you a story reason for having it!The second part is exploration. This is where the game gets scary. When the music and ambiance ramp up, and that little comm symbol in the corner displays a flickering ""Unknown signal"". You know that you're in for some freaky stuff. This is where the FEAR shines. I was legit hesitant to move on because of how much I was scared and worried about what was to happen. Even if I knew that I was in no danger.Now I mentioned that there are no ""Monster"" type enemies in the game, but that's kind of a lie. In certain segments, and parts near the end, you fight aparition like monsters. But like I said, they're kept for very specific parts and for a short while.If the main game wasn't enough, however, it also comes with the two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for absolutely free, adding another 5 hours each to an already 8 hour game. Extraction point is a direct (But non canon) sequel to the first game, taking place where it left off. Due to events at the end of the first game, the area you were in has been devestated, and the supernatural anomolies which were mostly contained are running in full force. This expansion I would almost say is even scarier than the main game, mostly for the fact that, like mentioned, the supernatural is now in full force. You'll be fighting some more creepier enemies, and going through a lot more scary♥♥♥♥♥♥than the main game. Along with the newly added weapons, this is the best out of the two expansions.The main problem with the second, Perseus Mandate, is that it feel like more of the same. Non of the new weapons from Extraction point appear, and the only thing they add are a new enemy or two. It's still creepy, and still fun, but not as good as the other two parts. I'd suggest playing this one first if not for story reasons.But overal, F.E.A.R is more than worth getting. The online feature doesn't work anymore but, it is still a great, and horrifying single player experience.			",119,19,0,3,4,1,4

												""She is a prisoner, floating in darkness...""I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, let alone Japanese-themed horror T_T, but something about this game that makes it one of my all-time favorite shooters.You play as the Point Man, a F.E.A.R. operative, sent to eliminate a group of super soldiers (replicas) and their leader, Paxton Fettel. You'd soon uncover that it was more than just a mission, it was a date with destiny.I loved the concept of the story, but in my opinion, fell short on the story-telling factor. There were times that felt like fillers just to make the game seem longer and some times where I was confused at who was who. Even with all that, the story is pretty solid for an FPS.The visuals are a bit dated today, but they did a damn good job at that time. The game doesn't rely on jumpscares to freak people out, but the way they build up the tension e.g. flickering lights, suspense music, things moving on their own etc. basically things that'll make your hair stand on edge, and the game did it well.The gameplay in F.E.A.R. is honestly one of the funnest experience I've had in First-Person Shooters. Think Half-Life meets Max Payne with awesome ragdoll physics. The Slow-Mo ability partnered with the shotgun can be OP at times, but I'm not complaining :D I also love that it has a health bar, collectibles to upgrade your health and reflexes, and medkits which you can use to heal yourself at will. Overall Experience: I love this game so much and is my favorite in the franchise. Plus, the ending is just awesome and will leave you wanting more. After beating the entire trilogy, I was kinda disappointed that the 3rd one took on a more generic approach. This game ironically managed to make me tolerate horror games, with the exception of Amnesia, Slender, Outlast and basically horror games that leave you defenseless T_T			",205,35,8,24,19,1,21

												Quite possibly the best and most immersive AI enemies I have ever encountered. For example in some fire fights a Replica will call out ""We've got X down"" X being the people you have just killed and it's not scripted! I have been counfounded and butchered by this AI so many times. Flanking, real time stratagy and tactical choices by the Replica's really make the First Person Shooter aspect original and unique even today. The story is simply fantastic and completely original, theres really nothing quite like it. As for the Horror aspect, well not even the original Dead Space game ever make scare me as badly, and may or may not have made me♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants a little as this game. Ladders man. I reccomend this game to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphics and dilapidated archetecture give it a very strong HL2 vibe but even more spooky.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Monolith Productions, TimegatePublishers: Warner Bros InteractiveInitial release: Oct 2005Genre: FPS, Horror#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI missed this game when it originally launched back in 2005. For I had not yet joined the darkside. So being such a highly regarded game I felt I needed to go back and get familiar about this era for PC shooters. I was not disappointed. In this game you play as a grizzled special ops agent dubbed point-man and little is known about your character up front. All that is known is that he can slow down time however its explained pretty early on that this is because he has extremely good reflexes. Being the pointman of First Encounter Assault Recon or F.E.A.R. you are tasked with investigating a company for questionable practices and finding and extracting a few people.This is a horror game and it definitely has its moments. Not entirely relying on jump scares but atmospheric tension as well. The game actually ages rather well if I do say so myself. Given a few grievances and lack of basic modern conveniences its still very playable. Health packs are still a thing and no iron sights. However this is replaced by storming into a room turning on reflex mode and mowing the entire room down with a shotgun. The story is also pretty interesting. I knew some things going in but the story is still engaging enough to see it through for additional exposition. All in all, I'm really glad I went back and played through something deemed “classic” and it held up over 10 years later. If you've not played this I HIGHLY recommend you go back and do so. Additionally the Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate expansions are included.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,94,7,96

												F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), is the masterpiece by Sierra Entertainment, and Monolith Productions. For me it's the best video game  of all time. Grabbed this version on Steam last January and having fun with it since. Even after completing the game numerous times , I can always do something in it, for example complete the game without slow-motion or only using two pistols and grenades..the enemy AI is very challenging, you gotta be on your guard all the time. The melee combat is also fantastic.10/10			",100,27,2,0,4,2,5

												FEAR is pretty cool, I guess.Set in the distant future of the next Tuesday. A psychic that goes by the name of Paxton Fettel takes control of an army of clone super soldiers known as the Replicants, or Stank Patrol, and slaughters the employees of the Armacham Technology Corporation, even the Janitor wasn't spared.  You play as the Point-Man, a operator of FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) who saw a hella ton of John Woo movies and was like “Yeah, I can do that.” Turns out he totally can. You and your team are sent in to deal with Paxton's hissy fit and put that balding ♥♥♥♥♥ back in his cage. But strangely enough, you are also haunted by this mysterious little ghost girl in a red dress, causing your screen to flicker and flash before she goes “Boo!” and makes you jump like a nerd. Haha, nerd. FEAR is a first person shooter of the best kind. You are given a plethora of weapons and sent out to go shoot some stupid clones in their stupid clone faces. Gunfights in FEAR are probably the best thing ever. Not only is it satisfying gory but everything just kind of explodes in it all. Walls turn into dust, office work goes flying, tables are flipped over, windows shatter, the whole kitten caboodle. Monolith's love for John Woo gun fights are more than apparent in this game. The Stank Patrol themselves are probably one of FEAR's greatest element. They're not only just goons that run at you and volunteer to hold on to your bullets using their brains and internal organs, but they also act like people who actually want to kill you. They take cover, suppress, flank, and even make a run for it if they're losing. I actually had a Replicant ditch a fight and I couldn't find him for the life of me. Then I gave up and went on, and three rooms later I was suddenly shot in the back. The punk was hiding in a cubicle and waiting for me like some sort of sneaky... Clone... Prick. And I loved it. Every now and then, the game tries to spook you. But the game actually warns you before the spooking happens. Every time Alma, the little girl in the red dress, or Paxton try to mess with you, your hud will flicker a bit to give you a heads up that not everything is right. It's kind of...Well stupid and takes out a lot of tension from any scare since you see it coming. Unlike condemned, some of these scares actually sort of got me and made me drop the monocle from my eye and go “I say!” Should you play FEAR?Yeah.No, that's all you're getting, FEAR is mad good even all these years. It's 1:30 AM and I've done 5 reviews today. So all you're getting is a Yeah out of Maybe.FEAR gets a Yeah out of Maybe.

												i played this game for the first time just recently, knowing it held the title as one of the best FPS ever made, and boy did it earn it, right now it easily stands as one of my favorite single player FPS of all timefirst of all lets talk about arguably the game's most legendary feature, the amazing AI, its just as good as you expect with all the hype behind it, maybe even morethe AI in the game can perform a variety of complex tasks and maneuvers, they will always try to take cover, they can vault over obstacles and crouch below them too, they can jump through windows, they try to flank you or use grenades to flush you out of cover, they use supressive fire to keep you pinned down, they will blindfire, they will even push objects from the environment and use em as cover, ive never seen AI this smart in any other FPS. And its not just smart, but realistic too! the enemy will remain oblivious to your presence unless something gives your position away, like your flashlight, your gunfire, your footsteps, or one of the enemy soldiers alerting his comrades about your presence, and even after they see you they can lose track of you, shooting for a while to your last confirmed position and looking for you. The game also makes intelligent use of the enemy comm chatter, enemies will constantly report their situation to each other through radio, this helps the player know when there are enemies waiting to ambush nearby or when they lose track of the player or are about to toss a grenade. there are different types of enemies each with their own AI tough being perfectly honest enemy variety isnt one of the game strongest points, considering the good AI keeps the enemy encounters fresh and the game lasts just enough to avoid these encounters becoming stale, this is hardly a problemalso this is going to sound a bit weird, but despite the game being 8 years old by the time of writing, it still looks pretty damn good, is not crysis 3 or battlefield 4, but the game uses its visual effects in great ways to enhance the atmosphere, stuff like dinamic shadows and such, is rare to see a game that actually uses graphics technology to enhance the gameplay and not just look shiny. also the animations are just top notch, for both the player and enemies, shooting enemies is so much fun, in part due to the great gunplay, with weapons having some meaty feeling thanks to great sound and recoil, but also thanks to the huge array of animations enemy soldiers have, they react realistically to shots, will often fall to the ground and try very hardly to get back up on their feed, they will sometimes limp around after receiving too much damage and when they die they will sometimes keep the trigger pressed, spraying the room with stray bullets. the player movements are faithfully replicated by the main character, climbing, kicking, puching and firing have a very heavy and realistic feelingthe gunplay as i mentioned is great, guns have some good recoil and damage, they are also very varied, the game has a lean mechanic which is crucial to survive agaisnt the great enemy AI, the game also thankfully makes no use of stupid regenerative health, instead you have to look out for health pickups and health upgrades, as well as ""reflex"" upgrades across the levels, your ""reflex"" is used to enter an amazing slow mo mode that allows you to easily and stylishly take out challenging foes, the fantastic ragdolls of this game just make taking out foes even more satisfying, even the melee feels great!another high note is the games atmosphere, using horror elements to set a believable spooky atmosphere, is not a survival horror game by any means, but you will easily be fooled during its most unnerving partsthe game has few but very noticeable flaws, the main one is that the environments are very samey and close quarters, its very easy to lose track and end up going in circles, is not that the levels are complex, they simply all look the same, also the same close quarters setup make firefights somewhat predictable, tough the game does make some efforts to provide engagements in more open areas, these are however the exception rather than the rule. Also while the atmosphere was great, i found the story to be merely ok, competent but nothing special with very few memorable charactersit took me 8-9 hours to complete the game, a very respectable amount			",257,51,5,26,17,3,56

												This game is a fu*king masterpiece! After so many years, the only thing that has aged badly is graphics. Compared to modern standards it is ugly... but the game is so much fun that I dont mind it! The physics is great fun, the AI is still very good, they flank you they hide and shoot from cover. The guns are awesome and you can feel 'the joy' when you kill your enemies with them I personaly love dual pistols, shotgun and... NAIL RIFLE, a rifle that shoots big metal bolts, kind of like wooden stakes for vampires but a bit smaller and metal, and every enemy you kill with it is literaly... nailed to a wall or any other surface behind him and stays that way, which is great as the engine keeps the bodies on map for a very long time if you set up the settings to max, so it is awesome when you backtrack to pick up a medkit or different gun and you walk into a room where you had a fierce firefight just a few moments ago and you can see the bodies still nailed in agony where you left them.And there is bullet time! Yes ladies and gentlment just like Max Payne (but opposite to Max there is an good explanation why our hero has such ability), our hero can slow down time for a short moment which looks and works awesome. You can throw a gernade twoards enemies and turn slowmotion on, and use it to shoot the gernade in air when it flies near your enemies' heads. You will grin with pure satisfaction every time you manage to pull that trick }:->==there are also 3 types of throwables (in base game, addon adds one more which is a mini turret). First you have a simple gernade which explods when he touches enemy or simply fall to the floor and detonates after a short moment (or you can shoot it mid-air), the second is a bouncing betty-like proximity mine, you throw it on the floor and when enemy walks near it, the mine jumps up about 2 meters highs and blows up straight in the baddies face. The last type of gernade is the sticky gernade with remote detonation. This one is uncomfortable to use as you cannot hold weapon when you select it as you have the detonator in your hands. Basicly you throw a gernade that sticks to any surface it touches, even enemies and it explodes when you use fire button, it is good to set up traps, for example when you run away a bit from the enemy you can stick couple of them the walls and detonate when enemy who follows you will pass them. The plot is very nice, it keeps you interested and the horror intrusions are also a nice atmosphere build up. This isnt a horror game as shooting is about 75% of the game but the horror intrusions are still very nice.The first expansion pack called Extraction Point has a lot more scares and they are much scarier, the atmosphere is much more horror like then the base game, and it adds new enemies and 2 new guns. It is a very good expansion. I liked it very much, it manages to be (despite being identical in gameplay as base game) doing things much better then the original did. The are lot of much more scarier places like Church or metro/underground station and finaly the hospital which is the most scary part of this addon. I also like how the addon keep the plot harsh and brutal for the main supporting characters, it will keep you in a very depressed mood but I mean it in a good way (lol). This is not a happy story where you kill all the bad guys and save all your friends, no happy ever after in this one.I am still playing the second addon campaing (Perseus Mandate) but I like it very much, it has a different main character and shows events that happen alongside those in the main game but dont directly connect with each other, it provides a lot of juicy stuff refering to main game. I love when one of your teammates says on radio: 'Hey it seems we have some minors in the building. There is a small girl in red dress... wait where is she? She was just there!'And the second expansion adds 3 (!) more guns to the game, and also a very good new enemy (a kind of elite forces) which is very difficult to fight so every encounter with them is a great firefight. The first part of the expansion happens during the main game timeline and is mostly heavy on shoting and fighting, although it has it share of scares and horror. The second part that starts just right after the main game ends and the first expansion starts is the where the scary stuff takes leadrship. I played not very much of this second part but enough to see that it is where the horror is taking over. One of the best FPP shooters in history. A unique blend of adrenaline rush action with very good AI of enemies and scary horror atmosphere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never cared much for F.E.A.R. . All I knew about it was that it had the The Ring girl and you could slow time like The Matrix, and those two things never really interested me anyways since they just seemed like gimmicks that were cashing in on what was popular at the time.So it came quite as a shock that I managed to find one of the best FPS games I have ever played here. Preconceptions can be deceiving so it seems, who knew?For a game released all the way back in 2005, im amazed at how well it holds up today in the technical department. The physics and particle effects are some of the best I have ever seen in a shooter, and the way they increase the positive feedback from the gameplay is great and ultimately what makes the game.And the slowing down mechanic only enhances it. Entering a room and dispatching every single enemy in the span of 5 seconds and bringing the game back to normal speed never gets old. The room will be filled with blood, bullet holes, lights swinging back and forth and smoke all over the place, giving you this immense feeling of satisfaction and empowerment. Its also great that the enemies have really good AI and will constantly try to flank  get the drop on you, and the game has a way of tricking you into believing they act like humans by having them have conversations between squads in relation to your actions. Most of that dialogue is simply a way of disguising the AI, since the enemies actions never really matches what they are saying, but it goes a long way to immerse you into the game and increase your suspension of disbelief.The weapons are also fantastic, they all have this absurd kick to them that makes killing the enemies incredibly rewarding, and it only gets better as the game progresses, giving you even more ridiculous overpowered guns that will either desintegrate or explode your enemies. Enemies react very realistic to being shot, and by slowing down time you can really see how a bullet hitting on their shoulder, for example, makes them move as you would expect them to.It never got old unloading a shotgun at point blank on an enemy face with time slowed down.You would think the slowing down time mechanic would make you feel overpowered, but the game balances that well by making you die very easily if not behind cover and in normal time. So the combat loop of this game ends up making you feel like a monster just annihilating everyone before they can even react and leaving a trail of destruction behind you.  To complement this amazing gameplay, you also have the brilliant level design. You will spend most of your time moving through builidings, offices and factories, and while those environments may seem a bit boring, they are completely elevated by the qualitiy of their routes.You see, there is always more than one way of approaching a combat segment, the levels tend to be circular, where there is always at least two paths leading to the same spot. This not only provides some really fun moments of hide and sek between you and the enemies, but it also always leaves you a bit tense turning your back to a spot that might just have an enemy trying to get the drop on you.If there is something FPSs should take from F.E.A.R., its the level design, just some of the best I have seen in a long time.The presentation is also fantastic. The pace of the game is broken up by horror segments, where you you will have to move through dark corridors and empty building structures. This is all elevated by the lighting system of the game that still holds up, creating some really great shadows, and the realistic environments only enhance the uneasyness.As for the horror itself, I have to say I found it more endearing than scary, but this is mainly due to the time the game was released, since most of its tricks are cliche by now. But they are good tricks, dont get me wrong and I did have fun getting startled by some of them, its just that they are really tame by today's standards. One thing I have to commend the game, is that the jump scares dont have the obnoxious high pitch sound meant to make you jump so I appreciate that.Hilariously, I found myself getting more spooked with combat situations that would either surprise me by introducing a new type of threat or by the creative way the enemies would approach me.The soundtrack is great, having that Half Life feel where it kicks into high gear when the moment calls for it, turning certain situations into a scene straight out of an action movie.The story itself while managing to get you invested is very by the numbers and the game has a way of trying to make a big deal out of what I think is a very straightforward plot, and some of its twists and revelations were a bit eye rolling inducing, but it was all in good fun and it was never intrusive.Its understandable, being a game of 2005. My biggest gripe with the game however has to be the way it decides to end the game. You would expect that the last moments of a visceral FPS like this would be to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you, bringing every enemy type at the same time and giving you every weapon you could carry to give you one last final showdown. But nope, the last two chapters are dedicated to the horror component, having you just follow some hallways killing some weird paranormal ghosts that cause minimal damage to you, just so the plot can be served to you.It really left a bad taste in my mouth, and it was a severe case of blue balls.Final veridict, play this game. It deserves more love than it gets, this is one of great FPS games of its time, and I think alot of devs would benefit from taking a look at how a shooter is ♥♥♥♥ing done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. is quite easily one of the most intense and atmospheric games that you'll play, and it's a spectacular blend of horror and action. This is a game that will thrill you one moment and scare you the next. F.E.A.R. features some of the greatest gunplay available in a first-person shooter, and it elevates the art of firing a gun to whole new levels. This alone makes it an incredibly intense game that must be experienced.			",141,11,0,16,0,0,3

												F.E.A.R is a fantastic game. In an age with trite like FNAF, that solely relies on cheap jumpscares with next to no gameplay, F.E.A.R is a shining beacon of quality horror gaming. Sure it does rely on jumpscares a lot, but when it's not scaring you, I'm terrified I will be terrified a minute later. This with the fact your flashlight drains really quickly, then you have to let it recharge for a moment. This single feature causes more FEAR (get it?) for me than the scares themselves. I end up hiding in a corner waiting for my flashlight to recharge, only to do it 20 seconds later. Even the jumpscares in this game can be smart, for example (that I still remember to this day), where you're in an office building, walking down a hallway, with cubicles to the left. All of a sudden, I hear a phone ring, and I instinctively turn to the left. Once I see the phone, a monster just jumps out at me. Call it a jumpscare, but then I had to actually fight that monster, not a thing a lot of horror games do (I'm looking at you, FNAF!). I haven't even gotten to the gunfighting, a reason this game is worthwhile. If it was just a horror game, it wouldn't be all that. But because it's also an incredible first person shooter, with a very satisfying slow-mo button. Just buy it, it's great.			",232,30,3,27,20,3,18

												F.E.A.R. is more than just a FPS with a scary little girl.Actually, the story feels secondary.  Where the fun comes from really are the gameplay and the bloody-dark ambiance. ->Play in Extreme Difficulty to get the true fight sensations.+The manual slow-motion : freaking amazing ! +The feeling when you shoot and kill enemies, and all those particles / blood flying everywhere...+The physics engine. (Havok) I think every single small and middle-sized object can move. +The AI is good.+Nearly perfect audio.+A bunch of memorable moments.-Most environments in the first game look the same. The 2 DLCs are (imo) even better than the original FEAR, some great ideas !NB : Won't please to people who are afraid or dislike heavy atmospheres, violent & scary moments, blood everywhere...

												Playing this game, even after so many years, is being an absolute blast. Especially now when comparing the rig I had back in the day, and this now where the game is going smooth at locked 60 fps, and being played how its creators have envisioned.Besides, other memories are tied to majority of my friends, who were like ""Dude, this sick s**t... I'm not even... I mean what the... This little girl, and.. dark and... I just couldn't. Start>>>uninstall after 10 mins in..."" I don't know but, personally, I didn't find it THAT scary. Maybe I'm weird, or maybe I had Doom3 in the year before, where it trained me well with its cheap-as* tricks with monsters spawning behind your backs,  who knows.So, yeah, the game is called F.E.A.R. Nice play of words which also stands for First Encounter Assault and Recon, special unit made for investigating and battling paranormal activities. You were just transferred into it, nameless protagonist referred simply as ""Point Man"", a dude whos inhuman reflexes earned him his place there, which are presented in-game as a slo-mo, or bullet time. Previously seen in Max Payne games, but found a great place in a FPS game as well.With the help of unknown forces, Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander (also a canibal who enjoys human flesh...) escapes from his confinement, and has a command over a whole battalion of telepathically controlled military clones. Its up to you to stop him, and investigate the ties with the Armacham Corporation, and the little girl known as Alma (who's ghostly presence is here for scary moments), while collecting the pieces of the puzzle by advancing through the chapters and listening to the voice messages or hacking computers.Majority of the game you'll spend battling Fettel's Replica Forces, or occasional Armacham security personel, which doesn't make much of a difference, except for the different models used. Of course, its not some scary experience unless you are playing alone (the lesson which FEAR3 maybe didn't learn), so you won't see any use of your FEAR colleagues, or DELTA Force companions. You may arrive with some of them at the scene, but soon you'll venture alone to pull some switch, just to find them lying in pieces in the lake of blood after getting back...Action in this game is just stellar. Awesome sound design, fires and explosions are looking amazing, particles and sparcles bursting around when highly destructable terrain comes under fire, holes leaving on concrete surfaces (this game is just rich with those) bursting in dust coulds when fired upon, grenades shaking ground and causing nearby light sources to blink, or enemies to lose the balance (if not killed by those),... There's a variety of weapons and grenade types, but my personal favorite is the SMG. Effects and sounds this weapon is producing are so sweet, its such a shame that I have to stop shooting sometimes to reload it. Out of ammo already? But I don't want to use anything else... Oh well, whatever works, I guess.AI is still better than what 99% of other games can muster. Enemies are even reacting to your flashlight, and as soon as they spot you their first reaction is diving into closest cover available. Heck, if there's no cover at all they'll make it by turning the furniture, or try to block your way with those. If you flank them they'll try to minimize the effect of it by running backwards to the next available cover while still shooting at you. In fact, Replicas are even more scary than Alma's freaks (which you'll face occasionaly every 30 mins of hard boilled action). Nothing causes a jump scare like stumbling upon them around the corner, or surprisingly after opening some door. Is he going to shotgun my face? M I going to eat his foot or his grenade? Fighting 3 of them without using slo-mo grants you quick death, even with full body armor and health (moderate difficulty level). Slo-mo serves like a cheat mode which gives you the edge over them. How much AI is smart you can see by activating the slo-mo, they immediately figure out that they are screwed over while yelling ""Oh shieeeee..."", or ""Oh fuuuuu...""...They love throwing grenades so much. Camp in the cover for too long and you can be sure you'll eat it. He is falling down, but ba*tard still managed to throw one down to your nose with his last breath. Boom, back to checkpoint. God help you if you forgot to quicksave since checkpoints are so far away, nothing kills your mood to play further like these things. But AI isn't perfect by any means. You can clearly hear your footseps since you are threading like an elephant, but they can't, so you can just walk to them and melee if you see their backs. Sometimes they are killed by their own grenade for hitting accidentally a part of some fence (physics in this game goes so far that even rocket launcher projectiles are colliding mid air, including with bullets). At least they can taste their own medicine sometimes, and so can you when your own grenade explodes in your face for being shot mid air with gun fire.Their reaction to your shots is very realistic, followed by sounds of every bullet hitting their body armor. But while they are ""dancing"" under fire they'll still try hard to hit you or shoot you, depending on your stance. You'll also have issues with aiming yourself when being shot at. Pretty much everything you can do to them they can do to you. Melee attacks in this game are very deadly, especially your own jump kick which will one hit every regular unit. There's also a special type of cloacked clone combating without any weaponry. Graphics are very detailed even by today's standards, special reward goes to the shadows and their relationship with light sources. They are often overused, hiding low textures here and there. Shadows are so deep you have a feeling that shooting will leave holes in them. There's no much of variety in level design, very linear game full of offices and concrete surfaces. Still, there are some hidden spots, and snooping around pays off for finding reflex and health boosters, while backtracking is mostly minimized. You can see your whole body including legs, and when using variety of melee attacks, while sounds which your equipment is producing while moving/fighting are giving a better feel of weight to the whole thing.There's not much to say about multiplayer since its servers were shut down long ago, while music is almost non-existent and plays occasionaly during larger fights, or longer nightmares caused by Alma.For some reason, I don't seem to be able to review expansion packs separately, so I have to use external links to those.Extraction Point review: http://pastebin.com/7u4a7FXPPerseus Mandate review: http://pastebin.com/7FxpVkd4 ",93,10,1,10,1,0,14

												I have over 700 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #60 - F.E.A.R.Just in time for Halloween, I get to play F.E.A.R. for the first time.As I start the game, it appears I'm playing the role of the nameless, silent protagonist who had just joined the recon team.  I'm briefed about this game named Paxton Fettle that I'm supposed to find.  I'm already a little creeped out as I'm watching a video of this guy snacking on the remains of some security guard.  They've tracked Paxton to some building and the team heads out.I had to laugh as I first entered the building and I see a rat, who scurries behind a trash can, which suddenly goes flying.  I didn't realize Mighty Mouse lived here.  I didn't laugh anymore after that.  As I'm going through the building, and suddenly I see some random flash of some bloody face, for like no reason at all.  And now I'm hearing a crying baby, even though I'm pretty sure there's no baby here.  Then a little later, as we're checking out more of the place, suddently my vision goes weird and my partner disappears into black mist.    At this point I have absolutely no idea what's going on.  And suddenly my partner is back, like nothing has happened.  And he's acting totally normal, so it's like I'm the only one huffing on the crazy gas here.Still looking for this guy.  I'm off on my own again, and I end up on a roof.  Suddenly I see Paxton, but before I can even react he's knocked me to the ground.  But strangely he says some weird things and runs off.  I guess I wasn't tasty?  With Paxton gone, I head back to my team, and the next thing I know we're on a helicopter ride to our next task.My squad has changed, as my original team has split up, and now I'm with a squad of expendables.  After we run into a closed gate, I split off to find the gate controls in the nearby warehouse.  I'm taking the time to explore and it pays off as I find a reflex booster, even though I don't quite understand what good it's for.Natually, once I find the gate controls and open the gate, everything goes to hell.  I hear lots of gunfire so I run back to my squad.  Right as I get back, my vision goes weird again, and I see this creepy little girl, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥she just Kenny Rogers Roasted my entire squad.  My vision clears and I'm looking at their skeletal remains.This game is seriously messed up.Now that my squad is toast, now I need to sync back up with my original team again, so I'm off through the gate.  I enter another building and come across a dying man, right before I get into a shootout with a bunch of guys.It's here that I learn that F.E.A.R. actually has some decent enemy AI.  They know how to take cover, and they like to throw grenades.  I'm hurt pretty bad, and this is when I learn that you only heal up to a 1/4 health without using a medpack.Also, in the mix of all of this fighting, and after dying, the game gives me a hint about the slow motion.  That's what your reflex is for, if you hit Control, time slows down, and it becomes a lot easier to handle yourself in a gun fight.  I wish I had known about this sooner!  It definitely changes the gameplay as you can slow down time to take out several enemies, and then take cover and let your reflex recharge. Now I'm finding myself methodically going through each room in this building, having to painstakingly check every corner carefully.  And I continue to run into pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments like when a body randomly falls from the ceiling for reasons.  There's lot of little touches as well, like coming across a dead guy next to a phone off the hook, and listening ""we're sorry, your call can't be completed.."" At one point, I have to move a shipping crate to unblock a door.  But I also realize I can cross the top of the shipping crate to get from one balcony to another.  Right as I'm halfway over the crate, it's another grey-hair-making moment as I'm suddently getting shot at right as I'm out in the open.After all that, I hop down through a window and suddently I see creepy Firestarter girl, and this time shes about to roast me.  I turn around and run and next thing I know I am blown through a window and knocked out, until I'm found by my team again.  And that was my first hour of F.E.A.R. Looking back, I thought about this voicemail I ran across while I was inside the building.""Yeah, this is Chet in accounting. Nobody seems to know what's going on, but we've been hearing a lot of loud noises..."" Yeah Chet, I don't have any idea what's going on either.  But I'm going to need some new pants.

												F.E.A.R is a first person shooter horror game in which you play as a member of the  F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team which is usually assembled to deal with extraordinary circumstances and pretty messed up paranormal♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pros: + Scary as hell + Tons of unexpected Jump scares+ Interesting story + Mysterious atmosphere + Good FPS Mechanics for a 2004 game + Slow Motion+ 14-16 Hours of Gameplay + Twisted story + Good level design + Unique style + Spent the entire game waiting for Alma to appear on a ladder. Braced myself every time I climbed a ladder. Squeeled louder than a school girl at a One Direction concert when it happened.  LOL :) + By the way it also comes with two expansion packs that are 5 hours long each ( Extra 10 hours of gameplay)+ 9.99$ for 20-25 hours of gameplay narrative xD Cons :- Outdated graphics ( since it's a 2004 game duh..... ) - Sometimes it gets repetitive - No GUCCI :( Verdict : F.E.A.R is an outstanding game for being unique and special among other solid first person shooter games . In addition, this game is soo scary to where you can use your flashlight AND your gun, and the game will STILL scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.Best Horror Game of this generation xD Score : 9.0 /10     ( Must Have )			",137,18,1,10,9,0,9

												My first experience with FEAR was way back in 2007. It was my friend, who iintroduced me to this classic. He bought it as a bundle with his new PS3. He said the reason he picked it up was beecause the cover looks cool, and it looks like ""some fun action FPS game where he can turn his brain off and relax"". until that is he played it and some quite creepy stuffs happening at first 30 minutes, looked back to the box art and realized there is a ghostly figure on top. and be like ""Well, damn, I guess I'm going to invite my friends, we're in for a thriling ride"".And well, there I was, with 3 others, playing this game regularly on weekend, and I must say it was one of the most memorable and ""fun"" game I've ever played, all the screams, pauses, controller-dropping, and ""taking-a-fresh-air"" moments definitely leave a mark.Now, 9 years later, revisiting the game. I'm surprised that F.E.A.R still managed to surprise me, not just with the horror part, but also the fact that it aged really well. It is still one of the scariest game ever, and the tightest, most solid shooting mechanic. And uh.. I'm out of introductory words, and it becomes quite lengthly at this point, so let's jump in.Story (9/10)The story follows F.E.A.R, a special force, countering supernatural activity. In this operation, you are the Point Man, tasked to neutralize a psychic commander and his army who is gone rogue. Well, that's it. That's the  main plot throughout the entire game, and it remained it focus until the end. It's as simple as other action FPS, it doesn't try to be all grandiose, dramtic, and stuff, and that makes FEAR have a tight grip on it's story, focused, and well paced, carefully building up tension so it can reach a maximum impact at the end/  Gameplay (9.5/10)A perfect blend between psychological horror, heavily influenced by Japanese horrors (or eastern horror in general). relying on disturbing imaginery and constant feel of uneasiness, and a really satisfying and tight shooting mechanic / action sequence, that combined with a REALLY intellegent A.I which will make combat feels more intense, tactical, and ""epic"" battles. The guns is your standard old school FPS arsenal: One type of handgun, shotgun, rifle  SMG, and some unique weapons. I particularly like The Penetrator, because reasons. Oh, and how can we forget SloMow / Reflex? One word. Badass. It's not just a gimmick. it's an esssential feature, the fast paced action sequence, mixed with numbers of enemies and level design that put you on disadvantage at later stages, you'll find yourself  on situations where you just have to go out of your cover and bicycle kick those fellas and blast the other ones' head with a shotgun afterward, Sound (9/10)Great voice acting, awesome soundtrack, and overall great sound design. Now, why I rate it so high despite my very minimal explanation? Because it's all comes down to this..Graphic (9.5/10)If you feel like I left out many things on previous aspects, you are right, I do. Because everything comes down to this. Graphic, or more precisely atmosphere, this is what ties all aspects of FEAR together, the thing that makes it regarded as a classic. The atmosphere on FEAR is pitch perfect. Story, gameplay, sound, level design, all of it is build around atmosphere. And until this day, it's atmosphere is the one that makes it holds up even after 11 years. I will break down several aspect of it:- ]Visual: The lighting was (and is) fantastic, great contrast between light and dark. The lighting alone is pretty unsettling, and with it's attenttion of detail and well thought out level design make even a well lit and neat offices doesn't  feel less disturbing than it's more messed up counterpart. And then we have the hallucination, which is simply mind♥♥♥♥ery and downright mental. Also, F.E.A.R might have what I like to call ""Half Life-tier level transition"", it's varied, smooth, and feelss natural. It also has a very nice stylized gore and slow-mo effects, it makes shooting someone with a shotgun in the head more satisfying (especially with the guns recoil, and sounds, make the weapons deliver a real punch when it hits)- Sound: Cracking walls, child's laugher, rattling metal, and any sound effeccts that will plays out in the right place and time, that makes you question your sanity. Oh, can you guess how many times I got a mini heart attack when I accidentally kicking a soda can? It's 4. I counted. - Story: As you progress through, you'll find voice mails and intels scattered around ATC, and this is why I score the story highly. It's immersive, they told you only what you need to know at the moment, progressively revealing darker and more disturbing side of the story, as you moved to  the core of Armacham. Overall (9.5/10) FEAR and it's classic status is well deserved. A game that so ahead at it's time. A horror game that will send chill down your spine, that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares (I don't say there are none, it has it's moment of course, even that is quite clever), an action FPS game that make your adrenaline rushing, and a tactical game that actually demand you to think and plan before you drop your first bullet. A seemingly linear game by design, but it actually encourage some exploration to get some boosters (HP and reflex) and tactical advantage over enemies. Overall a timeless classic that even it's sequel fails to emulate.Short DLC Review: Extraction Point (8/10):- Story: ""I know, it doesn't make sense. Not much does anymore."" - Paxton Fettel.- Gameplay: Same, fun gunfight, more gory, and more mental hallucination, especially the fifth interval, oh God the fifth interval. The new weapons are cool. Less explorable maps, and mostly a rearranged version of the first half maps of the base game.Perseus Mandate  (6.5/10)Uninspired. Could've been a really interesting side story, if it wasn't for the bland writing Why do it feels like I'm going through the last few intervals of the base game and the first few areas of Extraction Point again?

												Even though this game's enging is dated at this point, it is still very entertaining.  Having been certain that any attempt at combining horror and action would come out a failure (I'm looking at you Resident Evil 5), F.E.A.R. manages to make it work.The story is well written, the combat mechanics are smooth, and the unexpected horror scenes are creepy enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your playthrough.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person shooters and horror, as long as they can handle dated graphics.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												Great game, i love it.For it's time it has pretty good GRAFX and PHYSX, not to mention the light / shadow effects which quite frankly put modern games to shame. Plus oh my god guys i'm finally playing as a guy with LEGS.Shoulda called the game S.P.O.O.K. because, well you know why probably. Stands for ""Scary Paranormal Ooga bOoga Killedmeagain"".Aaaaaaaaand i almost forgot to mention the dank♥♥♥♥♥slowmo power. I'm a tiiiiime wizard.My only concern is the main character.He's breathing rather heavily through most of the game. What's the lore behind this? Does the poor guy have asthma? Makes me not want to put him through all of this, poor guy should just take a rest at home and stick with the inhaler.But i suppose that wouldn't make for an very exciting game, would it.

												This game was a revolution in showing how games can provide a top-notch blockbuster cinematic experience. F.E.A.R. combines incredible, energetic and innovative combat, never seen before in a videogame, with thrilling story of the horror of your worst nightmares featuring angry little girl with long black hair that is even more terrifying than her spirtual Japanese mother Samara. F.E.A.R. is a hell of a ride that is perfect in combining its elements into one masterpiece that just works. And even after 6 years after its release the perfect audiovisual presentation still works and along with the horror that lurks everywhere it will chill the hell out of you to the point of nerdy tears of awesomesauce.

												This game was released on October 17th in 2005. It is now August 6th, 2016.It has been almost 11 years since this games release and to this day it still holds up incredibly well. The graphics are gritty and still pretty detailed in a lot of respects, the effects are still incredible, the movements and animations still as solid as ever. The voice acting is timeless, the soundtrack is as great as ever at building the right atmosphere for this game.While it lacks some features included in more modern FPS games such as Iron-Sights (the game utilizes an old-school Zoom-In style) it makes up for it by including features that now are not so common, such as the ability to lean around corners (Fun if you're a more tactical player, perhaps less used however if you are a martial-arts warrior) and health kits. The gameplay and gunfights themselves still hold up incredibly with a high emphasis on skill and very little handholding. If you so desire it and have the precision, you can face a Mech unit and shoot its missiles as they are fired, then kick it to death. This remains true even on the highest difficulties.The horror aspect varies from person to person. I personally find it to be genuinely creepy, its pretty well done and manages to be fairly eerie all around. Some may not like the jump scares much, but for every jumpscare in the game there are 2 moments of subtle horror. Reflections in mirrors, pictures on monitors, and I'm sure some things I still haven't noticed even throughout my 6 or so playthroughs of the game.Another of this game's virtues is that it doesn't hold your hand much in terms of where to go (although levels can be somewhat linear) and the story elements. If you want to know more about the story, it is important that you pick up the audio logs and answering machines.This game is in my honest opinion a 9/10, and I mean that by the old standard where 9/10 was absolutely phenominal. I cannot reccomend this game enough.Finally I'll say this to any new buyers: FEAR is fantastic and I think FEAR: Extraction Point is a great addition. Perseus Mandate however isn't too interesting, and I think it is probably for the best to stay away from FEAR 2 (which, while not terrible, isn't more than say a 6/10 FPS) and definitely stay away from FEAR 3.Hope this review was useful.P.S. Watch out for that ladder.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon is a first-person shooter psychological horror video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment and the first game in the F.E.A.R. series. It was released on October 18, 2005.F.E.A.R. puts you in the shoes of ""The Point man"", a secret special ops group of the U.S. government specialized in dealing with paranormal threats, When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named Paxton Fettel taking command of a battalion of telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers, seizing control of Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, and killing all its occupants. A strong atmospheric shooter, FEAR does so many things right, but fails in some categories drastically. While the shooting is top notch, dynamic lighting and a solid soundtrack makes this an enjoyable shooter, the lack of enemy variety and repetitive nature of the leves might turn off some players. You are equiped with a fairly diverse arsenal from the basic pistol to more advanced weapons like the Type-7 Particle weapon and many other. The bullet time is superb, the amount of enviromental destruction is here aswel, as particles and walls shatter after you shoot them. It's a briliant showcase of how a shooting something should behave. Not many games offer this level of detailt, to be honest, and this one is quite old. The story is quite nice, a bit generic with the whole *experiment gone wrong theme* and some of the plot elements are delivered via phone calls or debriefed during loadtimes. Nothing too over the top, it gets the job done and keeps the player interested. Overall this game has much to offer, and falls into the category of ""old-school PC shooting games"", reminescent of the goldern era of shooters (1994-2004) with health pick-ups, no cover system, just plain balls to the walls action. Lastly, I'd like to talk about the AI, which has received much praise, and it deserves it. Your enemies use tactics and commands to adapt to certain situations you put them into, responding adequately, making them feel more human than just lines of code. When you shoot them, they react in a realistic manner, thanks to some great physics in the game, overall they perform well enough. I'll list specifically what I loved about the game and disliked about itThe good:Solid gunplayGreat amosphereGood sound/music designChallenging enemy AIDestructive enviroments, awesome lighting effects, cool death animationsSense of dread and solitude throughout the campaignExploration is rewardedThe bad:Repetitive level designLack of enemy varietyStory is delivered poorly and not developed enoughShort lenght for the campaignToo many health pick-ups and ammo, not too challengingDead multiplayerThis is a 7/10 for me, short of a 9 because of the level design being so primitive at times. A must own. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

F.E.A.R.2007, I put in the CD of my first PlayStation 3 game, and watched what is perhaps the most beautiful and artistic intro for a video game ever created. This to me, is with no doubt, the best game of all time. I've never been as awe-struck for a video game as I was for this one. The plot is fantastically intriguing, which while not directly told, keeps you wanting to know everything that happens, makes curiosity grasp into you, and question things, with an overall outstanding writing. The gameplay is a perfect mix of an old school and a modern shooter, appealing to nearly every FPS audience, with one of the, if not the smartest A.I. I've ever seen for its time. Astounding graphics, and even though it shows some of its age now, it can still be very impressive. Spooky and haunting atmospheres accompanied with spine-tingling soundtrack and an unfathomable amount of detail. Monolith's masterpiece. 10.0/10.0Extraction PointIf I had to define this pack with a few words, it would be darkness, and hopelessness. This takes F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere to the next level, and makes you ponder about everything that's going on around you. The soundtrack helps a lot in this. This pack features 3 new weapons and some new enemies, making the gameplay significantly refreshing. An epic plot line along with dark environments, Timegate kept true to the original game's formula and brought the fans what they wanted. 9.7/10.0Perseus MandateThis action packed piece comes with some of F.E.A.R.'s best firefights, and is very different from the first pack. It works as a side story to the original F.E.A.R. and Extraction Point, and brings some new characters, such as the wisecracking Lieutenant Chen and the determined Captain Raynes. This pack contains more new weapons and enemies, very uncommon level design, goosebumping soundtrack, great voice acting and storyline, as well as a nicely set balance between scares à la Extraction Point and gun battles against Replicas, ATCs, and Nightcrawlers alike. 9.3/10.0 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the single most challenging first person shooters of all time on higher difficulties, but exceptional for the fact that it isn't due to sheer reflex demand, it's not due to high health parameters, and it's not due to fake difficulty parameters all over the place.It is due to the fact that this game has some of the smartest AI in the last decade or two, bar none.Half Life 2, Crysis? The AI in those games has NOTHING on this, with enemies flanking you, getting better positioning, calling out your flashlight, and avoiding your fire at all cost.At the end of the day, slow motion powers won't save you, good tactical sensibilities will.Oh, also it ends up really scary due to the contrast of grounded, realistic opponents with good AI to supernaturally driven, all powerful entities that can kill with a thought.

												•	Concept: You are a genetically enhanced super soldier known as ""The Pointman"" and are part of the First Encounter Assault Recon force employed by the U.S. government. You and your team are ordered to track down and kill Paxton Fettel, an escaped and deranged psychic commander with hundreds if not thousands of ""Replica"" clone soldiers at his command. There's also a creepy little girl and a corporation with secrets to hide...•	Graphics: Solid graphics for 2005, good overall lighting and visual effects to boot. They shine most in the heat of combat or when in a tense/scary situation.•	Sound: Crackling gunfire, flickering lights, swinging fixtures, all contribute in some way to the overall gameplay and audio experience, whether alone in a dark hallway or shotgunning someone into a picture frame.•	Playability: Some excessive combat encounters or repetitive level designs are compensated by a reasonable and judicious pacing between horror and action elements, and controls are intuitive (with key remapping!).•	Entertainment: Additions like slow-mo action and quicksaving before encounters always leads to enjoyable and sometimes humorous moments, and unraveling the story of the game as you go may both frighten and intrigue you.•	Replay Value: Moderate•	Score: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edited at 2017. february 1st after finishing the trilogy and expansionsFEAR - a shooter that's positives still hold up really well, and the weak points haven't got worse either.The game is a suspense / horror FPS where a simple mission about capturing a target turns out to be a chase that ends up uncovering things from a corporate's past, hence building the story.The FPS parts are nicely done, the weapons feel really good to use, but some diversity would have been better, there are only 8? weapons, and the universally good weapons are available at every pat of the story.  Explosives are awesome in this game, they feel really powerful.The gameplay and the game itself... feels old  in a way (the game was made in 2005.) While shooting is great, and the story is really interesting from the second half when actually useful informations surface, vast parts of the game could be summed up as running in very similar looking narrow corridors and stairs under flickering lights, shooting clone soldiers, and hope that I'll find the next morsel for the story / a a creepy apparation.  While the game is not really long, there's remarkably small amounts of stuff going on but shooting at enemies, and it can get old - having a really easy last few chapters doesn't really help, either.It's an outstanding shooter on a room to room level, but as a whole game it's really lacking because of the unimaginative level design. So afterall, I wholeheartedly recommend it for lovers of FPS games who don't care (too much) about pacing and the story, but at the same time if someone wants to play for the story while doing some shooting inbetween, it gets old really soon.About Expansions in a nutshell:Neither of them is canon, so FEAR 2 doesn't take them into consideration.Extraction Point continues the game, having more cinematic elements and scares, but ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion and adds nothing to the story. No new weapons either.Perseus Mandate: a lot heavier focus on combat than base game IMO, with a few neat additional weapons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fantastic game. If you're a horror fan, it's a must play.Not only is it a very strong horror game, it's a damn good first person shooter. It shows a very strong polish that allows it to defy age. The environment's hitboxes were particularly strong. They all seemed very accurate, and I was able to use the thin gaps in the environment to my advantage. Not once was I hit by a bullet and questioned that it shouldn't have been able to hit me, nor the contrary.The graphics hold up well. I wasn't distracted by the graphics like I was in, say, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Genres play a role in that, of course.The story is interesting, but lacks a grip. What I mean is, I was eager to reach the end, but I wasn't interested in the journey. For the first half of the game, the notes and buildup to the story are rather dull. It picks up the closer you get. It took me a couple weeks to play through the first 6 hours, but then I completed the next 5 all in the same day. The first part wasn't bad, but I usually found myself playing other games because I wanted to play them more than F.E.A.R. The gameplay is, simply put, fun. I enjoy first person shooters, and this is better than many in that regard. The combat was challenging at times, but not rage-inducing. The AI is excellent. What I love is that they're not given benefits to make it more challenging. If you're quiet and sneaking, they don't know you're there until you open up on them. Once they know where you are, they strategize and move, focusing on taking you out. Once enough time passes without any indication you're still there, they'll take note of that and expand their focus and try to locate you. It's the best AI I've played with in a considerable amount of time. The environment usually allows for creativity in the situation. As in, it's not always linear. The character gets unnerved. Getting hit with bullets severely impacts your aim (which sways ever so slightly). This is what I mean by polish; everything had its fair share of attention.I usually hear F.E.A.R. regarded as one of the best horror games, and it deserves the spot. While the story takes too long to get moving, the rest of the game excels from start to finish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Classic, fun, scary. Being a huge fear fan myself, hell i went so far to roleplay as Alma once on steam, i really enjoy the series. I played F.E.A.R 2 and 3 before this, and 2 was a blast, 3 was awesome with my friend. however, this is the best. PROS +Smooth, good combat. better then COD's or Mirrors Edge.+Problay the only one in the series to make you s*** your own pants. it'd be great if it allowed 2 player splitscreen, but its really old so i'll let that go.+Alma is a adorable little girl, unlike future installments.+Quite challenging. CONS -If you save while shooting, you'll get stuck in a cycle of shooting and a aiming stance when loading the save. Can be fixed by crouching and jumping at the same time, but can get very annoying. although the game is old, so this isn't too big.-Some points of the game can get dumb and become a COD copycat.-why fettel OVERALL 10/10. I haven't even beat this game and i'm loving the expiernce i've been getting. Replayable, scary, fun, classic.			",71,7,0,9,7,0,0

												A true gem. All elements combine to form one of the best FPS you will ever play. Graphics hold up very well. Combat is super satisfying, especially with the bullet time element. Enemy AI is some of the best you'll see, with advanced environmental manoeuvres and coordination.The horror elements and their presentation is excellent. Ditching the trend of cheap scares, FEAR presents true horror in a slow burn, creepy sort of way. You are unsettled rather than startled. More games should take note of this.If you haven't played it, and if you like FPS and horror, you have no excuse. Especially at its price nowadays.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. or First Encounter Assault Recon, is a psychological horror first person shooter, amazingly well designed and one of the few games that always made me feel uneasy while playing it. This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it. You play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created. The story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable.F.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more. Alma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself. The game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart.F.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget.The Good-Creepy Atmosphere-Amazing story-Visuals, Sound and Particle system-Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games-Enemy AI is brilliant-Good selection of weaponsThe Bad-Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing-Could have used a little more variety in the environments9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine Michael Bay making a movie after binging on those Americanised-Japanese horror movies from ~2000 (The Eye, The Grudge, The Ring, etc), for me this is basically 'F.E.A.R'. I loved it. It's a First Person Shooter with some horror elements, it mixes the 'bullet-time' features of the Max Payne franchise, with some dark, twisted horror images from Fatal Frame. The story is pretty straight-forward (much like the corridors you'll spend most of your time walking through), but does it's best to be mysterious as it dripfeeds news and information to you via laptops and answering machine messages left behind.In truth the story isn't really the hook for the game, or at least it wasn't for me. I was drawn in by the bullet-time mechanic where you can slow down time and rip carnage into the enemies who try to stop you as you hunt down Paxton Fettel. There was some strangely satisfying about turning a corner in slow-motion, and blasting your cannon like shotgun into the soldiers and heavily armed troops. The red mist of blood, and the giblets of limbs and organs spraying, slowly and awkwardly across the room. I'm not crazy or anything, but the visuals and warped audio mix just gave the feature 'something', something extra to Max Payne which is perhaps best known for it's bullet-time. Besides, I'm a total sucker for insane ragdoll physic deaths... you know what; I'm not doing a good job of painting myself as a mentally sane, upstanding member of society here, am I.


FEARsby Flop 
A Video of F.E.A.R.
By: Chris

			World Record High Jump Death		


Moving on.Visually the game has held up since it's release in 2005, even if I did mistakenly start playing without checking the graphic settings (which were all on LOW to begin with). So do yourself a favour and ramp all the settings up to maximum if your rig can handle it. If not, don't worry it'll still look decent for a 10 year old game.The only real issue I had was with the audio, which seemed strangely unbalanced and left you feeling like your guy had the loudest footsteps in the world. However, in saying that (and I'm no expert) the guns made a great noise, and the bullet cases/shells hitting the floor was pretty satisfying too. In short, F.E.A.R was a fun, FPS game with a few jump scares based around it's 2000 era horror drawn inspiration. A very linear game made memorable be a few setplays, shotguns and bullet-time. Don't wait a decade to play this game like I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 F.E.A.R. First impressions: Nice game. FEAR puts you in the pants of some spec-op guy who's trying to figure out what happened to a secret military compound. Your team gets in, and then...well let's just say that things go bad. Real bad. Highly-trained soldiers come at you and you gotta defend yourself fast.Genre: FPS (Doom-like)/supernatural themes. For a game this ""old"" it's still a very solid shooter.AI: quite good (sometimes enemy flankers try to encircle you while others are suppressing).Difficulty: intermediate (due to the presence of ""free"" bullet-time).Plot: not bad, but in my opinion it's not central, for it's rather stale. It doesn't really drive you towards the finale (actually it does but as for me it's not as good as the Half-Life saga), it's more a tell-tale of evil experiments (rather cliche).Atmosphere: definitely dark and makes you feel like walking inside a (suprise) huge haunted house. Graphics:  While it would surely need a graphics-boost straight away, visuals are still appearing good.Audio: In my opinion it's one of the core factors in determining the eerie atmosphere that grows darker and darker as the game progresses. FUN FACTOR: crazy shootouts and major firefights with bad guys (as you may imagine) it's the core of this game. Conclusion: although the plot is rather mild, graphics are slightly dated, the gunfights are still fun today. Definitely worth a playthrough if you're into supernatural shooters that focus on ""decaying"" atmosphere and, I dare say, a little claustrophobic at times.Thanks for reading. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While Half-Life back in 1998 hypnotized the stagnated first-person-shooter genre with groundbreaking narrative, enhanced puzzle elements, immersed atmosphere within cinematic settings and intelligent artificial intelligence, F.E.A.R. expertly continued to elevate the modern shooter in 2005, primary from an outstanding cinematic standpoint. Although essentially recapturing the spirit of creative Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, the sci-fi classic The Matrix and terrifying The Ring remake, developer Monolith ambitiously established an intriguing original concept as well as an iconic figure no matter the various influences.The first-rate atmosphere became apparent immediately as the newest member (that would be you) of the First Encounter Assault Recon is set to carry out a classified objective within a military task force that deals with paranormal circumstances. Apparently, a mad military commander has become a liability after taking command of a secret army of cloned soldiers that are telepathically linked to him, causing mayhem within a restricted area in an unspoken American city in order to acquire something unknown. The F.E.A.R. team along with a Delta Force unit obviously issue a respond to this threat. Strengthened by frequent voice mails and radio news reports, the twisted story of the commander and the mysterious appearance of Alma unfold engaging and dramatic.A hectic blend of dynamic action and suspenseful horror was presented. Distinguished gun battles were downright spectacular to witness, creating stunning particle effects that in combination with the finest bursts of exciting slow-motion provided dramatically beautiful and wickedly entertaining action sequences in remarkably bloody repercussions. The lighting and shadowing model kept high class in bringing the mood, and so did the excellent music and solid voice-over. The movement patterns and animations of the enemies were well-made, but were obviously not as talked-about as their strikingly sharp artificial intelligence. Encountering these aggressive and tactically oriented opponents was challenging and incredibly unpredictable; they took advantage of the game’s physics system by knocking over objects to create cover, they fiercely reacted to your presence and actively communicated with one another. The weapons at your disposal, though only capable of carrying three at a time, were versatile, relatively equally efficient (if approached correctly) and actually dangerous, providing powerful punches to both enemies and surroundings, meaning they were implemented for a reason since you were as vulnerable as the enemy.Although the spiritual follow-up of Half-Life came out strong on so many levels, F.E.A.R. clearly fell short on some of them. The mention of repetitive environments that basically consisted of an industrial area and an office complex could not be ignored; at times the second-rate variety made progression jaded which fuelled a negative impression that the levels lasted too long. While the atmosphere was strong and coherent, the actual horror aspect came out less effective. The imagery was certainly on several occasions unsettling, showing off a few successful jump scares, but the scare tactics became slightly familiar over time and the pattern of predictability indisputable. However, just like Doom 3 at that time, certain tension brought out from the atmosphere was consistent enough to keep you alert and that quality somewhat redeemed the mentioned predictability. While particle effects, lighting and sound were astounding, the level design and textures were less complex and kind of mediocre looking. In addition, some of the character models felt wooden and appeared like plastic dolls.Essentially innovative and distinctly competent, F.E.A.R. elevated the modern shooter in spectacular proportions, which reasonably ended with an explosive cliff hanger. While combining action and horror, the incredibly beautiful and dynamic action portion - intensified by outstanding bullet time and amazingly clever opponents - clearly surpassed (and even to some extent neutralized) the fairly weakened horror note. Still, the unshakable lack of variety associated with the environments and level design had a significant impact on the general impression. All things considered, F.E.A.R. was and still is a skilful and relevant yet slightly jaded and overrated contribution of first-person-shooter history.7, 5 / 10  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 12 years F.E.A.R. is still one of the greatest FPS on PC, even though it is a decade old, it has aged pretty well. It works quite nice under Windows 10 64-bit, just set the main executable compatibility to Windows XP or to Windows 7 if you want to keep the Steam Game Overlay.It has some good moments of tension, and some good horror aspects, the first time you play it, it will give you some scares and an uneasy feeling. Graphically looks very nice, it doesn't demand a powerful PC to obtain some good frames per second. A must have in your Steam Collection, you can grab the F.E.A.R. Bundle at Bundle Stars for US$5.00 that's the main game with 2 DLC's. + F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin+Reborn DLC, and F.E.A.R. 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is easily one of the greatest FPS games of all time. From the adrenaline-fueled shootouts, to the haunting atemosphere and audio, to the tight gameplay, everything about F.E.A.R (and its enjoyable expansions) delivers. Highly recommended for all gamers. This is one you should not miss! Although it is unfortunate that the multiplayer isn't availiable any longer, there is enough replayablilty in the single-player itself that it is a jusifiable purchase. As stated earlier, don't miss F.E.A.R.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2005... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*At first glance, F.E.A.R may seem like any other FPS with features that have ""been done"". Well its based on a modified Quake engine, ""can't possibly be any better"".   ""Nothing will be as creepy as Doom"". ""Bullet time, pfft…what is this Max Payne?""  Sure at first glance F.E.A.R has everything any other FPS has to offer; . F.E.A.R - First Encounter Assault Recon a secret military agency which you can probably guess by its name was assembled to deal with unexplained phenomenon situations. It is extremely difficult not to spoil this game by describing the plot outline.  The opening cutscene explains the game’s antagonist, Paxton Fettel loses his mind and takes control of hundreds of military cloned soldiers. (Why are they cloned? I have no idea).   Fettel and his army of cloned soldiers go on a rampage through a small town killing dosens of civilians and seem to be looking for someone or something. Of course it is up to you, the player, to search the city, wipe out the cloned army and stop Fettel.   The kick to the story is sometimes Fettel will be talking to you from a ghostly apparition.  He will appear suddenly at the end of the hallway, but disappear as soon as you turn the corner; there is also some strange connection between a small child in a red dress, creeping you out by appearing and disappearing in the strangest places while laughter and crying fills your ears.  The best feature of F.E.A.R is the weapon control and gameplay.  Most FPS have a variety of weapons you can lug around throughout the game but usually do not distinguish recoil, change in ammo or a feel for power and weight.   F.E.A.R's engine allows the player to feel all these features on every weapon. A simple right click on the mouse will allow the player to aim the weapon (much like Call of Duty) and at the same time change the speed of the character to a slow walk, becoming a silence killer. When an assault gun is fired, the recoil is felt, obviously not through the mouse, but on screen; the bullets penetrating plaster walls, wooden boxes, paper, fiberglass, tile ceiling, glass windows creating a cloud of dust and debris right in your face.Among the series of weapons you can find during the course of the game including several assault weapons, dueling handguns, a nail gun, shotgun, rocket launcher and some sort of laser rifle, all carry very unique firing recoils and bullet wounds effects to your enemy. You cannot keep picking up weapon after weapon and continue your away through the game. F.E.A.R only allows three, including your handguns if you choose to carry them (I don't :)). You also carry along a series of grenades which all seem to come in handy at one point or another. A standard HE grenade, a proximity grenade and a very cool remote grenade.   Use them wisely, they are scarce.  If all these weapons and grenades weren't a lot to choose from, you are given the option of hand to hand combat.   Whether it is the simple melee with your rifle, slide kick, punch or jump kick you can kick the crap out of your enemy instead of riddling them with bullets. However, be prepared to face well armored opponents who will not flinch to a weak kick to the face.   I got a little jump kick happy and found myself falling out of a 50 story building because I thought I was jumping into the next office. Oops. Aside from this enormous improvement in weapon control, F.E.A.R also gives the ability to the player to slow down time. Yes this is a beaten to death feature and can be seen in Max Payne 1 and 2 and The Matrix series, but when you combine the previous feature with slowing down time, you can almost see every single dust particle rendered by your video card.   Also be very prepared when you use the time button and place your shotgun an inch away from your enemy for a giant red cloud of…well you know. To go along with bullet time, F.E.A.R carries a great soundtrack with most impressive sound effects. How about hearing every single shell that hits the ground when you're firing your assault rifle while at the same time hearing the bullets pierce your enemy and the wall?   Well that is exactly what you hear… but don't be freaked out by the whispers coming from the dark hallway when your flashlight goes dead and your radio hits a wave of static and your turn around to see a child crawling on the floor towards you.The AI in F.E.A.R is not bad. Enemies will react to certain situations which I was very impressed with.   If you throw a grenade, one of the enemies will call out. ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥grenade."" And the team will scatter.  Same situation if an enemy throws a grenade, the rest of the team will prepare for a ""fire in the hole"".   Also if they hear you running down the hall, they will turn towards the sound of your footsteps, but you can just as easily walk in a different direction, sneak up behind them and see them all staring at the original spot they heard you from. The cons? Well there isn't much, but one thing is for sure, you better have AT LEAST an X800 to run this game on high.   I've said this before about Doom 3 and HL2, if you're playing these games on low or medium quality; you are not getting much out of these games compared to what you see with a top of the line card, especially if you are turning off shadows. F.E.A.R is a CPU, memory and graphics HOG will truly test your system.Bottom Line: F.E.A.R is quite easily one of the most unique, freaky, best looking games to date.   With a combination of today's horror qualities most resembling the Ring, graphics that utilize today's best graphics cards and the best use of gameplay in FPS, F.E.A.R will fit in your collection with ease.   I wish the surrounding environment changed more throughout the game like HL2; changing the time of day, or setting instead of the same warehouse, office building, sewer maps that even still look the same, but I hardly notice when I'm trying to figure out where those whispers are coming from.

I Am 11 Years Late To This Game!!If you are a fan of Half-Life, Red Faction or even Counter Strike you will enjoy this game. It is genuinely full of scares and some freaky enemies. Plays like an old classic first-person shooter, you pick up health packs and ammo, none of that regenerating health from more modern games. I've yet to play the expansion packs but i know that after beating the main campaign at 9 and a half hours, i will enjoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was naive enough to think that a 2005 first person shooter game could not scare the hell out of a 20 yo guy.Man I was so wrong... This game is truly a great title of horror. Not because of the gore or stuff, but because of the extreme tension during the entire game. It's outstanding.I suggest trying to search something about this Wen Chi Lee who appears in the first line of credits. The fact that there is NO information about her intensifies the mystery of the game.Totally recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it comes down to it, the main reason you’re reading this is to determine whether F.E.A.R and its expansions are worth your time. Can a game which is over a decade old still hold up to today’s standards? FEAR (from this point on I’m ignoring the punctuated form) wants you to believe that it’s a horror slash first person shooter combo. Heck, the name, plot synopsis and cover art lead you to believe that you’ll be afraid to play it if you’re left alone in a dark room. Being generous FEAR comes across as a FPS punctuated with horror elements....things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, a jump scare here and there and creepy monologues from the antagonist. The reason that it doesn’t truly convey the dread that it wants to is because plot wise FEAR feel s slightly empty. Initially it has atmosphere, but after the umpteenth generic corridor, followed by the same old office cubicles, that sense of foreboding begins to wear thin. Environmentally FEAR is repetitive with a capital R....at times mind numbingly so.Story wise, Paxton Fettel, our antagonistic psychic terrorist, has escaped captivity and taken control of a small army of clone soldiers. He has then proceeded to aggressively takeover Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC), annihilate a Special Forces team and put on a special performance of Macbeth for his hostages(ok, maybe I was fibbing about of those things). And like it or lump it the FEAR team, or rather you, are given the task of eliminating that threat. The plot is mainly relayed through telephone voice mail messages and laptops scattered throughout the building, creating a fragmented picture of what is actually going on. Radio’s broadcast ongoing news of the attack and your team gradually fills you in on the patchwork of information that they have uncovered as the game progresses. The main problem with this is that it’s actually quite difficult to obtain a deeper insight into the back-story beyond the obvious plot thread (no spoilers here, but I had to read around the subject to learn more about what actually happened that were only had briefly hinted at in-game). In fact contrary to popular opinion, the most immersive point in the game (story wise), was a pseudo-escort section.....the most reviled of all gameplay devices actually makes the player feel connected to the game! Who’d a thunk it!!! However, what FEAR lacks in environmental variety and Shakespearean intrigue it makes up for in spades with its gunplay, SloMo mechanic and the enemy encounters. Whilst there is little in the way of breathtaking spectacle, FEAR’s encounters are memorable primarily because your enemies, the Replica Soldiers, display a degree of AI probably not expected in a game of this pedigree. Rather than blindly running into the fray, they cautiously engage and to underestimate them is to end up dead rather quickly. Their radio chatter adds to the sense of menace, and whilst after a while you’ll have hear d most of it more than a few times, the foes in FEAR actually go some way in creating that sense of jeopardy. Then there’s FEAR’s “unique” Max Payneian mechanic – SloMo. Our nameless protagonist has heightened reflexes that allow him to slow the world around him down to a crawl, whilst he is free to wreak havoc. “Point Man” can’t move faster, but he can aim and shoot whilst his opponents slow to a snail’s pace, and more often than not, toggling the SloMo on and off to create a balletic path of destruction will yield maximum results. In fact SloMo is strangely addictive, jumping up to flying kick a soldier and then shooting his partner with your shotgun, as you then spin to decimate the rest of the group is satisfying in a marvelously visceral way. And it’s there that FEAR holds its trump card. The gunplay borders on sublime....assault rifles actually feel like they pack a punch, dual wielding pistols is curiously fun, the sniper rifle feels deadly and the shotgun.....oh the shotgun. FEAR’s shotgun is a work of art...enemy’s blossom into clouds of red mist, splitting into pieces as you run like a crazy person into their number. FEAR’s weaponry feels just right, and your opposition don’t just soak up damage never to fall....these guns actually pack a punch (although conversely don’t expect to be let off making a mistake as you’re liable to die very quickly if caught out in the open).   And then there’s the environmental destruction, walls become pockmarked, blood sprays everywhere, grenades emit a visible blast zone. It almost becomes fun to see how much damage you can cause with your weapons during each face-off.So, great gunplay, good enemy AI, nice long campaign which is a bit repetitive and a running undercurrent of plot.....does it hold up today? Probably; if you can tolerate a bit of repetition then FEAR is definitely worth a run through. But hold that thought, as that’s excluding the expansions that you’ll also receive as part of this package. The first, Extraction Point, is a straight on continuation of the main game (non-canon however as these expansions were handled by different developer, TimeGate Studios rather than Monolith). Taking the final sequence of FEAR and running with it ultimately it’s more of the same with the addition of a couple of new weapons. Does it break anything? No. Does it significantly add or change anything? Again, no. So if the main game worked for you and you were after more of the same then Extraction Point will fill that need. The plot is an interesting sideline but ultimately you know what you’re getting.  Perseus Mandate mixes things up a little with a different protagonist (not that you’d notice of course) enhanced enemies, more use of companion characters (Steve Blum, loving your work!) and more new weapons. It actually boasts a couple of creepy moments that seemed more absent from Extraction Point, and rounds out some of the finer plot details. Added to that the game features some bonus time attack arenas to give the player a tad more challenge, and as a result Perseus Mandate actually feels like a solid way to end the first FEAR “series”.Given that you understand the shortcomings of a set of games that are around a decade old, FEAR and its two add-ons are around 20 hours of fun. At times yet another grey corridor/office room will make you want to scream, but persevere and you’ll experience the joys of one of the best shotguns ever conceived in game form.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is easily one of the best FPS of all time. The graphic still holds up surprisingly well in 2015 especially with downsampling, forced AA + soft shadow + SSAO, indoor environment has sharp texture, excellent lighting and shadow effect.Sound effect is also excellent, you can turn on EAX if you have one of those supported soundcards. Good sound effect truly makes a different in horror games. The gun blazing sound effect in slow-mo is beautiful just like in the movie Matrix.The game features some of the best supernatural horror sequences and firefights in traditional FPS. The enemy AI is one of the best in gaming history, and it makes the singleplayer so much more fun to play. The enemy reponds to your action very intelligently, but even on extreme difficulty, with help of slow-mo and proper positioning, you can still win most fights without too much effort. Unlike the bots in Call of Duty Veteran difficulty, the super soldiers in F.E.A.R. don't have superhuman reflex and aims, you can stealth kill a lot of them if you are careful enough. The enemy AI is smart but never cheat, it makes the game fun but never frustrating.Good selection of weapons, all the weapons even the pistols are useful and feels powerful. It features one of the most powerful shotguns in FPS: good range, fast reload time, plenty of ammo, and powerful enough to one shot most soldier to pieces (literally) at point-blank. At bit overpowered in singleplayer, but it is a lot of fun.The story is actually quite good for a FPS.Bottom line, if you like blood (lots of blood) and dismemberment, then you will like this game. These over the top gore effect are very exaggerated and can be rather hilarious at times, but entertaining nonetheless.I had fond memories of this game back in 2005. I replayed it again and in my opinion, it still holds up pretty well against mordern FPS. It saddens me to see this legendary PC series going downhill over the past years, I hope someday we will get a good sequel it deserves, or a remaster maybe?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a narrative that keeps warming up, leaving you anxious to see what is going to happen. The gameplay is a solid experience, with a very competent enemy AI, the aiming system is a little hard to get used to, but no deal breaker. The soundtrack is mostly made of noises that contributes to get your♥♥♥♥♥out of the chair in a jump, and there a few jump-scares, but they only work once. The game is a little short though, but it is sure as hell, worth of a replay on the hardest level.8.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R Despite being a good eight years old, The folks at monolith have made a game that still stands against the test of time. While the graphics are undeniably dated, F.E.A.R. still manages to pull you in to a dark tale that revolves around an cannibal convict, a creepy little girl, and a horrible secret. You play as Point-Man, a silent protaganist, and newest member of the First Encounter Assualt and Recon team and as your first mission you are charged with the responsibility of tracking down and apprehending violent murderer, Paxton Fettel. Though Fettel is just one man, capturing him will prove to be difficult as he is escorted by an army of replica soldiers (clones). Why are there clones, you ask? I'd love to tell you but the story is a little convoluted as are many in the horror genre, though this is eventually explained, it's sometimes hard to understand whats going on in the story if your not paying close attention (though there are recordings and the like that provide a more detailed backstory). As interesting as the story is, most will remember the vivid dream sequences and the constant dread that F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere provides. A moment that stood out to me involved a dark office space where the shadows always seemed to stalk you, barely audible whispers, a ringing phone and a bloody ceiling.  In addition to being host of a powerful atmosphere, F.E.A.R. happens to be a really fun shooter. Your enemies display a degree of independace that is still uncommon today. Replica soldiers will notice you if you are loud or forget to turn off your flashlight. When in battle, replica forces will often create cover, communicate with each other and flank you. Your enemies are also very accurate and provide a healthy challenge for experienced shooter fans. While F.E.A.R. offers the standard shooter arsenal of shotgun, rifle and smg and a few interesting novelties (one weapon turns people into bloody skeletons with a single hit) the slo-mo mechanic ensures that there is much fun. voices are distorted, bodies fall into crumpled heaps, and body parts fly in a symphony of blood and gore.Though the game looks old and lacks any multiplayer component, It's still a well done shooter that provides gripping chills, adrenaline soaked firefights and a story you wont soon forget and at ten dollars, it's a steal.

												What can I say? Very good survival shooter with thought-out elements (like slow motion). The best thing was that dark atmosphere though; it made you think as if you were alone for sure while playing it, with nobody to help and nobody to hear your scream... after defeating lots of enemies, of course. If you like that kind of games, then F.E.A.R. is for you! Do not worry about the graphic - even if this game came out back in 2005, the graphic is still nice for eyes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A creepy FPS, with graphics beginning to show their age when compared with newer games, F.E.A.R strikes a very good balance between, interesting story, challenging NPC's, and the startle factor of a good Horror-based FPS. Spawning a line of sequels, should be enough incentive to show F.E.A.R is a quality game. The Story is fast paced, making F.E.A.R an exciting, fun game I enjoyed playing through a second time. I recommend playing on the hardest settings, for maximum challenge. Definitely pick it up if you don't have it in your library. Bundle Stars usually carries it, packaged with the sequels for a total F.E.A.R experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I must have been living under a rock (or too busy working.. :-)) to miss this game and all it's sequels and expansions. Creepy story line, engaging from start to finish, enemy A.I. is fantastic - they will run, flank, work in groups, run for cover, try to discover an alternate route to you.. it's fantstic. Graphics are a little dated by today's standard but compared to Minecraft they are top notch. I recommend by the whole series and play through it from beginning and end, don't start at the end like I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR Version: Great game, great AI, great story and great gunplay. A must buy for FPS fans and even tactical shooter fans. 10/10One of the best FPS games I know of. Great AI, interesting story and fantastic John Woo-esque and tactical gunplay. The game has a unique combat system which I wish today's developers would take a note or two of, the game puts you up against squads of 5 soldiers which communicate with each other and co-ordinate to try to take you down, which in higher difficulties can make the game genuinely difficult because the AI are extremely intelligent. As an example of such, during my playthrough I had to resort to taking cover in a room with open windows in which my enemies could see me through, instead of charging me head first like most modern FPS games AI would do, they actually had 3 of the 5 soldiers laying down suppressing fire and trying to flush me out with grenades, while the other 2 were trying to flank me, at the end of the gun fight I was flanked and killed due to the fact that I had no idea that the enemy were flanking my position. As a result of that gun fight I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off because I hadn't been outsmarted in sooo long by AI and it was such a enjoyable experience. In my books F.E.A.R has the best AI I know of and still holds it's own even after 11 years, F.E.A.R is truly a masterpiece and I wish there were more games like it. The story of F.E.A.R is quite interesting but it is true that at times it can feel very drawn out but the visceral gun fights and atmospheric horror keeps you drawn in. It's a game that doesn't rely on jumpscares and forced perspective views to scare the player and I will admit that in my first playthrough I had some heart pumping moments which I won't spoil. All in all F.E.A.R is a great game to grab and for $9.99 USD it is a great deal, even for people that aren't fans of horror, I believe this is a game that every gamer should experience and it will forever be one of my top 5 FPS games and I also inspire to take what F.E.A.R has done right with it's combat and atmosphere and down the line create a homage of what F.E.A.R was in a game I hope to create in the far future. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

F.E.A.R. is a good game, it's basically an Action FPS with some horror elements, far from terrifying as they say. It's an old game that has aged well and is still perfectly playable. The gameplay is good but sometimes repetitive, the strong point is the enemy AI, very good and challenging, enemies seek every moment to take advantage of the numerical superiority with efficient combat tactics. The plot is what is best in the game, although I have not really liked the combination of sci-fi with horror, the story is solid and well built. The negative feature is the level design, scenarios are repetitive and sometimes make the game boring, I often had the impression of walking the same places I've been before.7/10F.E.A.R. Extraction Point: The first expansions, does not add much to the plot of the game and is just an extension of the final. The game remains predominantly action, there is the addition of some new weapons and enemies, as well as improving the AI. The level design is still repetitive and poorly explored, especially in this expansion.6/10F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate: An expansion in which the events take place parallel to the game and other expansion. Not much to be revealed in a matter of plot. The positive is the inclusion of more terrifying situations I had not seen before. There are new enemies and the AI is further best and challenging. In overall I liked most of this expansion. 7/10Overall I would recommend to play, it's a classic from FPS genre, but would not recommend playing the expansions right after the base game, I did it and felt bored with them because they become repetitive.

												Missing the FEAR boat the first time around, came to this game in the year of 2014....What can I say?This must be regarded as a classic and one of the finest shooters I have ever played!The visceral, trigger finger gunplay is truely a marvel to behold. The inclusion of a bullet time dynamic really makes the carnage shine, and even by today's standards the visuals throughout the gunplay are compelling.For me, the negative in this game must be the overall story. In this the game does feel it's age, and the final 30 minutes of the game feels somewhat rushed to it's conclusion.Having said this, the atmosphere the game creates is pretty claustrophobic, and there are plenty of jump scare moments to keep you on your toes....and of course the all out action is second to none.Now to move on to the expansions and further games in the series...which, if I am led to believe, should be a huge disapointment for me.

												The original F.E.A.R. was a great game combining elements of horror, fast paced action and great combat sequences into one nice little game. In F.E.A.R. you are part of a special squad to take down a rogue psychic soldier who has control over a whole army or replica soldiers. To aid you in this struggle is your ability to slow down time to take on several enemies on the go.The game mechanic works really well, since your usually swarmed by clever AI, the way the slow mo is used is quite marvellous and it feels like you’re in one of John Woo’s movies. Granted you only got the most out of the game if you played on the highest difficulty settings which really put you at level footing with the AI. Even today the gameplay holds well and weapon choice is ample as well as being creative.I recommend getting the game since it also comes with the expansion packs as well, Overall a great classic pc game if you just want a quick paced fps.

												Absolutely fantastic survival horror FPS game. Packed to the brim with very intense gameplay, helped by the very advanced AI, that only give you a moment to breathe thanks to the games core slow-down mechanic. Very investing story, some pretty good plot twists, and absolutely excellent atmosphere. I'd heavily suggest this game to anyone who is really into horror games, especially if you're into ones where the narrative is within the enviroment (games such as this, and Bioshock, and even the original Resident Evil games)I'd give this game a 10/10, it's an absolute masterpiece, and one every horror fan should play through.

												F.E.A.R  One of the Best Games Ever made, when F.E.A.R was first released the game itself was ahead of its time. Using its Advanced engine to thrill its audience, liturally Hold them in suspense, forcing players to peak around corners when unsure what was beyond. This game spans so far 2 sequals plus the expansions included with this game.  The Developers for F.E.A.R what they need to do, is Remake it using F.E.A.R as its center piece Using instead of a 2005 engine throw in the latest to date as software can go, because this game itself is a master piece. I Rate this game 10/10 anyone else out there that hasnt played F.E.A.R you should really consider grabbing a steam card, and Grabbing this game, Even when F.E.A.R isnt on sale its still worth what you pay.

												If you're a fan of FPS games and don't own F.E.A.R., I don't think you actually know the genre. I'm actually hard-pressed to think of a singleplayer FPS better than F.E.A.R., and the game's damn year a decade old. The visuals still hold up, the A.I. puts most modern games to shame, the gunplay is tight, fast, and solid, and the writing is actually pretty damn good. I recommend playing both at night and with headphones to maximize the experience. While not really scary, the game has lots of subtle ambiance-type inclusions that make subsequent playthroughs really fulfilling.Also, the level of detail is astounding.I wish modern FPS games were half as good as F.E.A.R. (And that includes its woeful second and third entries.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game with pretty fun combat/gunplay sections, especially thanks to the slow mo stuff, with some nice atmosphere and lots of jump scares which aren't really my thing but hey they might be yours. Didn't really care about the story until the end but out of all 3 of the FEAR's this is definitely the best one.Update: Finished the Expansions and all I have to say is that Extraction Point is really great, offers up some more of the satisfying combat from the main game, using the MC from FEAR again, with well placed spooks as well. Perseus Mandate on the other hand is just bland, with a cast of characters that don't matter and with Alma and Fettel just kinda thrown in there because PLOT. The combat doesn't feel nearly as fun due to certain enemies just feeling like complete bullet sponges, and with spooks that aren't nearly as well paced or as well done in general as either the base game or EP. In my opinion Perseus Mandate is completely worth skipping while Extraction Point is definitely worth playing through at least once after the main game of course.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R is an old classic that is still very playable and fun even to this day.I've replayed it a couple of times and it's best played on a higher difficulty in my opinion.Pros  Fun gunplay, the bullets have real weight. The enviroment is full of bits and bobs that move around so an intense firefight will feel that more awesome because of it. The sound design is incredible and always make you feel on edge even when there isn't happening anything. Very advanced AI that flank you, throw large objects around as cover and have a very large vocabulary to always shout and tell eachother where you're hidding or if you're about to shoot or are aiming towards one of their team mates. The atmosphere is very good in all the various areas you go to throughout the game.Cons  The game isn't very scary, even on my first time playing the game i wasn't ever really scared. The shooting in slowmotion can sometime feel a little finiky. The AI are very predictable and you can in certain circumstances force bigger enemies to become stuck making the fights too easy. The slowmotion makes you about twice as fast as the enemies, this is a little too powerful and does allow you to clear several areas in the game without being hit a single time.As a small disclaimer I never really become scared of any horror game so you might find this game super scary.Definitely recommend that you pick up F.E.A.R if you're ever looking for an awesome fps.

												With my new style of reviewing games, I guess I should write a more 'professional' review about F.E.A.R. as well.I'll try to keep things simple. The reason why I love FEAR so much and it's one of my top 5 games of all time is because it knows what it wants to do and does an amazing job at that: being an amazing action shooter with some creepy supernatural elements in between. Good:-Graphics, sound and the like: FEAR still looks pretty nice despite being nearly nine years old today and the sound design is as solid as ever. God, I love the gunfire in this game, it really sounds threatening. And don't get me started on the delicious Voice Acting by the Replica Soliders, that sounds extremely menacing.-Gunplay and combatt in general: the game perfectly balances between being a realistic and tactical FPS and being not too supa dupa serious guise. Even the 'normal' weapons like the SMG or shotgun still feel great because you really feel like they pack a punch, especially the shotgun, that destroys anything that comes in your way. And then you still have the more fancy weapons, like the repeating cannon, the nail gun (god, nailing enemies to walls never gets old for me) and the particle gun, or as I like to call it, the skeleton gun (because it vaporizes (is that even a word?) any foe you hit with it, leaving nothing but some dust and bones). Melee feels great too and it's really satisfying to give a Replica Soldier a slowmo kungu kick to the face. Said slowmotion works great and is necessary if you want to survive, because..-The AI: everybody has heard of FEAR's great AI by now. And while it's also the combination of good level design and intelligent scripting, the Replica Forces you'll encounter in the game really feel like smart and dangerous opponents that will destroy you if you don't use your wits, especially on higher difficulty, where it becomes 'kill or be killed'. These guys will, thanks to their awesome voice acting, insanely well co-ordinated teamwork and despite being clones still having personality, always carry a very special place in my heart.-The horror: FEAR is inspired by japanese horror and it shows. Surrealistic and disturbing imagery, darkness and silence to drive you slowly insane, 'did I just see anything or was it just my imagination', all that. The game does have a few 'jumpscares' but nothing in the likes of 'spooky face appears with loud noise'.-The story: FEAR tells it story through clever use of voicemail messages, date on laptops and the like. You'll really want to find out the truth behind project origin near the end of the game.-TECHNOLOGY: objects that don't just stand there and get bullet holes when you shoot/melee/blow them up, the ability to see your legs, reflections in puddles of water, FEAR's got it all. Suck it, Bioshock Infinite, this nine year old game beats you here without any effort.Bad:-Dislikeable characters: some characters in FEAR (TALKING TO YOU, NORTON) aren't really likeable and you'd wish they'd just shut up so you can go and slowmokungfukick some more cloned soldiers. It's not really an issue, though, and more a matter of having something I dislike so people don't call me a fanboy that can't give negative criticism.-Linear and repetitive scenery sometimes: you'll be fighting a lot of the times in the same type of buildings, though I didn't mind too much and this problem gets solved near the end of the game. There's still plenty of variation to make it bearable.Overal, I give FEAR a 9/10. The same score I give to its two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, who are in my opinion the true 'sequels' to this amazing game and add some interesting weaponry, areas and enemies while keeping the amazing formula that makes FEAR so damn great.

												A classic shooter with a lot of horror elements thrown in. The two expansion packs are included, bringing some welcome variety to the gunfights and the scare sequences.Pros* Great shooting mechanics, you feel deadly as the decor and enemies are shattered by your bullets* Graphics that were gorgeous for their time, lighting is still handled pretty well* Interesting storyline even though its tropes are well-known by nowCons* Repetitive level design, repetitive enemies, repetitive storyline ; how much time can Delta Force operatives be slaughtered and helicopters can crash without becoming boring?* The pacing is predictable, you will not be afraid during gunfights because you know there will be no jumpscares, and you won't feel threatened during the creepy partsAs a word of advice, the AI is very interesting so try to vary your actions during the battle segments and don't save scum, otherwise you may feel bored for a period of time.

												F.E.A.R. reminded me of Half-Life a lot. The game subject isn’t too similar and the levels are a bit more dull and repetitive but the gameplay and feel of running and shooting is definitely on par. In addition F.E.A.R. has a bullet time mechanic that brings an additional ton of fun to the action. It’s supposed to be a scary game but unless you are really easily scared the horror elements are quickly reduced to an eye-roller level of impression. But the action is good! It really is. I had so much fun playing this game that I immediately jumped to the two expansions developed for the game. If you’re not looking for anything deep or realistic but rather just fun action, this is a game for you.			",450,113,17,63,51,4,101

												Holy Crap.This is an ""Oldie, but goodie"". The graphics and visuals are old (you can't blame them though, this game is OLD), so it works great on low-end PCs and laptops. The experience is still at its best though; I quickly played through the whole thing. I think, however, this was meant to be a ""horror game"". It lacks in that aspect, at least for me, due to its typical ""pop-scares"", and perhaps due to its low graphical capability (because of its time, once again).In general, if you really like FPS on rails, and perhaps like a dash of horror, this game was meant for you. I am hooked on this series, and I will try the rest of the triology next :D			",439,127,8,56,25,3,52

												Not long after Half Life 2 Monolith came out with this gem with the intention of redefining the action in FPS games. And they succeeded! It's been almost 10 years and playing FEAR is still fun. Slow-motion is imperative for survival and it does make the gameplay exciting. All the particle effects accompanying this effect still stand out, even with today's standards.While full of action, FEAR is mainly a psychological horror. Between the action sequences supernatural encounters are common and your main antagonist is someone of that nature. Your are keen on finding out more of this phenomenon you are after and the story has some surprises for you along the way.Extraction Point was the follow-up expansion pack for the game which takes places exactly where the main story leaves us in the original game. Interestingly, the same studio that developed this expansion pack released another one two years later. Perseus Mandate was longer, more difficult and more action-packed - too bad the story was rather unoriginal and we already new a sequel would come out. Also, the story told by Perseus Mandate is not considered canon in this franchise.Although lacking the multiplayer component (check the message on the game's store page), FEAR's single player content is still very original and can be entertaining in 2014. I recommend it to all people who adore the FPS genre.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												With my new style of reviewing games, I guess I should write a more 'professional' review about F.E.A.R. as well.I'll try to keep things simple. The reason why I love FEAR so much and it's one of my top 5 games of all time is because it knows what it wants to do and does an amazing job at that: being an amazing action shooter with some creepy supernatural elements in between. Good:-Graphics, sound and the like: FEAR still looks pretty nice despite being nearly nine years old today and the sound design is as solid as ever. God, I love the gunfire in this game, it really sounds threatening. And don't get me started on the delicious Voice Acting by the Replica Soliders, that sounds extremely menacing.-Gunplay and combatt in general: the game perfectly balances between being a realistic and tactical FPS and being not too supa dupa serious guise. Even the 'normal' weapons like the SMG or shotgun still feel great because you really feel like they pack a punch, especially the shotgun, that destroys anything that comes in your way. And then you still have the more fancy weapons, like the repeating cannon, the nail gun (god, nailing enemies to walls never gets old for me) and the particle gun, or as I like to call it, the skeleton gun (because it vaporizes (is that even a word?) any foe you hit with it, leaving nothing but some dust and bones). Melee feels great too and it's really satisfying to give a Replica Soldier a slowmo kungu kick to the face. Said slowmotion works great and is necessary if you want to survive, because..-The AI: everybody has heard of FEAR's great AI by now. And while it's also the combination of good level design and intelligent scripting, the Replica Forces you'll encounter in the game really feel like smart and dangerous opponents that will destroy you if you don't use your wits, especially on higher difficulty, where it becomes 'kill or be killed'. These guys will, thanks to their awesome voice acting, insanely well co-ordinated teamwork and despite being clones still having personality, always carry a very special place in my heart.-The horror: FEAR is inspired by japanese horror and it shows. Surrealistic and disturbing imagery, darkness and silence to drive you slowly insane, 'did I just see anything or was it just my imagination', all that. The game does have a few 'jumpscares' but nothing in the likes of 'spooky face appears with loud noise'.-The story: FEAR tells it story through clever use of voicemail messages, date on laptops and the like. You'll really want to find out the truth behind project origin near the end of the game.-TECHNOLOGY: objects that don't just stand there and get bullet holes when you shoot/melee/blow them up, the ability to see your legs, reflections in puddles of water, FEAR's got it all. Suck it, Bioshock Infinite, this nine year old game beats you here without any effort.Bad:-Dislikeable characters: some characters in FEAR (TALKING TO YOU, NORTON) aren't really likeable and you'd wish they'd just shut up so you can go and slowmokungfukick some more cloned soldiers. It's not really an issue, though, and more a matter of having something I dislike so people don't call me a fanboy that can't give negative criticism.-Linear and repetitive scenery sometimes: you'll be fighting a lot of the times in the same type of buildings, though I didn't mind too much and this problem gets solved near the end of the game. There's still plenty of variation to make it bearable.Overal, I give FEAR a 9/10. The same score I give to its two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, who are in my opinion the true 'sequels' to this amazing game and add some interesting weaponry, areas and enemies while keeping the amazing formula that makes FEAR so damn great.

												What a hoot of a game, this long arduous descent into a ring of contemptuous shenannigans was a great example, even a good bench-mark, of game design of it's time. Nuanced observation, a fine understanding of simple gamer joys, well thought-out map sections, and a... XD ..deplorable sense of humour lead to a great first-person shooter experience. Claustrophobic and unpredictable, the game had a strange sense of 'coming up for air' all the way through it. The horror aspect was handled well and lead to some stunning situations and visuals that made for creepy times, unfortunately perhaps not really creepy enough. The game, if played right, felt like a personal conquest with one being cast as a purifying agent, an avenging angel on loan to the state, a skilled assassin with almost god-like powers and nasty guns. The labyrinthian nature of the sections have nice bottlenecks and tight gunplay is recommended. Innovations like the NPC bots making snickering jokes about seeing your torchlight in dark areas and blind firing panicking retreating enemies have enhanced the whole FPS game play mode. The background soundscapes scare my roomie =)  Tips of the hat to Doom 3, Max Payne and the movie 'the ring' I recommend this romp for anyone interested in revisiting a grand parent of the modern video-game paradigm and taking it out for a drive. 9.8/10			",246,82,16,13,21,1,17

												Absolutely classic run and gun game play with light horror themes and near-future weaponry. Pick it up if you like shooters, you won't regret it. The later installments are a bit iffy from what I've read, but the game that started the franchise still holds up today as a solid experience.When FEAR was new, it changed up the classic arena shooter formulas by introducing melee attacks (jump kicks, slide kicks, etc...) and limiting the number of weapons you could carry to 3, but the biggest feature was the bullet-time mechanic which has been used in a lot of games since. I'm not going to get into a long discussion here, but hitscan (projectiles you can't dodge in mid-flight, as opposed to say a Doom imp's fireballs) weaponry is difficult to implement in games because you can't dodge it, you can only either soak the hits (unrealistic) or hide from it behind chest high walls (not fun). FEAR neatly solved this problem with bullet-time by allowing you to move so much faster than your enemies you could dispatch them without needing to soak up hits or hide for very long (only if you ran out of bullet-time).If you like this I highly recommend the two expansions, Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point. They are full games and essentially more of the same, but there is nothing wrong with that when the game play is this good.			",590,93,4,119,46,6,105

												First of all, I always heard that F.E.A.R. was an horror FPS and a very good one but after my first 2 hours on it I realized that this is not a horror FPS, it's more like a First Person Shooter with some ocasional jumpscares. The game at its core is a very solid and competetent FPS, the shooting feels great, the guns feel really authentic with a decent amount of recoil on each one and a decent variety of guns to choose which I really like. Besides the gunplay the combat gets some variety with the melee combat, which consists of punching and kicking while moving or standing and I think this one is a real plus because when you use a melee attack the animation looks really nice and gives it a certain ""style"" not only that but you can use a slow motion ""mode"" that has a certain timer to it which allows you to aim better and pick your targets more easily. For me, the shooting on a first person shooter lets me decide if the game is good or bad so what I described above pretty much makes me love this game. Besides that I think that the graphics were great looking for the time when F.E.A.R. came out and the music definitely hits the right spot at the right moment during the entire game, on the other hand I don't think that the sound design, more specifically, the gun sounds are that great but that doesn't really matter. In the end F.E.A.R. will provide you tons of enjoyment if you like FPS and also a great story with a paranormal twist to it. Do play it!			",1393,387,26,190,117,15,203

												Still one of the premier first-person shooters of all time. The shooting mechanics are in-depth and satisfying, with the slow-mo ability adding an intense, if unoriginal, tactical advantage. The ability to use a variety of melee attacks is also incredibly addictive, perhaps overpowered since it can kill an enemy in one hit, but this is mitigated by how easy it is to take damage if not played carefully. Great level design rewards players who move slowly and explore, and also enables the complex AI to provide a competent challenge as they flank, use grenades, communicate and ambush the player.Beyond the gameplay, this still remains one of the best horror and story-based games as well. The scare-tactics are a bit ""in your face"" compared to some recent gems in the field of horror, but it still has a deeply disturbing atmosphere and a low-key ambient soundtrack adds to the tension.The story is a sickening descent into the horrors unleashed by mankind's wickedness, the desire to play god, and monsters who destroy their makers.

												First review, be gentle. I have not completed either of the DLCs but I have just recently completed the main story.This game is amazing, it hits the nail on the head as far as story, gameplay, horror and difficulty. If you enjoy first person shooters of any kind this game is a must have.Pros-varied weapon choice-interesting combat-fun game mechanics-limited ammo on high powered guns-rewards exploration-Awesome story-good visuals despite old gameCons-linear story with few choices (save for bonus areas with exploration), makes for little replayability-Game has issues with Logitech plugins (mouse, keyboard, etc.) but these are easily fixable either with online help or just unplugging your mouse whenever the game starts to freeze (this is what I did and it worked perfectly)In a world that seems to be increasingly obsessed with ULTRA HIGH RES GRAPHICS rather than good story I feel that F.E.A.R. delivers in ways that only older games can. I even think that it is as good as if not better than most first person shooters coming out today.I may update my review after finishing DLCs but maybe not.			",92,16,0,21,17,0,20

 A solid FPS action game perfectly mixed with horror and paranormal themes Even though this game is over a decade old, it holds up with modern horror games. It is better than majority of the titles released in the past five years. The combat is smooth and has features that most modern games don't include like slow-mo and leaning. The graphics are dated, but they are tolerable enough and do not ruin the experience. The story is very well written and is unique to any other game I've played. The sounds and music are also fitting and perfect to set the atmosphere for the game. It takes 6-8 hours to complete the game on moderate or higher at a normal pace. The two expansion packs included for the first game are worth playing and take 4-5 and 5-6 hours to complete. I highly recommend you pick the trilogy up in a bundle while on sale. For the best experience play in a dark room alone at night. The multiplayer is no longer supported by the developers, but if you really want to play you can still find servers on gametracker etc. Very few players still play but it is still semi playable.

												One of my favorite FPSs to play just because of how awesomely the slow-motion goes with the gunplay. All the weapons are very fun to use too, and, of course, the game is pretty dang scary. It's also a fairly long game as far as FPS go, at least to me. I just wish I could have played the multiplayer, since apparently they managed to make slow-motion work in that. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I think this was the first game to make that happen too. But anyway, F.E.A.R. is one of the most fun FPSs out there, and with excellent atmosphere and scares. Also, the enemy AI is a wonder to behold, even now, approaching a decade later. This game is probably the best mix of action and horror I've seen done in video games, with neither being sacrificed for the other, all while managing to be deliciously challenging the whole way through. This game really hit the sweet spot on so many levels. Monolith Productions just doesn't get quite enough credit.The two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, are also very fun, naturally, and certainly worth playing as well. Mutha♥♥♥♥in' minigun and laser cannon and lightning gun, ♥♥♥♥♥es!Apparently they're not canon though. I don't see why they shouldn't be, honestly. Sort of a Half-life: Blue Shift and Opposing Force situation with the expansions, except Blue Shift and Opposing Force are technically canon, or at least it's ambiguous and has still not been denied by Valve. Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are apparently just not canon, under the grounds that F.E.A.R. 2 doesn't mention the events in those (Just like Blue Shift and Opposing Force! And those are canon!) and because it wasn't developed by Monolith Productions (Just like F.E.A.R. 3! And that's canon! [... unfortunately]).So I say they might as well be canon, Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate, Blue  Shift and Opposing Force AND Dragon Ball GT. Could Half-life and F.E.A.R. take  place in the same universe?! And how does Dragon Ball fit into this?!I guess we'll never know...			",1322,459,34,180,136,12,186

												When I first rented Monolith Productions’ F.E.A.R. on Xbox 360 back in 2007, I was very impressed with the singleplayer campaign. Despite not being able to complete F.E.A.R. before I had to return it to the video store, it left a lasting impression on me and I considered it a modern classic. The recent inclusion of the game as part of the Humble WB Bundle provided the perfect opportunity to re-experience the game and see if my initial impression of it holds to my more refined standards of today. One element of F.E.A.R. that impresses more than even most newly released games is its beautiful visual effects and physics. Just about everything smaller than entire desks and tables, from office telephones and spinning desk chairs, to paintings on the walls, are physics based. Occasionally, this causes some issues (most of which exist in all games with lots of physics-based objects) such as corpses becoming embedded in walls and floors or clutter bouncing around when they should not, but for the most part lends itself greatly to the experience. It can be terrifying when you are walking down a dark hallway, trying to sneak up on an enemy, when you accidentally walk over a soda can, kicking it down the hall with a silence-breaking twang. The first time you enter a large firefight, enable SloMo, and begin exchanging fire with the Replica soldiers is breathtaking: dust fills the air as bullets impact nearby walls, creating actual holes in the walls rather than just placing a decal; stray bullets knock boxes of papers and electronics off shelves, breaking them; a grenade goes off nearby, knocking the hanging lights around, the game’s marvelous dynamic lighting and shadows changing the entire look of the battlefield; and the opposing forces’ soldiers react realistically, with custom animations dependent on where they are hit that are integrated well with ragdoll physics. Another soldier, panicking, runs away but stumbles and falls over while he attempts to call squad for backup. While these sorts of features are not a new creation for F.E.A.R., they are all used extremely effectively together to create impressive and satisfying scenes that leave a lasting impression, defining F.E.A.R. and setting it apart from other games in people’s minds.While F.E.A.R. manages to wow with its impressive physics, lighting, and effects; intense soundtrack and Japanese-horror inspired ambience; and solid gunplay and fair difficulty, F.E.A.R. is not a perfect game and many of its elements and tropes undermine the level of immersion needed to truly be disturbed by a horror game. There are a significant amount of attempted jump scares that are ineffective and cheap feeling. The enemies, unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, lack the power to instill a fear of death in you. Because of this playing on the hardest difficulty is an absolute must, even on a first playthrough. The highest difficulty is the only one that has fair and interesting feelings gunplay, since on lower difficulties enemies are just too weak and easy to kill. The improved gunplay and stronger enemies add both enjoyable skill-based gameplay and intense ambience that greatly improves the overall feel of the game.Overall, F.E.A.R. is an overall great game that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys first person games. Despite its age, it is of much higher quality than much newer first person and horror games. F.E.A.R. is a classic that everyone should experience as an important part of the history of modern gaming, regardless of your interest in the genres.			",284,78,3,63,33,3,58

												Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers here to share my thoughts on F.E.A.R by Monolith Productions and Sierra Entertainment. I didn’t receive a copy of this game for review this time around. I purchased a boxed copy and then a digital copy ages ago and I wanted to write this review after completing the game.FEAR was originally released on PC on October 18, 2005 with Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions arriving on October 31, 2006 (360) and April 24, 2007 (PS3). For today’s review we’re covering the PC release. The game originally released on CD-Roms (The version I own) but a DVD (Director’s Cut) version was later released which included many bonus features including a Dark Horse comic book, a series of Live Action Vignettes, and a Making of FEAR/Developer’s Commentary documentaries.In the commentary video Producer Chris Hewitt revealed that there was an entire car chase level which they had worked on for 2 months before removing from the game because it didn’t come out right. He also mentions that there were originally 2 villains; Fettel and Conrad Krieg. The two of them were eventually combined into one enemy with Fettel wearing Krieg’s jacket.There were two expansion packs titled Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate but these were developed by TimeGate Studios and released on October 24, 2006 and November 2007 respectively. There were also two sequels to the game; FEAR 2: Project Origin and FEAR 3. The game also originally released with multiplayer as well but has since been shut down due to Gamespy’s closure in 2012.Now that our history lesson is over we can begin talking about the game itself!FEAR is a psychological, horror, first-person shooter that puts you in control of a new member of the First Encounter Assault and Recon unit that specializes in dealing with supernatural threats. Your mission is to locate a man named Paxton Fettel and kill him at any cost. Over the course of the game you’ll travel to various locations around the city in search of Fettel and to uncover what’s going on. Eventually you begin learning about a research program called Project Origin and it’s none too pretty.One of my favorite parts of this game is easily the gunplay - which is fast, fluid and a ton of fun. Our unnamed hero has the ability to slow down time (which is really just moving faster than people can register) to take down enemies and escape hairy situations. The game features various types of weapons which are based on real world weapons like assault Rifles and shotguns. There’re also some unique weapons too including one that shoots railway spikes and another that fires particle beams. You can also choose to go full on melee if you so choose and you can unleash some pretty devastating punches and kicks.Another thing I really enjoyed about the game is the enemy AI which is incredibly smart so long as you’re not playing on easy difficulty. Enemies will hide behind cover, work with their teammates and will often try to flank you in order to kill you. They also have superb melee skills and if they get close to you they’ll unleash the hurt. They’ll also try to use grenades to flush you out from cover as well. The game can get pretty intense.The game’s graphics have held up incredibly well over the years as well. It still has some absolutely gorgeous lighting/shadowing and the particle effects from ricocheting bullets are still incredibly awesome. Bullets leave deep holes in walls which also increases immersion and shows the destructive power of the weapons.  The sound effects hold up pretty well as well and lends to the superb atmosphere. The horror elements didn’t work on me simply because I don’t find games scary, but there was a pretty good balance between the horror and action. There was also one section of the game that was lacking in horror elements but the rest of it was quite good.Overall, FEAR has been an incredibly fun experience and one I gladly recommend if you haven’t played it yet. It’s not a very long game by any means (I beat it in 6 hours) but it has some excellent gunplay, a great balance between horror/action and it’s quite gorgeous to boot.Thanks a lot for taking the time to watch my video and read my review folks. I’d greatly appreciate if you could give them both a share or like. Also, be sure to subscribe to my channel for future videos!Happy gaming folks! - Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!

												After completing F.E.A.R.3, which is one of my top favourite Co-Op games, I wanted to find out how it all started, so I picked up the first game in the series.The graphics are old, but still decent on highest settings. It doesn't hurt the gameplay. The battlesystem is nice, with great AI behaviour, though enemies are a bit more challlenging than in F.E.A.R.3. It takes 3-4 shots before you are killed on normal difficulty. So, you should be really careful. But with slow-mos and covers it's managable and, leaving those piles of corpses behind you, makes you feel like a mass murderer. There are a lot of surprises in terms of enemy spawning, which adds up for a nice challenge. You don't get bored, because as soon as you get used to enemies and start to think ""meh, this is too easy"", something new pops in, requiring you to adapt to the new level of difficulty.There is not much of a story in terms of dialogues and cut-scenes. But what you have is a rather direct experience, and the story reveals itself, as you advance through enemies and levels. The sound and special effects adds up nice tension to the gameplay.So, as a result, you get a really good semi-horror first person shooter with a nice polish. I recommend it to all players, especially, if you have played and like such games as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and F.E.A.R.3.EXTRACTION POINT expansion: F.E.A.R. at its best. Includes more paranormal content and horror elements, engaging in very, very tense, almost psychologically tormenting, yet addicting gameplay. The enemies are more difficult, too, ranging from regular soldiers to armored units, mechs and phantoms, that will slice you up in no time.PERSEUS MANDATE expansion: after completing Extraction Point, it will feel like a casual game. In this game you play as Pointman from the second F.E.A.R. team. There's not much of horror in this game, the focus is on different guns. Still, it is a satisfying game. 3 unlockable bonus missions included (kill all the enemies in the clinic; survive the arena; and sprint trough enemy lines).My overall rating: 9/10Note. There are many players saying that F.E.A.R.3. ruined the series, because there wasn't a lot of horror in it. But I liked F.E.A.R.3 better, because you could play with two characters and there is a co-op mode in it. Sure, the first game is more emotionally involving, but just a bit. It's not a big deal from me. And who gets scared by a video game anyway?			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												8.6/10 - Ten years later.. still amazing!This is my first time playing FEAR. I was expecting a game that had aged like many do. I was wrong this game is amazing still. Reminds me of Half-Life2 except a focus on horror as opposed to action.I don't believe in horror games.. They usually suck. This game is really scarey though. The lighting, bad guys and feel are all well done. Worth $15 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												That's one well-aged game. Shooting mechanics still feel fresh and SlowMo is great.Enemy AI is pretty good, better than 80% of today's shooters.Shooting feel is amazing, blood BLOOD MOAR BLOOD.Story is intense and amazing, you'll acutally wonder what will happen next.There are hidden mechanics, like you'll one-hit kill first enemy if you can shoot before they see you. Which feels great.I strongly recommend it to anyone that likes shooters or horror elements. It takes about 6 hours to finish it, just do it !			",858,246,17,105,77,6,126

												The F.E.A.R. series is an oxymoronic franchise of both action-horror and old-school FPS elements. It's derivative from both genres, yet it maintains its uniqueness with its subversions.It’s generic environments, modern-FPS gunplay, odd design decisions for exposition and limited variety of enemies overshadows the greatness of the subtly of its writing, the high-intense atmosphere, the complex AI and the paranormal elements that make F.E.A.R. distinct. Even when it comes to the gameplay, the series has been torn between the disempowering nature of fear as well as the catharsis of the tension from its high-risk/high-reward combat.In 2016, the horror elements have not withstood the test of time; the gunplay and difficulty surpasses many games made today that it will baffle you how we are behind the times for AI. In many ways, like other FPS classics such as DOOM or Quake, F.E.A.R is a milestone for the genre that has yet to be understood by the creators/publishers themselves for why it is such a classic.T.E.N.S.I.O.N., not F.E.A.R.If any game could warrant from a name-change, F.E.A.R. is the highest on my list. The paranormal elements of enemies, hallucinations, the Alma encounters, the scientific rationale for tampering with psychiatric forces beyond their control all warrant the name it is given. (In many ways, the generic abbreviation fits the game’s confusing mix-mash of ideas.) The horror elements are the focus of the game as well as its story, and none of this is to say that on first playthroughs the experience is not intimidating to your senses.However, the game’s sense of building tension far outweighs any horror it can instill in you no matter how much you are FPS-Bullet-time-Jesus. From the ambush encounters of invisible enemies, squads that will flank you or employ tactics to get around your defenses, and the paranormal appearances with the atmospheric music all keep your nerves on edge. F.E.A.R. excels in this manner because the core gameplay–the combat–emphasizes that the tension is what will get you killed, not the scares. The combat itself uses acceptable, if somewhat barebones, gunplay compared to the customizable, experience grind you will find in modern FPS (even old-school inspired ones). Resource management, of ammo, of guns (which you can hold three), of grenades and of medkits harken back to the design philosophy of DOOM-like games where resource management and mastering level-design are the key skills you must master. F.E.A.R., however, doesn’t stop there with this idea as its most marketed, iconic gameplay mechanic is perhaps one more resource to manage as your arsenal, bullet-time mode.Bullet-time mode is not unique to F.E.A.R.; it’s how it is used that makes it more effective than a mere gimmick found in other games. Until I had played the game recently, I always wondered why bullet-time mode was such an integral part to the experience. In many franchises, bullet-time is a gimmick staple in FPSs that is only there because it’s a cliché.  F.E.A.R., however, offers another reason for its inclusion that adheres to the similar idea of old-school FPSs: Resource management.In many ways, playing the game without the reflex boost makes the game more difficult than the game was ever meant to be. That’s because bullet-time is another resource meter that offers an illusion of difficulty similar to games like Max Payne. Bullet-time is not just an offensive tool for combat efficiency but a defensive requirement as well; you use it to evade attacks, take out enemies in numbers beyond your normal means of control—and it’s a convenient way to offer the illusion of overcoming difficulty for both console and PC gamers with more time to react and aim your shots while reenacting your favorite John Woo fantasy. This system would feel shallow and worthless had not the AI nor the high damage output warrant its inclusion. Enemies, rather than being class-specific, change their tactics based on the situation—a normal soldier could flank you while you are distracted, another could become a grenadier or they will fall back to regroup with a greater opposition. The banter, reactions and complexities of their AI system rivals most games made within the last decade since its release. The AI emphasizes that you play more smartly with your godlike abilities while the frailty of your character exercises caution. Use your bullet-time unwisely and you’ll quickly find yourself dead; use it efficiently and you can explode a grenade mid-flight to take out a squad. The added melee and momentum options for attacks/dodges combines all these individually excellent elements of F.E.A.R.’s combat system into one of the most entertaining FPSs you will find.  “You Have One Unread Message…”Now when it comes to the storytelling of F.E.A.R., I find the experience as respectful of your intelligence as much as the combat demands from you being strategic. This isn’t to say that the storyline is original, memorable, or flawless but that the execution goes a long way to respect the player who wants to enjoy the greatest aspects of the game, the gameplay, and then realize all the connections upon each new playthrough.Most of the exposition is hidden away in conversations, flashbacks/paranormal experiences, as well as seemingly irrelevant details tucked into voice-mails or laptops. (These laptops with super confidential data of immoral practices from corporations are lying around for anyone to discover at the facilities.) While the presentation of this important information is subpar to other games that use the same ideas, it’s the gradual coming all together of details, characters and motives that really establishes the darkest of themes touched on in this game and in future sequels. It wouldn’t be until F.E.A.R. 2 that the squad would get some semblance of personality and add details about the corporation of Armacham; F.E.A.R. 3 would try, and fail, at establishing some personal motivation and character for Pointman (yes, that is his name as far as you know). The expansions for F.E.A.R., amusingly, foreshadow an understanding too late for the franchise now that the F.E.A.R “trilogy” should have died with the end of Extraction Point where the REAL ending of the series ends as far as the horror elements are concerned.Looking back at the “trilogy” and the official trilogy, Perseus Mandate exemplifies all the future blunders that would sink the franchise down into the abyss of F.E.A.R. Online. PM retells the same story about Alma, choosing to focus on the horror elements rather than the elements that made the gameplay tense; PM highlights the same revelations of Project Origin with rarely anything new added; and it is a franchise that lives only by its successful marketing and profits are concerned until it all comes down to be ruptured into ashes. (PM is not bad as Timegate knows their stuff for making good FPSs, but it displays everything that befell the series from here on out as cheap cash-grabs.)So… Who You Gonna Call?Even as I write this review, F.E.A.R. is something I would hope warrants a reboot for the franchise where Monolith can return the series to the aspects that made the gameplay great, not the cheap-scares that were marketable. It is a game I can easily recommend, and if you have any interest in the franchise you should play the first game’s “trilogy” as well as the second game (I personally liked it but I can understand why people think it falls short of the original.)In the end, F.E.A.R. exemplifies all that seems to be lost to modern games, especially in single-player games, where the gameplay is perfectly paced, interesting and the game knows where to end. The only thing that seems to be forgotten is knowing when something should end, stay dead, and something new should be made, not grave-robbing from the same corpse for sequels.

												If you own a PC, you need to play the original F.E.A.R. To this day, this game has some of the most intelligent AI, intense gun fights, and well-paced experiences of all time. It's also fairly frightening on your first playthrough. F.E.A.R. puts most modern story-driven FPS games to shame, especially since it came out almost 10 years ago. And the story IS there: you have listen to all the answering machines, all the cross-comm traffic, all the cutscenes, in order to piece together a fairly well-written drama.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. isn't the perfect FPS but these many qualities are undeniable: finely tuned suspense, atmosphere ""horrifico-science-fictional"" worked, incredible AI, insane action scenes, soundtrack almost perfect. Thus, despite a scenario that may seem underexploited and the few sets or the small number of weapons and enemies, we begin a sacred trip pouncing in the game of Monolith. You may haven't fear but that is the Origin of this game that you will fix this dark corridor where something has just issued a noise, a very slight noise ...			",72,7,1,12,2,0,3

												(WARNING: When you play F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, be sure to play it at night, with your lights closed, specially with nobody else home, for a full effect of♥♥♥♥♥♥and s*** in your pants.)If I were to describe the first F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, I would describe it as The Expendables meet Max Payne, which then meets The Grudge. (ok, my description might not just had up, buy at least I tryed :S)Seriously: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS GAME!!! Yes, it is old, but I played it many times and it still feels awsome to me! There is a reason why GameSpy considered it to be 2005 Game of The Year. I had this game some years ago, then I gave it to a friend: now, I bought it again on Steam at amoment when it was inpromotion, and I tryed it again, along with the expansions that it brought. After this many years, this game still blows my mind. It is a game like SuperMaio or CastlevaniaIV: you will play it again and again if you want to, and you still love it, because it is damn good.This game (I am refering to the original game, F.E.A.R.) was revolutionary at the time because the develepors decided to mix the FPS genre with the Horror genre of gaming. To be fair, the game it´s good mainly because of the fire-fight, and not because of the horror. The combat system was made perfectly, with the slow-mo ability and how the enviornment around you reacts with bullets and explosions.The expansions are better than the original in some aspects: Extraction Point has much more scarier and bigger horror sequences, while Perseus Mandate is more dedicated to the action and is more challenging, with you having to face a new type of enemy which is more powerfull and agressive. The bad thing about them is that the story of those expansions are kinda silly, even thougth they are still better stories than the cannonical games (F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3), which have more silly stories and who are games that are not scary at all.Score: 8.5 out of 10.

												My first experience of this game was on the PlayStation 3, and I must say it still stands up as a rather unique and off-beat experience (even more so than it's two, admittedly also excellent, sequels).  On paper, I'm sure none of this would've made much sense: Let's make a high-octane action game/first-person shooter, keep it MOSTLY straight, but with a constant HINT of something altogether spookier going on, with only the occasional foray into full-blown ""horror"".  And somehow STILL manage to be one of the tensest and spookiest games ever made.  Loonie tunes, right?  Except that they PULLED IT OFF.      It's hard to say how or why, but for some odd reason this game FEELS like a horror game almost the entire time, despite the fact of you spending the vast majority of the time running about maps shooting, well, dudes.  ""Super-soldiers"" they may be, but they're still relatively ordinary DUDES.   But herein lies the game's genius, as you really just don't know WHEN the ♥♥♥♥ the supernatural is going to invade the otherwise relatively familiar - if admittedly still atmospheric - ""action"" trappings, and temporarily turn the game into something else altogether.  Then, just as suddenly as it came, the weirdness disappears for a while again and you can safely get back to shootin' bad guys (at least until the very, very end, where the horror takes more fully over).  What this all means is that the game is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, and arguably all the more effective as a ""scary"" game than most other horror games where you just KNOW there's gonna be some weird♥♥♥♥♥monster or what-not lurking just around the next corner.  If you're still dubious as to how this could all possibly work...PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING THING.      Oh, and F.E.A.R. teaches you another valuable life lesson: DON'T TRUST FAT PEOPLE.  The NPC in question is at least twice as evil as the character played by that Newman actor in Jurassic Park.  NOTHING is what it seems in this game.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Verdict: 10/10. (Oh, and PS...the ""slow-mo"" function of this game is simply AWESOME, and again, must be seen to be believed.)			",744,418,6,57,40,5,78

												A classic psychological horror first-person corridor shooter.  At launch FEAR PC requirements were staggering. Today the engine still puts out some impressive graphics, lighting and shadows.  One would be hard pressed to find better combat even in modern shooters.  A nice variety of guns and melee techiques are at the players disposal.  Animation is over the top with tremondous unprecedented detail given to how enemies react to bullets, grenades and melee damage. The engine paints their blood on surfaces with a liberal brush and blows their bodies apart better than any other I can remember.  Excellent sound, a well implemented slo motion mechanic (that you can disable, good luck) and good physics compliment a wonderful combat engine.  Correctly criticized for repetive level design however FEAR leads with communications that tell a horrific tale of psychological horror.  The combat never gets old and there's that need to see what's around the next corner.			",2426,1048,114,292,316,28,430

												Got this as part of the Humble Bundle last year. Having played the demo version years ago I thought it would be nice to try out the full game especially considering some of the positive reviews that others have given it. Despite being an older game the campaign was fairly decent and was packed full of action in each chapter/interval. The enemy AI in particular was rather challenging at times which is excellent, definately better AI than some of the newer games, including F.E.A.R 2 and F3AR. Obviously being an older game means the graphics are a bit dated but when maxed out they are comparable to some of the cheaper or F2P games on steam. This is also be a good thing for people that don't have amazing PC specs or are laptop users as pretty much any modern machine from 2010 or later can play this game on medium graphics (some higher intergrated GPUs such as the Intel HD 4000 or the AMD hd 6550d can max out the settings on this game).This game does have some basic jumpscares (it is called FEAR for a reason after all) so be wary about buying this game if you are prone to easily getting scared, however most people should have no problem playing this.I recommend this game to users who are looking for a fun game packed with action. The game itself is fairly cheap already at £6.99 but I often see it at £3.49 ( sometimes less) during the sales. F.E.A.R is one game definately worth picking up.			",62,7,1,1,6,0,2

												Have you tried survival horror games? Maybe it's time.F.E.A.R. is a FPS game, but more importantly a survival horror.Playing as the Point Man, part of a First Encounter Assault Recon team, your job is to locate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic able to control a battalion of Replicas. What seems to be a classic spec-ops mission will actually turn into a nightmare, that will put your enhanced reflexes at heavy use.Through this game, you fight smart enemy soldiers, you dig into Armacham's story, you help funny and frail survivors... But you can't expect how good this game is at scaring you, nor how bad things can turn to.

I find this game a good choice in order to begin survival horror games, specially if you are used to FPS ones. I suggest continuing with its first DLC, Extraction Point, which starts right when the main game stops, and puts you in an even worst nightmare than before.I also suggest stopping before the second DLC, Perseus Mandate. Though the universe is the same and gives some good scares, it's a lot more focused on firefights and is a lot more difficult.

												I got F.E.A.R as part of the Humble WB bundle (the one with the Arkham games) and decided to go through them again since I hadn’t tried the 2 expansions before. For some reason, Steam bundled the first game along with the 2 standalone expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate together into a massive 17 gigabyte installation. This is weird since the 2 expansions are so similar to the base game (in graphics and gameplay) that they probably should have just shared most of the same data files and shrunk the size considerably. The three games have different Steam entries too, so once F.E.A.R is installed, just choose to “install” Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate and it will pretty much instantly install them.You play the part of an unnamed First Encounter Assault Recon soldier, though they refer to you a few times as the point man for the team. Your squad has about 4-5 people but you get separated from them right away so there’s no squad based gameplay. Your primary mission in the game is to take down Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander created by the Armacham private military contractor. Psychic commanders are supposed to control “replica soldiers” who are basically genetically engineered clone soldiers. Fettel went insane for some reason and his replica forces are tearing the place up. As the story progresses you find hints about Armacham projects called Perseus and Origin, which are somehow related to Fettel’s creation. Throughout the game you also see visions of a little girl who appears out of nowhere and vanishes when you get close. There are a lot of “dream sequence” type hallucinations where you learn about Alma, the little girl, and what they did to her at Armacham.Fear is a first person shooter with a slow motion “power” that you can activate with the push of a button. It’s explained in the story as your character having off the chart reflexes, and you can use it to give yourself an advantage in battle. In reality though, it’s not as useful as you might think. You’re not actually moving faster in slow-mo, it’s mostly just to give you more time to aim your shots (you can’t dodge bullets like Neo). Reloading and aim correction from weapon recoil still slow you down. The thing that really sets Fear apart from other games at the time was its advanced enemy AI. The replica soldiers actually behave like real human players a lot of the time. They throw grenades if you’re under cover and they try to circle around you. Most importantly though, they don’t sit still in combat, making it a little harder for you to flank them. Fear uses a health/armor system where you have both a health number and an armor number and constantly find armors lying around in the levels. You can carry up to 10 med kits which you use manually by pressing a button. You can carry up to 3 weapons and can switch them around by taking the stuff your enemies drop. Pros:+Excellent enemy combat AI+A bunch of scares thrown in when Alma pops up or hallucinations occur+Immersive storylineCons:-The game’s graphics are pretty dated now. I don’t think you can get more than 1280 x 1024 resolution. And it’s a large download for such an old game.-No real “boss fights” which are usually fun in first person shooters-The enemies have great aim. It seems like they can hit you no matter how far away they are.Mini reviews for the 2 standalone expansions:*FEAR Extraction Point:This is a non-canon continuation of the story. That means that it if you play the sequels, FEAR 2 & 3 will ignore what happens in the FEAR Extraction Point story. The game is standalone, which means you don’t keep all the upgrades and gear that you found in the base game. There really isn’t anything new in Extraction Point except maybe 1 or 2 weapons that you only use for a few minutes. *FEAR Perseus Mandate:A few new weapons appear which actually make it into the sequel FEAR 2. So even if the story isn’t “official” they were clearly paying attention to this game.  This one has some pretty mean new enemies including a difficult boss fight. Definitely better than Extraction Point. Perseus Mandate’s story is separate from the original game. You play a different person in a different FEAR squad, though there are a lot of references to events in the base game happening at the same time.Overall I’d give FEAR a thumbs up if you can handle the large download and don’t mind some poor (by today’s standards) graphics. You cannot just download the base game; you automatically download all three at the same time (FEAR + Extraction Point + Perseus Mandate). If you could pick and choose, I’d recommend you skip Extraction Point. The experience is better if you play in the dark. ",655,205,34,57,43,12,103

												So I got rekt by this little girl and it totally scared the hell out of me. Now everytime I see this girls shadow pass by the wall I sit there like a wimp to prep my self for the jump scare which is bound to happen. Once prepared for it I walk out and play the game for another 10 mins and no jump scare and begin to relax. Then she appears out of f*cking nowhere and, once again, jump in my seat. Lessons learned: 1) Don't relax when playing F.E.A.R2) Shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥ even if it doesnt deal any damage then run away.*Edit*After playing the DLC 'Perseus Mandate' the dual pistols are really overpowered especially when used with the ability to slow time. Use it to your advantage guys.			",73,4,1,4,1,0,3

												This game is brilliant, incredibly realistic and very fun, the fire fights are some of the best iv ever seen in a computer game, the computers AI shows great adaptability to the players actions making the battles very tense and giving you a sense of accomplishment when you finally take down the last enemy.The visual effects are very impressive, particularly the clouds of dust, explosions and bullet effects in ""slowmo"" time. Even more striking is the games effective use of sound. The use of surround sound means you can hear footsteps approaching from behind corners, and the overheard shouts of your foes gives you crucial information about how many are left or what tactics they're about to use against youHowever as has been previously said there are occasions where you seem to be moving through endless corridors with no-one to fight, This i think was supposed to instil an eerie atmosphere as light bulbs pop and different bit of the environment will move making you think there is someone the and does so very well, however they do try to carry this on to long leaving the player yearning for the next battle.

												F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon:Intro:An absolutely amazing FPS experience full of glorious bloody goodness! If you are a true FPS or horror game admirer, do not miss out on playing this game.Nothing beats a mad fearguy shooting through a horde of replica soldiers, on his mission to reach Paxton Fettel.The story is simple and so is your goal, but it doesn’t have to be anything complex, it works and I may go as far to say that it adds a bit to the atmosphere.Graphic, controls, performance, & sound:The combat/controls are very decent and so is the graphics of a 2005 game. Exploding bodies with a single shot from shooty is one of the things that always made me giggle in a rather cruel way. I especially like the graphical details of; weapon skins, bullet detail, explosives and fire in general. Never had performance issues with this game, but again it’s from 2005; a nowadays low-end pc with a medium-end graphic card shouldn’t have too much trouble running this game.There is a good amount of sound detail in this game that helps to trick and mislead you in situations of scares. The weapon sound is quality and the combat background music fits in nicely.Artificial Intelligence:The AI technology in this game is absolutely amazing; those replica soldiers will run, hide and kite you, like their life were at stake, eh I guess it is against a mad fearguy on the loose!Overall:My only dislike was the very similar level stages, but compared to the overall experience and long playtime value, it didn’t really matter to me.I played this on the PS3. I plan to play it on the PC sometime in the future again on a harder mode. I personally prefer FPS on the PC and would recommend it over playing it on the PS3 - if you’re used to play FPS on the PC.F.E.A.R. Extraction Point:I didn’t expect much from this expansion first time I tried it, but color me surprised! It’s more spot on compared to the first one regarding scares, which I found to my liking.If you enjoyed the first F.E.A.R. and felt like you didn’t get quite enough scares, this one may satisfy your desire on that point.Alma also takes a larger role in this game as well and may aid you if the situation counts for it.The weapon armory is very similar compared to F.E.A.R., which I didn’t mind at all, since I like most of the weapons.The levels were great! A lot of fun and strange stages- Alma playing tricks on you and all that sort of stuff. The playtime value is also decent 6-8 hours depends on how long you spend on looking for goodies.

												After Max Payne combined Hong Kong Action with noir - an odd combo, but one that worked - another developer tried their hand at a Hong Kong Action hybrid. This time with an even stranger genre: horror.  It works, but the spooks are more of the themepark variety. You hallucinate, see some creepy♥♥♥♥♥♥ move on. Only on a few occasions are you forced to shoot your gun at something coming towards you, which isn't much of a challenge. But it's nice to have an atmospheric game where you're not crapping your pants because you're being chased by some hellish monster or a damn xenomorph. You're just haunted by a little girl who appears to spook you when you go around corners then vanishes. It's managable for wimps like me. It's the slow-mo bullet-time FPS action where the real threat is at, and it's great. A lot has been said about the FEAR AI, which is damn good, always on the move, outflanking you, sometimes sneakily hiding in corners. I just feel that most of the claustrophobic environments, with the exception of some ingeniously designed office spaces that loop in on eachother, don't really bring the most out of the AI. The warehouses and underground secret labs do little to test the AIs on their ability to move their way around to murder you. Looks like most of the budget went to the middle of the game, where you're moving your way up an office skyscraper, featuring the best level design, in terms of gameplay as well as aesthetics. The rest of the levels pale in comparison. Still, give this game a shot if you want John Woo mixed with Japanese horror. It's visceral action with great gamefeel, great gore, environmental damage as well as exaggerated physics and particle effects. Still looks pretty good despite being a decade old by now.

												9.0/10Pros: - Extremely impressive combat AI- Combat in general with the AI- Good atmosphere most of the time- Fairly good pacing- Interesting plotCons:- While the levels were put together well and offer a good spatial complexity, there is an attenuated theme and texture variety.- Too much ammo (personal pet peeve :)- Limited enemy selection. Aside from the basic replica soldier with different skins and HP/armor (skins look good), there are about 5 other enemy types: heavy soldiers, mechs, flying mechanical things that shoot lasers, stealth kung fu commandos, and ghosts. Minus the regular replica soldiers, all the other enemies numbers, individually, are in the single digits, save the ghosts, but youll only see them once.- More environmental interaction would be preferable personally. You are basically limited to opening and closing doors, breaking things like glass, and pushing the button that advances the story.I played this game through when it was released, but never got the expansions or sequals. I got the bundle of all of them on sale, and am glad I played through the original again. Being almost 10 years now since I originally played it, I can now really appreciate how good the AI actually is. FEAR's AI was revolutionary at the time, and remains as a high standard that few FPS games get to (mention some if you can, Id like to know of more games with impressive AI like this).As the player, you are as vulnerable to bullets as the enemies, and more so on higher difficulty levels. To be good at countering the AI, a person cannot approach the enemies as they would a normal FPS, meaning you cannot charge into combat and hop around a lot, or jump out into the open with guns blazing, with a little adadadadadadadadad dancing here and there. Try that, and even on medium, youll get torn to pieces. You also cannot wait for the soldiers to come to you; if you do, youll be waiting a loooong time. You must actively engage the majority of them as they use cover to wait for you.Cover and leaning around corners is essential, especially on hard difficulty, and without question necessary on extreme difficulty. Expose your body for more than just a second (and sometimes not even), and youll take damage. Stay uncovered and in LOS to multiple enemies, and youre sure to die.""Reflex Time"", or bullet time, is slow mo that can be activated for short periods at will. It is not really necessary to use it unless playing extreme difficulty, but is a lot of fun at times, allowing you set up some impressive moves.The combat AI and battles with it is where this game shines, and remains truly impressive, even a decade later. While there are some shortcomings to FEAR, the stellar AI mitigates much of their effect.Highly recommended.			",111,27,0,14,14,0,13

												Honestly the best straight shooter I've ever played.  Will run on just about anything, can be got for under $10 on steam sales (with it's sequels).  The perceus mandate ""expandalone"" that comes with it (it comes with the base game, the extraction point expansion, and perceus mandate) is honestly one of the hardest but most satisfying games I've played.As far as being scary?  Don't count on it, it's a great shooter that I would reccomend to anyone, but it's not scary.Edit:  There is a multiplayer service available for this game at http://fear-community.org/about/ ",1025,273,36,146,107,12,154

												F.E.A.R. is a fun and creepy first person shooter which allows the player to slow down time and adds some horror elements to spice things up. As the game progresses the story becomes a little confusing, however the intelligent AI and challenging enemies makes the game engaging. Once the main game is completed there are 2 expansions which add some variety in weapons, enemies, and areas; however the game feels a little repetitive by the middle of the first expansion.

												I just now replayed the game from the beginning to the end including all expansions. It amazes me how well this games holds on with current FPS titles. The graphics is still good. It's easy to play this game on max settings since it's a old game, but it looks great for it's time. Gameplay is great too. Everything is pretty much works as you would expect from a corridor FPS title but it's good if you're after this experience.While I tried to follow the story it's still confused me at time since it's told quite sloppy but thanks to the expansions I had a chance to have a deeper look to the events of the world since I was really curious who is who and why things happened the way they did. Overall it's okay but don't expect much. It's a old style shooter and it should tell you all you need to know. Mission is simple. Kill bad guys and monsters. Survive till the end.Overall it's surprisingly good game. If you're after old style FPS experience I can't recommend it enough.			",282,142,1,33,7,0,24

												An appropriate title, considering how thick the suspense is at times.  It's almost comedic how much of a relief it can be to run headlong into a horde of cloned troopers that don't hesitate in their attempts to cut you down with military precision, the bullet time at your command serving as a strangely calming intermission between being stalked by a psychic being that does little more than whisper creepy things to your character, with some hallucinations thrown in for good measure.  Speaking of visual deception, somehow the graphical fidelity in this game is even more impressive than on day one, with the clean yet seemingly anachronistic technical limitations of 2005 serving as beauty marks on the ahead-of-its-time Jupiter EX engine.  Monolith created a truly Legendary FPS with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*** F.E.A.R. ***The good stuff...- As a shooter it does it's job, much fun- The enemy actually has some intelligence, they hide, they search, they advance coordinated and so on- The graphics is very good for a game this old- Lots of fun to melee the enemy, you can jump-kick, slide-kick, punch and so on. No generic MW stabbing here- I guess the storyline could be considered good. Very eerieThe bad stuff...- Gets repetative after a while, best played in small doses- The enemy soldiers are very generic, it feels like you shoot the same guy over and over again even if it's sweet- The stupid answering-machine messages EVERYWHERE. It get's old really fast- The levels could be more differentiaded, it's just office complex after office complex, basement after basement- The spooky music could be mixed up a bit- The kickback on the guns are annoying. Way exaggerated compared to real world guns- It won't let you aim by HOLDING the right mouse button, you have to CLICK. I hate thatFinal verdict...7/10 - It's like Half-Life combined with a John Woo movie. HAAY-YAAH!			",312,39,0,21,8,0,4

												F.E.A.R. is the only game that makes me feel like I'm playing as Neo from the matrix (Theres no relation but have what you will, the games combat was a absolute inspiration from the movie I swear, you can increase your reaction and agility with the slow mo ability that slows everything around you down. I praise this game for it's horror moments and overly creative use of physics and scenory manipulated by pure horror, having the world change around you in such a spetacular matter is intoxicating. I don't get scared of much but I'm sure some people would be freaked out by this.This game is  right up there with half life, doom, duke nukem, perfect dark, golden eye, time splitters and other amazing games. There are 2 things I can say bad about it, the first being the character walk speed which is okay because it benifits the tactical nature of the game, this is one of the most tactical shooters you will play outside of half life, it has many acrobatic moves to sweep, cut balance and and out right stun your enemy, and it pairs with the gun combat so well. This is one of the only shooters I find forgiving in the character walk speed department. The second being the story, it's good until the ending where I feel follows a clacay Friday the 13th did what happen just happen. However the story has many twist and is overall great.The expansion packs are simply more fear, there story is meh but the game play is a nice popsicle true fans can lick who simply die for my fear.

												I love F.E.A.R., but it frustrates me. It's three different games stuck together; there's the moderately atmospheric but never scary horror game; there's the gray,  unbelievably  repetitive corror shooter which is almost entirely set in office buildings or generic underground facilities; finally there's an incredible tactical shooter which feels and looks great and combines both old school and modern sensibilities. F.E.A.R. thinks it's scary, and maybe it could be if it'd commit. Although being so powerful diminishes horror, the non-combat sections could have been scary or tense if they weren't so rigidly divorced from the rest of the game and entirely predictable. Alma had potential, but you quickly realize she poses no threat. The hallucinitory segments are visually striking but unintercative and poorly presented. At times the atmosphere works, but F.E.A.R. is just afraid to commit to fear.Worse than that though, is the environment design. Do you like gray? This is your game. Do you like office buildings, water treatment facilities, and warehouses? Have at it, friend. With such drab and repetitive environments, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb. It's as if they had a binder of environmental designs, but lost most of it in a fire except the most boring parts, and didn't have time to make any more. For a game with such great lighting effects, the endless labyrinths of grey and off-white are shameful.For all of that negativity, the game has one saving grace. The shooting. It's rare to play a game where guns feel so powerful. A shotgun at close range is likely to straight up tear weaker enemies in half; enemies jerk about under hails of assault rifle fire; the HLV Penetrator (fun fact, for a long time, thanks to the game's font I thought it was the HIV Penetrator), which is basically the Stake Gun from Painkiller, nails enemies to the walls; unlike in most games, explosions leave parts of enemies throughou the room. Bullets leave craters on the walls and floors, papers go flying,  windows shatter, and hanging lamps flicker and swing from the force of explosions. Every weapon feels, well, like a deadly weapon should.However, the enemies in F.E.A.R. are surprisingly smart. They will try to flank you, throw grenades to get you out of cover, and move quickly if under fire. Every encounter is intense as you die quickly, and you will have to use health packs and armor wisely since none of it regenerates. Most fights have at least two routes of approach, so your postioning matters. Really your only advantage is the slow motion, which besides letting you see every visceral detail, gives you time to aim and think. Most shooters could learn a thing or two from F.E.A.R. about combat. Oh and there's a story too, but very little actually happens, and I rarely had any reason to think about itUnfortunately, F.E.A.R.  suffers from the boring environmental design and the noticably segmented gameplay, which is a crying shame, since its gleefully visceral combat and consistently intelligent enemies are light years above and beyond any thing most games offer. If you can put up with those problems this is definitely worth you money. 10/10 for combat, 5/10 for everthing else.			",207,39,2,29,8,0,4

												I've come to the conclusion that F.E.A.R is almost my favorite shooter. It's almost the perfect shooter really if it wasn't for interval 11 and the tedium of shooting the waves of paranormal crossing over during your escape. Despite the shortcomings which are few, this is the best gameplay in a first person shooter I've played.  It all just feels so great and really does make you feel like ""a god among men"" as Harlan Wade put it to Pointman. All of the guns feel powerful the way they impact the enemies and the enviroment which coupled with the amazing sound design of them leads to firefights that leave you feeling like a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥looking over the carnage you just inflicted. The game gets a lot of praise for its ai and rightfully so as the enemies reactions are always impressive as long as you give them time to react before killing them. I especially like how they might be taking cover from you and one shouts out that he's in cover then another replicant will tell him to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. Also really like how F.E.A.R. has an explanation for why there are so many bad guys to kill. I know it's just a video game but it always bugs me anyway when a game prided on its narrative just throws random bad guys at you (Uncharted). It's especially cool in this game considering the replicant forces context. Speaking of the narrative I think F.E.A.R. has a very interesting one and all it's just a little weird that your team was formed to combat the paranormal and supernatural and yet every time Fettel's signal disapears nobody knows whats up or the Armacham problem is written off at first as a ""gas leak"" not expected paranormal activity but when you find delta force teams flayed corpses nobody bats an eye. Still the story is properly spooky and keeps the ball rolling. Again shortcomings aside this is one of my favorite shooters. Probably my favorite shooter of the last generation and some might argue the best. I cant recommend it enough.			",391,50,7,47,10,2,32

												Rating 8/10What is it?First Person Shooter with the ability to slow time for a limited durationThe Good:+On a technical level, the graphics are pretty amazing. 9 years later and this game still holds up. Note: I was playing with everything maxed out but it still speaks to how good the game is. The lighting is equally impressive.+The particle effects are fantastic. Every gun battle truly feels like you just finished an epic showdown, with debris, dust ,blood and other effects flying everywhere+When the game was released it was noted for having great AI. This is still the case, and in some regards better than most games today.

												This review will include the main game, and it's expansions, as they don't have their own store pages.F.E.A.R.Gameplay is awesome, guns have lots of weight to them, and you feel like a powerful badass. Gameplay feels kind of mix of Half-Life and something else. Level design is quite similar to first Half-Life game, and It made this even more enjoyable for me. I remembered fear as a horror game with shooter elements, but replaying it now i appreciate it much more. It's damn good shooter. Slo-mo is fun, and useful in hard situations. Game took me 4,5h beat on easy. HLTB says average is over 8 hours, so i guess that difficulty made the game quite a bit shorter.F.E.A.R.: Extraction PointContinues the main games story, and picks up straight where the campaign ended. If you graved for more, this will satisfy you quite well. Took me about half the time compared to main game, so good value for an expansion! New guns, new story etc.FEAR: Perseus MandateSecond expansion, where you play a different character at the same time the main game took place. You are part of second F.E.A.R. team. This one was more of the same, with even more new weapons. Some new enemies, and new story as well. Overall, Game and it's expansions are quite damn enjoyable shooters with some horror elements. If you don't like horror, it should not be that big of a problem, the game is shooter, and the storyline is part horror.			",953,273,26,84,87,9,85

												Extremely fun shooter with a unique style and some good scares!  The guns all feel as though they belong in the game, and the atmosphere, when not in a firefight, is intense.  For being made in 2005, the graphics are outstanding!  Some bland textures will be noticed, but the particle affects and fire animations are a splendid sight.The combat is rough at first.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, ""bullet time,"" that takes a little getting used to.  Once the player has a better understanding of the AI and the use of the bullet time, things will start to get interesting, and by ""interesting"" I mean out of control!  Watching the chaos unfold in slow-motion is a lot of fun, and the ability will be VERY important in the late game fights.The characters are all well made and the voice actors are good as well.  The game does a great job making the player feel isolated from the rest of the friendly NPCs.  It wouldn't be very scary if a team of bots came along for the ride.  Just like Gordon Freeman, the main character has no input to the events around him, which seems a bit odd considering some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥that unfolds.The weapons themselves work well for the game, but they were far from my favorite part.  Apart from the pistols and a small number of other guns, almost every weapon in the game is burst fire, even the sniper rifle and rocket launcher, and that was a bit frustrating.  As the game progresses, some additional weapons, that are not burst fire, will be found: the shotgun and a type of bolt thrower are awesome.The scary portions of the game seemed a little skewed at times, and at others, some of the best in an FPS.  Even though the use of a loud screeching sound was over-used, a lot of the spooks came from deep within -- that voice and feeling in the back of the player's mind that does not agree with what's on screen; unfortunately, the placement of these scares were a little off some times.  There were a number of scares that I missed and had to reload a section to see what happened due to a misjudgment of the player's actions.The balance of action with tension was great.  Even if it was a mite predictable at times, there were plenty of moments that had me jumping out of my seat!  Worth every penny.

F.E.A.R.: Extraction point review below:The follow-up dlc for F.E.A.R, aka Extraction point, picks up right where F.E.A.R. leaves off.  F1 leaves the player with an amazing ending to the game and choosing for the dlc to work as a conclusion is a grand idea!The dlc starts out fast and wastes no time throwing the player right back into the mix; unfortunately, if the two games are played back to back, the combat can and will become extremely repetitive!  The  first two thirds of the game are top notch.  The combat is more furious than the first game, and there is no need to slowly work the player into the tension.  The cards are on the table and Alma is out of the bag --  so to speak.Personally, the horror moments of Extraction point are better than it's predecessor's; however, like it was mentioned already, after the first half of the game or so, the horror segments and hallucinations become the only thing worth working towards.The combat fails towards the end due to the fact that the same tactic works for the whole game!  On top of that, the longer the point man (your character) makes his way through the city, the less and less it makes sense that there has been ZERO military or police response to the numerous explosions happening though-out the subway and surround buildings.  A one man army scenario can work, Gordon Freeman, but the setting has to make sense.  Gordon was stuck in a city that was controlled by the same people attempting to kill him.  In extraction point, it just feels like the world has forgotten about you.Lastly, there's the silent hero gig...  It worked for Gordon because he was never actually put into a situation where his lack of response didn't some how ""work"" with the dialog.  In Extraction point, the point man simply ignores the people talking to him even when it's a desperate plea for help or acknowledgment.  Friendly NPCs die because it.If you plan on playing Extraction point, do not play it right after F1, do yourself that favor.  It's a fun and tense game, but it can be really frustrating.

												This game. Ohhhhh, this game. It was one of the most powerful games of it's time, and still holds up as an emotional and involving piece second to only that of Half-life. Either from it's chilling atmosphere to it's deep, involving story to it's rock-solid combat, this game will thrill you to the core, and you will finish it feeling emotionally drained and deeply satisfied.And the expansions? They're alright. Extraction Point focused more on the horror and tenseful atmospheres, while Perseus Mandate was mostly about the gun fights and hard pumping action. Take your pick on which one to go through first after beating the first game, as it doesn't really matter.			",175,10,2,10,9,2,6

												This is by far the best first-person shooter I have ever played. I have played COD, Battlefield, Far Cry, Overwatch, Destiny, etc. and they are all great games, but F.E.A.R. will never compare to them. It has super smart A.I., great destructible environments, and extremely awesome gun play. The slow-motion is more than incredible. I got it on sale for $2.49 during the Summer and WHAT A DEAL this was! By all means, BUY IT NOW! If you haven't played it, you are missing out on one of the greatest first-person shooters ever!

												In my opinnion this is THE fps. It was fun, addicting and scary. If you enjoy single player only fps's, and you can stand some older settings this one is worth a shot by all means. I got fully immersed into this game with a pair of surrond sound headphones, when I had the slightest tap on my shoulder damned near shot through the ceiling. If you get immersed into it you will fear Alma just ask steve.

												I find it difficult to believe that this game was made over 9 years ago! Many games today might have more bells and whistles and current day graphics but are not as fun to play.Though as you can see from the screenshots the graphics were advanced for it's day and still hold up well.Be carefull of the enemy AI. They will flank you and kick your♥♥♥♥♥The story in this game is very interesting with at least 2 enemy factions competing to kill you.The path you take through the game is linear but in a good way with minor puzzles to solve best way around obstacles and locked doors.What I found surprising was how large the expansions are. I had played the base game previously and replayed it along with the other two this time around. The expansions in the good old days were as big as the base game itself. Not like DLC's these days that give you a new camo and a couple of different guns.Play this game at night when all is quiet with the lights off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R., lembro que joguei ele em 2005 qdo foi lançado mas não cheguei a terminar. Tinha achado legal pacaraio, mas com cenários meio repetitivos. Resolvi tirar a poeira do jogo e ir até o final e ver se minha visão do jogo mudava.Ao contrário de jogos como Doom 3 e Half-Life 2, graficamente o jogo não envelheceu bem. A engine não é legal. Deus Ex 1 com Unreal Engine envelheceu melhor, e a sensação é que FEAR foi lançado em 2003, ou algo assim. Sombras duras e ambientes escuros demais te forçam a usar uma lanterna que ilumina só a curta distância. Sons ambientes são processados de forma estranha também, e o jogo no geral é bem silencioso.Na época ele competiu com Quake 4 e a grande vantagem dele, q deu toda a atenção, foi a Inteligencia Artificial. Ela é ♥♥♥♥. Ela faz bom uso do level design q em áreas de batalha possuem mais de um caminho, te deixando tenso sobre onde olhar, te forçando a jogar de forma mais tática. A IA é capaz de te flanquaer, pular catwalks, parapeitos e até janelas quebradas, usar cover e lean pra se proteger dos seus tiros enquanto atira, e as vezes só colocar o braço pra fora da cobertura pra atirar. ♥♥♥♥. Ainda to pra ver IA melhor em jogos FPS.Combate é dificil e você toma muito dano com pouco tiro, e o jogo equilibra colocando sempre muito medkit e armor em locais de combate. Isso meio que quebra a surpresa de certos combates pq vc passa numa área com esses itens e sabe q a coisa vai ficar preta. Eu preferiria que o jogo tivesse equilibrado melhor os danos e colocado menos medkit. Por outro lado, quando você passa de um combate e não precisa usar medkit nem repor seu armor você se sente ♥♥♥♥ e q sua tática foi boa.A história é interessante e ao mesmo tempo não. Eu não curto o quase plágio do filme O Chamado (q eu curto bastante) com a história da menina, mas no final das contas ela até q se desenvolve de forma interessante apesar de bem previsível. O jogo te dá uns sustos legítimos, principalmente nas expansões. Acho que tomei mais susto aqui do que no Outlast.Level Design é bom, o q ajuda a IA a funcionar, pois áreas de combate geralmente tem dois caminhos. Mas o cenário se repete muito. Você passa muito tempo dentro de um prédio onde é tudo muito igual. Corredores, escritórios, copas, mais corredores, escritórios... Sem muita variedade. Nas expansões isso melhora muito.Sobre as expansões: a primeira, Extraction Point, é continuação direta do jogo original, acaba sendo um pouco mais do mesmo, e prolonga um pouco a história do jogo que é meio curto. Foram 8hs pra terminar o original e mais 5 pra terminar a primeira expansão.A segunda, Perseus Mandate, é bem melhor e na minha opinião obrigatória jogar se você curte o jogo. É uma história paralela muito bem encaixada com o original, mostrando eventos sobre outro angulo. As vezes lembra um pouco Half-Life, q ele se esforça pra ser, mas não chega a tanto. Foram mais 8hs de jogo que valeram muito a pena. Além dos cenários variados, eles melhoraram um pouco o engine com o lance das sombras cruas, e aqui os ambientes são um pouco mais claros e a sombras mais suaves.Se você curte FPS e tiver o jogo empoeirado e não tiver terminado ainda, jogue, com as expansões. Se jogou o jogo original, jogue as expansões, pelo menos o Perseus Mandate.			",394,88,23,44,40,3,66

												I still remember playing that game 10 years back. And what I remember is a constant feeling of uneasiness. This game no frightens you, it gives you feeling of being misplaced. Like ""what am I doing here?"", ""why again I'm all alone and should attack dozens of heavily-armored intelligent soldiers?"". Or even ""Why my mother is such a ♥♥♥♥♥?""So, remembering all that uncomfortable stuff along with the point it is a railroaded FPS with stupid and logically inconsistent story... and it's not only railroaded, but keeps you in dark and narrow corridors of industrial premises... Usually it's pretty obvious for me at that point that the game is sucks.Not this one, though. Yeah, about it's story - the less you know, the better. Don't bother looking some evidences, or reading any briefing info - it's only make you more uncomprehending.It's all about visuals and behavior of your enemies. About whom ""story"" tells you as of mindless puppets, controlling remotely by the main villain. Wrong point. Not only those soldiers acting together, like covering each other with fire and outmaneuvering you, skirting from different angles. They are, in fact, assess the situation and act correspondingly. They even show some emotions! Like answering ""no way!"" when they are few, and their commander urges them ""Forward!"".And for visuals part... I'm not into all that technological stuff about particles, shadows and so on. Usually. It is irrelevant for me basically. But there, in those narrow corridors of industrial premises - when I'm shoot and when I'm shooting at - I see clouds of dust and crumbs when bullets hit the walls, and it feels so realistic that I don't remember any of so praised FPS later, which gives you so natural experience from the middle of shootout.You know, I've started this game to write a turning down review. I'm strongly not liking the game plot, its cutscenes, voices from the answering machines - all connected with the story. But the game mechanics in F.E.A.R. makes me retreat in awe. It is a masterpiece, which stands proudly above the endless railroaded FPS games like the Call of Duty series.Yeah, multiplayer part of the F.E.A.R. is no more, so the only reason to buy the game now - is to feel how much plainer and stupid modern shooters are.But it is well worth it's price. 7.5/10 (only for lack of decent story, gameplay is second to none).

												My favorite game of all time, F.E.A.R combines action and horror that is purely unique and can never be recreated. You take the role of First Encounter Assault Recon's Pointman where the mission is to kill a man named Paxton Fettel. The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman. There are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use ""bullet-time"" that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties. The biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.Amazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game. It even comes with both expansion packs.			",163,10,1,7,18,2,29

												One of the greatest FPS games of all time. When F.E.A.R. was released in 2005, it was critically acclaimed for it graphics and superior A.I. Now almost 12 years later, the game still plays sharp as it did back then, Despite the advancement in visuals, the A.I, in modern games pale in comparission to the A.I in F.E.A.R. Contrary to what the description says, this is no horror game. There are instances of jump scares but you hardly need to be afraid when you have 3 powerful guns and overpowered meele attacks at your disposal. I would call this a FPS with a horror story.The campaign is roughly 7 hrs and its bundled with the 2 non canonical expansions. If you like FPS games like Doom and HL, you will love F.E.A.R. Buy it if you haven't already.			",42,11,0,2,0,0,1

												I just bought this game yesterday, it is amazing, why the hell did i put of buying it for this long? The replicas behave better than some modern enemies, (jumping through windows, waiting in ambush after hearing shots, etc) and I'm actually scared by the weird stuff like the moving boxes and creepy figures.  I'm amazed, I definately reccomend this!			",188,9,0,9,11,0,6

												Just beat the game and really enjoyed it! It controls smoothly, graphics are decent, didn't encounter many bugs. Solidly programmed! The story is relatively vague, but it is still intruiging and progressed nicely. Flashbacks, some laptops, and voicemessages help piece things together. Not a very scary game besides a jumpscare or two that got me. In fact, I found myself laughing a good bit at some of the enemy reactions! I just kill somebody and another guy shouts our, ""Are you all right?"" Freaking roflcopter! The atmosphere is wonderful! From open areas that make you feel vulnerable to tight, dark corridors that keep you on edge, the variety of the settings kept the game feeling fresh. There are sometimes different routes to take to complete your objectives which gives a level of strategy. Sadly the enemies were pretty much copy and pasted with a few tougher armored ones here and there. If the enemies were as varied as the different environments, I'd be even happier! I have not yet tried the multiplayer, so no comment there. However, singleplayer was definitely fun and worth a play!			",111,24,1,16,6,0,1

												An awesome Classic! I wouldn't say this is the scariest game to me because I'm so used to scary games anyway but it's very very creepy. The storyline is very unique and there is a lot of twists and forshadowing. F.E.A.R. is like Half Life  the horror version. It's also not very linear but there isn't a different outcome. There just happens to be several ways to get from Point A to Point B. F.E.A.R also includs two expansions for free which are seperate games in your steam library. The game used to have multiplayer but it was removed a while ago. You can still get it elsewhere on the internet and it still has an active community.			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												The U.S. version of the Steam store packs the original F.E.A.R. and both its expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Although the expansion packs are not officially canon, they are still entertaining and utilize the same mechanics as the first game. F.E.A.R. looks, feels, sounds and plays great. Certainly one of the best first-person shooters to date, F.E.A.R. has aged well with its unique ""slow-mo"" feature that is similar to ""bullet time"" from the Matrix movies. It should be noted that there is an outstanding bug with the game that conflicts with some gaming mice (most notable Logitech) that destroys the game's frame rate after a prolonged gaming session.

												Considering that more that 10 years passed since its release. This game still holds up pretty well.Shadows and models seems a bit silly, but still looks pretty decent. Game mechanics are very satisfying even with the weird gun recoils..NPC AI is great and refreshing, they hide behind corners, dont go charging at you like scared animal.It has that wibe of a scary game, but isn't very scary. There are a few jump scares though.All in all still worth it to have it in your library and play through at least once even so many years after release.			",266,62,6,29,21,6,25

												F.E.A.R. is a survival horror game, but honestly the horror part isnt that scary. The FPS part is super fun though. The weapons are brutal and the enemies work together to try and anahilate you. The game is hard at times but never unfair, it makes sure to never baby you and let you work things out yourself. The greatest thing about this game is probably the enemies, they shout out commands to their squad and their squad will respond in turn. If you try to ambush them and one hears you knock something over he'll tell the others, if one goes silent they'll go into search mode, if one gets pinned down or sees you flanking he'll tell the others and they will react in turn. People who like dark themes bordering on paranormal, tactical fps games, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, or enjoy a good (but not too intense) scare will usually love this game. In other words most people will love this game.			",153,7,0,10,5,0,2

												I would like to preface this review by saying this: this is a great game. If you see it on sale, buy it.F.E.A.R., borders the line between horror, and action. And it does one of those well.Now, I would not recommend F.E.A.R. as a horror game, because it simply isn't that scary. It is however, unsettling, and I did jump at least a couple of times. The atmosphere in this game is phenomenal, the eerie sounds, the oppresive nature of the environment, and the way you always feel like you're against insurmountable odds really come together to make everything just feel right.Now, don't get me wrong, the game does have some genuine scares, but it really overall it just fits into the ""2spooky4me"" territory of ""scary"". The one enemy that did scare me were the phase-shifting ninja guys. You see a shadow when walking through a hall way from another room, so you look over and you see this... spider looking thing in the corner of the room... and it slowly turn its head to you to reveal its human form before jumping at you and disappearing and reforming on another wall. Sh*t, I just had to pause the game and take a break for a minute at that point.The enemies are tough, smart, and they work together with each other in a way that I have never seen in any other game, so much so that you aren't even frustrated when you die most of the time, you are just like ""well, I've been outsmarted"". The game still looks great, dispite being a 2005 game. The lighting effects are outstanding, and the slo-mo effect you can use makes everything much more dramatic. The level design really is top-notch and made me actually think about what I should do before a fire-fight. You can see the shadows of enemy soldiers peek from around a corner before they see you, giving you time to hide or run to a place to ambush them. At one point you are climbing a ladder, and through the ladder you see an enemy placing mines in a hallway, so you know to avoid them when you pass through. It's just done very well.Everything about it was really well thought out and made me realize you rarely see this kind of thing in modern FPS games. They just try to compete by having bigger explosions and and scripted sequences than the last, and yet this game has close to none and still manages to have a cinematic feel just by having the AI react to everything in a very human-like way. It's just GOOD.GFX = 8.5/10 It is a game from 2005, but it still holds up. The lighting is great, and the effects look good.Sound = 9/10 Eerie ambiance, music that sets the mood, and enemy voices all sound fine. No complaints.Replay = 7/10 F.E.A.R. honestly doesn't have that much replay value to it, but it does come with its 2 expansions, so at least you can get some solid game time out of it. I have yet to play the expansions, but the base game took me about 6 hours to complete.Story = 7.5/10 The story was honestly pretty boring until about halfway through, and you never really cared about any of the characters. This doesn't effect the enjoyment of the game much however.OVERALL = 8.5/10 Buy it.			",389,64,9,47,36,4,38

												One of my favorite FPS games that I have ever played. It is a horror game, so expect a lot of gore, creepy moments, and jumpscares. The combat in this game feels and looks amazing. You have a slow motion ability that gives you the edge on your enemies. It makes the gunfights look very cool when you have bullets whizzing by your head and you are running up to things to deliver a shotgun blast into them and they explode into pieces. The grenade effects are one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in a game. When they explode (especially in slow motion), the particle effects from the blast look awesome. Try throwing them in a group of enemies with lots of destroyable objects around them and watch the eye candy.The A.I. in this game is one of the best ever created. Your opponents will be constantly calling out different tactics to deal with you and then executing them in the middle of a gunfight with you. They constantly try to flank you, send multiple formations at you, throw grenades at you behind cover, and lots of other methods. Good thing you have that slow motion ability to deal with them. The only negative thing I can say about this game is that it is a corridor shooter. You run through a lot of enclosed areas and a most of them are the same thing over and over while going through the storyline. The 'scary' moments are a hit or miss for people. I think it did a great job for the time that it came out in delivering a scary experience. Even after playing through the game multiple times, that 'ladder scene' still gets me every single time!The main game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore and listen to the audio recordings scattered throughout the levels. The Extraction Point DLC is worth getting too. It's about a 4 hour long DLC, that continues where this game left off. It still has all the great elements that made the main game so good. The only other thing I will say about it is, Holiday didn't deserve that :( Avoid the other DLC. It's terrible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I forgot how much of a great game the original F.E.A.R. was. I played this game way back in 2005 when it was first released, and I had an absolute blast playing though it again. It has a nice mixture of fast paced game play with some horror tossed in it. And it’s not cheesy ""American horror"" either. None of those lame sudden movements or gore that tries to gross you out. The game's horror was heavily influenced by Japanese horror movies, like the original ""Ring."" F.E.A.R. does an excellent job in making you wonder about what is going on all while keeping you on your toes as you progress through the story. The game is a visual treat as well. F.E.A.R, being a game that first came out on PC back in 2005, has definitely aged but it has aged well. Some parts of the game just look fantastic. The designers have done an excellent job of using the lighting to their advantage. The shadows and overall dark environments of the game help to enhance the atmosphere. Even the small things, such as lights flickering, lights of a phone that has a voicemail on it, and empty offices where the only light source is a computer monitor just help to make it that much creepier. You’ll find yourself constantly using your flashlight, and dread walking through long dark hallways. I highly recommend this game, even if you're not a big fan of first person shooters. It’s definitely a must buy if you don’t have it already, and a great game to add to your collection. It goes on sale constantly on Steam, so don’t hesitate to pick it up if you’re interested. F.E.A.R. 2 was also a pretty great game. I personally liked it a lot, but I found the first one to be a bit better. The expansion packs for the first game were just pretty average. I have not played F.E.A.R. 3, but I’ve heard that it’s the least well received of the trilogy. You’ll be perfectly fine with just the original F.E.A.R.  ",289,42,5,25,13,0,24

												My favorite game of all time, F.E.A.R combines action and horror that is purely unique and can never be recreated. You take the role of First Encounter Assault Recon's Pointman where the mission is to kill a man named Paxton Fettel. The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman. There are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use ""bullet-time"" that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties. The biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.Amazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game. It even comes with both expansion packs.			",163,10,1,7,18,2,29

												F.E.A.R. was the first horror game I ever played all the way through. I recently revisited it since I picked them all up on steam. And I got to say it holds up. Unlike most modern horrors, that show you horrific creatures mauling people or torturing them, F.E.A.R. takes a different approach. At times you almost forget that you are playing a horror game. You spend a lot of your time in office buildings and research labs encountering soldiers trying to kill you. It feels like a standard FPS game. But they sprinkle horror elements into the game throughout. Whether it is from the unerving quiet of the offices, or from glimpses of people who vanish or rooms full of blood, you are quickly reminded that something is not right. The FPS gameplay is solid for a game of its time. It feels reminiscant of Half Life. I recommend playing this game on the higher difficulties. This not only increases the horror of the game due to tension of ammo and health supply but also makes the game more of a challenge. F.E.A.R. has a slow motion ability that you can use for a short amount of time, and it recharges over time. On easier difficulties, this makes the game a breeze. On harder difficulties, I found myself saving it for when I truly needed it. I recommend checking out pcgamingwiki.com for some tweaks to all the games. I had to increas the FOV for it. It looks a tab weird at first, but nothing that takes away from the game.The F.E.A.R. series will always be in my short list of horrors I recommend. Definitely worth picking up if you havent played through it before, turn of the lights, put on the headphones and have at it.			",152,17,4,9,6,0,1

												There has to be some appeal to the idea that one person taking out a group of bad guys in style is 'A grade' material for a lot of different kinds of media, whether it be movies or games. The thrill of one highly trained operative taking on the world never gets old, and being in the shoes of one is better. Video games are a perfect way to put the player in the spot and what better way to do this then in F.E.A.R.  now F.E.A.R is what you get if you combine ""the raid"" with ""the ring"", a beautiful ballet of♥♥♥♥♥kicking action with themes of the supernatural. It has some good set pieces and level design even if it's linear, the levels are still wide enough for experimentation. But let's get down to the details. Gameplay The core gameplay is based on close quarter shooting and the use of your reflexes. The reflexes aspect make the game go into slow motion for making more accurate shots and better judgment in areas around you. The reflexes are really well designed and might I say this, if shooting a guy then grabbing his gun in mid air to shoot at another  guy doesn't appeal to you then you probably should stop reading this. It even lets you see the special effects differently then what you would see without the reflexes, like Explosions warping the area around them. The guns in this game are pretty amazing if not overdone on purpose. It may not make sense that a sub-machine gun with an mp5 mag have 50 rounds and a fire rate the same as a mini-gun but that's the whole point.  Oh yeah and even the way you kill people can be cool as well. Especially the shotgun that shreds people into piecies, and a particle smasher that literally turns enemies into skeletonsartificial intelligenceI also have to say that the AI are really smart, they give orders to each other during battle and try to get the drop on the player in ways that the player would never guess. They even work with each other to flank and get to better positions to stop the player dead. I played this on hard and if I didn't have reflexes I would have never beaten the game. In summary the whole thing is suppose to be a stupid but enjoyable action game that doesn't take itself too seriously, (well maybe the story). Don't think too hard about why a flying kick does more damage than a gunshot to the head, it's all for mechanics sake to make an enjoyable game without ruining it for the story. Atmosphere Now if you have been reading this and you read the words ""well maybe the story"" I'll tell you right now that it's interesting, but not amazing. The story goes that you are an operative of F.E.A.R  and have to stop an army of psychedelic cloned soldiers that can communicate telepathically. Avoiding the games obvious moral (don't waste money on war) the game tries to be like bioshock in the twist of the story, but is delivered very poorly. It even tries to do the horror elements but with most twits, (including me) its actually quite hard to scare someone who's behind a monitor especially playing as a guy who can take care of himself in an end of world scenario. But don't ignore the game for the story, do it for the gameplay, that what the developers were trying to do. Negatives There is not really much to say about the negatives in this game, Unless you call the mixed feelings of the story negative. Well a couple I could really think of is the characters. In one scene you meet up with a lady operative and one of the nameless F.E.A.R soldiers who's with her and all join up in a room with the ceiling drenched in blood. She wasn't even scared about it, including the git with her and I thought they were literally clones in disguise. But no that was her and it's never brought up again.  So the character building is bad except for the fat guy wearing a flower shirt and the antagonist. If the story was given to Bioware they would push this under the carpet and make a good story, probably with an option to bone one of the team members.but the biggest one there is, is that theres no mission select, and take it from me. If you want to replay the missions, save at the beginning of every level, you'll thank me later.conclusionIt's a really good first person action game and I could also go on to the music and physics in the game to make more positive remarks but know this. If taking down a team of soldiers with the skill and accuracy of a hopped up cs:go player on adrenaline shots is appealing then go play this. It's cheap, it even has two expansion packs and a lot of hours of content to play and I cannot recommend it enough. If fighting is not your thing and you want a good story or tackle a situation differently, go play deus ex or the old thief series.  If nothing I said is appealing then go outside because you are clearly someone's who takes to much advice from fox news.			",146,44,0,9,5,0,5

												What can i say about this game? The story and the gameplay is just fantastic. Ive really enjoyed playing  F.E.A.R and its stand-alone expansion packs.  I love it when you can dive in these action scenes  and finish off  the replica soldiers, mercs, nightcrawlers etc in style, as if you are a well-trained supersoldier.  For a fairly old game it does have clever enemies. For instance  if the enemies  see you they scatter arround the place. Some enemies find cover and try to flush you out or keep you pinned down  so that others try to flank you. Then you have this horror-movie like atmosphere in these games where you enter a bloody building and you dont know who or what is waiting for you around the corner on every floor.  To be honest i didnt feel like  F.E.A.R and  F.E.A.R Extraction point was scary.  F.E.A.R Perseus mandate did have a pretty good scary atmosphere and there were a  few parts in it that scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, like for instance one time when i was  loading stuff in to my inventory and I didnt realize that something was waiting behind me for me to turn around.  Ive spotted two minor issues but they are not so critical or anything. When you enter a scene and intense audio sound starts to play, this gives the player the signal that there is going to be a battle. when you win the battle the intense audio keeps playing and this is kinda confusing because it gives me the idea that there are some additional enemies who are going to barge in any moment when there arent any. The intense audio sound stops when you enter a diffrent area and this issue happend only a few times in the games. The second small issue is , there was one time when the game is done loading  the next level, it knocked me back to the main menu with an message ""server disconnected"". I dont know why it did that but this happend in my experience only once in the games extraction point and perseus mandate. Luckily you can bypass this problem by lowering your game settings and re-configure them back when the next level is loaded. Like i said before F.E.A.R. and its stand-alone expansion packs are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Its worth the money and  im glad i have them in my library. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												G.R.E.A.T.This was a replay for me, having first played FEAR some years ago. I had fond memories of the game and thought it time to revisit it. I’m glad I did. The game has a wonderfully spooky and tense atmosphere and outdoes many more recent titles in this respect (it still startled me on several occasions). The graphics are pretty good given the game’s age. It comes from the era when FPSs were commonly set in research facilities, abandoned factories, and office buildings, and this lack of diversity in the environments is one of the game’s weaknesses. As is the lack of humour -- there are no laughs here. But the game’s strengths lie in the atmosphere and in the combat. There is a palpable sense of apprehension as you sneak along the corridors under the flickering lights. The AI is crafty and the combat is always fun, especially when using the slo-mo, or bullet-time, ability, which is flawlessly implemented. If you like a good old-fashioned FPS with loads of atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating combat you can’t go far wrong with this classic.4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												First of all, I'd like to state that I played and finished the whole series 3-4 times, acquiring it from ""different"" sources.Anyway, while reviewing this game, one simply can't jump right at it without mentioning a little bit about Monolith.These guys made something like ""Blood"", and made it perfect! These guys know how to make a damn horror game for sure.This is not one of those, -you don't have a weapon, run like crazy when in danger- games that unfortunately exist recently.You do have a weapon in this game, however; it's not a sole shooter game, nor something that jumpscares you every second.In my humble opinion, everything is really super balanced in its own way.It did not bore me by making me shoot guys for a long time or leave me thrilled for a long time.Moreover, this game has one of the best artificial intelligences.I do not want to mention more about it, so you can be surprised in the game.And, I will not mention about the story, now that everyone's aware of it.Lastly, I think that you should play its expansion packs too.In this series, except the 3rd game ----> 2nd game, 1st game and its expansion packs were made by precious Monolith.EPs are as good as the game itself by the way.I strongly recommend this.

FEAR is one of my favorite single player action horror games, with a strong focus on intense and challenging combat, atmospheric and unsettling horror elements, as well as the realization that what you're trying to eliminate isn't all that evil. Base game being 4 hours, the 2 expansions coming with the game add another 8 hours of gameplay, one starting right where the main game left off, and the second being its own story alongside the main journey of the Point Man.

												Many people believe F.E.A.R. (subsequently just called FEAR) is a horror game, which is not quite right. The term which I find most appropriate to describe FEAR would be ""a military themed sci-fi/horror FPS"".FEAR and its two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, stand at the pinnacle of the FPS genre. Admittedly, FEAR lacks some variety in environment and enemy design. You'll spend most of your time shooting at enemy soldiers in offices and warehouses. But what FEAR is weak at is easily overshadowed by what it is good at, because everything else about this game is just so good.The game takes a serious and realistic approach with a tight atmosphere, and is consistent with it. At one time, it handles like a military shooter where you fight against enemy squads, and at other times you'll be stuck in nightmarishly visions or surrounded by supernatural beings, which is done so well that it never really feels out of place.All the weapons sound and feel amazing. From the dual pistols, which are a lot stronger than they look, to the futuristic Particle Weapon and Repeating Cannon, there's not a single weapon that is boring or not fun to use. The shotgun is one of the best in history of computer games.The enemies aren't that rich in variety, but make up for it with their behaviour. For a major part of the game, you'll battle the Replica Soldiers. Even now, 11 years after release, FEAR is heralded as the game with the best artifical intelligence thanks to these guys. They can crouch through tight spots, jump through windows and move furniture to use as cover, not as part of scripted events, but as their natural behaviour. Replay one particular fight, and it will never turn out the same way. These guys are just so much fun to fight. What's more is that you can really see and feel how your attacks affect them. Shooting a soldier will make him stumble and throw off his aim, while nearby explosions will throw enemies off their feet and may knock them down. Replica Soldiers' behaviour, actions and reactions make them incredibly satisfying to fight.The level design doesn't offer many varied environments either. Yet it's incredibly well done with love to the detail. You will almost always have multiple ways to reach certain places. You can run along a corridor and take enemies head on, or crouch through the vent and ambush them from behind. Despite spending a lot of time in offices and warehouses, you'll still visit some amazing and incredibly atmospheric places, especially in the expansions. A futuristic cloning facility here, a creepy hospital there, these places are memorable and well crafted.When you're not fighting enemy squads, you're usually in the horror part of the level. Sometimes you'll experience this through some kind of dreams or visions sent to you by Alma, who acts as the main antagonistic force in this game. Other times you have to fend off otherworldly beings that appear through portals. FEAR offers frequent jumpscares as well as drawn out segments with tight and creepy atmosphere.Both expansions are outstanding. Extraction Point is essentially more of the same, while Perseus Mandate cuts back somewhat on the horror parts while giving you more heated firefights in return.FEAR and its two expansions represent some of the best the FPS genre has to offer, and easily make it into the top 5 best singleplayer FPS ever made. It is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre.			",71,3,0,7,1,0,2

												F.E.A.R. was the first horror game I ever played all the way through. I recently revisited it since I picked them all up on steam. And I got to say it holds up. Unlike most modern horrors, that show you horrific creatures mauling people or torturing them, F.E.A.R. takes a different approach. At times you almost forget that you are playing a horror game. You spend a lot of your time in office buildings and research labs encountering soldiers trying to kill you. It feels like a standard FPS game. But they sprinkle horror elements into the game throughout. Whether it is from the unerving quiet of the offices, or from glimpses of people who vanish or rooms full of blood, you are quickly reminded that something is not right. The FPS gameplay is solid for a game of its time. It feels reminiscant of Half Life. I recommend playing this game on the higher difficulties. This not only increases the horror of the game due to tension of ammo and health supply but also makes the game more of a challenge. F.E.A.R. has a slow motion ability that you can use for a short amount of time, and it recharges over time. On easier difficulties, this makes the game a breeze. On harder difficulties, I found myself saving it for when I truly needed it. I recommend checking out pcgamingwiki.com for some tweaks to all the games. I had to increas the FOV for it. It looks a tab weird at first, but nothing that takes away from the game.The F.E.A.R. series will always be in my short list of horrors I recommend.

REVIEW: F.E.A.R: FIRST ENCOUNTER ASSAULT RECONAlthough Resident Evil 4 broke new ground in merging horror with action, it was by no means the only offering in 2005 that mixed horror with action. F.E.A.R, a first person shooter, was by no means the first game to mix horror with action, but it was released to considerable hype and acclaim. When I play games like this, it is for the atmosphere and story, but would I get it?Armacham Corporation, the creators of a small army of psychically controlled soldiers. The intended commander, the unhinged Paxton Fettel, has gone rogue. The First Encounter Assault Recon team, a special forces group that deals with the paranormal, is sent in to kill Fettel and end his control over the soldiers. But as the new Point Man of F.E.A.R delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll soon uncover the sins of the past that Armacham are trying to cover up. Sins that link Fettel, the Point Man, and a mysterious girl called Alma Wade…I like games with a good story, and the one in F.E.A.R is enjoyable. It’s not quite as involving or as in-depth as, say, Alan Wake, and a lot of the background and story elements are easily missed, being in overt but optional phone messages and laptops you can find out more from. A few of the characters, particular Mapes and Alice, are somewhat irritating and, in the case of the latter, hard to get much sympathy for that is badly needed. But it’s still good for what it is, and genuinely unsettling.The graphics probably were top of the line back when this was released, and while there are some minor problems here and there, it’s quite good. The character models for many of the NPCs don’t look as good as many latest ones, but the graphics overall contribute well to the atmosphere, and it’s clear that this is where much of the massive 17 Gigabyte download went.Sound-wise, well, it’s fine enough. The normal music isn’t particularly noteworthy, doing the job that it does. So too does the voice acting, though that is somewhat better. However, the eerie sound effects, and the stings that they have, do help add to the atmosphere of the game immensely.Perhaps my biggest complaint is about the gameplay. It’s a very short game, which I finished in 7 hours, and a lot of the FPS action is repetitive and tedious. The restriction to 3 weapons, particularly in situations where you need more than one heavy weapon, is a pain in the posterior, and there’s a distinct lack of variety in enemies. The slo-mo mechanic does help with the gameplay, but it also feels like it is barely beyond a gimmick. A few of the weapons are fun, if you have a sadistic streak. There’s a stake-firing gun that allows you to pin enemies to walls like butterflies in a collection, and there’s a death-ray that makes me feel like a Dalek. But ultimately, I was left wanting more, and not from the expansion packs.Overall, F.E.A.R was enjoyable enough. I may one day peruse the immediate sequel (rather than the expansion packs), but for now, I’m done with this game.RATING: ***½  ",117,22,0,30,7,2,3

If you want to replay the missions, save at the beginning of every level, you'll thank me later.conclusionIt's a really good first person action game and I could also go on to the music and physics in the game to make more positive remarks but know this. If taking down a team of soldiers with the skill and accuracy of a hopped up cs:go player on adrenaline shots is appealing then go play this. It's cheap, it even has two expansion packs and a lot of hours of content to play and I cannot recommend it enough. If fighting is not your thing and you want a good story or tackle a situation differently, go play deus ex or the old thief series.  If nothing I said is appealing then go outside because you are clearly someone's who takes to much advice from fox news.			",146,44,0,9,5,0,5

												This game... Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ My friend kept talking about how awesome this game was and he even went to get me this and FEAR 2. FEAR is one of my favorite single player action horror games, with a strong focus on intense and challenging combat, atmospheric and unsettling horror elements, as well as the realization that what you're trying to eliminate isn't all that evil. Base game being 4 hours, the 2 expansions coming with the game add another 8 hours of gameplay, one starting right where the main game left off, and the second being its own story alongside the main journey of the Point Man. Get this game. Now.			",123,7,0,2,2,0,6

												F.E.A.R. provides an unforgettable experience through its seemless, if not perfect, blend of psychological horror, intense action, and difficulty. I played F.E.A.R 3 (or F.3.A.R. because edgy) on the 360 a few years back, and I can honestly say that F.E.A.R. provided a far more satisfying horror/action experience than Call of F.3.A.R: Gore & Jumpscares. I give it a 9.8/10, because Norton Mapes is an ***hole			",50,1,0,9,0,0,1

												F.E.A.R is a FPS horror games with unique elements that you could use to your disposal, although F.E.A.R isn't the scariest installment in the franchise, it is the center of attention for action. A,I characters aren't great, including the enemies.I won't give away the story and the characters just for your entertainment, ENJOY!!!!			",66,2,0,6,6,1,2

												With the in mind factor this is from 2005 and its the whole getting the hang of physics engines thing (still kinda dont), this is a gem of a game, i guess if your into horror stuff this is cool for you. I found the broken if not baffling ragdoll physics humorous and kept every weapon feeling fresh and readily usuable (i still used the 10mm HV Penetrator 9/10 times for any given moment). Maybe im just a cold human being or mildly psychotic even but nothing in the main game honestly bothered me much, there was one or two jump scarish things that i guess got me but it was mostly just the Metroid Prime room to room feeling that put you any form of edge. Hell i found myself laughing at the game than being scared simply due to the physics and the the ability to pin ""Test Tube ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" to walls. So far havent quite finished Extraction yet (adendum) but so far Extraction has some honestly scary♥♥♥♥♥♥comparably, made me question progression or even how to move on. So all in all fun game easy to enjoy, physics, isnt really scary till dlc ...ect id reccomend it to people that arent into horror as well as those who are. Adendum: Finished Exrtaction Point, its a 6 hour worthwhile follow up open ended wrap up to FEAR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game written in 2005, FEAR holds up remarkably well.  Playing at 1080p with all the options maxed, it really does not feel that old.  There is a noticeable squareness to the environments but this feels more like deliberate art direction than a limitation of 8 year old technology.  There is a beautiful simplicity to the gameplay too - compared to a modern game such as Far Cry 3, this is a tightly-focused stripped-down elegant shooter where the only thing that matters is blowing bad guys away.  While the environments are fairly linear, this fits well with the horror theme.  Like the classic bad dream, your only option is to walk through the door at the end of the corridor even though you know you aren't going to like what you find there.  The story is so-so but largely superfluous. The environment builds tension on it's own.  The horror is less the visceral in-your-face variety of, say, Bioshock, more the subtle psychological horror of Silent Hill. Instead of chainsaw-wielding maniacs leaping out of cupboards at you, there are flickering lights, unexplained footsteps and phantom photocopiers.  After a long session with FEAR I really had to concentrate to relax the knots that had formed in my shoulders.  This game is an absolute classic. Buy it!			",155,25,5,25,19,1,25

												I have played through and beaten this game several times on PC and its console ports in the past years and I still haven't found a more visceral and kinetic first person shooter action like F.E.A.R all these years. This game mixes horror, action and suspense in such a masterful way that deserves to be praised again and again. It doesn't hurt that the game has wonderful sound and design and amazing technical graphics and animation. The enemy A.I displayed here is seldom matched by any other video game so even though you can slow time down, your enemies aren't fools. They WILL try to flank and surprise you and the multi-path maps are designed to take advantage of this situation. So either you can surprise them, or they will definitely surprise you.All in all, still an excellent, highly replayable single player game and a very entertaining yet standard multiplayer mode. If you demand heart-stopping action, this game deserves to be in your library.			",492,214,5,51,25,2,32

												*FINAL REVIEW*Contrary to it's namesake, I find F.E.A.R. to be far from scary in the slightest. To me, any horror game worth it's title does not have a shotgun and instead leaves the player feeling helpless and hunted.Not to say that F.E.A.R. isn't good, the game has an addicting combat system, very dynamic gore and a wide range of enemies to keep the pace flowing. The game's combat system is simple in theory, you are given three weapon slots which you can fill with any weapons you come across during the game, allowing the player to mix and match any combination of shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers, even spike launchers and particle rifles. The player also has access to a skill called ""reflexes"" which allows the player to effectively slow down time to either initiate an assault on a fortified position, allow an escape from a dangerous situation or to simply take in the hilarious ragdolls from a dated engine. Exploration of the maps gives the player opportunities to find boosters to increase their max health and the size of their reflex bar, making them a greater threat to their enemies. F.E.A.R.'s gore system, given the game's age, is very impressive and hardly any games I've seen recently come close to comparing to it. From simply dismembering enemies by shooting off limbs/heads to reducing them to red mist or a charred skeleton to even sawing them clean in half with a mothertrucking shotgun. Not many games I've seen can allow you to turn your enemies into a red puddle by blasting them point-blank with a buckshot. SMOD is the only other game I can think of, and it's only a mod for Half-Life 2. Enemies in the game start off as the tried and true generic gas-mask soldier, the likes of which have been seen in other games like Half-Life 2 and Mass Effect 3. As the player progresses new enemies are added to the mix, forcing the player to adapt their strategies and keep the experience fresh. You might be doing an amazing push when suddenly a heavily armored tank soldier wielding a rocket launcher comes at you, forcing you to fall back and lay the path with grenades. Or a group of invisible ninja-esque soldiers can appear forcing you to go on the defensive. The game's story I must admit leaves a bit to be admired, the characters feel two-dimensional and are difficult to care about, and the player will often find themselves annoyed by the slow-paced Alma scare scenes meant to advance the story. But if you have the capacity to pay attention to the story then at the end of the credits you'll be rewarded with a twist and a cliffhanger for the sequel.F.E.A.R. also suffers from some irritating bugs caused by all the recent updates to Steam's UI. By simply holding down the W key, Steam takes a screenshot every 2.5 seconds, resulting in a flooded screenshots folder than needs to be cleared out regularilty. It's like playing Pokemon Snap on the N64 with the A button taped down. In conclusion, despite it's software compatability hiccups and it's forgettable storyline, F.E.A.R.'s gameplay is unique and highly enjoyable. If you have the capacity to work around the screenshot bug then I definately recommend this game.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												I must have played this game fifteen times now and I still enjoy it every time I play it. The combat is tight, the sound is top notch, the guns feel powerful and are fun to use, and the AI gives you a nice challenge. This review is for single player only, because gamespy no longer exists, and you cannot play the multiplayer section of the game anymore.I'm going to split this up into a few distinct sections because there is a lot to talk about in this game.The game came out right when first person shooters were getting popular again, and it shows heavily in the design. There are obvious influences of Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and Halo/Halo 2 across the board, but it manages to combine some of the better aspects of each of these games together into a cohesive product. You have limited weapon slots and health kits, but it takes the route of giving you slow motion and allowing you to store the health kits to modernize the gameplay aspects.The graphics style and technology has aged fairly well, and has a distinct ""Doom 3"" look to it with sharp shadows, dark environments and fairly rough polygonal models, but still manages to capture what the developers were going for. Texture resolution is fairly good, and there are a lot of fine details that you can pull in if you look around. I really love the bullet decals and the way they utilized parallax mapping to make it look like chunks of the wall are missing. It comes out very natural.The environments are not very varied and it shows that the engine was not well optimized with open areas, leading to the feeling of wandering through endless corridors without much variety. They tried to spice things up by changing locations every so often, but this is one of the bigger complaints you'll find with the game. Most of the events take place inside warehouses, office buildings, and the occasional ""sewer"".The sound in this game is top notch. Weapon sounds are sharp and booming, and compliment the visual look of the weapons perfectly. Enemies and allies are all well voice acted and have a large number of lines they can pick from situationally. The music is well produced and compliments the scenes taking place within the game, leaving you immersed but helping to hype you up for what is going on. The environmental effects fit well, and none of the sounds stand out as feeling off or out of place. Even the spooky scary sounds have their place, and feel well integrated. Monolith has always excelled here and this game is no exception.The weapons are fun to use and feel powerful, both in your hands and in those of the enemies. The shotgun is easily one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in a game in a long time, capable of literally blowing people to a fine mist at close range, and cutting them into chunks at moderate range. The penetrator shoots massive metal spikes that will nail people to walls in the most insane poses. There are also akimbo pistols.Combat is intense and thrilling, and when combined with the startlingly good AI and the slow motion it just comes with you feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ while still being challenging and fun. The developers said they wanted it to feel like the opening scene to Hard Boiled, and they were 100% successful, sparks, dust and debris everywhere. With how reactive and varied the AI can be during a fight you get a decent amount of variety out of the fights.The game has fairly good pacing, and a reasonable difficulty curve with various little spikes of difficulty scattered through to keep things interesting. Monolith knew that combat wasn't interesting if it was all you did, and so added in a bit of exploration and toned back sections to let you recover from the high intensity fighting. The game expects you to begin using your weapons more effectively, and to use the tactics you've learned and the environments to your advantage, so you never feel like things quite settle down.I want to give the AI in this game a special mention, because it is particularly well done. Combining a dynamic squad system, flanking tactics and staggered reload pinning techniques, the AI is surprisingly lifelike. It has a fairly advanced sense system, and the individual enemies have a brain of information they retain and can share using verbal call outs, and will often react to stale information in surprisingly realistic ways. Each enemy can be scared, demoralized and manipulated, leading to unique behaviors. The only problem with this is that combat is typically too short to see a lot of this behavior emerge unless you are at a higher difficulty level. It shows that the developer put a lot of love into the AI.This game is supposed to be scary, or maybe just creepy, and it is usually successful on the first play through. With a clever combination of supernatural powers, disturbing imagery, jump scares and sound hits, you're kept on edge. The sometimes predictable scares lose their impact as the game goes on,, but there is still plenty to love about the game even without this aspect. If you absolutely hate scary games, this is not for you.I strongly suggest that you at least give the game a try if you enjoyed one of the games that helped to shape this game(Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Halo). For the price, it's hard to go wrong. If on sale, it's even harder to go wrong!P.S. The expansion packs for this game will likely leave you wondering where the magic went. They don't have the same polish or enjoyment factor. The review is focused on the main game only.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While a little dated as far as visuals and general technology go, this is still a solid game that launched a franchise. Sadly the multiplayer is dead, but to me this game was more about the designers knowing that just the right amount of creepy and/or gorey visuals can leave a far more lasting and scary impression than an all out gore-fest, not to mention when to deliver them for maximum impact; after the high energy of a gun fight, having something some into view that tosses your expectations out the window was exciting.

												Wow this is a satisfying game. Playing without slomo gives off a demonic creepiness due to the high speed of enemies and weapons. The tension is high because you often don't have much reaction time to turn on slomo before you've been outgunned. The enemies feel truly superhuman. Turn on slomo and the game becomes eye candy as bullets fling bodies and particles about.This game is rather timeless, and mechanically outshines many shooters that have come out since.Also as a complete horror weakling this is about as much as I can handle. Any more horror than this and games become unplayable for me :)			",296,32,8,39,28,2,43

												I first played F.E.A.R. upon it's orginal release way back when, and recently played through it again a second time.  The game has some of the best A.I. ever to be put into a first person shooter.  While most of the game is played inside a high rise office tower, it offers very challenging and exciting combat.

												I hate horror movies. Not because they scare the $%!& out of me, but because they never can, and watching a horror movie without the horror makes it either a great comedy or a great bore to me. The same can be said for some horror games which emulate the usual tropes seen in those $@*# movies. This is not one of those games, and yet it is. F.E.A.R. takes all those classic/overused tropes and elements of both horror and action movies and utilizes them so perfectly that it achieves a constant state of ""unpredictable predictability"", catching you off-guard at the absolute perfect moments while driving you insane when nothing happens while you're on your guard. The pacing, the plot progression, the combat, the scares, the theming, the levels, and the atmosphere (ESPECIALLY THE ATMOSPHERE) are all so excellently designed that it somehow manages to brilliantly encapsulate you in the moment; you'll find yourself acting and reacting like you would in a similar real-life scenario. And at times, when scares and combat sequences play out just right, it genuinely feels like you're playing through the perfect action/horror movie. I could go on and on but I'll end here by saying this: It's one HELL of a joyride from start to finish. The first F.E.A.R. is a diamond in the rough that deserves far more fame than some other games of yore... ",221,43,6,16,15,2,11

												A classic FPS and a must play for any FPS enthusiast. This game is still enjoyable after 10 years, which is not something a lot of games can say. Slo-mo might seem like a gimmick, but believe me you require this on higher difficulty levels. + You have legs+ Physics+ Graphics (for it's time)EDIT:Just finished Extraction Point, basically just a continuation of the main game. 2 new guns, some new levels, some rehashed. Pretty solid 5 hours for an expansion. Something I forgot to mention in the original review. The game runs fine at max settings at 60fps. For some reason, after some time playing, FPS drops to around 54fps. Quiting the game and restarting fixes it. Pretty weird. Happens in both the main game Extraction Point.EDIT:Busy playing Perseus Mandate and figured out that if you switch on ""Force Restart"" in the display settings, it reloads the video memory with ever start of the map, which stops the FPS drops. This take about 1 second and is well worth it.EDIT:Finished Perseus Mandate, solid expansion. Actually pretty long considering it only took about 2 hours more to finish the base game. In conclusion, the base game and the expansions are awesome, one of my favourites and highly recommended.			",212,45,3,13,10,2,39

												F.E.A.R is a brilliant game and work of art. Cant remember a shooter that was more involving, intriguing, viceral or scary than this game. The combat is just spectacular.. AI is good, they take cover, try to outflank, throw grenades and will work together to take you down. You will literally feel the heat of the gun battle.. with contineous fire, the area get's smokey, dusty and the surrounding gets destroyed in an intense fight. The bullet time turns the hectic action into a beautiful battle sequence and Once the dust settles, you are ready to press on...  always wondering whats going to happen next. You know your objectives but their is a variable, a big ♥♥♥♥ing supernatural.. variable that will keep you guessing and  the atmosphere is always tense, and their is a sense of something very sinister in the air.Throughout the game you are haunted by disturbing visions that are geniunely scary and mysterious. But you continue eagerly, you are in persuit of a sinister maniac and you want answers to the visions you see, put all the pieces together.  The sound design is exemplorary and the best I have heard. Brilliant from begining to end. Though the game lacks in variety of enviroments it makes up for it in the mood it sets and  the story it tells. The constant tension will turn into fright when you least expect. Their is no cliches here. Nothing forced, no shock value, gore for the sake of it. The game is molded to scare you pschologically and it succeeds. Though your tough guy with big guns and bullet time, you will tread carefully... like a girl :)   As the the story draws to it's climax, your heart will pound harder and you will press on without a break or blink. Once the final cutscene plays, it is not an ending  to relax upon and will leave you in awe. Expect the experience to stay with you..  even after the credits roll.Rate This: A+ (Terrifying).

												FEAR upon release was lauded for its superb AI, and that still stands up today.  This is one of the most intense and satisfying shooter games I've ever played.  Sure you can fault it for the repetitiveness of its enemies and environments, but the enemies are so intelligent you probably won't notice it so much and the environments needed to be repetitive because horror doesn't really work well if the environment drastically changes every 30 minutes.  Overall it is an amazing piece of work that still manages to outclass most modern shooters in the AI department.			",252,45,7,10,7,1,23

												The origins of FEAR are myred in old action films by John Woo. Mixed with a few sporatic horror bits thrown in. FEAR to it's core is an action game that molds itself to the player's own skills. All the weapons are balanced, even the dual pistols compared to the rail gun. The game forces you into massive firefights using only your super human slow motion powers and guns to defend yourself.Truly, if you like action movies you will perfectly enjoy FEAR. It's AI is complex and dynamic, and is truly a thrill ride from start till finish.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter Horror game.You are the ""Point Man"" a person without any informations about, at least at the beginning.You have a job, to catch a man called Paxton Fettel, a man that has more bounds with you than you might think at the beginning of the game. On your mission you often hear about a girl called Alma. Who is that? You even meet here several times in your paranormal visions. And the game is horror indeed. Often you are in levels where you are hunted by Fettels and Almas paranormal visions. Persons who die in front of you eyes and who die because of having their flesh removed from their bones. Thats totally normal. And that is not even all. You are always hunted by the dark... It can wait behind every corner. But who is Fettel and Alma actually? One thing is clear, you are bound with them but you cant tell how. That is your mission to find out.The game has nice graphics especially for the fact its from 2005. I doubt that there was anything better looking back then, not even Far Cry from 2004 looked that great. If you ask me at least. Nearly everything is demolishable and the physics are great. What I really love is the bullet time that you can start anytime you want, but its limited and needs to recharge sometimes. You also have a flashlight but this one needs to recharge too. Dont waste your flashlight because you will need it. The play with the light and the dark is really amazing in this game.I played the multiplayer once, it was ok and can make some fun.BUT. The official multiplayer is done. There is F.E.A.R. Combat though, the multiplayer of F.E.A.R. that has been published by the community and is still supported. Works without problems. You should try it, its free. Just google for their website.The Steam version also has both released addons for free!Both are NOT considered canon by the official developers Monolith. Its fiction.Means things that happened in them are not covered by FEAR 1, 2, 3.Extraction Point tells the story what happened after the main game ending.Its nice and it still had those Horror shocker. I really liked this addon.Only downside is that for some reason its not supporting widescreen out of the box.Weirdly the main game and Perseus Mandate does... However, you can easily edit a ini to get your desired widescreen resolutions, google it.Perseus Mandate on the other hand wasnt really my taste.You are a whole different character trying to uncover mission perseus.The horror shockers in this addon are nearly non existent if you ask me.Also its mostly about shooting yourself through corridors flooded with replicants.I died very often because it was way too difficult, even on normal compared to the other games.It was frustrating and a little bit boring, especially at the end.Both addons were developed by another developer named Timegate Studios.The maingame will take up to 10 hours to finish.The addons each around 5 hours.The Steam version comes only in English!There are several language packs available as Steam guides and also in the web.I also added a German UNCUT language pack for those who like to play the games in German.Its in the guide section.Also I want to say that F.E.A.R. and its addons suffer from FPS problems on most modern rigs.This is due to the engine having problems with several HID devices like mouse, keyboard, controller.All systems starting with Vista can have this problem. The fix is to disable several HID devices. Google it. This is actually really annoying. There are some more problems. EAX does not work on all modern systems starting with Vista. Some can still enable it with soundcard driver programs. Or use a tool called directsound to activate basic EAX support. I should note that Windows XP fixes actually both issues. Also the game itself is not able to activate soft shadows and anti aliasing at the same time. To do so you have to use Nvidia inspector and a online tutorial to add proper anti aliasing support. Just disable the ingame AA but leave soft shadows on. Works fine then. I dont know if there is a AMD way to do this.Positive:- Bullet time- Good graphics (2005)- Good Story- Big amount of options ingame- Alma is one of the best game characters ever- No health regeneration!- Great play with the dark and shadows- Good and fitting unique soundtrack- Good Enemy AI- Shooting is a lot of funNeutral:- Multiplayer is ok but dead, use community mod to fix it- Not available in the German Steam storeNegative:- High Difficulty- Mostly simple and kinda boring level designs- Technical problems with modern systems- Some questionable key settings, changeableReplayability: MediumI really liked the story of it and the atmosphere, also the bullettime.Alma was one of the creepiest and most interesting characters I have ever met in a videogame.The addon Extraction Point was just as good as the main game. Perseus Mandate wasnt good though.I would give 8.5/10 points for the maingame and the extraction point addon.Perseus Mandate wont get more than 5/10.I also reviewed the other F.E.A.R. games.

												I would say that it's probably a must own for any fans of the fps genre. Graphics look pretty good, AI is great, and the gunplay feels fantastic.That all being done and said, and as much as I love the series, it just isn't really scary to me. It definitely feels more like an action game with a spooky setting rather than an actual horror game.Also comes with the Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point expansions, so that's pretty neat.

												TL;DR: A good tactical shooter, still holds up well today.So as a note, I am not an expert on FPS's, nor the particular history of the FEAR franchise or how it affected other shooters. I am merely writing this review in regard to the game as it stands today, not historically.FEAR (I'm not putting those periods in every time I write it) is ostensibly a tactical shooter with horror elements. Fairly old now, after playing it I feel it still holds up well. It is a fun game to play through, and the visuals hold up well enough, given when it was released. The gameplay itself holds up amazingly well, and it is a very engaging game.The gameplay itself is mostly in the tactical shooter genre, in that you by yourself (No squadmates), confront large squads of fairly intelligent AI enemies. While not a cover based shooter, it is important to use cover to your advantage, as the enemies definitely will, and you can get minced fairly quick just acting as a turret. The enemies themselves will call out to each other, use cover, suppressing fire, and the like in order to try and take you down. How the AI compares to more modern shooters I am not sure, but it felt smart enough that I wasn't gunning them down in droves easily. The environments are varied enough that you are adjusting to each level's style to look for proper cover and where enemies might be hiding. There is a bit where it feels like you are in offices forever, and it starts to drag a bit. Finding your way through the game is pretty much going from A to B, only a few choices in routes that diverge very shortly. There are some items to find and story elements to listen to, but nothing that stops you from plowing on through. Movement has almost no execution challenges, which was a big plus for me as I am currently rather tired of FPS's that try to be platformers.Tool-wise, you are given the pretty standard FPS variety to choose from, rifle, shotgun, pistol/dual pistol, SMG, along with some fancier guns with more limited ammo (Rail gun, particle gun, multi-rocket launcher, assault cannon). You can only hold 3, so I went with my two main stays (The shotgun which took out enemies fairly quickly if aimed right and close enough, not using up too much ammo), the rifle (ran out of ammo quicker than I got it, but good for precise shooting), and a fancy gun depending on the stage. You also get 3 different 'grenade' types, the standard sort that also explode on contact, mines, and remote detonated sticky bombs. I mostly used the first two, as the last required you to put away your gun, and I felt that the set up required wasn't worth the boom. In addition to weapons, other pickups include health (you can hold up to 10 health kits, I was usually maxed or close), armor, and items that permanently increase your maximum health and reflex. The pickups were valuable enough that I was scouring stages for ammo/health/armor/power ups, with the added bonus that it also lets you find the story elements as well, but I never felt I had to scour every inch of the stage.The reflex was probably the selling point for the game along with the smart enemies, as it puts you into a slo-mo mode that allows you to take more careful aim and dodge better. It recharges pretty quickly, so you can use it every other encounter or so if they are coming at you rapid-paced. Mostly it felt it most useful for taking very careful aim (it let you adjust for recoil very well), or for nailing groups with the shotgun more readily. The slowed sound and effects definitely make it feel awesome.The story is one of the horror genre, though it mostly gets that through the hallucinations and pop-up moments from the resident spooky girl. I wasn't too freaked out by it, as you pretty quickly identify which illusions can hurt you (hint, lots of fire, humanoid things rushing you), and the rest just serve to be spooky. The story is decent, there have been far better since it came out to fit into the horror genre, and the fact that if you can't shoot it, it can't hurt you causes things to stop being spooky/scary.The only part that probably doesn't hold up nowadays is the graphics. The textures are flat, shots of the city in the distance are decidedly not cinematic, and faces are really blegh. I'm sure someone who keeps up with the most recent FPS's would scoff, but I found it didn't detract from the experience at all. It doesn't affect gameplay, so I didn't care.Overall, FEAR still holds up as a fun gameplay experience. It is no longer top of the line, but the shooting elements hold up well, and it is good for an evening or two of fun getting through it.			",293,125,2,82,34,3,51

												The game may be old and the graphics not top notch, but I will bet it will make you jump a least once if not more, its a great game and loads of fun, It gets spooky and with music and back ground noise's to keep you on the edge of your seat its just great. For an old game I reckon it still has enough to hold any gamer. There is loads to explore,  and lots to find, from secrets, weapons, ammo, armour and routes to complete each task. enjoy.

												The is an interesting FPS that captures the both sides of action and horror. This is a brillant gem of a game and one of the last true arcade style shooters to hit the gaming industry before almost all have died out before the whole Call of Duty craze. This is also one of the last true PC game exclusives before PC games became just a port of the console version.The graphics are amazing for their time but may show some age to some gamers. If you don't care about graphics, the gameplay is still amazing with it's slow-mo shooting mechanics. Total gameplay time is about 10 to 12 hours, it is a little longer than your standard FPS game which is always a plus.With it's blend of horror and scary moments, along with it's action. This is a winner. At some points of the game, the action does slow down in certain spots, other than that it's a great game and a must play for horror addicts. I give this game a 8.5/10			",1035,339,17,132,84,7,136

												This is a fantastic game. Due to always being very far behind with computer hardware, I missed F.E.A.R. when it was first released in 2005 and only played it through recently. I went in worried that F.E.A.R. would just be a generic FPS with some jump scares thrown in, but came out very pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I thought that the game started off a bit slow, with the first level (probably deliberately) presenting itself pretty much as I described in the previous sentence, but I persevered through the first mission and it's rare that I'm this glad that I did.In terms of gameplay, the game has very solid shooter mechanics which are extremely enjoyable. You never feel severely overpowered (maybe a little if you rely on the slow-mo reflexes ability), but you also never feel like fights are unfair. Enemies are neither damp paper nor bullet sponges so fights never drag on for too long. The main challenge in firefights is just how impressive the AI is; enemies will usually be smart enough to know when and where to take cover, even being able to move some objects to create their own cover, work together effectively by using techniques such as suppressive fire and flanking whenever possible and communicate with each other so effectively (both verbally and through their actions) that they seem like real people - so much so that there were a few points where I nearly felt bad for killing the last one in a group. One particular instance that stuck with me as the moment that sold the AI for me was when I was walking through a series of corridors with my flashlight switched on, heard a squad of replicants nearby and tried to sneak a bit loser to them while forgetting to turn my flashlight off - one of them saw the light from around the corner, yelled ""flashlight!"" and ordered another squad member to check it out, surprising me so much that I fumbled and was forced to drop my plan of getting the drop on them. Some time after that, I ended up developing a tactic of luring an enemy around a corner by flashing my flashlight at the wall and then ambushing them with my shotgun when he came to check it out, thinning out the squad just a little.To combat this, you're given a solid array of weapons - you can hold up to three at once, which is generally a love-it-or-hate-it trope in shooters but used very effectively here. What impressed me most about the weapons is that no single weapon in the game is clearly more powerful than any other; instead, they're balanced extremely well and all very useful for different situations and playstyles (I ended up settling on a favourite set about halfway through the game - shotgun for close range, assault rifle for medium range and particle weapon for sniping - and never changing them because they fit the way I played so well). Each weapon also takes into account the weight, with heavier weapons making you move noticably slower and lighter weapons increasing your speed and making melee combat a very viable tactic - if you can get close enough, it's usually an instant kill. There are also three grenade types (standard frag, proximity mine and remote sticky mine) that are great for flushing out enemies and laying traps; I generally hate using grenades and explosive weapons in shooters because I'm terrible with them, but, in F.E.A.R., I found myself accurately lobbing grenades to flush out entrenched enemies, laying mines to catch out anyone who tried to flank me and sending enemies screaming into their squad with a sticky mine lodged on their back. Generally, F.E.A.R. favours a nearly-cover-shooter tactic - full-on assault against a squad of replicants will usually get you ripped to shreds so you need to plan carefully, look for good cover, watch your back and make good use of the lean keys to drop in and out of cover. Health is not infinite; it doesn't regenerate and the only form of healing is from medkits which you can take with you and use at will and rare health upgrades which permanently increase your health by five points. F.E.A.R. also features a ""reflex"" mechanic, which is basically an ability to temporarily slow down time (I was sceptical of this at first, but it makes sense in the context of the game's story), in which everything - enemies and your own movement speed and fire rate - slow down apart from your own turning speed, allowing you to get an aim on enemies very quickly. There were times when I felt like this made the game a bit too easy, but, because it still slows you down as much as the enemies, activating it while out of cover can still be a very foolish move, and it's always great fun to see your enemies terrified and bewildered at how fast you've suddenly started reacting to them.As for atmosphere, as I said before, I was initially worried that the game would just be loaded with jump scares. I was very wrong; there is a bog-standard jump scare close to the beginning of the first mission, but, right after that, the game gives up pretending that it's your run-of-the-mill, ""edgy"" shooter and unrelentingly toys with you up to the very end of the game. F.E.A.R.'s scare factor relies very heavily on atmosphere - light and dark, loud and quiet. Small, unnerving noises somewhere nearby that make you edgy about turning the next corner, dimly-lit rooms that you know you have to stay in for a minute to catch part of the story but make you constantly nervous enough to be checking the doors, a ghostly figure just catching your eye as it passes by the next room. The game is very aware of when you're expecting something to happen and loves nothing more than to suddenly take that tension away, then throw it right back at you when you've let your guard down. I admittedly haven't played many horror games, but I can happily say that there has been no other game so far that has made me as nervous about my surroundings as F.E.A.R. has. Monolith took heavy cues from classic Japanese horror films, the likes of The Ring and Dark Water, so anyone who has seen films like this knows a bit of what to expect in the story and presentation. The only thing I didn't like about the horror aspects were that any ""hallucinated"" characters invariably withered away into dust after they'd performed their bit, leaving you with absolutely no sense of ambiguity on whether they were really there or not. Nevertheless, even though I'm no horror junkie, the spook sections were such an enjoyable thrill that I often found myself hoping that there would be another soon.One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for me was that, if you want to get the whole story, you have to work for it. Almost the entire story plays out through listening to voice messages on phones and taking information from laptops that a surprising number of people left lying around and, while none are particularly hard to find, it adds a small layer of exploration into the unnerving surroundings, often requiring you to go just a little bit out of your way in an area where you really don't want to do that because you're worried that something is lurking just around that corner, or because the flashing voice message light on that phone is the only source of light in the room. It's always a rewarding experience, both for the little thrill of defying your own logic telling you not to hang around there and for adding another piece to the fascinating puzzle that is the story. I may not be the best person to comment on it - and am rather annoyed at myself - because, some time ago, I decided that I'd probably never end up playing this game and read the story to see what the game was like, and so spoiled some rather big details that I wish I hadn't, but I was still pulled enough into the story and immersed so heavily into the game that I wanted to find out every minute detail I could about what was happening.If you love FPS and/or horror games, not giving yourself the opportunity play this would be an injustice. I could not possibly recommend this enough.			",139,10,0,8,12,0,5

												A classic and must-play for fans of FPS or Horror games. F.E.A.R. provides some solid storytelling and more than a handful of scares. The visuals, though dated, do not detract from the great gunplay and unsettling atmosphere. Get this if you love shooters and have yet to experience F.E.A.R.			",256,44,1,10,15,0,27

												I have never been a huge fan of FPS games, but I remember playing this a number of years ago, and it always stood out as one of the few truly exceptional FPSs. Even years later this game still looks amazing.  The brilliantly designed lighting and shadows make  this game an immersive experience and certainly add to the spooky atmosphere in a way that a few jump scares never could. Finally, the amazing physics engine makes it immensely satisfying to run up behind a hapless guard and turn them into chunks with a shotgun or pin them to a wall with the aptly named ""Penetrator."" This game is worth every penny. P.S. Slow motion flying jump kicks.			",185,29,1,30,7,1,17

												One of the best PC shooters of all time. A great mix of Japanese style horror (mainly drawn from the Ring) and John Woo first person bullet time FEAR will keep you entertained with its tactically superior enemies and horrific atmosphere. Even at that you'll probably spend a few minutes every level messing around with the objects within the game, although much of the game is set in tight corridors and claustrophobic office hallways, the levels are still dense with objects that would interact in ways that you would expect how it would in real life. One of the shining diamonds of the mid-00s anyone with a love of FPS should play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is F.E.A.R.?--F.E.A.R. is a classic first person psycho-horror shooter, with a fluid bullet time mechanic, and a number of phenomenal jump-scares.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R.?--The game is a bit dated now, but it has aged decently. It's not a particularly action packed FPS, though it's far from dry in that department. Where the game really shines, however, is in keeping the player constantly wondering what might happen next. It's packed full of ambient tension, and just enough jump-scares to keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly challenging game, definitely not for the light of heart, but if you're looking for a rush, and can get over the dated engine, F.E.A.R. is definitely for you.----Over-all: 70%A solid game. Worth playing through for sure, especially if you plan on playing the later titles in the series. F.E.A.R. holds its own as a ground-breaking title in the psycho-horror genre.--Mechanics: 3/5The mechanics aren't perfect, but they serve the needs of the game. Mobility is slightly cramped compared to most modern shooters, but the fluidity of the bullet time experience definitely compensates in this regard. Despite the clunkiness, it's not enough of a weakness to distract from the fantastic immersive experience the game provides.--Experience: 5/5The greatest strength in F.E.A.R. is it's ability to pull the player into the game. Despite the dated audio and visuals, the game still manages to immerse the player to a degree I haven't experienced in a long time. The audio mixing, though dated, and overly simple, is fantastically orchestrated. Ambient static, strategically placed, and dissonent instrumentation instill a very desirable sense of paranoia. Headphones are definitely recommended. Some of the dialogue gets a tad redundant and obnoxious, but can definitely be overlooked, given the phenomenal work done in the other departments. The visuals are painful at times, especially during cutscenes, but during the actual gameplay, with the bullet time effects at play, and the visual interruptions that are part of the psycho-horror theme, you almost completely forget all of this. The game is visually dated, for sure, but still manages an incredible depth of immersion, adding tremendously to the experience.--Balance: 3/5The fight blance is pretty poor over-all. Some fights are far too difficult, especially if you've run low on ammunition or health kits due to a string of accidents. That being said, this does add to the tension at times, which is great, as long as it doesn't become frustrating. The AI is good enough. It's simple by today's standards, but it's not dumb enough to be noticably distracting, and that's more than enough in this case.--Longevity: 3/5The game itself is 21 missions long, each ranging between 15 and 45 minutes (though you could probably speed run some of them very quickly). There is no immediate replay value, but if you give yourself a few months or years to forget the specifics of the game, it's likely you'll enjoy a second play-through at that point.----Expansions:--Extraction Point: Extraction point is a decent expansion. I would not recommend it, however, as it distracts from the fantastic finale' F.E.A.R. leaves you at, which, incidentally, is where F.E.A.R. 2 picks up. That being said, it's not bad enough to suggest not playing, if you're really interested in the series, beyond just the experience. There are some great, fights in the expansion, and while the over-all quality is slightly lower than the base game, in my opinion, it still provides a few new twists and plenty of lore to keep you entertained. The finale' of Extraction point does a poor job of explaining itself, and is slightly baffling, but the adventure there is possibly worth it.--Perseus Mandate: Perseus Mandate is over-all, a terrible expansion. It plays more like a poor action FPS game than a psycho-horror, and drags on far longer than I wish I had the patience for. I would only recommend this expansion to players who find themselves fascinated by the lore of F.E.A.R.. It provides a bit of extra insight in this department, which is nice (though distracting from the experience of the series). There are several intersting gun battles, but almost no jump-scares, or tension at all, for that matter. If you're on the fence about this expansion, I'd suggest against it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take the linearity of Half-Life, but create a game that's actually fun and you have FEAR. Actually, this game is more linear than Half-Life, if that's even possible. It's entirely understandable if you grow tired of corridors and start to feel like you're just going down a conveyor belt with enemies ocassionaly popping out of the darkness in front of you. It's telling when even in a vehicle during the game's intro you're going down an incredibly narrow path whereby there's barely any space between the car and the walls. It's as if the developers refused to have any sort of open areas present in even the most sensible of places.But linearity isn't bad. In fact, this game is a strong showcase of how linearity can be used to craft a strong single-player experience. While the corridors may make you feel constricted, at the same time they are conducive to brilliant enemy ai that knows its surroundings and moves accordingly. Linearity also allows a developer to craft an experience that ensures certain events are experienced a particular way and come about in proper order. Linear progression in level design means that you are strapped to a roller coaster and ride through all events in a manner that leaves no doubt in the creator's mind that you got the specific emotional ride he/she was looking to put you through.The game is littered with many events where something 2spooky happens which is only possible through a constricted experience whereby the developer knows you are looking a particular way or going down a particular path. While getting the exact reaction out of you is only possible through linearity, it's a positive that quickly falls back down to neutral due to the negatives that weigh it down. You see, because all the 'scares' are crafted in a linear experience, you can often see them coming. It doesn't help that you get a little 'UNKNOWN SIGNAL' prompt at the top left of the screen whenever the little girl appears somewhere in the map trying to scare you. It aids in letting you know that an event is occuring and you might miss it, but that defeats the purpose of surprising/scaring you.Not that the 'fear factor' in the game is that great anyway. Personally I wasn't frightened by the title, but it does do a fantastic job at crafting some good atmosphere. Remember: you don't actually have to succeed at scaring people to create an atmosphere that is eerie. Theres excellent use of lighting throughout and great pacing between the game's more hectic moments that leaves you wondering if a firefight is afoot or a 'jump scare'. Trying to create an FPS that is also horror-based is a tough balancing act, and this game pulled off that tight rope walk admirably. It's a shame that the plot itself couldn't have more meat to it. It feels a little bare-bones, with the story feeling more like justification for the little girl character and all the creepy shenanigans. It's as if they created the game and characters first, and then realized they needed a plot to tie it together; story came towards the end of development, essentially. But something tells me they had the plot down, and then got down to level creation and just kept on creating more and more until they had to stretch the already thin plot even thinner to last through the constant stream of levels. So I guess it's excusable, if not a shame. After all, gameplay comes first, even if plot is the motivator for me to keep progressing.All said, if you don't mind linearity and a rather simple plot it's a great experience that is held up by its atmosphere and enemy ai that is carefully balanced between eerieness and enjoyable firefights.

												QUICK SUMMARYNice fun game. Not the prettiest to look at, but fun from start to finish. Some of the most amazing AI ever created. Probably worth $5 at most.GRAPHICS 3/5The game is from 2005 and it shows. However I believe they have aged well, especially if you crank up all the feature to the max, since it never really becomes bothersome, although a bit repetitive on it's color plate. Even when it was originally released, graphics where never meant to take the forefront though, so don't expect a big 2005 showcase. They are simply OK.STORY 2/5Again, for the time, mixing horror with military FPS was a bit of an inovation. The story also simply serves the bigger game picture, providing a good excuse to mow down clone soldiers, get a scare or two out of the player, and come up with some weird scenarios. However, you can't help but feel the story never reaches it's full potential, being content with only feeding you bits here and there. Even worse, a good chunk of explanations are left to audio recordings which are barely audible and force you to simply stand and listen when you are all pumped up and want to continue.MUSIC AND SOUND 2/5Not much music to talk about. It's creepy and barely noticible. Never stands out but subtly sets the atmosphere for either creepiness or action. Sounds simply fitts as it should, guns sound the way guns doo and some shrieks here and there can be chilling to the bone (but only the first couple of times). GAMEPLAY 4/5If anything, this is where the game shines the most. The controls are tight and the actual shooting is as satisying as shooting could be. The graphics, sound effects, animation and everything in general come nicely together so every shoot has the appropiate punch behind it. There's some good weapon variety and destructible stuff littered around to make firefights more flashy. AI is one of the best I've ever seen for a game though, and was years beyonf it's time. Enemies coordinate, use actual attack tactics and react as a human player would. So good is the AI that even at the lowest difficulty level, where enemies are weaker, have poor aiming and you can apparently take more damage, you can STILL be surprised by the AI and die.REPLAYABILITY 1/5Not much to do once you beat it except trying to do it again at a higher difficulty level. I'm not much for multiplayer so once I finished it I didn't touch it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh now here's a good game! F.E.A.R at first glance looks fairly standard shooter fair and for the most part it is. However it's a well made standard shooter with the shooting feeling pretty solid. Also the slow-motion reflex ability greatly enhances the fun of the game, however some people may find issue with it as there's an over reliance on this mechanic. Only a handful of times did I engage enemies without the slo-motion ability and that was due to not being able to wait for it to recharge.  The AI stands out as being rather intelligible compared to other shooters as they try to flank you, flush you out and navigate cover fairly well. Whilst the horror elements are fairly nice and creepy, they don't really elevate beyond that and never really become scary. Also the level design is bland and uninspired with the majority of the game being set in either a warehouse or an office area. But overcome it's shortcomings and you can enjoy it as a solid and fun first person shooter.			",243,42,1,11,4,1,8

												I rate the game F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon): 4/5. Good.This is a an extremely creepy game that stays fairly creepy throughout. True, this game is full of jump-scares but they are all well done. The jump-scares are not usually the loud, annoying kind but the kind which give you quiet glimpses into a seemingly other world (or rather, mind). If you take the time to look at everything carefully and listen to every answering machine message you can find the game's mysterious plot gets explained quite thoroughly as well. The controls are good, the sound is adequate and the lighting and graphics, while fairly simple and minimalistic by today's standards, are clean. The enemy types do not have a great deal of variety (though there is some and this game features the most potentially realistic looking power-armor design I have ever seen in any game).This game is short and the plot is highly linear (which limits its replayability severely) but the story that is told is fascinating and thought-provoking while the gameplay is tense and creepy throughout. The enemy AI is frighteningly clever (far superior to Half Life 2's soldier AI) with soldiers who will flank, ambush, flush you out with grenades and often refuse to get tricked into being piled up in bottle-necked doorways. 80% of this game takes place in-doors (mostly in after-hours night time office spaces (which I think is a cool idea and is a setting I haven't seen since the early part of Half Life 1) so as a result the enemy AI (and the graphics and lighting) doesn't have to deal with as much complexity as it might have otherwise. Much of this game reminded me of the first Die Hard movie in terms of action (due to the night-time, largely abandoned office building environment) but in all the best ways. In many ways this game's style is like an even cross between the action and environment of Die Hard I and the creeping horror of The Ring (if you can imagine it). This made for a great combination. The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but is suitably shocking and horrific (in the extreme) while still paying homage to The Ring (which is where the game has clearly borrowed most of its horror style). The music is strange but well suited to the game but I found only 3 songs I really liked (the main opening theme and two action themes they were).			",172,24,2,6,7,0,17

												If you can get past the old textures (see below if you don't), F.E.A.R is still a good horror-FPS that holds well to modern standards while keeping a lot of the ""older"" FPS elements like rewards from level exploration. How's the gameplay ?The weapons, while beign quite standard, have a good feel to them and are pretty much balanced depending on the situations. This, coupled with the slow-mo makes gunfight quite tense and enjoyable.How are ennemies ? There are very few bulletspongy ennemies and the AI manages things quite well. Its able to flank you, use grenades to push you out of cover and aims decently. There are enought scripted ambushes and other unsuspected situations able to push you out of comfort zone and keeping you away from borederom. How's the level design ?The level design is quite linear and dosen't offer a lot of different approaches and somewhat lacks variety, but its not bad and serves well the claustrophobic atmosphere of the game, there are some hidden powerups that'll be grealtly helpfull, forcing you to explore a bit.Is there stealth in it ?From what I've tried, ""stealth"" works in this game, ennemies can spot you by sound but also because of your flashlight, walking and crouching to reduce your noise can allow you to surprise ennemies or seldomly knock them down without beign noticed. What about the story and the athmosphere ?Its quite a decent story for an FPS I guess, it builds up slowly and gives you clues as you progress and the final is quite memorable. The horror aspect is very efficient for a first run, less on a second but sucessfully goes beyond beign just a jumpscare fest. There are whole levels made up to build up the tension and the line between reality and illusion isn't always explicit.What are the known issues and possible improvements on modern systems ?- If you have a logitech keyboard like a G110, you might come accross a hudge frame drop. There's a workaround on the steam forum about it, there's also an utility online for this fix, but I'd suggest you do things manualy, safer and probably more effective.- If you find the textures too ugly, know that someone is working on remplacing them with HD textures here : http://www.moddb.com/mods/fear-texture-overhaul ",318,56,0,50,27,1,66

												One of the best PC shooters of all time. A great mix of Japanese style horror (mainly drawn from the Ring) and John Woo first person bullet time FEAR will keep you entertained with its tactically superior enemies and horrific atmosphere. Even at that you'll probably spend a few minutes every level messing around with the objects within the game, although much of the game is set in tight corridors and claustrophobic office hallways, the levels are still dense with objects that would interact in ways that you would expect how it would in real life. One of the shining diamonds of the mid-00s anyone with a love of FPS should play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												85% - A Classic That Has Aged Well!The game tells the story of an anonymous operative known as Point Man, who is part of a team, called First Encounter Assault Recon, sent in to investigate the goings on at a site in the Auburn district, with reports of gunfire in the area. It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.This isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.There are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.The only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it.

												F.E.A.R. succeeds as a great FPS with moments of horror.  The action is great, varied, and the ability to slow time for a little bit adds to the cinematic action as you seamlessly cut through the baddies.  The only problem I really have is that at the beginning, med-packs aren't very plentiful so you feel anxious about what is around the next corner, but a few hours into the game, med-packs are pouring out of everything.  There are usually too many med-packs than you can carry, so that kind of takes away from the anxiety.  But, overall, this is a great horror/FPS that should be on the list of buys for fans of both genres.			",100,19,0,10,10,0,9

The gameplay is all time Best. The sound is ♥♥♥♥ing sp00py and as stupid as it sounds in F.E.A.R I've jumped at my shadows a few times thinking it was that lil Girl. The guns ar balanced and go with power to ammo, Such as if you want an amazing gun ammo is scarce and it has it's doubts ,but if you want a balanced gun ammo is balanced to the power! Im scared of little girls now, I was having fun saying this game isn't scary pfft, I was wrong went in the Sewer to get Health Upgrade turn around and she's there checking me out. Shot her, quit game and thought bout how scury this games is...My review doesn't make since and if you've read this far great! I would rate this game in graphics 8/10, Gameplay 10/10, bugs there aren't any in the game unless it's your software, and sp00ky is 10/10 super sp00py!			",39,5,0,3,7,0,1

												FEAR is a first person shooter with light horror elements. The story evolves around a member of First Encounter Assault Recon (which has to be one of the most forced acronyms on video game history) who is pursuing a guy called Paxton Fettel who is being a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and commanding cloned super soldiers to kill people through telepathic abilities. FEAR really plays like 'Hollywood Shootout: The Game'. Everything that is shot seems to break, or take a ridiculous amount of damage, and the player has the ability to use slow motion. This really feels awesome, and makes every shoot out feel badass.Also helping the gunplay is the AI. The AI is willing to flank, retreat, throw grenades, and even just push your position. What most modern game AI can't seem to do on hard, these guys can breeze through on normal difficulty. This game is at least challenging which is a great change from most games of today. You also tend to only take on squads of 3-4 at a time, and this really works. The combat is challenging without relying on having a bunch of dudes bum-rush you. Weapons all feel good. You've got the standard assault rifle, SMG and pistol. The shotgun is gutsy as hell and will tear things up. You also get the penetrator, which is like a slow, powerful assault rifle, a burst firing scoped rifle, a particle rifle which can strip the flesh from most enemies in one hit (basically acting as a sniper rifle), an automatic cannon, and a burst firing rocket launcher. Some of these later weapons don't have a lot of ammo around, which is a shame as they are fun as hell to use.My biggest gripe about this game is the horror. It's honestly not scary, it's just annoying. A little girl staring at you is only a little spooky to begin with. Eventually I found myself just wanting to skip the flashbacks and wanting to kill guys again. The game is also quite repetitive with it's environments, but the firefights are so good that I honestly wasn't too bothered by it. The base game is easily worth $10. I'd give it an 8/10.

												One of my all time faves together with Bfbc2. Fast paced, good maps with chokepoints, requires more mouse related skill than other shooters due to the locking time on target (if you play good players), intelligent use of medpacks and armor.You all can still enjoy the multiplayer mode contrary to what steam tells you, the masterserver powered by gamespy got shutdown a while ago, but the game lives on thanks to efforts of community members, although basically dead it's still awesome for the ones like me that refuse to accept the games faith and need the casual flashback to post 2007 :) but there's still 2-4 servers that refuse to die and will probably be around in 10 years..So if you just want the story..buy this here, if you want the multiplayer only, go to: http://fear-community.org/ and register, you will get a free key and a download for free ofc. Props to Fred and Phreeze keeping the game up and running, and also a big thanks to the mappers that continue to create content for the game, you guys rule! Fear Combat forever <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not necessarily going to give this game a glowing review.  It hasn't exactly aged well and there are a ton of bugs throughout the title ranging from the way enemies' heads extend GMod style when getting hit by a headshot to the weird way landmines occasionally deny the laws of physics and fly skywards crying 'my people need me' in the middle of a combat zone.  But, overall, this was a fairly fun shooter.The game is advertised as a horror shooter.  Whether it's because I'm desensitized to the point where my soul is layered in titanium or not is up for question, but I've only had a couple of times where I've been uncomfortable or 'scared' of characters or environments.  There is quite a bit of near-future scifi going on though, so I'm willing to forgive it for that (especially the weapons).  However if there's one thing I will take away from this and honestly say that I will miss from this game it's the slowdown mechanic.  Making enemies suddenly talk in deep, slow baritones and watching bullets fly matrix-style towards my face has honestly been fun, however I do feel like that I will have a hard time walking away from this game without expecting similar mechanics in other shooters only to fall flat on my face.  I sincerely hope that this is a mechanic that's kept in the sequels.Story was intriguing; it wasn't perfect, the ending wasn't as heartbreaking as it could have been, but it was fun overall.

												FEAR is scaryiessness.  You always has to do slow motion, otherwise you get shot in the face.  Then there's the scary jumper things, which made me poop my pants.  Two of the characters you meet are really scary too.  One is a girl like the one from The Ring, and she likes to make you die.  The other is a fat guy.			",35,7,0,2,1,0,8

												One of the last Old-Style type FPS games before Call of Duty 4 transformed the genre. A neat sci-fi horror narrative that occasionaly scares, graphics that have aged quite well, and a physics and AI engine that is still superb. FEAR is still a game worth playing. Great gunplay and fun guns.			",369,98,3,78,28,5,65

												This game is awesome. The music, lighting, and ambient noises all perfectly combine with subtle glances of shadowy figures to leave you permenantly on edge. The atmosphere is really unnerving. The gameplay is great, and the A.I. is pretty darn good considering the games age. Seriously, at writing, this game is 10 years old. Anyone who knocks the graphics needs a reality check, because despite being 10 years old they are still decent, and the shadowing gives many modern games a run for their money.			",37,4,0,4,1,0,3

												An entertaining game, FEAR was well built for it's time.  Excellent graphics, a rather advanced and aggressive AI, an interesting antagonist, and enough challenges and surprises to keep you on your toes.  The horror element of the game isn't that strong, it's more like a horror theme than intense horror.  The gore may be a bit intense, but the scariest moments came when some marine managed to sneak up behind you, rather than the spooky or supernatural events occuring around you.  As someone not particularly fond of horror, this was a nice balance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still a fantastic, cinematic FPS from the good ol' days when there were teams of Quality Assurance and companies weren't realeasing any peice of dog turd and then lazily patching it, if/when they felt like it.Sure the texture resolution is low and can look funny at times but the models and special effects are beautiful.The multiple ways you can attack your enemies makes you feel like you're in control even when the levels are quite linear (ALA Metro series)A decade old and games these days can still take notes from it's lighting system.A classic, 4 out of 5*.

												Very scary, and although the level design does become a tad tedious (and trite...office blocks...), it is a technically impressive game which I recommend to every PC gamer. The pacing is excellent and it is chock full of scare tactics, along with some genuinely enjoyable gameplay, thanks to the Max Payne-esque bullet-time, and the weapon variety. Although unfortunately the download is humongous (16 FREAKING GIGABYTES FOR A GAME FROM 2005!!!), and the enemy variety is a bit...not varied...that should not be enough to deter you from this excellent horror first-person shooter from the folks at Monolith.

												 F.E.A.R. is an amazing series, and it all started here. First Encounter Assault Recon is one of the most original FPS games ever made, and ranks right up there with Timesplitters and Half-Life on my list of best FPS games. The action is intense, the gore is satisfying, the story is superb.This game managed to put in enough action that you can forget it's a horror game, and that's why it's scary, you are apt to let your guard down and that is when the scares really get you.The game is fun and, rarely for a FPS, actually has replay value. I would recommend it to anybody. A true classic.The only downside is that the multiplayer is no longer active, which disappoints me to no end. 9.5/10			",209,44,3,22,26,1,13

												Shockingly fantastic. I installed it just looking for sort of a janky aging shooter to mindlessly walk through but from the very first level F.E.A.R. blew my mind.I think this game single handedly caused my mind to divide the term FPS from Modern Military Shooter. I don’t know that I have the insight, experience or the articulation to explain it, but these older games really are different than modern shooters. And in my opinion, it was for the better. One of the very first things I noticed was how spectacular the texture work was in FEAR; some of the objects even trumped objects I’ve seen in recent AAA releases. The lighting also must have been something to behold when it first released. All the light sources in FEAR are dynamic and interact with the environment and with your character, casting shadows which enemy AI are amazingly aware of. The first time I heard a guy say “Hey! I think I saw a shadow over there!” while I was walking past a lamp in the next room, my mind literally shut down in disbelief. I actually have to play FEAR the way that I pretend I have to play MMS games and it is everything I’ve been looking for in a FPS game.I’ve always told people I don’t like shooters. What I’ve actually meant is that I don’t like modern military shooters. FEAR has shown me that I really do love FPS, it’s just that no one does it right nowadays.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												One of my all time faves together with Bfbc2. Fast paced, good maps with chokepoints, requires more mouse related skill than other shooters due to the locking time on target (if you play good players), intelligent use of medpacks and armor.You all can still enjoy the multiplayer mode contrary to what steam tells you, the masterserver powered by gamespy got shutdown a while ago, but the game lives on thanks to efforts of community members, although basically dead it's still awesome for the ones like me that refuse to accept the games faith and need the casual flashback to post 2007 :) but there's still 2-4 servers that refuse to die and will probably be around in 10 years..So if you just want the story..buy this here, if you want the multiplayer only, go to: http://fear-community.org/ and register, you will get a free key and a download for free ofc. Props to Fred and Phreeze keeping the game up and running, and also a big thanks to the mappers that continue to create content for the game, you guys rule! Fear Combat forever <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What game mixes Japanese horror films (like the Grudge), The Matrix's slowmotion reflex, and John Woo's best Hong Kong film, Hard Boiled? This game. I played the retail version back in March 2008 and it is really enjoyable with a great balance of suspense/horror and the stylized firefights. As I had done with World in Conflict, the Steam version of F.E.A.R is another great collection to the Steam library. The storyline in the game is rather mediocre, but who cares. Solid gameplay hours of 12-15 hours with highlighted horror and ""John Woo"" killing signatures shine out the most to any gamer. In most honesty, this game (aka the first F.E.A.R) is actually the best out of the trilogy. This is a must buy to anybody who never brought it before. You better buy this game or Chow Yun Fat will shoot you down.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												FEAR is a fantastic horror FPS from Monolith, makers of some of the greatest FPS games ever, including the awesome AvP 2, and No One Lives Forever 1 & 2.  The sequels aren't quite as good, but the original is great.  The combat is unsurpassed.  The enemy A.I. is really good.  The weapons are great.  The story is also pretty good.  FEAR was also one of the first modern games to start the trend of the audio and text logs from long-dead NPCs to expand the narrative and set the stage for the action.			",205,9,1,16,10,0,23

												I rate the game F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon): 4/5. Good.This is a an extremely creepy game that stays fairly creepy throughout. True, this game is full of jump-scares but they are all well done. The jump-scares are not usually the loud, annoying kind but the kind which give you quiet glimpses into a seemingly other world (or rather, mind). If you take the time to look at everything carefully and listen to every answering machine message you can find the game's mysterious plot gets explained quite thoroughly as well. The controls are good, the sound is adequate and the lighting and graphics, while fairly simple and minimalistic by today's standards, are clean. The enemy types do not have a great deal of variety (though there is some and this game features the most potentially realistic looking power-armor design I have ever seen in any game).This game is short and the plot is highly linear (which limits its replayability severely) but the story that is told is fascinating and thought-provoking while the gameplay is tense and creepy throughout. The enemy AI is frighteningly clever (far superior to Half Life 2's soldier AI) with soldiers who will flank, ambush, flush you out with grenades and often refuse to get tricked into being piled up in bottle-necked doorways. 80% of this game takes place in-doors (mostly in after-hours night time office spaces (which I think is a cool idea and is a setting I haven't seen since the early part of Half Life 1) so as a result the enemy AI (and the graphics and lighting) doesn't have to deal with as much complexity as it might have otherwise. Much of this game reminded me of the first Die Hard movie in terms of action (due to the night-time, largely abandoned office building environment) but in all the best ways. In many ways this game's style is like an even cross between the action and environment of Die Hard I and the creeping horror of The Ring (if you can imagine it). This made for a great combination. The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but is suitably shocking and horrific (in the extreme) while still paying homage to The Ring (which is where the game has clearly borrowed most of its horror style). The music is strange but well suited to the game but I found only 3 songs I really liked (the main opening theme and two action themes they were).			",172,24,2,6,7,0,17

												Has to be one of the best first person horror shooters ever made. Before F.E.A.R., there was very little to choose from in the action horror genre. Monolith Timegate really did a great job in putting together a quality game that will give you chills. It reminds me of those horror movies like The Ring and The Grudge. It provides the right complement of shooting action combined with well placed cut scenes. Many of the enemies are quite unique and offer some serious challenge on the higher difficulty settings. The slow motion feature does make the game a little easy, but you can deliberately not use it. The ideal way to experience this game is to create a scare factor atmosphere by playing it at night with the lights turned off. Highly recommended if you've never played it.

												I'll include 2 comments along with this one, each reviewing the different FEAR games.FEAR basic:50% action, 50% horror.  The game mostly deals in shock scares, some you'll miss, some will really scare the pants off of you.  The game has some of the smartest AI I've ever seen, with a game length of, oh, 12 hours or more?  I only completely beat it once, back when I had to install it using 5 seperate discs.The Slo-Mo feature isn't just a gimmick they used for this, it actually is a gameplay feature.  In some firefights it would be suicide to not use it, because the enemies react just as fast as you do, flank, throw grenades, communicate, dodge, and can wipe out large portions of your health in mere seconds.Really a great FPS, one of my all-time favorites.

												8.5/10What a wondeful experience. F.E.A.R. is a FPS shooter with twitch based and somewhat horror based shooting. Still holding up in 2017 even after 12 years on the market, the game allows for sub-linear open levels of play and freedom with shooting gameplay that would rival some of even todays standards. You play the game as a nameless soldier called 'Pointman' whose tasked with an ultimate goal of finding the games antagonist 'Paxten Fettel' and his hundreds of telepathically controlled units that he now controls (he went rogue or something.). Along the way, you will encounter the para-normal child 'Alma' who's pretty much there for no other reason than to scare/creep you out it seems. There's so much more to the story but I'll keep this spoiler free as possible. The story is fine however the way it is presented throughout using phone messages, laptop computers (against, just voice messages) and very few lines of dialoge from any NPC makes it very.. uneven. If I recall, everything except the beginning and end scenes is played from the eyes of the 'Pointman' in a first person view and certain scripted events can be missed if not in the right place/time.Gameplay is fantastic. My first playthrough was on Hard, clocking in at 12 hours with pure keyboard/mouse. The core gameplay relys on shooting, scavenging and very little else other than pushing the action key on buttons or messages. There's a couple other sections like turret control and dreams worlds but there just didn't seem enough variety of objectives. For what there was, oh man. Obviously, the main aspect is combat. Right off the bat you are introduced to Reflex (I think it's called that?) mode which slows down time and gives you an advantage over your enemies while quickly draining and slowly refilling in the background. This is probably the best looking bullet time looking effect I've seen in any video game title. The game focuses heavily on corridor shooting. Very rarely will you be in open areas but it still happens occasionally. One of my gripes with the game is that level design is.. so bland. Recalling my 12 hours after credits I can only seem to remember (truthfully); office buildings, construction sites inside office buildings, a parking garage, abandoned office buildings like places and dream world on fire hallways. And that took me a second to think about. I got the the point of getting lost a few times in the game because I couldn't tell certain rooms from rooms. And there's lot of rooms. The game is open linear structured broken into segments/levels. You'll always be exploring and going forward but get lost or a need to rebacktrack and you can actually go return to the beginning of a level. On the way, healthkits, messages, ammo/weapons and health/reflex boosters must all be found. The game is healthpack based and armor based.Enemy variety was also a disappointment. Without spoiling anything, you will fight; soldiers, turrets, flying robot things, invisible ninja soldiers, ghosts, robots and bigger robots. This sounds like a lot which it is, however 95% of the game is focused of soldier warfare and I do not recall more than 2 types of 'soldier'. The 2nd kind which is only a stronger, recolored and textured 'soldier' is found only on the last 2 chapters. What balances this (somewhat) is the fantastic AI. This is truly one of the best enemy intelligences I have seen is a game period, no exaggeration. You rarely take on less that 3 guys at once. They always work and comunicate as squads. They will flank, take cover and make cover, help/drag other comrades to safety .. just amazing work here. No battle will ever function the same and it's not just like they are aimbots or anything (far from it, just good work), they act so realisticly. Weapons are varied as well. There's a good amount of them if you go by situational standards. Dual pistols, shotgun, smg, assault rifle, battle rifle, rocket launcer and a few others I won't spoil but they are pretty cool and unique thereselves. Each gun looks and sounds amazing and each one has a specific role. Considering the Pointman can only carry 3 weapons of his choice at one time, they must be chosed wisely. Ammo is sort of scare playing on higher difficulties and I had a chance, or rather, actually had to use each weapon individually throughout the game. You also have a few types of explosives and a couple cool looking melee attacks that are easy to perform. Effects are beautiful here. Particle effects run wild with sparks bounding and flying across the environments. Smoke will fill up small corridors (literally), blood sprays and enemies lose limbs (or just explode!) in mists, fire blurs the screen from it's heat and every bit of this looks so much better in Reflex mode. The graphics hold up quite well here. Textures are still reasonable. The lighting effects manage to provide a believable atmosphere and you will be getting used to the dark. It just gets rather old seeing the same bland office buildings over and over and over. Performance wise, the game ran rather smoothly after using the 'Logitech Mouse/Keyboard fix' I found on Google. I played on Max settings, no FXAA and Soft Shadows OFF. I recieved perfect limited 60FPS on a AMD12 6Gig ram and an integrated card Laptop. The requirements are not high at all and any computer newer than 5 years old should be able to run it smoothly.  In all, F.E.A.R. is an amazing title that has survived (so far!) the test of 12 years and holds up rather well. Gameplay wise, Monolith had everything going for this game that just suffers from drab level design and lacking story that tries to be told but best left to Wikipedia after the credits. Still the coolest slow motion of any game and best AI I've yet to find, I paid $9.99US Dollars for F.E.A.R. and both it's expansion I have yet to try. Well worth my money.			",19,0,0,3,0,0,0

												What is F.E.A.R.?--F.E.A.R. is a classic first person psycho-horror shooter, with a fluid bullet time mechanic, and a number of phenomenal jump-scares.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R.?--The game is a bit dated now, but it has aged decently. It's not a particularly action packed FPS, though it's far from dry in that department. Where the game really shines, however, is in keeping the player constantly wondering what might happen next. It's packed full of ambient tension, and just enough jump-scares to keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly challenging game, definitely not for the light of heart, but if you're looking for a rush, and can get over the dated engine, F.E.A.R. is definitely for you.----Over-all: 70%A solid game. Worth playing through for sure, especially if you plan on playing the later titles in the series. F.E.A.R. holds its own as a ground-breaking title in the psycho-horror genre.--Mechanics: 3/5The mechanics aren't perfect, but they serve the needs of the game. Mobility is slightly cramped compared to most modern shooters, but the fluidity of the bullet time experience definitely compensates in this regard. Despite the clunkiness, it's not enough of a weakness to distract from the fantastic immersive experience the game provides.--Experience: 5/5The greatest strength in F.E.A.R. is it's ability to pull the player into the game. Despite the dated audio and visuals, the game still manages to immerse the player to a degree I haven't experienced in a long time. The audio mixing, though dated, and overly simple, is fantastically orchestrated. Ambient static, strategically placed, and dissonent instrumentation instill a very desirable sense of paranoia. Headphones are definitely recommended. Some of the dialogue gets a tad redundant and obnoxious, but can definitely be overlooked, given the phenomenal work done in the other departments. The visuals are painful at times, especially during cutscenes, but during the actual gameplay, with the bullet time effects at play, and the visual interruptions that are part of the psycho-horror theme, you almost completely forget all of this. The game is visually dated, for sure, but still manages an incredible depth of immersion, adding tremendously to the experience.--Balance: 3/5The fight blance is pretty poor over-all. Some fights are far too difficult, especially if you've run low on ammunition or health kits due to a string of accidents. That being said, this does add to the tension at times, which is great, as long as it doesn't become frustrating. The AI is good enough. It's simple by today's standards, but it's not dumb enough to be noticably distracting, and that's more than enough in this case.--Longevity: 3/5The game itself is 21 missions long, each ranging between 15 and 45 minutes (though you could probably speed run some of them very quickly). There is no immediate replay value, but if you give yourself a few months or years to forget the specifics of the game, it's likely you'll enjoy a second play-through at that point.----Expansions:--Extraction Point: Extraction point is a decent expansion. I would not recommend it, however, as it distracts from the fantastic finale' F.E.A.R. leaves you at, which, incidentally, is where F.E.A.R. 2 picks up. That being said, it's not bad enough to suggest not playing, if you're really interested in the series, beyond just the experience. There are some great, fights in the expansion, and while the over-all quality is slightly lower than the base game, in my opinion, it still provides a few new twists and plenty of lore to keep you entertained. The finale' of Extraction point does a poor job of explaining itself, and is slightly baffling, but the adventure there is possibly worth it.--Perseus Mandate: Perseus Mandate is over-all, a terrible expansion. It plays more like a poor action FPS game than a psycho-horror, and drags on far longer than I wish I had the patience for. I would only recommend this expansion to players who find themselves fascinated by the lore of F.E.A.R.. It provides a bit of extra insight in this department, which is nice (though distracting from the experience of the series). There are several intersting gun battles, but almost no jump-scares, or tension at all, for that matter. If you're on the fence about this expansion, I'd suggest against it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												85% - A Classic That Has Aged Well!The game tells the story of an anonymous operative known as Point Man, who is part of a team, called First Encounter Assault Recon, sent in to investigate the goings on at a site in the Auburn district, with reports of gunfire in the area. It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.This isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.There are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.The only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it.

												F.E.A.R. slow-mo'd its way onto my list of top FPS games, competing with Battlefront 2, Halo 2, Far Cry 3, and Republic Commando. F.E.A.R. beautifully manages the thin red line between horror and first person shooting with atmospheric yet intense gunplay. Your opponents, the Replicant soldiers created by Armachan and the Armachan private army both have excellent AI. They behave very intelligently under the circumstances and coordinate well as squads. The storyline engrossed me completely even though it wasn't deep. It was disturbing, dark, and thrilling as you put together the picture. Overall the game feels satisfying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as ambushing an enemy squad then while in slow-motion wipe them all out in less then a second (in game time).Most surprisingly the graphics hold up better than its sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Now nearly 10 years after its original release F.E.A.R.'s graphics are visually interesting and highly functional. The enemy units come in variety and all are fascinating to look at. The sequel's graphics while most advanced are simply dull and remind one of Call of Duty.Ultimately, I recommend this to any member of the gaming community to play. Be wary of the sequels, they are unimpressive but fun at best. They're downright terrible if you want more of the original flavor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They don't call it F.E.A.R. For nothing.(If you're too lazy to read this review, just buy the game).FEAR is a first-person shooter game that swaps between throwing baddies with guns at you, to throwing a scary little girl and some really frightening hallucinations at you. This game made me deathly afraid of ladders for the entire playthrough, from just one hallucination early on.Basically, the story is a little goofy and feels goofier when all the characters take it so seriously, but you are a member of the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" task squad (nevermind that Assault and Recon are two entirely different things) and are assigned with bringing down a man named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic commander to a secret clone army (I said it was goofy) and out of nowhere an evil little girl ghostie-goo is haunting you and killing people. Despite it's goofiness, the story gets better as it goes, and ends up becoming really awesome.The gameplay is broken into segments of exploration and light puzzle solving, to crazy fun combat, and getting the poop scared out of you by the mysterious ghostie girl. The exploration and puzzles aren't really anything new, if you've played Half-Life 2 it's like that, but with none of those dumb see-saw puzzles. The scary moments are, well, scary and well done, however they begin to get a little predictable near the end of the game, but for the first 70% of the game people will disintegrate around you, you'll be teleported to different locations, and the little girl will try to kill you, and you'll be scared. Not horrified, but scared and probably asking, ""What the #@^%$?,"" multiplie times. Where the game truly shines though is in it's combat. The combat is fast paced and brutal, and bullets tear chunks out of walls and objects and spray particles into the air. A simple office shootout becomes mayhem as dust fills the air as shrapnel flies off walls, computers explode in bright flashes of light, and paper flutters around the air as enemies hunt for any sign of you, whether it's your flashlight or a sound you make in game. And these enemies are smart, they have the best AI I've seen in a game. They constantly hunt you down, flanking and calling orders to each other, quickly detecting you if you get to close  to their field of vision, spot your flashlight, call for reinforcements. This makes it feel like you're fighting a true army of highly trained soldiers and makes the combat shine, as each individual fight will play out completely different ways each time you play. You also have a bullet-time feature which you can trigger whenever you'd like, and it turns any combat situation into the lobby scene from The Matrix. Bullets cut through the air, leaving little ripples behind them, dust slowly explodes from damaged walls as you and your enemies shoot and jump kick each other to death in slow-motion. It's incredibly fun, and gives you the killers edge you need against the intelligent AI, and also ties into the story nicely.The game was a real blast to play through, and when things become a little too boring it introduces new things, such as hallucinations that will try and kill you, or invisible, wall climbing ninjas that will make you jump and scream and spray your bullets wildly. When these newer features get old (the ninjas never do, there were too few of them actually), the game gives you one of the best video game finales you will ever see.I rate this game a 5 for Amazeballs, it is the highest rating I can give, and it means you should buy it like right now. I'm waiting. No seriously, stop fooling around. Buy it.			",149,10,0,28,13,1,8

												The fear franchise is absolutely incredible. The first time I played FEAR 2: Project Origin I was stunned by how awesome the story of the game was. Since then I played all the fear games from FEAR 1(With all DLC) to FEAR 3 and was surprised about how brilliant the series was, that I kept playing them over and over and to today I am still not bored of the games!The games are sort of creepy, things pop out of no where, where you least expect it. The enemies are non-repetative, and the difficulty actually increases as you go along in the games themselves.If you're the type of person who gets scared easily I can't recommned this series to you as it will scare you. If you enjoy horror FPS games, then this series is the right series for you. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Always wanted to pick this game up, finally did it nine years after its release. I have to say, this game still holds up to the reputation it had almost a decade ago. The sounds in this game are incredible, even with the limited graphics it had, combined with the sound, its still one hell of a creepy game, definately one to wear headphones for.Despite being such an old game, the AI in the game are very well done, the enemies duck and hide, while your allies never block you. It's definately an aspect that some current games (I'm looking at you Brink) still struggle with, but this one had it right.This game perfectly combines shooter with horror, the scary scenes make you feel helpless, while the firefights not only test your shooting skills but also your observational skills to your surroundings.9/10			",270,49,3,22,9,3,33

												F.E.A.R. succeeds as a great FPS with moments of horror.  The action is great, varied, and the ability to slow time for a little bit adds to the cinematic action as you seamlessly cut through the baddies.  The only problem I really have is that at the beginning, med-packs aren't very plentiful so you feel anxious about what is around the next corner, but a few hours into the game, med-packs are pouring out of everything.  There are usually too many med-packs than you can carry, so that kind of takes away from the anxiety.  But, overall, this is a great horror/FPS that should be on the list of buys for fans of both genres.			",100,19,0,10,10,0,9

												10 years after its release, I’d say that the game has not aged well. Enemies tend to use cover and I like how they communicate with each other and act on the orders they are given via radio, but there are only like 5 different types of enemies and the maps don’t change much either. In the end you are just wishing for it to end, because you’ve visited that same place (or at least a very similar one) just in the last mission. As you can expect, the graphics are old and what is supposed to be its greatest feature, its story, is really not that much interesting until the last bit.  By that time, however, you have probably guessed the ending and the only exciting thing about it is making sure you were right the whole time. Oh, and seriously, they could have come up with something better than: “We’ll regroup later, you go alone first” in every single mission. Gets tiring pretty soon. Other than that, the slow motion mechanic is quite cool, but don’t expect the game to scare you too much. I don’t know. In most cases I probably wouldn’t recommend playing it, but since it’s not too long and it was quite a game back in its day, I suppose it couldn’t hurt to give the game a try. Just be ready to experience a really repetitive game until the very last stage.  ",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												With a fair learning curve, manipulative save system and genuine fun factor, F.E.A.R. not only goes the extra mile as a game, but as an example to all future first-person shooters.  The original game-play mechanics, namely slow-motion, bring a satisfying flavor that some future games have failed to reciprocate (properly).  Being a survival-horror game, there are points where the game offers jump scares and the occasional plot twist that works against the protagonist, giving players a chance to feel, if just a little, genuine fear.  Despite these elements, there's clearly a greater emphasis on action and strategy over story (though that alone has never kept a good game down).  While F.E.A.R. and it's expansion packs do offer a fun, memorable experience, the primary issue with this game is poor optimization for PC's; players may be forced to unplug and re-plug their mice and keyboards in order to keep their USB ports from flooding, which creates unplayable lag on any machine (for more info, go here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1279444).  The fact that the game hasn't been optimized for resolutions other than 4:3 and the loss of it's (supposedly) strong multiplayer support also testifies to the game's failures in standing the test of time.  Technical shortcomings aside, F.E.A.R. offers dedicated gamers a game that's not only fun to master, but philosophically engaging.			",865,261,38,108,86,11,169

Its a medium length game so you will have plenty of time with it. If you are looking for a scary game this would be a great buy, but you have to be ready for alot of normal fps shooting against other soldiers.			",163,10,4,8,13,1,22

												F.E.A.R. slow-mo'd its way onto my list of top FPS games, competing with Battlefront 2, Halo 2, Far Cry 3, and Republic Commando. F.E.A.R. beautifully manages the thin red line between horror and first person shooting with atmospheric yet intense gunplay. Your opponents, the Replicant soldiers created by Armachan and the Armachan private army both have excellent AI. They behave very intelligently under the circumstances and coordinate well as squads. The storyline engrossed me completely even though it wasn't deep. It was disturbing, dark, and thrilling as you put together the picture. Overall the game feels satisfying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as ambushing an enemy squad then while in slow-motion wipe them all out in less then a second (in game time).Most surprisingly the graphics hold up better than its sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Now nearly 10 years after its original release F.E.A.R.'s graphics are visually interesting and highly functional. The enemy units come in variety and all are fascinating to look at. The sequel's graphics while most advanced are simply dull and remind one of Call of Duty.Ultimately, I recommend this to any member of the gaming community to play. Be wary of the sequels, they are unimpressive but fun at best. They're downright terrible if you want more of the original flavor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is F.E.A.R.?--F.E.A.R. is a classic first person psycho-horror shooter, with a fluid bullet time mechanic, and a number of phenomenal jump-scares.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R.?--The game is a bit dated now, but it has aged decently. It's not a particularly action packed FPS, though it's far from dry in that department. Where the game really shines, however, is in keeping the player constantly wondering what might happen next. It's packed full of ambient tension, and just enough jump-scares to keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly challenging game, definitely not for the light of heart, but if you're looking for a rush, and can get over the dated engine, F.E.A.R. is definitely for you.----Over-all: 70%A solid game. Worth playing through for sure, especially if you plan on playing the later titles in the series. F.E.A.R. holds its own as a ground-breaking title in the psycho-horror genre.--Mechanics: 3/5The mechanics aren't perfect, but they serve the needs of the game. Mobility is slightly cramped compared to most modern shooters, but the fluidity of the bullet time experience definitely compensates in this regard. Despite the clunkiness, it's not enough of a weakness to distract from the fantastic immersive experience the game provides.--Experience: 5/5The greatest strength in F.E.A.R. is it's ability to pull the player into the game. Despite the dated audio and visuals, the game still manages to immerse the player to a degree I haven't experienced in a long time. The audio mixing, though dated, and overly simple, is fantastically orchestrated. Ambient static, strategically placed, and dissonent instrumentation instill a very desirable sense of paranoia. Headphones are definitely recommended. Some of the dialogue gets a tad redundant and obnoxious, but can definitely be overlooked, given the phenomenal work done in the other departments. The visuals are painful at times, especially during cutscenes, but during the actual gameplay, with the bullet time effects at play, and the visual interruptions that are part of the psycho-horror theme, you almost completely forget all of this. The game is visually dated, for sure, but still manages an incredible depth of immersion, adding tremendously to the experience.--Balance: 3/5The fight blance is pretty poor over-all. Some fights are far too difficult, especially if you've run low on ammunition or health kits due to a string of accidents. That being said, this does add to the tension at times, which is great, as long as it doesn't become frustrating. The AI is good enough. It's simple by today's standards, but it's not dumb enough to be noticably distracting, and that's more than enough in this case.--Longevity: 3/5The game itself is 21 missions long, each ranging between 15 and 45 minutes (though you could probably speed run some of them very quickly). There is no immediate replay value, but if you give yourself a few months or years to forget the specifics of the game, it's likely you'll enjoy a second play-through at that point.----Expansions:--Extraction Point: Extraction point is a decent expansion. I would not recommend it, however, as it distracts from the fantastic finale' F.E.A.R. leaves you at, which, incidentally, is where F.E.A.R. 2 picks up. That being said, it's not bad enough to suggest not playing, if you're really interested in the series, beyond just the experience. There are some great, fights in the expansion, and while the over-all quality is slightly lower than the base game, in my opinion, it still provides a few new twists and plenty of lore to keep you entertained. The finale' of Extraction point does a poor job of explaining itself, and is slightly baffling, but the adventure there is possibly worth it.--Perseus Mandate: Perseus Mandate is over-all, a terrible expansion. It plays more like a poor action FPS game than a psycho-horror, and drags on far longer than I wish I had the patience for. I would only recommend this expansion to players who find themselves fascinated by the lore of F.E.A.R.. It provides a bit of extra insight in this department, which is nice (though distracting from the experience of the series). There are several intersting gun battles, but almost no jump-scares, or tension at all, for that matter. If you're on the fence about this expansion, I'd suggest against it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take the linearity of Half-Life, but create a game that's actually fun and you have FEAR. Actually, this game is more linear than Half-Life, if that's even possible. It's entirely understandable if you grow tired of corridors and start to feel like you're just going down a conveyor belt with enemies ocassionaly popping out of the darkness in front of you. It's telling when even in a vehicle during the game's intro you're going down an incredibly narrow path whereby there's barely any space between the car and the walls. It's as if the developers refused to have any sort of open areas present in even the most sensible of places.But linearity isn't bad. In fact, this game is a strong showcase of how linearity can be used to craft a strong single-player experience. While the corridors may make you feel constricted, at the same time they are conducive to brilliant enemy ai that knows its surroundings and moves accordingly. Linearity also allows a developer to craft an experience that ensures certain events are experienced a particular way and come about in proper order. Linear progression in level design means that you are strapped to a roller coaster and ride through all events in a manner that leaves no doubt in the creator's mind that you got the specific emotional ride he/she was looking to put you through.The game is littered with many events where something 2spooky happens which is only possible through a constricted experience whereby the developer knows you are looking a particular way or going down a particular path. While getting the exact reaction out of you is only possible through linearity, it's a positive that quickly falls back down to neutral due to the negatives that weigh it down. You see, because all the 'scares' are crafted in a linear experience, you can often see them coming. It doesn't help that you get a little 'UNKNOWN SIGNAL' prompt at the top left of the screen whenever the little girl appears somewhere in the map trying to scare you. It aids in letting you know that an event is occuring and you might miss it, but that defeats the purpose of surprising/scaring you.Not that the 'fear factor' in the game is that great anyway. Personally I wasn't frightened by the title, but it does do a fantastic job at crafting some good atmosphere. Remember: you don't actually have to succeed at scaring people to create an atmosphere that is eerie. Theres excellent use of lighting throughout and great pacing between the game's more hectic moments that leaves you wondering if a firefight is afoot or a 'jump scare'. Trying to create an FPS that is also horror-based is a tough balancing act, and this game pulled off that tight rope walk admirably. It's a shame that the plot itself couldn't have more meat to it. It feels a little bare-bones, with the story feeling more like justification for the little girl character and all the creepy shenanigans. It's as if they created the game and characters first, and then realized they needed a plot to tie it together; story came towards the end of development, essentially. But something tells me they had the plot down, and then got down to level creation and just kept on creating more and more until they had to stretch the already thin plot even thinner to last through the constant stream of levels. So I guess it's excusable, if not a shame. After all, gameplay comes first, even if plot is the motivator for me to keep progressing.All said, if you don't mind linearity and a rather simple plot it's a great experience that is held up by its atmosphere and enemy ai that is carefully balanced between eerieness and enjoyable firefights.

												QUICK SUMMARYNice fun game. Not the prettiest to look at, but fun from start to finish. Some of the most amazing AI ever created. Probably worth $5 at most.GRAPHICS 3/5The game is from 2005 and it shows. However I believe they have aged well, especially if you crank up all the feature to the max, since it never really becomes bothersome, although a bit repetitive on it's color plate. Even when it was originally released, graphics where never meant to take the forefront though, so don't expect a big 2005 showcase. They are simply OK.STORY 2/5Again, for the time, mixing horror with military FPS was a bit of an inovation. The story also simply serves the bigger game picture, providing a good excuse to mow down clone soldiers, get a scare or two out of the player, and come up with some weird scenarios. However, you can't help but feel the story never reaches it's full potential, being content with only feeding you bits here and there. Even worse, a good chunk of explanations are left to audio recordings which are barely audible and force you to simply stand and listen when you are all pumped up and want to continue.MUSIC AND SOUND 2/5Not much music to talk about. It's creepy and barely noticible. Never stands out but subtly sets the atmosphere for either creepiness or action. Sounds simply fitts as it should, guns sound the way guns doo and some shrieks here and there can be chilling to the bone (but only the first couple of times). GAMEPLAY 4/5If anything, this is where the game shines the most. The controls are tight and the actual shooting is as satisying as shooting could be. The graphics, sound effects, animation and everything in general come nicely together so every shoot has the appropiate punch behind it. There's some good weapon variety and destructible stuff littered around to make firefights more flashy. AI is one of the best I've ever seen for a game though, and was years beyonf it's time. Enemies coordinate, use actual attack tactics and react as a human player would. So good is the AI that even at the lowest difficulty level, where enemies are weaker, have poor aiming and you can apparently take more damage, you can STILL be surprised by the AI and die.REPLAYABILITY 1/5Not much to do once you beat it except trying to do it again at a higher difficulty level. I'm not much for multiplayer so once I finished it I didn't touch it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They don't call it F.E.A.R. For nothing.(If you're too lazy to read this review, just buy the game).FEAR is a first-person shooter game that swaps between throwing baddies with guns at you, to throwing a scary little girl and some really frightening hallucinations at you. This game made me deathly afraid of ladders for the entire playthrough, from just one hallucination early on.Basically, the story is a little goofy and feels goofier when all the characters take it so seriously, but you are a member of the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" task squad (nevermind that Assault and Recon are two entirely different things) and are assigned with bringing down a man named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic commander to a secret clone army (I said it was goofy) and out of nowhere an evil little girl ghostie-goo is haunting you and killing people. Despite it's goofiness, the story gets better as it goes, and ends up becoming really awesome.The gameplay is broken into segments of exploration and light puzzle solving, to crazy fun combat, and getting the poop scared out of you by the mysterious ghostie girl. The exploration and puzzles aren't really anything new, if you've played Half-Life 2 it's like that, but with none of those dumb see-saw puzzles. The scary moments are, well, scary and well done, however they begin to get a little predictable near the end of the game, but for the first 70% of the game people will disintegrate around you, you'll be teleported to different locations, and the little girl will try to kill you, and you'll be scared. Not horrified, but scared and probably asking, ""What the #@^%$?,"" multiplie times. Where the game truly shines though is in it's combat. The combat is fast paced and brutal, and bullets tear chunks out of walls and objects and spray particles into the air. A simple office shootout becomes mayhem as dust fills the air as shrapnel flies off walls, computers explode in bright flashes of light, and paper flutters around the air as enemies hunt for any sign of you, whether it's your flashlight or a sound you make in game. And these enemies are smart, they have the best AI I've seen in a game. They constantly hunt you down, flanking and calling orders to each other, quickly detecting you if you get to close  to their field of vision, spot your flashlight, call for reinforcements. This makes it feel like you're fighting a true army of highly trained soldiers and makes the combat shine, as each individual fight will play out completely different ways each time you play. You also have a bullet-time feature which you can trigger whenever you'd like, and it turns any combat situation into the lobby scene from The Matrix. Bullets cut through the air, leaving little ripples behind them, dust slowly explodes from damaged walls as you and your enemies shoot and jump kick each other to death in slow-motion. It's incredibly fun, and gives you the killers edge you need against the intelligent AI, and also ties into the story nicely.The game was a real blast to play through, and when things become a little too boring it introduces new things, such as hallucinations that will try and kill you, or invisible, wall climbing ninjas that will make you jump and scream and spray your bullets wildly. When these newer features get old (the ninjas never do, there were too few of them actually), the game gives you one of the best video game finales you will ever see.I rate this game a 5 for Amazeballs, it is the highest rating I can give, and it means you should buy it like right now. I'm waiting. No seriously, stop fooling around. Buy it.			",149,10,0,28,13,1,8

												Fear is a good average fps shooter with an average plot, the game is fun and entertaining and can be relaxing if played at lower levels of difficulty, but has few flaws:Negative:- No map or minimap or any directions of where you're supposed to go, while this is most of time not much a problem, in some point it was, making me lose a lot of minutes walking forward and back in the aim to find the right direction to go.- Often enemies approach to you without any noise, i mean, in all games i've played, to know where the enemies are is very important, but these soldiers, too often (not always) make no noise with steps when they walk near you, so they could appear out of a wall and if you not have good reflexes you're shoot down.- Perseus Mandate expansion is the best of the 2 expansions, has more longevity and better enemies, but its level of difficulty is insane, i had hard time to beat final boss, that was really insane and i've played one of lower levels, so ,considering there are 4, i think difficulty in this game is not well balanced. As last note, once you beat the game you unlock 3 additional missions that could have been fun to play if devs would not have decided that you cannot save the game (nor checkpoints works) while trying one of these, making the experience a lot frustrating and not fun.- The AI of enemies is a little dumb ^^Positive:+ The AI of enemies is a little dumb ^^+ The game is fun enough to play+ The ability of slow the time while taking the aim is awesome and probably the best thing of this game (beware, this could seems optional but is not, if you not learn to use it always and try to face enemies without it you're going to die)So i could recommend this game to both fps fans and average players cause will give you a decent amount of hours of fun.My Final Score is 75 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For all the ""copycat"" accusations this game has received, it still feels amazing to play by today's standards. The combat is one of the most satisfying things in all of games I've played, and it feels uniqe for this very game. While other games in the series are ok, the first one is absolutely astounding.There are still not many games where enemies are so responsive to what is going on around them, they will investigate noises and rooms lit by a flashlight, they will count their numbers, be more aggressive when there are more of them, ask for cover, retreat, flank, pin down and even cower in fear when you obliterate almost an entire squad in seconds. To top that, they are a bit tanky, but managable, with great headshot bonuses - given how fast they move, you will have to look for opportunities; like throwing a grenade if they come out of an elevator or a corridor, pop up to nail their heads as soon as they stop pinning you down with fire, or rush in with a shotgun when they scatter.This combat style makes it an instinctively fair playing field, where player has advantage in powers and wits; and enemies in numbers and additional tactical opportunities. In days of enemies simply running at you and taking cover occasionally, this is like a breath of fresh air.And while combat is the highlight of this game - another thing is most definitely worth mentioning: sound design.There are even fewer games where every cracking of the wall, each bullet hit, each shell dropping after short bursts, grenades exploding and even dead bodies dropping, sound like they should do. And that creates an amazing balance, between an absolute chaos during firefights, which flows into the silence as last echoes of shots fade away. 11 years earlier, the graphics of smoke and mess all around were making an even bigger impression, but after so much time, it doesn't look as gorgeous today.And because of that, a remaster with only high poly models and high resolution textures as changes, would be something great, the proof of how well that game would stand up to current standards. Because even without that, it's easily one of the most fun shooters I had a pleasure to play.			",305,45,2,32,17,2,16

												The original F.E.A.R was probably the first horror shooter available and is still one of the top games in terms of atmosphere. It’s not the sheer sudden shocks that make this game great, but the fact that you neck hairs stay on end all the time despite the game not having a single jump scare moment. So if you don’t mind 2005 graphics and like FPS with atmosphere this game is for you.  The raven on the ledge is not a jump scare – and I think it was perfectly placed  The expansions are a bit lacking, but that doesn't chage the original game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really recommend this game.Although graphic as for now days standard isn't mint, and some locations may look a bit empty, graphic still looks good. Some of textures like Player or NPCs may looks bad so for better experience I recommend to increase resolution even that exceeds your monitor screen resolutions (ex. Nvidia DSR option).As for other things this game is pure awesome. Mechanic are like how they should be, AI, even as standard, is good enough. There are lot of places that AI can easily overrun or flank player. Recommend it with mods, that even increase the experience. Cool firing effects, plus slow-mo, plus gory (again better with mods). All from above makes the game very cool to play even now. I honestly prefer real shooters, but this is one I like so much it doesn't matter. It is so satisfying. For those who haven't played before and like hardcore FPP games is just a must have.			",78,3,6,0,3,0,1

												""A forgotten classic"".It's undoubtedly the best bullet-time game ever. I'm writing this review in 2017 and the graphics are still neat looking. The textures are good throughout, and the damage system, physics and particle effects are really extensive to a surprising level. You can blow little chunks of walls with your bullets, send enemies flying into the air as you shoot them with your Spas 12, which btw is one of the best feeling shotguns in any game ever, and the ragdoll physics is fantastic you're questioning yourself why is there no game since, that has  used this feature to this level of detail.As for the level design, it is simply fantastic. The game is semi linear with a little backtracking involved to collect health and armor. Also exploration is encouraged so you can pick up health and reflex bonuses so you can make life a little easier. As far as the difficulty goes, this game's pretty easy and that's my only complaint. But, you can remedy it by doing either one of two things : 1. Just pick the 'Extreme' difficulty setting if you want some challenge, or 2. Simply unbind Slow Mo from the controls menu and enjoy the game like any normal first person shooter on the Normal/Hard difficulty. Do note that the expansion packs Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate get progressively harder but it's nothing you can't handle even on the Extreme difficulty if you're decent at fps games. If you're wondering what's the point of playing Fear without slow mo, trust me, it's actually great even without slow mo as long as you're not playing Perseus Mandate (hardest expansion) on Extreme difficulty.Another major pro for this game is the Ai. They flank you, they hide behind cover, they try to surround you.. They act like real people, only not as good as a shooter as you are, especially if you are using your slow mo powers. Sadly, the game isn't all that scary, atleast for me (I was barely scared playing this after playing other horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent, Alien Isolation etc), but this may even be a good thing for people who shy away from games with the horror tag.This game has stood the test of time, and I would recommend anyone and everyone to pick this game up. Doesn't matter if you don't like horror or first person shooters. If you got a pc, just stop reading and buy this game already. It even runs on a Dual core pc without a graphics card, just don't expect all the special effects and physics features to be as detailed as I explained above.			",303,35,8,21,11,1,22

												In my time, F.E.A.R. was a cult classic that went on to become a trilogy, though no real fan of F.E.A.R. will actually acknowledge the thrid game... When I saw this on the Humble Indie WB Bundle, I jumped on it. F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first person shooter with some interesting horror elmets thrown in. You play as Pointman, your typical mute hero (as many were during the dawn of the Xbox 360, which is where I first played this game) who has been transferred to the F.E.A.R. Unit and is tasked with hunting down Fettel, a phsycic warrior who is able to link his mind to Cloned soldiers and issue them orders. All the while you do this there is something more sinister behind the curtain, a small girl known as Alma. Who is she? What is Fettel up to? All those answers can be found within the chapters of the game. Gameplay isn't realy innovative, point and shoot is pretty much all you do, but it's the complex and dark story that keeps you sitting in your chair. My only real ""beef"" with the game is the lack of proper controller support. I know what your going to say, but i was a console baby so playing FPS's with a mouse doesn't come natural to me, not to mention i'm playing on a laptop. A must have for any fan of both action and horror.			",246,71,2,50,26,0,28

												Great solid F.P.S., decent length campaign and has some genuinely creepy atmosphere. Challenging too and since it doesn't have the recharging health system that so many games have now you need to actually be good at it, which is nice. Was a great game when it originally came out, still is now after all these years and I highly recommend it.Another nice thing is that it does not require a very powerful computer to run and it will work on Windows 8.1 perfectly so no compatibility issues. Controls are nice and tight too and fully rebindable. While it is older and has aged some, it still can look fairly good when the graphics settings are a maximum. Only thing is these days the MP no longer works, but the SP is more than worth it. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played.			",141,4,8,6,8,0,8

												An elegant mix of horror and FPS gameplay.  Takes the atmospheric immersion of System Shock 2 and combines it with the run-and-gun functionality of Half-Life 2.  The game shows its age by being rough around a couple of edges, but they're not nearly enough to warrant avoiding this title.  F.E.A.R. does too much right; even the musical score and dialogue complement the narrative and don't get in the way.  A unique game, finely-designed, and deserving of a playthrough.

												You want a game that includes intense firefights, a slight scent of puzzles, a nice storyline and a touch of F.E.A.R.? Well, than what are you waiting for, go get it! F.E.A.R has the perfect combination of a FPS and jumpscare/horrorgame.In one moment you find youself fighting 10 (Doesn't sound too hard) Replica soldiers, and in the other moment you get scared until death by a little girl (No spoilers). Even thought these two things do not work very well together; Monolith worked it out. It this is probably why this game plays so well and offers you a action and horror packed storyline. There are quite a nice variety of guns available, with each gun having its own cons and pros. From long range to short range, laser beams to rocket launchers, ther will be something you like. (The expension encludes 1 or 2 more guns).The A.I is still outstanding even though it was developed in 2005. The enemy will suprise you with all its tricks, like building barriers, jumping behind cover or working as a team. This can bring you in deep trouble. But don't worry, the character (Which is only known as Point Man) you play has a special abillity that lets you slow down time and gives a super fast reflexes.You have to love having 5 enemies in front of you while beiing in slowmow, makes you a little feel like you are in Matrix.Last but not least, the story is quite nice and has a lot of plots and turns (I still wounder why nobody wrote a book about it). The story more and more reviels, and things get clear and start to make sence. I personally recommend this game not only for its fantastic overall gameplay but also because it is a classic and a must have in your Steam library.  ",80,7,10,2,8,1,8

												Wow, it's really been nearly a whole damn decade since this came out?  I still remember looking at the pre-order box in the shop and saying ""1GB OF RAM REQUIRED? ARE YOU INSANE!?"" like it was yesterday.  But yep, next year F.E.A.R. will 10 years old.  So now is the time to sit down and ask: ""Is F.E.A.R. still a good game that holds up""?  And the answer is ""Yes.""  Yes, F.E.A.R. is still a good game that holds up.  It sits firmly inbetween older fashioned shooters and newer shooters, not unlike its brethren (And at the time, competition) Doom 3 and Half-Life 2.  It's more linear, story focused, and the like than old school shooters but it still had navigational environments, a health bar, and other nice things that I miss.  For the time, F.E.A.R.'s technology was keen, and while aspects of it haven't aged as well as the previously mentioned Doom 3 & Half-Life 2 (Mainly the environments, plus some character models have visible seams down their faces and its weird.)  other aspects of the engine still remain pretty damn impressive and paradoxically, superior to the games own sequels and many other games today.  The bouncing particles, whizz-bang sparks, and the way each bullet creates light all around it still make for some damn cool scenes that please the eye.The atmosphere is also pretty solid, and while the scares didn't get to me like they once did, I still got chills here and there and admittedly if you are a first time player the scares might get you good.  I've hardened to them mainly because I'm currently on my 4th playthrough.The A.I. is also pretty spectacular, smart, and dynamic.  The weapons feel powerful and every bullet makes an impact on you and the enemies, and the combat animation is superb and packed with lots of satisfying bloodshed.The story is also interesting, flawed, but interesting and it must have taken some talent to pull the story off considering that it was trying to be a Sci-fi horror story inspired by The Ring, The Matrix, and Kung-Fu movies.  Not a mix that makes a lot of sense, but somehow comes together surprisingly well considering all of those things are from completely different planets.For 10 bucks, you get the original game and its expansions - and while ""Perseus Mandate"" is really only the quality of a fan made mod, it feels like its thrown in for free since the core game and ""Extraction Point"" are both pretty solid and will last you awhile.  And feel free to stop on by online, there's still folks playing - and its damn fun.In short, F.E.A.R. has Guns, Grenades, Ghost Girls & is Gory, Grisly, Gritty, & Grim.  Mmm, alliteration.

												One of my favorite shooters of all time, and the game that desensitized me to most horror when I was a lad, FEAR is a wonderful, if not exactly groundbreaking, thriller-esque romp.  The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay.  The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments.  There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis.  Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new.  The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart).  The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.Oh yeah, there's those.  While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind.  Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.Which is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline.  It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist.  Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome.  If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend.			",161,14,1,26,14,2,27

												What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said before? Despite the obvious flaws, it's one of the few first person shooters.. well games in general, that I keep coming back even now, many years after my first playthrough.I'll get the negative points out of the way first. Yes, the majority of the game takes place in the same bland office building. And yes, a large portion of the story is presented through boring audio files scattered throughout each area. But what makes F.E.A.R. such a special game is the combat. It is absolutely phenomenal. I still cannot believe this game arrived in late 2005. The majority of shooters these days don't even come close to the level of quality presented in F.E.A.R.'s engaging combat scenarios. The enemy AI is among the most intelligent i've ever faced off against in a shooter. They actively work to outsmart the player, going as far as to take alternate routes completely out of their way in an effort to sneak up on the player's flank for an easy kill. They're fast, and deadly accurate. On the harder difficulties, every mistake is quickly punished leading to a near instant death. This is all partly to balance the slow-motion reflex system, which does more to add real tactical depth to the combat rather than a crutch. Enemies can and will still hit you even with reflexes engaged and with its relatively short duration, every use must be carefully planned out to ensure success. The difficulty of the combat is what makes this game so rewarding, and why I continue to come back to it after all these years. I've played this game to completion at least a half dozen times on several difficulty settings and it still feels fresh. The graphics are extremely dated. It looks downright ugly most of the time.. but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I always found the story interesting, even if it wasn't presented in a very consistant and informative manner. F.E.A.R. does offer some legitimate scares as well, but at times they feel like more of a distraction. These moments do add mystery and a sense of forboding to the game though, and helps to set the atmosphere more than any combat scenario does. I'm currently playing through this game again on the Extreme difficulty, and I'm loving almost every moment. The brutal efficiency of the enemy AI makes every combat scenario a tactical engagement, with the threat of a quick death ever present. Easily one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time. And in my opinion much better than the sequels.			",235,15,4,26,13,0,24

												It might have been a long long time since the day that FEAR. First encounter assault recon released. But man oh man, this game is up there amoungst the giants of PC fps genre.The level design is amazing, i know this game has gotten a lot of flack for this, i always felt the levels was awesome. It fit into the environment and it made sense. Sure its a lot of office buildings and space, buts its fun interesting and help convey the story and atmosphere.The Ai is equally amazing, sometimes it seems like the AI hasnt improved jack squat in modern FPS games, because players are gimped by controllers. The ai in this game flanks, works together, takes cover, flips over tablet to take cover behind. If you play higher difficulties you will need to use every advantage you can get. You actually have to plan ahead and use tactics.The sound and music is also amazing, it totally fits, help to convey the dark creep atmosphere.The game has one of the most amazing engrossing stories ive ever played, it sucks you straigh into the world. very few games can do that even to this day. and the atmosphere is so scary and thick that you can literally cut it with a knife.I remember i got this game and i fired it up and i played this baby from beginning until end, and no its not because its a short game, i spend like 12-14 hours or something. Want an amazing journey, very few games can keep my attention like this and for that long, and after you completed it, well i just sad there, taking it all in.The game has some expansions that are worth while playing as well.Fear 2 and 3 is another matter. Fear 2 is a bad console port with all the restrictions limitations and dumbed down stuff you expect sadly. Fear 3 is just a piece of crap, abusing and milking the license.   In short Fear is one of the best FPS games of all time along with HALFLIFE, but where Halflife 2 continue the excellence, They totally messed up the fear series, Its such a shame.As a final note, im sad to see how far Monolith have fallen. FEAR and No one lives forever is two of the best FPS games i have played in my life, and i will never forget them.			",476,141,12,26,49,2,59

												As an action shooter, F.E.A.R. is one of a kind, even if for the slow-mo combat which hardly gets stale. As a horror game, where 90% of what's designed to scare you can't hurt you, it tanks badly. I can't recomment this if you're a horror junkie. Not only has the game aged pretty badly in terms of engine stability and consistency of graphics, the horror bits are so badly played that they slow down the game and add nothing to it. Level design is a little weird. Nothing feels practical, and you tend to wander around in loops.That said, the few times that the things that scare you CAN hurt you, it's a decent thrill ride, especially if you can hold out to the end. The plot is kinda vague and seems to be forgotten about midway through, but the slow motion gunplay adds a nice touch of strategy and the length is just right for the kind of game.Buy this if you want an action game, not if you want a horror game.

												Should you play F.E.A.R.? Yes, absolutely. It's an excellent psychological horror FPS that does a great job of mixing action and scares, leaving you guessing as to what comes next. The story is excellent, and the slow build of the mystery kept me interested and eager to find more. The horror has lost some of its impact on what I think is my fifth playthrough, but it still got me tense and jumpy, especially towards the end.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/05/fear.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Excellent psychological horror shooter, containing just enough jump scares, action moments, and puzzle-wandering. 8.5/10, the only thing they could do to make it even better would have been a bit less wonky controls and less heavy enemy types which are significantly annoying and detract from my gameplay. They aren't explained or introduced save when they shoot you in the face. Story could've been a bit more fleshed out as well, even after reading all 'lore' and finding all the messages there was still a general 'wat' as to how all of this came about. Highly recommended if you don't have it already.Sidenote: Steam downloads and installs the two expansion packs for you even if it doesn't appear as ""installed"", just click install from Steam and it's already ready to go with a confirmation message.

												Despite this game being almost 9 years old, all the tenants that made it a great game back then still hold up now. The graphics, although not as flashy or deep as modern standards, are still pleasing to the eye. The environments are textured rather sparsely and in generic forms like warehouse, office, or lab, yet they all look sharp in 1080 and max AA. The game's AI which was lauded in 2005 is still impressive; better than many games since. They will not stand still and wait to get shot, neither will the ""wait by the door and shoot them as they come in"" work in F.E.A.R.The story though was not taking any effect on me because I did not want to wait around answering machines to hear voice messages that comprise the story. Aside from that, it was a blast to go through the campaign, moving from one slo-mo shootout to the next.			",125,31,4,14,18,2,35

F.E.A.R. still outshines modern shooters in some aspects.Pros: Story, Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Horror, Repetitive, MultiplayerThough a bit telegraphed, F.E.A.R. does have an interesting narrative to unravel.  Gameplay is solid; enemy AI is much better than most shooters nearly a decade later.  Most modern systems can handle the game at maximum graphical settings, an often overlooked advantage.  The sound and voice acting is excellent.  Controls are good but not quite thoroughly refined (e.g. no hold-down aim).Unfortunately, F.E.A.R. is not particularly frightening, especially to someone wanting to be scared.  The gameplay and environments become a bit repetitive after some time.  Finally, multiplayer has long since shut down.Overall, F.E.A.R. manages to create a little fear without abusing jump scares or monster closets.8/10			",174,41,0,29,7,0,9

												In my time, F.E.A.R. was a cult classic that went on to become a trilogy, though no real fan of F.E.A.R. will actually acknowledge the thrid game... When I saw this on the Humble Indie WB Bundle, I jumped on it. F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first person shooter with some interesting horror elmets thrown in. You play as Pointman, your typical mute hero (as many were during the dawn of the Xbox 360, which is where I first played this game) who has been transferred to the F.E.A.R. Unit and is tasked with hunting down Fettel, a phsycic warrior who is able to link his mind to Cloned soldiers and issue them orders. All the while you do this there is something more sinister behind the curtain, a small girl known as Alma. Who is she? What is Fettel up to? All those answers can be found within the chapters of the game. Gameplay isn't realy innovative, point and shoot is pretty much all you do, but it's the complex and dark story that keeps you sitting in your chair. My only real ""beef"" with the game is the lack of proper controller support. I know what your going to say, but i was a console baby so playing FPS's with a mouse doesn't come natural to me, not to mention i'm playing on a laptop. A must have for any fan of both action and horror.			",246,71,2,50,26,0,28

The game shows its age by being rough around a couple of edges, but they're not nearly enough to warrant avoiding this title.  F.E.A.R. does too much right; even the musical score and dialogue complement the narrative and don't get in the way.  A unique game, finely-designed, and deserving of a playthrough.

												For all the ""copycat"" accusations this game has received, it still feels amazing to play by today's standards. The combat is one of the most satisfying things in all of games I've played, and it feels uniqe for this very game. While other games in the series are ok, the first one is absolutely astounding.There are still not many games where enemies are so responsive to what is going on around them, they will investigate noises and rooms lit by a flashlight, they will count their numbers, be more aggressive when there are more of them, ask for cover, retreat, flank, pin down and even cower in fear when you obliterate almost an entire squad in seconds. To top that, they are a bit tanky, but managable, with great headshot bonuses - given how fast they move, you will have to look for opportunities; like throwing a grenade if they come out of an elevator or a corridor, pop up to nail their heads as soon as they stop pinning you down with fire, or rush in with a shotgun when they scatter.This combat style makes it an instinctively fair playing field, where player has advantage in powers and wits; and enemies in numbers and additional tactical opportunities. In days of enemies simply running at you and taking cover occasionally, this is like a breath of fresh air.And while combat is the highlight of this game - another thing is most definitely worth mentioning: sound design.There are even fewer games where every cracking of the wall, each bullet hit, each shell dropping after short bursts, grenades exploding and even dead bodies dropping, sound like they should do. And that creates an amazing balance, between an absolute chaos during firefights, which flows into the silence as last echoes of shots fade away. 11 years earlier, the graphics of smoke and mess all around were making an even bigger impression, but after so much time, it doesn't look as gorgeous today.And because of that, a remaster with only high poly models and high resolution textures as changes, would be something great, the proof of how well that game would stand up to current standards. Because even without that, it's easily one of the most fun shooters I had a pleasure to play.			",305,45,2,32,17,2,16

												""A forgotten classic"".It's undoubtedly the best bullet-time game ever. I'm writing this review in 2017 and the graphics are still neat looking. The textures are good throughout, and the damage system, physics and particle effects are really extensive to a surprising level. You can blow little chunks of walls with your bullets, send enemies flying into the air as you shoot them with your Spas 12, which btw is one of the best feeling shotguns in any game ever, and the ragdoll physics is fantastic you're questioning yourself why is there no game since, that has  used this feature to this level of detail.As for the level design, it is simply fantastic. The game is semi linear with a little backtracking involved to collect health and armor. Also exploration is encouraged so you can pick up health and reflex bonuses so you can make life a little easier. As far as the difficulty goes, this game's pretty easy and that's my only complaint. But, you can remedy it by doing either one of two things : 1. Just pick the 'Extreme' difficulty setting if you want some challenge, or 2. Simply unbind Slow Mo from the controls menu and enjoy the game like any normal first person shooter on the Normal/Hard difficulty. Do note that the expansion packs Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate get progressively harder but it's nothing you can't handle even on the Extreme difficulty if you're decent at fps games. If you're wondering what's the point of playing Fear without slow mo, trust me, it's actually great even without slow mo as long as you're not playing Perseus Mandate (hardest expansion) on Extreme difficulty.Another major pro for this game is the Ai. They flank you, they hide behind cover, they try to surround you.. They act like real people, only not as good as a shooter as you are, especially if you are using your slow mo powers. Sadly, the game isn't all that scary, atleast for me (I was barely scared playing this after playing other horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent, Alien Isolation etc), but this may even be a good thing for people who shy away from games with the horror tag.This game has stood the test of time, and I would recommend anyone and everyone to pick this game up. Doesn't matter if you don't like horror or first person shooters. If you got a pc, just stop reading and buy this game already. It even runs on a Dual core pc without a graphics card, just don't expect all the special effects and physics features to be as detailed as I explained above.			",303,35,8,21,11,1,22

												A totally must have for all FPP/S fans, even when now multiplayer is officially unsupported (it is using mods). I really recommend this game.Although graphic as for now days standard isn't mint, and some locations may look a bit empty, graphic still looks good. Some of textures like Player or NPCs may looks bad so for better experience I recommend to increase resolution even that exceeds your monitor screen resolutions (ex. Nvidia DSR option).As for other things this game is pure awesome. Mechanic are like how they should be, AI, even as standard, is good enough. There are lot of places that AI can easily overrun or flank player. Recommend it with mods, that even increase the experience. Cool firing effects, plus slow-mo, plus gory (again better with mods). All from above makes the game very cool to play even now. I honestly prefer real shooters, but this is one I like so much it doesn't matter. It is so satisfying. For those who haven't played before and like hardcore FPP games is just a must have.			",78,3,6,0,3,0,1

												The original F.E.A.R was probably the first horror shooter available and is still one of the top games in terms of atmosphere. It’s not the sheer sudden shocks that make this game great, but the fact that you neck hairs stay on end all the time despite the game not having a single jump scare moment. So if you don’t mind 2005 graphics and like FPS with atmosphere this game is for you.  The raven on the ledge is not a jump scare – and I think it was perfectly placed  The expansions are a bit lacking, but that doesn't chage the original game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FEAR - очень весёлый шутер с необычной фишкой - режимом SlowMo. Хардкорщикам брать точно не стоит, так как здесь их будет ждать сплошное разочарование. Даже я, не любитель хардкора, без проблем прошёл на ""экстремальной"" сложности, раскидывая всех с дробовиком.Сюжета здесь почти нет, так что ради тяжёлого сюжета и катсцен FEAR покупать не стоит. Могу мало чего сказать по части хоррора, так как это явно не моё, но джампскэры (резкая хрень со звуком) есть, всё как положено. Но вот ради чего стоит купить FEAR, так это ради геймплея:ИИ умнее, чем во всех современных играх, которые я знаю. Я даже признаю, что врагам часто удавалось меня обхитрить. Противники переговариваются между собой, что одновремнно делает их более живыми и облегчает игру.Пули - не лазеры, как, например, в CS:GO (первое, что в голову пришло). Они действительно летят, и от них можно увернуться в SlowMo.Рефлексы (режим SlowMo) позволяют слоупокам типа меня мгновенно убить всех в комнате. Звучит это не так круто, как чувствуется в игре.Графон намного лучше, чем можно ожидать от игр 2005 года. Ну серьёзно, я офигевал от графона, когда впервые запустил игру.Идеальная совместимость с Windows 10.Конечно же, есть и плохая сторона. Но я её не нашёл. Может только то, что игра короткая. Если она занимает 7 часов на экстриме, то на лёгком, наверное, часа 4.			",217,24,6,10,18,1,21

												F.E.A.R. is an acronym for First Encounter Assault Recon, and you playing for a member of it - a Point Man to be precise, and that's the only thing you know about him. F.E.A.R. specializes on handling combat situations of uncoditional nature - paranormal stuff in other words. Stuff like this must be happening all the time for squad like this to be created. And it seems to be the case, because one day certain cannibal with batallion of special ops on telepatic leash loses himself and starts to wreak havoc taking over Armacham HQ and moving his forces into long abandoned area for unknown reasons. Our mission is to stop the lunatic but it's obvious that everything is not that simple...Although very well trained and equipped - you are not superman. Player can take roughly same amount of damage as the enemies, and you should use every tool at your disposal - from your gun to your boosted reflexes which appear to you as slow motion - properly to get out of fight alive, and make a difference in the situation. And if you are using your head on top of that you are rewarded greatly by feeling of manhandling enemy and their F.E.A.R.ful chatter about you taking down whole squads of men.being released in 2005 it still holds up, and not because it's some sort of classic, but because it's a damn good game. It shows it's age - in bad sense in graphic someplaces and in good sense in gamedesign, but it's certainly worth playing for anyone from old time quake veterans to (and especially) spoiled polygon-counting folk.PlusesFast paced smart shooter: you have to work fast and take every advantage over your enemy. Take every cover, flank them, approach unnoticed and be wary - because they will do the same.Good leveldesign: different situations every minute, you have to be on your toes all the time. If you can forgive game small amount of textures and models you will find it visually pleasing too.Reactive environment: twenty years ago we thought games of future will have every object simulated individually. But now we see that cinderblock solid and inert levels are fault of bad design, not low computing power. Thankfully it's far from truth here. Mugs and glass shatter,  monitors break, papers  and chairs fly, lockers doors go off the hinges - sometimes you will willingly hold your trigger just for look and feel of it. And firefights turn into symphony because of this.Smoke and dust: i wanted to add this to previous point but decided to dedicate separate one because of how significant it is. Each piece of concrete that you chip away from wall with bullets leaves cloud of dust behind it and grenades do this much more. This can obstruct your and enemies view very much and forces you to aim carefully and change positions.Big and interesting arsenal: all guns have unique and pleasing feel to them, and certainly used differently.MinusesSlo-mo: don't get me wrong, it's cool. It just feels more like a cheat. My advice - play without it. It will train you a good bit of tactical thinking and planning ahead.Melee: although it has all potential to be VERY cool melee system with all stuff you can pull off - roundhouse jumpkicks, bicycle kicks, weapon strikes etc. - it has very limited use because of how painfully slow it is. You are long dead before you could land a strike, or even if you are not - enemy has more than enough time to get away from you. And it's twice painfull because it is one hit kill in most cases. Therefore it has very limited appliance on one enemy type to be exact. And not one you would expect - that one is invunerable to melee altogether.Story: there are some serious holes and although overall thing is very interesing sometimes you may feel not very investedAI: despite how smart it is and how interesting it makes challenge, sometimes it can get really irritating. For example, if enemy has explosive weapon he will shoot at you even at point blank distance, which makes them really hard to deal with.F.E.A.R.: it seems that you are the only one member of it, and presence of other ones is outright laughable. You just can't take those guys on radio seriously.Horror: It's not scary. Just not. You look at it with interest, but not in fear.Overall it's a very good game. Play it. They just not making things like this anymore. It's both an interesting and nostalgic trip to the beginning of 2000's when bulky rounded plastic things with small LCD's looked futuristic and very interesting and demanding challenge which will make you feel like real special operator.

												I just played F.E.A.R. for the first time, and despite the fact that this game is nine years old, I found myself delighted with every aspect of it.The graphics are dated, to be sure, but they certainly aren't bad, and didn't distract from the gameplay.The A.I made my mind figuratively explode.  It is better than any game I've experienced recently, and really makes popular games stand out as examples of how essential gameplay elements are discarded in favor of prettier pictures.  Take a good look at F.E.A.R, Bioshock Infinite, and then hang your head in shame.The other aspect of this game that stands out is the atmosphere.  The game is not outright scary, and that's a good thing.  It doesn't reply on cheap jump scares, but rather doles out intermittent scenes of gore and supernatural phenomenon, then forces you continue forward despite your inclination toward retreat.  It's like you want to run out front door, but you have to run upstairs, even though you know that is a terrible idea.			",139,27,2,22,11,1,32

												As an action shooter, F.E.A.R. is one of a kind, even if for the slow-mo combat which hardly gets stale. As a horror game, where 90% of what's designed to scare you can't hurt you, it tanks badly. I can't recomment this if you're a horror junkie. Not only has the game aged pretty badly in terms of engine stability and consistency of graphics, the horror bits are so badly played that they slow down the game and add nothing to it. Level design is a little weird. Nothing feels practical, and you tend to wander around in loops.That said, the few times that the things that scare you CAN hurt you, it's a decent thrill ride, especially if you can hold out to the end. The plot is kinda vague and seems to be forgotten about midway through, but the slow motion gunplay adds a nice touch of strategy and the length is just right for the kind of game.Buy this if you want an action game, not if you want a horror game.

												This game comes pretty damn close to perfection. The shooting mechanics are on point, the level design motivates you to search around for powerups and the tidbits of story and the great AI knows just how to use it to your disadvantage.They also nailed how to do horror. It's not just your usual jumpscares but a constant atmosphere of uncertainty. Since Alma can get you pretty much anywhere, you never know when she's gonna strike next. The memories aren't too bad once they've appeared (♥♥♥♥ that elevator though), but the fact that they might appear at any point keep you on the edge of your seat. The sound design does the rest, very well-made.And there's also the technical point. The game aged incredibly well, I can still play it without problems to date (I'm doing it right now). And the graphics were pretty good for the time. Certainly nothing I'd call ugly today.﻿			",168,21,3,23,7,2,15

												An amazing game. I really regret letting this game wait for me for almost 9 years. Even though the graphics got a little bit old, the game is still an amazing piece of work. And it really frightened me at some points, not exactly because of screamers. If you like themes like secret projects, secret underground facilities, paranormal activity, creepy kids and a you enjoy dense, dark locations - this game is a must-play. Oh, and one more wonderful thing - not only it is a great...well, horror, but also a really good shooter. I enjoyed the hell out of gunfights, especially with slow-mo and HV-Penetrator ;)			",436,103,20,39,31,5,57

												It might have been a long long time since the day that FEAR. First encounter assault recon released. But man oh man, this game is up there amoungst the giants of PC fps genre.The level design is amazing, i know this game has gotten a lot of flack for this, i always felt the levels was awesome. It fit into the environment and it made sense. Sure its a lot of office buildings and space, buts its fun interesting and help convey the story and atmosphere.The Ai is equally amazing, sometimes it seems like the AI hasnt improved jack squat in modern FPS games, because players are gimped by controllers. The ai in this game flanks, works together, takes cover, flips over tablet to take cover behind. If you play higher difficulties you will need to use every advantage you can get. You actually have to plan ahead and use tactics.The sound and music is also amazing, it totally fits, help to convey the dark creep atmosphere.The game has one of the most amazing engrossing stories ive ever played, it sucks you straigh into the world. very few games can do that even to this day. and the atmosphere is so scary and thick that you can literally cut it with a knife.I remember i got this game and i fired it up and i played this baby from beginning until end, and no its not because its a short game, i spend like 12-14 hours or something. Want an amazing journey, very few games can keep my attention like this and for that long, and after you completed it, well i just sad there, taking it all in.The game has some expansions that are worth while playing as well.Fear 2 and 3 is another matter. Fear 2 is a bad console port with all the restrictions limitations and dumbed down stuff you expect sadly. Fear 3 is just a piece of crap, abusing and milking the license.   In short Fear is one of the best FPS games of all time along with HALFLIFE, but where Halflife 2 continue the excellence, They totally messed up the fear series, Its such a shame.As a final note, im sad to see how far Monolith have fallen. FEAR and No one lives forever is two of the best FPS games i have played in my life, and i will never forget them.			",476,141,12,26,49,2,59

												I did one playthrough, on Extreme (hardest) difficulty. I do not regret time or money spent. The gameplay is good enough to know you can beat it, and the story is good enough to want to finish it.Some of the mechanics of the game are just stupid and cheap; mainly, enemies can spot you and react really really quickly, and the turrets are apparently god-like death machines that are sometimes harder to kill than the rock-launching mechs. I've been shot by turrets through ""cover,"" which was just the game either failing to recognize the object in front of me or me failing to recognize my actual hit area (which is bigger than you think.)Basically the turrets are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and in general there is very little hiding besides behind several corners.Also the ""leaning"" is pretty much useless, but you can use it in combination with slow-motion to make pretty accurate shots and not get too hurt. Then again, guys can hit you from miles away, so gfl m8.About halfway through the game, the damage you take also increases dramatically. I thought maybe extreme was too easy, or that I was ""too good"" (lolol what an a**hole), but right around the time starting to fight the ATC guys, I felt a very noticeable change in how much damage I was taking.The game doesn't seem to ramp up the difficulty as much as it does spike and plateu the damage you take/ the damage it takes to kill baddies. Endgame weapons are fun if a little unvaried in their general effects.Oh, also, has a gun that shoots nails and is great.Also has a gun that shoots particle lazers and disinitegrates baddies.Good game!

												Wow, it's really been nearly a whole damn decade since this came out?  I still remember looking at the pre-order box in the shop and saying ""1GB OF RAM REQUIRED? ARE YOU INSANE!?"" like it was yesterday.  But yep, next year F.E.A.R. will 10 years old.  So now is the time to sit down and ask: ""Is F.E.A.R. still a good game that holds up""?  And the answer is ""Yes.""  Yes, F.E.A.R. is still a good game that holds up.  It sits firmly inbetween older fashioned shooters and newer shooters, not unlike its brethren (And at the time, competition) Doom 3 and Half-Life 2.  It's more linear, story focused, and the like than old school shooters but it still had navigational environments, a health bar, and other nice things that I miss.  For the time, F.E.A.R.'s technology was keen, and while aspects of it haven't aged as well as the previously mentioned Doom 3 & Half-Life 2 (Mainly the environments, plus some character models have visible seams down their faces and its weird.)  other aspects of the engine still remain pretty damn impressive and paradoxically, superior to the games own sequels and many other games today.  The bouncing particles, whizz-bang sparks, and the way each bullet creates light all around it still make for some damn cool scenes that please the eye.The atmosphere is also pretty solid, and while the scares didn't get to me like they once did, I still got chills here and there and admittedly if you are a first time player the scares might get you good.  I've hardened to them mainly because I'm currently on my 4th playthrough.The A.I. is also pretty spectacular, smart, and dynamic.  The weapons feel powerful and every bullet makes an impact on you and the enemies, and the combat animation is superb and packed with lots of satisfying bloodshed.The story is also interesting, flawed, but interesting and it must have taken some talent to pull the story off considering that it was trying to be a Sci-fi horror story inspired by The Ring, The Matrix, and Kung-Fu movies.  Not a mix that makes a lot of sense, but somehow comes together surprisingly well considering all of those things are from completely different planets.For 10 bucks, you get the original game and its expansions - and while ""Perseus Mandate"" is really only the quality of a fan made mod, it feels like its thrown in for free since the core game and ""Extraction Point"" are both pretty solid and will last you awhile.  And feel free to stop on by online, there's still folks playing - and its damn fun.In short, F.E.A.R. has Guns, Grenades, Ghost Girls & is Gory, Grisly, Gritty, & Grim.  Mmm, alliteration.

												One of my favorite shooters of all time, and the game that desensitized me to most horror when I was a lad, FEAR is a wonderful, if not exactly groundbreaking, thriller-esque romp.  The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay.  The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments.  There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis.  Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new.  The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart).  The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.Oh yeah, there's those.  While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind.  Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.Which is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline.  It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist.  Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome.  If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend.			",161,14,1,26,14,2,27

												Great solid F.P.S., decent length campaign and has some genuinely creepy atmosphere. Challenging too and since it doesn't have the recharging health system that so many games have now you need to actually be good at it, which is nice. Was a great game when it originally came out, still is now after all these years and I highly recommend it.Another nice thing is that it does not require a very powerful computer to run and it will work on Windows 8.1 perfectly so no compatibility issues. Controls are nice and tight too and fully rebindable. While it is older and has aged some, it still can look fairly good when the graphics settings are a maximum. Only thing is these days the MP no longer works, but the SP is more than worth it. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played.			",141,4,8,6,8,0,8

												As an action shooter, F.E.A.R. is one of a kind, even if for the slow-mo combat which hardly gets stale. As a horror game, where 90% of what's designed to scare you can't hurt you, it tanks badly. I can't recomment this if you're a horror junkie. Not only has the game aged pretty badly in terms of engine stability and consistency of graphics, the horror bits are so badly played that they slow down the game and add nothing to it. Level design is a little weird. Nothing feels practical, and you tend to wander around in loops.That said, the few times that the things that scare you CAN hurt you, it's a decent thrill ride, especially if you can hold out to the end. The plot is kinda vague and seems to be forgotten about midway through, but the slow motion gunplay adds a nice touch of strategy and the length is just right for the kind of game.Buy this if you want an action game, not if you want a horror game.

												Has to be one of the best first person horror shooters ever made. Before F.E.A.R., there was very little to choose from in the action horror genre. Monolith Timegate really did a great job in putting together a quality game that will give you chills. It reminds me of those horror movies like The Ring and The Grudge. It provides the right complement of shooting action combined with well placed cut scenes. Many of the enemies are quite unique and offer some serious challenge on the higher difficulty settings. The slow motion feature does make the game a little easy, but you can deliberately not use it. The ideal way to experience this game is to create a scare factor atmosphere by playing it at night with the lights turned off. Highly recommended if you've never played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said before? Despite the obvious flaws, it's one of the few first person shooters.. well games in general, that I keep coming back even now, many years after my first playthrough.I'll get the negative points out of the way first. Yes, the majority of the game takes place in the same bland office building. And yes, a large portion of the story is presented through boring audio files scattered throughout each area. But what makes F.E.A.R. such a special game is the combat. It is absolutely phenomenal. I still cannot believe this game arrived in late 2005. The majority of shooters these days don't even come close to the level of quality presented in F.E.A.R.'s engaging combat scenarios. The enemy AI is among the most intelligent i've ever faced off against in a shooter. They actively work to outsmart the player, going as far as to take alternate routes completely out of their way in an effort to sneak up on the player's flank for an easy kill. They're fast, and deadly accurate. On the harder difficulties, every mistake is quickly punished leading to a near instant death. This is all partly to balance the slow-motion reflex system, which does more to add real tactical depth to the combat rather than a crutch. Enemies can and will still hit you even with reflexes engaged and with its relatively short duration, every use must be carefully planned out to ensure success. The difficulty of the combat is what makes this game so rewarding, and why I continue to come back to it after all these years. I've played this game to completion at least a half dozen times on several difficulty settings and it still feels fresh. The graphics are extremely dated. It looks downright ugly most of the time.. but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I always found the story interesting, even if it wasn't presented in a very consistant and informative manner. F.E.A.R. does offer some legitimate scares as well, but at times they feel like more of a distraction. These moments do add mystery and a sense of forboding to the game though, and helps to set the atmosphere more than any combat scenario does. I'm currently playing through this game again on the Extreme difficulty, and I'm loving almost every moment. The brutal efficiency of the enemy AI makes every combat scenario a tactical engagement, with the threat of a quick death ever present. Easily one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time. And in my opinion much better than the sequels.			",235,15,4,26,13,0,24

												You want a game that includes intense firefights, a slight scent of puzzles, a nice storyline and a touch of F.E.A.R.? Well, than what are you waiting for, go get it! F.E.A.R has the perfect combination of a FPS and jumpscare/horrorgame.In one moment you find youself fighting 10 (Doesn't sound too hard) Replica soldiers, and in the other moment you get scared until death by a little girl (No spoilers). Even thought these two things do not work very well together; Monolith worked it out. It this is probably why this game plays so well and offers you a action and horror packed storyline. There are quite a nice variety of guns available, with each gun having its own cons and pros. From long range to short range, laser beams to rocket launchers, ther will be something you like. (The expension encludes 1 or 2 more guns).The A.I is still outstanding even though it was developed in 2005. The enemy will suprise you with all its tricks, like building barriers, jumping behind cover or working as a team. This can bring you in deep trouble. But don't worry, the character (Which is only known as Point Man) you play has a special abillity that lets you slow down time and gives a super fast reflexes.You have to love having 5 enemies in front of you while beiing in slowmow, makes you a little feel like you are in Matrix.Last but not least, the story is quite nice and has a lot of plots and turns (I still wounder why nobody wrote a book about it). The story more and more reviels, and things get clear and start to make sence. I personally recommend this game not only for its fantastic overall gameplay but also because it is a classic and a must have in your Steam library.  ",80,7,10,2,8,1,8

												An amazing game. I really regret letting this game wait for me for almost 9 years. Even though the graphics got a little bit old, the game is still an amazing piece of work. And it really frightened me at some points, not exactly because of screamers. If you like themes like secret projects, secret underground facilities, paranormal activity, creepy kids and a you enjoy dense, dark locations - this game is a must-play. Oh, and one more wonderful thing - not only it is a great...well, horror, but also a really good shooter. I enjoyed the hell out of gunfights, especially with slow-mo and HV-Penetrator ;)			",436,103,20,39,31,5,57

												Wow, it's really been nearly a whole damn decade since this came out?  I still remember looking at the pre-order box in the shop and saying ""1GB OF RAM REQUIRED? ARE YOU INSANE!?"" like it was yesterday.  But yep, next year F.E.A.R. will 10 years old.  So now is the time to sit down and ask: ""Is F.E.A.R. still a good game that holds up""?  And the answer is ""Yes.""  Yes, F.E.A.R. is still a good game that holds up.  It sits firmly inbetween older fashioned shooters and newer shooters, not unlike its brethren (And at the time, competition) Doom 3 and Half-Life 2.  It's more linear, story focused, and the like than old school shooters but it still had navigational environments, a health bar, and other nice things that I miss.  For the time, F.E.A.R.'s technology was keen, and while aspects of it haven't aged as well as the previously mentioned Doom 3 & Half-Life 2 (Mainly the environments, plus some character models have visible seams down their faces and its weird.)  other aspects of the engine still remain pretty damn impressive and paradoxically, superior to the games own sequels and many other games today.  The bouncing particles, whizz-bang sparks, and the way each bullet creates light all around it still make for some damn cool scenes that please the eye.The atmosphere is also pretty solid, and while the scares didn't get to me like they once did, I still got chills here and there and admittedly if you are a first time player the scares might get you good.  I've hardened to them mainly because I'm currently on my 4th playthrough.The A.I. is also pretty spectacular, smart, and dynamic.  The weapons feel powerful and every bullet makes an impact on you and the enemies, and the combat animation is superb and packed with lots of satisfying bloodshed.The story is also interesting, flawed, but interesting and it must have taken some talent to pull the story off considering that it was trying to be a Sci-fi horror story inspired by The Ring, The Matrix, and Kung-Fu movies.  Not a mix that makes a lot of sense, but somehow comes together surprisingly well considering all of those things are from completely different planets.For 10 bucks, you get the original game and its expansions - and while ""Perseus Mandate"" is really only the quality of a fan made mod, it feels like its thrown in for free since the core game and ""Extraction Point"" are both pretty solid and will last you awhile.  And feel free to stop on by online, there's still folks playing - and its damn fun.In short, F.E.A.R. has Guns, Grenades, Ghost Girls & is Gory, Grisly, Gritty, & Grim.  Mmm, alliteration.

												One of my favorite shooters of all time, and the game that desensitized me to most horror when I was a lad, FEAR is a wonderful, if not exactly groundbreaking, thriller-esque romp.  The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay.  The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments.  There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis.  Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new.  The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart).  The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.Oh yeah, there's those.  While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind.  Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.Which is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline.  It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist.  Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome.  If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend.			",161,14,1,26,14,2,27

												Great solid F.P.S., decent length campaign and has some genuinely creepy atmosphere. Challenging too and since it doesn't have the recharging health system that so many games have now you need to actually be good at it, which is nice. Was a great game when it originally came out, still is now after all these years and I highly recommend it.Another nice thing is that it does not require a very powerful computer to run and it will work on Windows 8.1 perfectly so no compatibility issues. Controls are nice and tight too and fully rebindable. While it is older and has aged some, it still can look fairly good when the graphics settings are a maximum. Only thing is these days the MP no longer works, but the SP is more than worth it. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played.			",141,4,8,6,8,0,8

												I'll include 2 comments along with this one, each reviewing the different FEAR games.FEAR basic:50% action, 50% horror.  The game mostly deals in shock scares, some you'll miss, some will really scare the pants off of you.  The game has some of the smartest AI I've ever seen, with a game length of, oh, 12 hours or more?  I only completely beat it once, back when I had to install it using 5 seperate discs.The Slo-Mo feature isn't just a gimmick they used for this, it actually is a gameplay feature.  In some firefights it would be suicide to not use it, because the enemies react just as fast as you do, flank, throw grenades, communicate, dodge, and can wipe out large portions of your health in mere seconds.Really a great FPS, one of my all-time favorites.

												8.5/10What a wondeful experience. F.E.A.R. is a FPS shooter with twitch based and somewhat horror based shooting. Still holding up in 2017 even after 12 years on the market, the game allows for sub-linear open levels of play and freedom with shooting gameplay that would rival some of even todays standards. You play the game as a nameless soldier called 'Pointman' whose tasked with an ultimate goal of finding the games antagonist 'Paxten Fettel' and his hundreds of telepathically controlled units that he now controls (he went rogue or something.). Along the way, you will encounter the para-normal child 'Alma' who's pretty much there for no other reason than to scare/creep you out it seems. There's so much more to the story but I'll keep this spoiler free as possible. The story is fine however the way it is presented throughout using phone messages, laptop computers (against, just voice messages) and very few lines of dialoge from any NPC makes it very.. uneven. If I recall, everything except the beginning and end scenes is played from the eyes of the 'Pointman' in a first person view and certain scripted events can be missed if not in the right place/time.Gameplay is fantastic. My first playthrough was on Hard, clocking in at 12 hours with pure keyboard/mouse. The core gameplay relys on shooting, scavenging and very little else other than pushing the action key on buttons or messages. There's a couple other sections like turret control and dreams worlds but there just didn't seem enough variety of objectives. For what there was, oh man. Obviously, the main aspect is combat. Right off the bat you are introduced to Reflex (I think it's called that?) mode which slows down time and gives you an advantage over your enemies while quickly draining and slowly refilling in the background. This is probably the best looking bullet time looking effect I've seen in any video game title. The game focuses heavily on corridor shooting. Very rarely will you be in open areas but it still happens occasionally. One of my gripes with the game is that level design is.. so bland. Recalling my 12 hours after credits I can only seem to remember (truthfully); office buildings, construction sites inside office buildings, a parking garage, abandoned office buildings like places and dream world on fire hallways. And that took me a second to think about. I got the the point of getting lost a few times in the game because I couldn't tell certain rooms from rooms. And there's lot of rooms. The game is open linear structured broken into segments/levels. You'll always be exploring and going forward but get lost or a need to rebacktrack and you can actually go return to the beginning of a level. On the way, healthkits, messages, ammo/weapons and health/reflex boosters must all be found. The game is healthpack based and armor based.Enemy variety was also a disappointment. Without spoiling anything, you will fight; soldiers, turrets, flying robot things, invisible ninja soldiers, ghosts, robots and bigger robots. This sounds like a lot which it is, however 95% of the game is focused of soldier warfare and I do not recall more than 2 types of 'soldier'. The 2nd kind which is only a stronger, recolored and textured 'soldier' is found only on the last 2 chapters. What balances this (somewhat) is the fantastic AI. This is truly one of the best enemy intelligences I have seen is a game period, no exaggeration. You rarely take on less that 3 guys at once. They always work and comunicate as squads. They will flank, take cover and make cover, help/drag other comrades to safety .. just amazing work here. No battle will ever function the same and it's not just like they are aimbots or anything (far from it, just good work), they act so realisticly. Weapons are varied as well. There's a good amount of them if you go by situational standards. Dual pistols, shotgun, smg, assault rifle, battle rifle, rocket launcer and a few others I won't spoil but they are pretty cool and unique thereselves. Each gun looks and sounds amazing and each one has a specific role. Considering the Pointman can only carry 3 weapons of his choice at one time, they must be chosed wisely. Ammo is sort of scare playing on higher difficulties and I had a chance, or rather, actually had to use each weapon individually throughout the game. You also have a few types of explosives and a couple cool looking melee attacks that are easy to perform. Effects are beautiful here. Particle effects run wild with sparks bounding and flying across the environments. Smoke will fill up small corridors (literally), blood sprays and enemies lose limbs (or just explode!) in mists, fire blurs the screen from it's heat and every bit of this looks so much better in Reflex mode. The graphics hold up quite well here. Textures are still reasonable. The lighting effects manage to provide a believable atmosphere and you will be getting used to the dark. It just gets rather old seeing the same bland office buildings over and over and over. Performance wise, the game ran rather smoothly after using the 'Logitech Mouse/Keyboard fix' I found on Google. I played on Max settings, no FXAA and Soft Shadows OFF. I recieved perfect limited 60FPS on a AMD12 6Gig ram and an integrated card Laptop. The requirements are not high at all and any computer newer than 5 years old should be able to run it smoothly.  In all, F.E.A.R. is an amazing title that has survived (so far!) the test of 12 years and holds up rather well. Gameplay wise, Monolith had everything going for this game that just suffers from drab level design and lacking story that tries to be told but best left to Wikipedia after the credits. Still the coolest slow motion of any game and best AI I've yet to find, I paid $9.99US Dollars for F.E.A.R. and both it's expansion I have yet to try. Well worth my money.			",19,0,0,3,0,0,0

												Playing FEAR in 2015, this game feels like a funny mix of old and new. The level design and environmental puzzles come straight out of Half-Life, but the over-the-top shooting and meathead soldier enemies resemble Crysis or the new Wolfenstein games. Ten years on, FEAR seems like it's having an identity crisis. Of course, in 2005, it probably didn't seem so strange to mix these elements together, and thankfully, in this case, it works.It's also supposedly a ""horror"" game, though it mostly fails on this front. The plot involves secret cloning experience and it features occasional jumpscares, but the actual gameplay is all 100% classic shooter. Ever the famous ""ladder moment"" didn't make much of an impression on me; I actually don't even remember encountering it in the game.What really makes FEAR shine is the AI. Most of the battles are against enemy troopers, and the way they try to flank you and out-maneuver you is really second to none in shooter games. This is one game where the soldiers won't just run at you spraying wildly. Their hunting and survival instincts are advanced, but the player has a balancing weapon in the form of the bullet time mechanic. It's great that they decided to add that, as I think it's probably what prevents the game from getting needlessly frustrating like Far Cry 1.			",241,34,0,23,12,0,25

												F.E.A.R. is an amazing FPS game. The shooting feels tight, the slo-mo is oh-so satisfying to use, the guns feel like they have incredible punch to them, and everything gets destroyed. Just about everything in the game either has crazy physics or emits a particle effect when hit, so entire building floors become decimated as you work your way through the game. The A.I. employed by the enemies is miles above most modern FPS games. Fights end up feeling so dynamic that repeat playthroughs just to see ""what if I do this..."" are highly encouraged. Not everything is perfect; environments and enemies lack visual and mechanical variety, some of the in-game textures and artwork are clearly stuck in 2005, and I found the environments a bit confusing to navigate at times. Regardless of these complaints, F.E.A.R. is something everyone should experience at some point.			",592,113,18,86,45,5,100

												Dated graphics? Check.  Samey environments? Objectively, yes.  Scary?  Again, objective, but not really.  Saving grace?  Amazing cut throat AI that has no issue with flanking you, tossing a nade in your window, then closing in on both exits.  This game's tight CQC gameplay and creepy environments combine to form possibly, the best and most exhilirating shooting you can experience.  This game's AI is still better than almost every modern shooter's, and as such, if you haven't played it already, give it a go!			",695,197,31,84,68,8,87

												A rare FPS gem that combines a truly grim atmosphere, genuine scares, and a haunting sci-fi story packed with action. It was released back in 2005, but don't let that fool you, this is a hardcore, blood and guts CQB shooter with state of art enemy AI way ahead of it's time. It's The Matrix that meets The Grudge with a solid single-player that's endless and a multiplayer that packs a punch. F.E.A.R. is right up there with Half-Life 2 and DOOM 3, a true classic that set the bar for PC shooters.10/10			",73,0,2,0,3,0,0

												So as of writing this review, I just finished the game less than five minutes ago AND OH MY GOD. OH. MY. GOD. You would not believe what an adventure it was. If you don't want to read the full review, then, here it is. 9/10. Masterpiece in the horror genre. Masterpiece in the FPS-Action genre. The graphics are a bit outdated tho, as of 2015 but it doesn't disturb (atleast) me much, and would fall into the decade of half-life 2 graphics. So if you don't care about flexing your PC's muscles then it's no prob for you, but if you want to experience a horrifying adventure that will haunt your dreams for months after you had uninstalled it, then go. What are you waiting for!ok, now let's talk more detailly about each category.Graphics:Yes, as I said, the graphics are a bit outdated. The game was released almost ten years ago as of now, but it does not change the story and gameplay of this game. If you have a super-hyper-mega-epic gtx 970 i7 4790k build then you can play this game on 4K ultra, and get way over 200fps. If you have a less powerful build, like say a 760 with an i5 or something like that then you won't have any problems playing this game at 60+ fps either, but still i wouldn't recommend going 4K. Also, there's plenty of mods out there to fix the lighting, the reflections, etc, but I personally prefer to play the game like it is given to me (pronounce: I was too lazy to install any mods).Gameplay:I remember hearing that Valve once said, that in their Half-Life series, they value gameplay over story (even tho both are important). In my opinion this game perfectly nailed the Half-Life feel and even overdid it. As we know Half-Life was meant as a Light-Horror-Shooter-Puzzle-game. Well F.E.A.R. in our case is FULL-HORROR-Shooter-with some puzzle in it. For me personally the puzzles were not that interesting (go to the furthest away room, press a button, return to start, proceed to now opened gate), but at least they added diversity to the gameplay, different from CoD. The shooting factor in this game was really good in my opinion. If you're a beginner at shooters you'll have a fun time exploding the heads of Fettel's private army, but if you're an FPS veteran like me, you'll beat the game on extreme difficulty with just enough effort for the game to seem a little-tiny bit hard at moments. Also what I really liked was the time freeze button. Loved peeking around the corner then pressing U (I binded it to U) and shooting unsuspecting troops in the head with a plasma gun and seeing them throw their weapon away and turn into a skeleton. So satisfiying. Oh and did I tell you, you can completely remove the crosshair? Definetely gonna be a plus for those who are seeking realism in games and want to try their skill. And Lastly the spooky-spooks. When I started playing it, the last time i had played a horror game was over a year ago. It literally went like this: Walk out of the car. Go inside an abandoned building. Try open the door, it falls down. got me creeped but I kept going. Walk on the second floor, and see a cloud of smoke coming my way. BOOM. A BLOODY FACE COVERING THE WHOLE SCREEN. I ran out of the building, tried to get back in the car, closed the game, started laughing at myself, told my friends so they could laugh too, started crying, and went to get icecream. After a couple jumpscares i got used to them, but still thinking it all through keeping the lore in mind will get you pretty disturbed.And last but not least the story:Without spoiling much, you are a marine, who got sent to remove a military commander (or something) who has gone crazy, and while chasing him you start to uncover some supernatural $hit. And a girl following and jumpscaring you everywhere. Like G-MAN but creepier. Time to time she and the crazy supernatural guy talk some creepy stuff to you in between fighting hordes of soldiers. I won't go deeper into the lore, for you to still have something to discover, but the ending... Right when I had let my guard down thinking: it is finally over, but JUMPSCARE-PLOT TWIST.Anyway this game is a definite 9/10 and would have gotten better from me if I had bought it in the gold days of Half-Life 2, but i still definetely recommend you to play it.P.S. Not that I want to say something bad about our great lord and savior, Gaben, but this game (or rather the collection, because you also get two dlcs to continiue the story that you wouldn't have gotten otherwhise) rarely goes on sale and is still pretty expensive then. Call me cheeky, but in my opinion 60 bucks for 3 games and dlc is a tad too much for my wallet to afford. Grab this game during the next winter/summer sale and prepare for having an awesomly creepy and creepily awesome adventure.P.S.2 I do know I had left a whole bunch of typos and mistakes in this long-a$$ text, feel free to point them out to me and make my life easier.

												It may seem morbid but killing enemies in F.E.A.R. is remarkably gratifying and the highlight of the entire experience. This is thanks to weapons that feel and sound impactful while also being incredibly fun to use; combined with the numerous amount of visual effects, an ideal bullet time feature and a satiating gore system to provide gleeful carnage of the highest calibre. The horror elements mesh with the rest of the game quite fittingly and serve up a few intense moments. Sadly, it isn't without its faults, mowing down droves of the exact same enemy type through excruciatingly dull and repetitive environments is an effective way to deafen the positive notes of your game.As for the expansion packs, they are monotonous and unimaginative, only recommended for hard-core F.E.A.R. fans.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												11 years on and FEAR is still an infinitley replayable and deeply immersive shooter. Few franchises manage to nail their design on the first try and FEAR is among the outliers. Sadly its sequels while respectivley good and decent (FEAR 2 and FEAR 3) couldnt live up to to this spectacular first outing.Half life, Doom, Halo, FEARFEAR is the seminal PC shooter. Displaying exactly the dominance of this genre on the PC and playing to the platforms strengths.Originally released in 2005 FEAR is a looker in 2016 with a striking style that puts its most developed visual assets to the forefront. While no longer a piece of cutting edge tech FEAR displays exactly the type of strong design that will top modern efforts when given the attention it deserves.Games like this are Rare. Dont miss it.			",171,13,2,22,1,0,20

												Some years ago I saw a friend making his first steps in FEAR, now I give it a try of my own. My feelings are generally positive, though I probably should not have played all the three games in the package (the original and the two expansions) at once: when FEAR itself was over, I was excited, after finishing Extraction Point I was interested, and by the end of Perseus Mandate I was exhausted. It's my first thriller, and I'm certainly not disappointed. The expansion packs deserve separate recognition: they are quite the way such additions should be. Perseus Mandate, for example, is in fact a yet another game, as lengthy as FEAR itself, and having a slightly different approach to storyline (which is, I dare say, generally better than the original).There's mostly nothing to complain about, except for some issues with walls, doors, and other obstacles (especially corners): it's very, very annoying when you are completely covered by these, but bullets sometimes still go through and hit you. Except for that, the game gave pleasant experience.Take caution if you have weak nerves. There are rivers of blood and many fearsome visions inside the game. Even I was frightened once or twice, though I'm very resistant to such things.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												""F.E.A.R.""A review by Richard Valkinsenn.""What's the first thing you remember?""F.E.A.R. is, hands-down, one of the best single-player action experiences out there. While the game's visuals have dated horrendously, it's overall gameplay has aged incredibly well. There's a unique blend of action and horror on display in the game's narrative, balancing and often mixing both effectively and memorably. The game's action is brutal and relentless, though its frenetic, lengthy, and heavily stylized firefights are broken up by short breather sections in-between, so the action never feels tiring. It also strangely never becomes repetitive, even though you'll be seeing a lot of the same environments throughout the game. Fear is the name of the game, both literally and figuratively, and the game features high amounts of genuine creepiness before, after, and even during it's insane action sequences. In fact, the game seems to pay homage to Japanese horror with it's atmosphere and it's chief antagonist resembling Samara from ""The Ring."" And thankfully, the game's creepiness relies more on the building of atmosphere instead of cheap ""jump"" scares, though, admittedly, whatever of these scares there are in the game are very well-timed.Overall, F.E.A.R. boasts a unique blend of action and horror that combines seamlessly and effortlessly into one unique and memorable package that still delivers.Final Verdict:I (still) love it.Thank you for reading this (touched-up) review.This is Richard,Signing off.

												When F.E.A.R first launched in 2005, people were blown away with the technical level of its graphics. Unfortunately for the gamers of today, Monolith Productions forgot to implement any art style or set pieces what so ever. The most fearful thing about this game is how cold and sterile the world seems, rather than its imitation of Samara from The Ring. Thanks to said girl, the game was also commended on living up to its name, thanks to scripted sequences involving corridors of blood à la The Shining, and cheap jump scares. I’m not really sure what all the fuss was about, considering horror masterpieces Resident Evil (2002) and Silent Hills 1 (1999), 2 (2001) and 3 (2003) had long been on the market. The ‘spooky sequences’ played out as little more than a predictable ghost train, and couldn’t actually harm the player. Sure, they broke down the repetitive battles, but to any seasoned horror game fan, they felt shallow. Condemned: Criminal Origins (2005) did a far greater job of striking fear into players in a first person perspective, and using the very same engine as F.E.A.R. My other major complaint about the title is that while starting out solidly enough, the cliché story becomes vague and muddled throughout the campaign, and although their back stories are vaguely revealed, the characters entirely fail to develop.Yet despite these major flaws, I would recommend this game (or it’s first expansion pack) to fans of the FPS genera in a heartbeat, thanks to some of the best gunplay I have seen in games, even to date. Whilst the weapons might be neither realistic nor visually interesting, the kinaesthetic feedback from a firefight is uncannily satisfying. Be it a pistol, shotgun, smg or rifle, the ricochets, plaster chips and dust clouds that get kicked into the air are immensely satisfying in a way that the game’s sequels never managed to replicate. In addition to this, the enemy AI is still some of the best I have seen, so gunning down waves of clones as they squeal in fear over their radios  never out stays its welcome, despite the frequency of battles.If you enjoy shooing things from a first person perspective and have any interest in games that predate a couple of years, you owe it to yourself to play F.E.A.RSpoooookyvision out of Ten.

												First of all, I love the original F.E.A.R. game. I just finished it for the second time and it was still worth the time. However, the Extraction Point expansion was very disappointing. On one computer it kept crashing every two minutes, and on another it didn't crash but slowed down until it was unplayable. I finished the game, but it took me twice as long as it should have because it is so buggy. However, I wouldn't recommend Extraction Point even if it had worked properly. I found it repetitive and boring, and at times plain silly compared to the original game. I had the same problems with Perseus Mandate on one computer, but on another it works just fine and seems to be more enjoyable than Extraction Point.			",99,23,0,9,4,0,7

Whilst the weapons might be neither realistic nor visually interesting, the kinaesthetic feedback from a firefight is uncannily satisfying. Be it a pistol, shotgun, smg or rifle, the ricochets, plaster chips and dust clouds that get kicked into the air are immensely satisfying in a way that the game’s sequels never managed to replicate. In addition to this, the enemy AI is still some of the best I have seen, so gunning down waves of clones as they squeal in fear over their radios  never out stays its welcome, despite the frequency of battles.If you enjoy shooing things from a first person perspective and have any interest in games that predate a couple of years, you owe it to yourself to play F.E.A.RSpoooookyvision out of Ten.

												This game was alright, for it being as old as it is. It wasn't scary, not in the slightest. The short synopsis for this is that the iconic little girl, Alma, was tested on. She had powers that others wanted. She died, I guess? She was put into a coma, impregnanted, and forced into labor. Until she died at 8 years old after her captors ( and father?) pulled the plug. Now she wants revenge? That is what I made of it anyway. There were a few glitches I encountered along the way. Falling off the world was one, and loss of all weapons is another. Cheats are useful, for when these events happen. I myself used two.  Godmode, which proved semi-useful, and kfa (restores all ammo and health). For the many times a glitch caused me to start over. Apparently, from my research, this game is the best in the series. Although the DLC is non-canon. Made by another company. I am yet to try PMandate and Extraction point out. My over all time for completion of this game ( including DLC) was a little over 16 hours.			",134,26,2,18,3,0,2

												For a FPS made in 2005, this game beats the majority FPS games out there today!The mechanics are extraordinary and you'll feel like a pro with the 'bullet-time' feature like in Max Payne.The horror genre to this is quite spooky, but for those who know the difference between a 'scary' game and a horror game, this is not the type of game that will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants all the time. It's got a very eerie feeling to it and you're just on the edge of your seat the whole time. I'll admit, there is alot of jump scares but not that big that you will♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, you'll just get a fright, that's all.If you want to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... go play Outlast. But if you want a great FPS shooter with the horror genre, then F.E.A.R is the game for you. ",209,20,6,9,4,1,2

												I use to get scared when the first trailer came out, I think it was the one with ""what is fear...fear is a basic human emotion...."". Yeah had chills and then saw this guy on youtube named Steve and he played this game in the dark alone in his room recording himself of his reactions (first time playing it). Wow lol that was funny as heck and this is was back in 2005-2006. Good ol' days.......Yeah this game is great but when you look at it now the visual quality isn't great, too grainy pixels (well duh compared to now).  the part near the top floor and those monsters that goes in the ceiling office tops, scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me and Alma appearing out of nowhere (usually behind you all the time, it only spawns in your field of view for game script).Yeah old game classic, you'll get a kick out of it.....

												good horror experience,however it falls into the same trap as every horror game ever in that the pattern the scares happen become too obvious and you can predict when the next scare session will be..ruining much of the atmosphereexample: in the ATC (not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ band i mean Amacham xD) HQ you fight through waves of soldier,then scares,then when there are no scares for a while,more soldiers,and when there are no soldiers after a while the scares begin againimo this is heavily predictable and after a while i just didn't feel as scared as i was in the first 4-5 hours of the game and the end of the game was just me wanting to finish the story so that i actually completed the game because i didn't do it anymore for the scaresall in all,it's still a good horror game down the line it became less but still reasonable,soundtrack is good for the atmosphere,and the FPS sections (while no iron sights but that is more of a personal preference than anything else xD) are good and satisfying(the nail gun is an example)			",160,30,0,30,16,3,23

												F.E.A.R. ~ An almost forgotten relic from 2005. If you managed to find this game because of curiosity, a recommendation from a friend, you're an old FPS die hard fan, or some other reason, this game may leave you satisfied. The major strengths of F.E.A.R. consist of a suitable soundtrack in which the music matches with its appropriate scene. If you are isolated and cannot predict what is around a corner, there will be suspenseful music. Otherwise, a fierce firefight will make your blood pump faster and the music won't disappoint.  The A.I. for the enemies, specifically the Replica forces, will not bore you. They are unpredicatable and vicious for they only serve to complete the main antagonist of the game. In other words, the movement of the Replicas are well coordinated and they tend to flank. In harder difficulties, their attacks are more devastating thus forcing you to avoid confronting more than a couple of these soldiers. Each Replica unit is unique and I find most of their voices, interactions with their squad and the given environment, and the way they assess threats very realistic. There are a ton of weapons , ranging from the usualy pistol and shotgun, to a futuristic particle weapon that can sear the flesh off a living being. Thanks to ""Slow-mo', the one ability in this game that makes a difference, F.E.A.R. allows you to see your inflicted destruction on targets in a ""beautiful"" way. This is what gives you the ultimate power over your enemies. Although I do like this game, its existence is not without cons unfortunately. F.E.A.R. was heavily focused on action and left other parts of the game underdevelopd. The plot is scarcely detailed and relies too much on listening to mundane laptops , voice mails, and some news reports. These are easily skipped and it's a waste of time to listen to them. Overall, most of the characters are forgettable and they don't have that much interaction with each other.  Some of the transitions between suspense, horror, and action seem quite ""choppy"". In greater detail, if you leave an area after a fight, you're almost immediately pulled into a terrifying scene. This will make a lot of players more confused than scared. As for the expansion packs, they are acceptable to play. Be warned though, that Extraction Point is more horror oriented, has more jumpscares, and the plot is even thinner. After playing it for a while, you will lose your interest if you favor action. On the other hand, Perseus Mandate seems like a ripoff of F.E.A.R. and its aforementioned expansion pack. There may be some new enemies, weapons, and 3 ""bonus missions"" that can test your skill but this game will leave you more upset if you're a loyal fan. In my case, the most hated part of the game for me was the music. It was good but it's not sutiable for a F.E.A.R. game! Despite the criticism, I do recommend F.E.A.R. if you like to possess ""slow-mo"" and mow down enemies with any newly obtained gun. So far, the action is what keeps me playing F.E.A.R. every once in a while.			",112,9,1,12,6,1,8

												I remember when I first bought this game at Best Buy. I rushed back to my college dorm to play it and proceeded to freak out to the edge-of-your-seat gameplay and creepy atmosphere. This was before I knew about Steam. I was not able to buy physical copies of the DLC and I was really bummed about that...until I saw they were included with F.E.A.R on Steam! I paid full price for F.E.A.R just so I could get those DLC and I am glad that I did. F.E.A.R. came out in 2005, and it really has aged. However, the gameplay and the story more than make up for the older graphics. The combat is intense, forcing you to fight through tons of soldiers by yourself in order to reach your target. The AI can be pretty annoying sometime since they can figure your tactics, and also freak out when they have realized you took out an entire squad. There is strong language throughout the game. The gore can be intense. Carnage and blood is everywhere and not just from bullets. After the firefights, Alma shows up.The story that surrounds Alma is the reason I recommend this game. This is what I feel sets this game apart from all other FPS's. You have military combat gameplay team up with a seriously creepy and supernatural storyline. It's a terrifying combination. She may be inspired by The Ring and countless other scary movies with little girls with black hair, but she is so original, you won't have any trouble singling her out as one of the scariest forces in video games. FEAR ALMA.Now for the DLC. They are not necessary but they are fun to play. Both are similar in length. Each one took me six hours to complete. They are not considered canon but you do learn some interesting things about the Perseus Project and Armacham.This was a great game to play and it got my psyched for the sequel, Thought I have not played an extensive list of FPS's, I believe that this one stands apart for merging a military FPS with psychological horror.

												I'm only 10 minutes into the game but I already know this is a gem. I don't play horror games in which you have weapons, mainly because I always go through them in berserk mode, laughing as I blow up every monsters head. You know when a horror game is doing it right when even though you are used to horror games, you get scared by your own shadow.This game is well designed, has nice graphics for its time, and the sound design is great too. It's on sale at the moment, very worth it if youre into that kind of experience.			",125,36,0,28,5,1,12

												If you're looking for cheap jump scares, FEAR is not the game for you.  Throughout the game, I can safely say I only jumped once or twice.  Where FEAR really delivers, however, is its tense atmosphere that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout most of the game.  The dripping of blood and the unnaturally loud noise of knocking something over makes you want to slow down and peek around the corner to make sure Alma isn't waiting.  Which she often is.  The enemies are pretty repetitive, and there are only about five or six variations throughout the story.  The reflex ability partially alleviates this, making the fights far more interesting.  The low price makes it a great deal, especially if you can find it discounted.			",56,8,0,8,2,0,3

												Satisfying gunplay: The Game.    Spooks are not spooky enough anymore (probably because they warn you about them for some reason).    Locations design so uninspired that you always going to be saying to yourself: ""Hey! I've already been in the identical room, like 15 minutes ago.""   Story is completely trivial. And it's good that the game is aware of this, It doesn't try to stop action for a long time.    AI is as good as everyone claimed it to be. They rarely act moronic, they flank, a lot. They ambush when they outnumbered. They won't go to the room when there is clearly someone with shotgun around the corner waiting for them, they act like real people, and this is ironic considering that most of them are mindless clones without any free will, controlled by someone else.    I think the most disappointing part of this game is that there are only two encounters with ninja assassins, they were the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Enjoying the game so far, I recommend to anyone.Edit (2.4hours in):Love it! Took me a while to learn the mechanics, since I play alot of CSGO and the feel is much different, but toning down my sensitivity and DPI settings improved my aim and my movement in the game, this feels really fluid, the game itself is great also! Highly suggest this to anyone!Edit (10 hours in):Completed the game, DEFINETLY WORTH THE MONEY, amazing game! Incredible story-line, I give this 2 thumbs up. TL;DR: Good ambiance, good story, good mechanics, scary, challenging, will recommend to any FPS/Horror fan!			",56,8,1,1,1,0,2

												This game has a scare aspect that you don't normally see these days in modern games, walking down a dark hallway and suddenly your flashlight runs out and a jumpscare happens.

												Ever wanted to star in your own John Woo movie? F.E.A.R sets the bar unbelievably high when it comes to enemy intelligence and cinematic action. When you aren't gunning down squads of heavily-armed super soldiers using your super-human reflexes, you'll be peeking around every corner in anticipation of the next scare. Even though the protagonist is armed, F.E.A.R manages to make the player feel vulnerable to the paranormal activity that shadows the already tense gameplay. Bullet-Time, Kung Fu, Ninjas and Robots all star in this action blockbuster and create an experience I personally haven't felt since Half-Life 1.			",217,37,1,39,9,1,17

												Compared to games of today, the scare tactics this game use are very outdated and I really can't recommend this as an horror game, unless you just started playing horror games. But as an action game with horror themes is honestly, still excellent. The gunplay is great, the AI and the effects makes the combat very visceral. This great quality varies from game to expansion pack to great to excellent.The MP doesn't work anymore, but if you are searching for Quality Single Player FPS where combat is central, and just KING, get this game. Highly recommended if you just completed Bethesda's Wolfensteins and want more.You can make your 360 controller work on this, but is hard to configure, somehow possible but limited.

There's no story here (or maybe I didn't play long enough to get to a story?), and there's nothing scary, which is odd for a game called F.E.A.R.  Basically it's an urban combat shooter. run from room to room, area to area, shooting soldiers.Buy it on sale, by all means, but I woulldn't pay full price for it.  It's just okay.Updated:So I've played it a bit longer now and am liking it more.			",224,183,2,35,42,2,18

												Fear was the system hog of its time. It was also touted as one of the best FPS titles of its time. Does it hold up to both those titles today.Well, yes and no. Yes it's one of the best FPS titles of its time (and still an impressive shooter nowadays), no it's no longer a system hog. Let's look deeper into that.FEAR puts you in control of Point Man, the newest member of a government team meant to combat paranormal threats. You're sent out to stop a crazed cannibalistic solider who's taken telepathic command of an army of clone soldiers. Meanwhile, there's this creepy girl stalking you through the whole thing and making people explode into meat splatters with her telepathic abilities. The whole game is pretty much you tracking down the cannibal freak, killing clone soldiers, investigating the situation's backstory, and discovering all the dirty little secrets. It's a mildly intriguing story, but i'll admit it's never really hooked me. The gameplay on the other hand...Woo boy. This game has some of the best shooting i've ever come across, even by today's standards. If you've ever watched a John Woo film, you know what you're gonna get here. the gunfights here are cinematic, frenetic, fast-paced encounters where bullets tear chunks out of concrete, glass windows are shattered, bodies fly around like ragdolls, blood splatters, smoke emanates from gun barrels, dust clouds your vision, and furniture is obliterated. Despite the near complete lack of enemy variety (they're all literally clones), the action never gets old. All this is made even better by the smart enemy AI. Clones pin you down, shout orders to their squad mates, flank you while the others keep you in cover with gunfire, throw grenades your way, jump over ledges to avoid your bullets, run away from your grenades, take defensive positions, crawl under tables for cover, notice your flashlight, and even hear your footsteps if you don't crouch. The AI here was ahead of its time and still impresses today. The game's also pretty scary and atmospheric too. I wouldn't call it terrifyin, but I will say it managed to give me the chills and jolt me many, many times. Disturbing hallucinations, that creepy ghost girl stalking you, chilling music, and things moving on their own all work together to unsettle you whenever you're not locked in a fierce firefight with enemies.Like I said though, the graphics have already been eclipsed tons of times in the years following this game's release. It simply isn't all that demanding anymore. On a mid-range laptop, you can easily run it at max settings with 60 frames per seconds. The visuals themselves are very sharp at max settings, but not exactly impressive. Textures are... all right. Water effects are fairly basic. The two places the graphics are still fairly impressive are in the lighting effects and, especially, the particles. Remember what I said about how the environments just come apart when you're in gunfights? Yeah, the particle effects actually add to the gameplay here and turning them down deals a serious blow to the enjoyment in my opinion.Overall: recommended. It's a solid, exciting shooter worth your time and money. Not for the graphics enthusiasts (though the game isn't what you'd call ugly), but definitely for shooter fans and anyone who wants to see some terrific AI at work. Pros: Frenetic, intense, satisying combatImpressively smart AIGreat music and sound effectsGenuinely chillingNot hard to run nowadaysCons:Visuals aren't all that impressive anymore ",125,6,0,1,3,0,0

Bullet-Time, Kung Fu, Ninjas and Robots all star in this action blockbuster and create an experience I personally haven't felt since Half-Life 1.			",217,37,1,39,9,1,17

												Without any doubt one of the best Fps´s ever made, people talk about Half Life or Bioshock and often forget about this one. And why you ask?Great graphics for a game that was released in 2005 that still look gorgeous today with great dynamic light, something that even today some games struggle to do well. Very good gameplay with maybe the best Bullet Time system(apart from Max Payne) ever done, and great A.I making the battles between enemies very intense and challenging. A very well executed story without too many cutscenes, that keeps you interested until the end, and a somewhat a good level design that can be sometimes a little bit repetitive because it seems you´re always stuck in the same place. Very good game overall. This is how FPS´s should have evolved.			",338,93,6,37,21,2,39

												FEAR is like the Breaking Bad of first person shooters. Yeah, it's great. Now shut the hell up about it. Gamers seem to forget that the title was blasted upon release for its repetitive environments... but only by journalists. Yes, contrarian clickbaiting-- posting negative reviews to appear edgy and increase site traffic-- has been around since AOL, and those rags had some pathetically fanatical followings too. The only positive outcome of this is when I finally got around to playing it a year or so later my expectations were low enough that I was very pleasantly surprised-- mostly in the story department. I love horror, and FEAR is a very scary game, a strange fusion of action and terror that somehow manages to mesh perfectly. Not surprising, seeing as Monolith are legends of the FPS genre, up there with Raven and Id. These are the guys that made Blood, NOLF, Shogo, Condemned and other envelope-pushing titles before gaming was taken over by suits and ties.So what is FEAR? It's a highly atmospheric shooter with fun guns and a fluidly reactive melee system. It's lauded as having some of the best enemy AI ever, though I've never really noticed because I've usually wiped out everyone in the room before they have a chance to do anything ""artificially intelligent"". This was one of the first (not THE first) shooters to implement slow-mo bullet-time, which you can upgrade throughout the game (along with health) if you have sharp eyes and a knack for exploration. It's highly satisfying, gruesome, and gives you an opportunity to admire the gorgeous particle effects. The campaign segways back and forth throughout its runtime with frantic bouts of action interspersed with sections of unnerving silence and exploration. Many have criticized the story and horror elements as distracting to the action-- ""I just wish the game would stop trying to be scary so I can get back to killing stuff in slo-mo"". These people were probably potential school shooters at some point, so their opinions can safely be discarded.FEAR has one of the best horror atmospheres ever, if only for it's minimalism. Because the story starts at dusk and carries on deep into the night, and because you are spending most of the time in empty office buildings, abandoned tenements and construction sites, there is a deliciously unnerving silence inundating most of the game. FEAR is actually one of the quietest games I've ever played, which you wouldn't expect-- the combat is over so quickly, the music so restrained, that this is hands down the best ""after-hours"" game I've ever experienced. What I mean is there is a sense of being in a place you're not supposed to be, a place that is a bustling center of human activity during the day, but because it's the middle of the night, and everyone has gone home (or is dead), and all that's left is the dim glow of overhead fluorescent lights and the pitch black corners they fail to illuminate, there is the uneasy sensation of being an invisible trespasser. It creates a potent feeling of loneliness, accentuated by the subtle, throbbing soundtrack, with only the occasional friendly radio update or enemy chit-chat to break the silence. This makes the jump-scares (and they are good jump-scares) all the more effective. Once, a stealthy ATC grunt gave away his position to me because he knocked over a bottle of pills.The story is also quite minimal, needling it's way into your subconscious through a combination of exposition in the form of radio updates, computer laptops, and answering machines (whose red lights blink invitingly in the darkness) giving you tiny bits of insight into the lives of the people who use them. There are also some very creepy ""hallucinations"" that add to the mystery, and as long as you are paying attention, all the pieces will fall into place by the ending of the game, and what a shocking ending it is.Oh, and you can LEAN.There is plenty to nit-pick here, but just to thumb my nose at the wannabe-journalists who knocked the game a decade ago I'll keep it brief. There is a fat, out of place comic-relief character. There is very little on-screen indication of damage, with your HUD being so tiny as to be practically invisible on higher resolutions. This means it's very easy to go from full health to dead before you know who's shooting you or before you can smash the Z key with your pinkie to use a health pack. The OP shotgun is considered one of the best weapons ever by FEAR fans, and it is indeed fun to use, but it's still OP. Pointman only has to rack three shells in a row to reload the 12 round chamber. Also, you can carry, like, a gajillion shells, which makes no sense. (I prefer the dual pistols myself.) Some of the reload animations and weapon models are a little lazy. There is a very annoying ""drone"" enemy that thankfully only makes two appearances in the entire game. Also, for all the love the melee system gets, I only found myself using it maybe half a dozen times throughout my last play through. It's just easier to blow everyone away. Which is fine, to each their own, but don't go off criticizing the sequels for not replicating the system to a fault just because the developers wanted more shooting and less fighting.A definite must for shooter and horror fans. The sequels are good too, but none of them ever did it quite like FEAR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine yourself as an elite soldier being chased by a ruthless and cannibalistic psychic and his army of cloned super soldiers, and an eight-year-old girl who constantly taunts you with visions and hallucinations who is also able to literally obliterate groups of enemies in seconds; that is F.E.A.R.. The atmosphere in this game is absolutely terrifying; dark, gloomy, flickering lights and eerie whispers coming from behind every door and corner you approach. To top it all off, the creepy visions depicting a demonic little girl will give anyone chills. On the other side of things, the creepy atmosphere comes well complimented by a very interesting approach to the shooter-type game. With a myriad of weapons and countless enemies to blow to pieces, and the unique Slo-mo feature, this game blends violence and terror phenomenally, and sometimes both are present simultaneously. My only criticism of the game is it's graphics as it appears quite dated compared to games from its time. Nevertheless, a gripping plot, creepy gameplay and seemingly unstoppable antagonists rounds out one great horror/shooter. 8.5/10.			",72,3,5,7,9,0,4

												I have not played a huge amount of FEAR yet, but I have done some research and feel I need to make something clear for buyers of this gameThis is not a horror-combat game, this is a game where you kill lots and lots of soldiers and every thirty minutes something mildly scary happens and then you go back to killing soldiers for another 30 minutes or so. The only fear in F.E.A.R are badly made, cheap jumpscares that would only ""Terrify"" someone who has never played a horror game before, I mean, if youve ever run away from a wasp, you have experienced more horror than fear offers. I am not trying to diss the game here, but I will say that the fear community manages to be more ""Fanatical"" than the mind controlled soldiers that are at the center of this game. I started with fear three, barely a horror game, and was told ""Nah, man, fear 1 is the scary one"" So i tried it.The honest to god truth is, when this game came out, it probably was pretty scary to those who played it, especially as kids. The honest to god truth is that this original fear game will at best make you jump one time. Even the few jumpscares are badly made, and can be seen coming from around corners, as in, you see the static monster or person and then shoot at it, nothing happens, you realize its for a cutscene, and have to stroll into its ""Grab range"" to initiate the cutscene. At the end of the day, a  fanatical fear fan (Not all are this bad) will tell you the series is super horror, some kind of amazing entity that pulls off horror in ways no other game has. This is complete crap, this is a good first person shooter with a horror themed story, max payne style bullet time (Why is that in a horror game anyway?) and most of the game comprises you moving through tunnels, offices, and ships to find a cutscene thats supposed to be scary then repeat. You will not fight many, if any, monsters. Do not buy this game expecting it to live up to its name, it simply does not. Call me desensitized, but even as a kid in 2005 I dont think this would have scared me, and it defenitely doesnt today. Again, this is not meant to bash fear, this is meant to cut through all the crap put out by the fanatics that put this rather typical FPS game onto a pedestal along with other horror icons like silent hill, and the simple fact is this game doesnt even hold a candle to great horror games. A good shooter, horror story, and that's the package, end of story. Buy for nostalgia, buy for a good shooter, do not buy for killing paranormal monsters or being scared, simply doesnt happen.

												F.E.A.R is a AMAZING game that everyone who loves FPS and horror games should play. It has some very neat and fun to use weapons(including the pistol), an amazing story, epic battles, great creepy atmosphere,very inteligent A.I. for the enemies, and a  great melee system. My only complains is that the mutiplayer dosent work but is fixed with Fear Combat. Another issue is that even though it has great atmosphere and very effective soundtrack, the actual horror can sometimes not be scary and some of the horror gags get really old. Its hard to tell which horror element can kill you and they are scripted so if you miss them, you miss them. But this is made up by the game`s DLC Extraction Point. Overall I really recomend this game but i have to warn you to check your specs and the forum to help run this game as it will drop frames at startup.			",23,0,0,4,1,0,1

												I must say, F.E.A.R. is one of *THE BEST* shooter/horror games I have ever played. The AI is absolutely phenomenal, they're actually dynamic to what you and what each other do The gun-play is pretty good, but the best thing about it is the story line. I feel so bad about Alma, and scared completely crapless by her as well. PLAY IT. PLAY IT SO HARD. Even though I'm completely scared to near insanity at the end of the game, I can't help but pity her. The intensity of the game gradually grows and grows as the game progresses. Sadly enough, the sequels couldn't follow suit with what this game started, but this game? PLAY IT.			",132,25,1,19,10,1,12

												So just a few things to point out.This game in my opinion is not a horror title, but just very bizarre and surreal at points. The level design and pacing follows a cycle of fighting and bizarre story elements. It repeats this cycle as well.The weapons are nothing really to boast about, as they're quite generic and uninteresting design-wise. Bullet time however seems to balance this factor out and make fights interesting. Mind you, this game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around with difficulty, as weapons HURT and a horde of enemies will kill you fast if you're not paying attention. Some parts can be exceptionally difficult first playthrough, but you can overcome it if you figure out what you're doing.Graphics-wise, this game has not aged well at all. The texturework and models look extremely bland nowadays, and the lighting is nothing to brag about either. As for environments? They're pretty nice, so I can't complain.One of the things about this game that is really good is that it approaches a situation differently than most linear FPS titles. A conflict will most likely not be like the last, and that's enough to keep me hooked.Pick this up when it's on sale or if you wanna have a good time, I recommend it.			",196,16,10,10,13,1,7

												Despite it being a 10 years old, it definitely still holds up today, despite the multiplayer no longer being available, the singleplayer is worth it. I recently bought this so im new to the franchise, but I can say it's definitely worth your time. You may be loaded up with guns and ammo the whole game, and you're pretty much fighting the same enemies over and over, the horror parts give you a nice taste of variety right when you need a break from the fire fights, and the icon of the series, Alma, definitely lives up to the role. It's definitely worth your attention atleast.			",39,2,0,5,2,0,0

												Welcome to the last FPS that ever tried. F.E.A.R. is a highly atmospheric shooter that does not forget that it is indeed a shooter. The AI is terriffic, the story has to be found, rather than beating you over the head with it, and there's some spooky scary ghosts! So yeah, Dynamic lighting that reacts to player input, Dynamic AI that makes today's look outdated by comparison, So so gore effects, Fantastic kung fu action, F.E.A.R. in a single game tries harder than the entire mass effect, assassins creed, Call of Duty and battlefield series (since bad company) combined. And it really shows. What you have here is just a fantastic game.I highly recommend this shooter as it is in my opinion when non-arena modern PC shooters peaked.			",172,7,24,7,6,1,1

It has some very neat and fun to use weapons(including the pistol), an amazing story, epic battles, great creepy atmosphere,very inteligent A.I. for the enemies, and a  great melee system. My only complains is that the mutiplayer dosent work but is fixed with Fear Combat. Another issue is that even though it has great atmosphere and very effective soundtrack, the actual horror can sometimes not be scary and some of the horror gags get really old. Its hard to tell which horror element can kill you and they are scripted so if you miss them, you miss them. But this is made up by the game`s DLC Extraction Point.

												F.E.A.R is a couple levels below Half-Life and other shooter classics, but not by much. It's a fantastic old-ish shooter that really deserves some praise.+Horror Elements: Although extremely light, the horror-themed plot is a great departure from the generic ""americans shooting terrorists"" shooter formula.+ Brutal Gunplay: Imagine the lobby scene from The Matrix. There's dust everywhere, shells falling all over the floor, massive holes in the walls, sparks, fire... There's also slowmotion. Best part of the game.+ Nice Graphics: Despite being old, and looking old in a lot of places, most of the game still looks great. Nice lighting, mostly.+ Artificial Intelligence: The enemies take cover properly, they try to flank you, they are very accurate and if you camp they are very good at throwing grenades. Not the usual dumbarse bots.- Repetitive Gameplay: Mostly due to lack of combat and level variety. You just shoot people in abandoned buildings. The combat is still fantastic, but repetitive. Be warned.You like shooters? A decent plot? Some horror? Get this game. It still holds up really well. Looks great, plays great. It's the lobby scene from The Matrix for ~7 hours, what's not to like?Simolius - December 2016			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite it being a 10 years old, it definitely still holds up today, despite the multiplayer no longer being available, the singleplayer is worth it. I recently bought this so im new to the franchise, but I can say it's definitely worth your time. You may be loaded up with guns and ammo the whole game, and you're pretty much fighting the same enemies over and over, the horror parts give you a nice taste of variety right when you need a break from the fire fights, and the icon of the series, Alma, definitely lives up to the role. It's definitely worth your attention atleast.			",39,2,0,5,2,0,0

												With this going on sale over the steam market recently I thought back to how awesome this game is. There are a few major aspects that makes this game a most buy and most play. 1. The AI in the entire F.E.A.R series is by far smarter than your typical AI. They try and think of ways to out smart you and communicate with one another.... leading to actions such as flanking you. 2. The environment was very well designed, lighting fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the use of gore throughout the world will never let you down. 3. The storyline was well written and thought out4. They did a very good job with the paranormal factor and leading Alma freak you on many different occasions, keep your eyes open and make sure your checking those corners.			",148,10,3,14,8,1,13

												This game is really cool and awesome. The story line is MEH but everthing else is amazing. My favourite thing about this game is the physics engine. It is a really good and a suprisingly realistic physics engine even to this date. I am not sure if this game is meant to be scary but it is not, the semi ""horror"" element to this game is really stupid and almost wrecks the game for me. Overall F.E.A.R. is a awesome game 8.5/10.			",97,7,2,7,12,1,5

												A quick review for those on the fence.F.E.A.R. is not the best FPS - it doesn't try to be. The story line is minimal and the characters are not going to be developed. However, this is a fun little shooter with a slight horror twist. If you don't mind a few jump scares with your FPS, this is the game for you. The AI is not the best but I have seen worse. They are tolerable for what the game is trying to achieve. The weapons are nothing special and the controls are simple enough. If you have never played a FPS or a FPS on PC, this game is a great little introduction to that. All in all, if you are looking for some time to kill on a budget, the FEAR series is worth it. Buy this on special - you may even be able to get the trilogy with DLC for cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R really seems to have with stood the test of time. IMO graphics still seem to hold up and dificulty curve on moderate seems about right for someone that doesnt play many FPS. There were some difficult bits, but not to the level of fraustration. At the end of the game I found bit genuinly scaryMy one gripe is that the mix between horror and FPS seems a bit disjointed, it was almost like 2 different games with noticable switching between the 2.If you are into FPS with a bit of horror, this is definitly a good pick, but if you want all out horror, I would go elsewhere.

												Impact and savagery are likely the two best words to describe FEAR. In a game where it's entirely possible to turn an enemy into a fine mist of blood with just your shotgun, it's pretty apt to say that FEAR operates primarily on extreme violence, and a John Woo aesthetic of the beautiful ballet of destruction.Normally most people dig into FEAR's psychological horror diggings, but I'm going to come right out and say it, they've aged terribly, the horror aspect of this game is cliched at best and utterly ineffective at worst, besides the occasional jump scare, not much will get your booty juices flowing with adrenaline like Silent Hill or Amnesia could. The story is stupid and ends disappointingly.However, that just so much more cements the pure joy of what FEAR does right, and that's ball-busting, heavy, loud firefights. Everything from the way bullets tear through the air during slo-mo, enemies flail in reaction to being shot while still pouring out bullets as they spaz out, the crunchy, distorted screams and radio communications of the replicants, heft, heft, heft.There are very few shooters that produce such a feeling of pure power in its mechanics, even disruptive mechanics like recoil, and your aim being offset when you're hit, manage to make to make the moment to moment gunplay feel more intense and reactive, fantastic particle effects, including gigantic dust clouds that obscure your vision, sparks and gibs and so on and so forth, create a tangible response by almost everything that can be touched by a bullet.The guns are loud as all hell, and the shotgun is of particular note, capable of bisecting enemies after roaring out like a sumbetch, and it can kill enemies decently at moderate range as well, which is a god-send. Everything from the SMG to the fantastically punchy dual-wield pistols (and thank God for FEAR's pistols, they're incredibly powerful, unfortunately ammo is rather limited) all feel quite potent.Heck, instead of a dull old sniper rifle you have a particle rifle that literally turns enemies into a liquified pile of goop with only a smoky skeleton left behind. It's great.There are very few games that rival FEAR when it comes to doing slo-mo properly, a lot of it comes down to the great graphical effects and distortions during its activation, but the very slight delay, which would be clunky in any other game, done worse, to your actions seem to deliver a little drip-feed of delayed satisfaction. That half-second between you clicking and your shotgun pulverizing an enemy into utter nothingness is absolutely magnificent.Unfortunately, any shooter becomes repetitive if it wears out its welcome long enough, and despite FEAR's phenomenal AI (imagine the aggressive, flanking grunts from Half-Life, except even better) its length is just a tad too long for something with such a small enemy variety. At about 7 hours if you really hoof it your first time, there's only so much you can get out of shooting replicants, nuggets in heavy armor, and mini-mechs, and the fact that you have to drudge through dull horror segues inbetween doesn't help.There are a few aggravating things as well, it's always balls when you come out of a fight with a smidgen of health, only for the last enemy to spray you in the face with a headshot as he tumbles to the ground, the med-kit management doesn't add much to the game, and on moderate difficulty, there's little reason to use grenades or proximity mines outside of fighting the heavier enemies. Judicious use of slo-mo and shotgun blasts to the face tend to work just fine for the other encounters.You have a mid-air kick, but it seems to be of little use for the most part, besides booting the face of the rare mook who surprises you between reloads.Thankfully, FEAR has instant action missions that are essentially plotless little arenas that allow you to enjoy the combat as much as you want, and FEAR's combat more than enough makes it worth playing.I highly recommend you check this out, despite its old age, it's an amazing example of how to do combat right in shooters, IMPACT. IMPACT!THIS GAME WILL IMPACT YOUR BUMHOLE FOR GOD'S SAKE.			",182,32,4,44,25,1,60

That's something I don't like about Perseus Mandate.Still, though F.E.A.R. is the first and oldest game in the series, F.E.A.R. is still the best of the games.Also F.E.A.R. is the first of a very few games that can actually make me feel chills or jump from the jumpscares.

Pity the poor girl, until she liquefies some soldiers alive. And how the hell does that fat Norton Mapes survive EVERYTHING?! It boggles the mind. Good story overall, but when you find yourself taking breaks in the game just because you are afraid to see what comes next, it's time to reconsider how often you should play, if at all.8.6/10			",40,1,1,1,2,1,0

												Albeit it's little on the short side, the action in this game holds up incredibly well. The game never takes away control from you and it moves fast. The horror elements on the other hand have not aged quite as well, and the scary bits ofthen come off as something of an afterthought. A few worse sequences (namely fighting turrets) are still worth suffering through to experience all of F.E.A.R. in 2015. The game also fully supports the ultrawide aspect ratio, which is a good deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is still one of the best I have ever played. If you're not good with horror, it's obviously not something I can recommend whatsoever. However, if you play this game for the first time, try to immerse yourself, and you'll hopefully be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I sure was, the first time at least.Considering the time it was made, it has held up very well in all aspects, except for visually, but it is generally only noticeable in cutscenes.The shooting in this game is very solid, with a few very entertaining weapons, and quite decent expansion packs even. From what I've seen of others playing it, if you have no sense of direction, you will get lost as there is no map or anything obvious pointing you in the right direction. But generally, if nothing has happened or a while, you're probably not going the right way, as F.E.A.R. has minor things happening constantly to keep you alert and informed that you're going the right way.I'm having a hard time to say anything bad about this game, that's how good it is. But, if you're going into F.E.A.R. expecting a horror masterpiece, sure it's better than the later installments, you will probably not be too impressed. F.E.A.R.  is a very solid first person shooter, with a horror setting, not a horror game with FPS elements.			",167,23,2,13,7,0,9

												Let me start off by saying I passed on this game years ago due to fact that I do not like scary games. That was a mistake.Fear is a really well put together FPS with 15 percent horror. It trys to scare you in places. Most of the time it does not work, but it adds to the overall game experience. The story is a bit all over the place but it is differnt in a good way. I find my self looking for recorded phone messages in the game to find out more. The shooting is fantastic and the enemy AI is very smart. Instead of waiting for you to make a move the AI will try to flank you or lock down a hallway. The lighting in this game really sells it. It adds a spooky feeling and makes for a better game. The sound and music is amazing. This game is really good at creating a mood and keeping you on the egde of your seat. That being said there are some down points. To often did I find myself overflowing with health kits or having none. There wasnt an even flow. The game had 2 modes. Its like heres story time now heres action time. They dont meld together very often. The game also uses set pieces. IE a character looking at you through a window. But a lot of the time I wasnt looking at that window. So i missed it only to know I missed it because of a music cue. Overall this game is a jem in the sea of FPS! Very differnt and very refreshing. I recommend you pick it up.8/10 ",217,34,5,6,15,5,17

												Great weapons and satisfying combat prevail over a story you never care about or fully understand. The game's sad attepts to be scary all fall flat on their face and the last levels are about as fun as getting a transorbital lobotomy, but it still delivers around 8 hours of solid and mostly fun gameplay.Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate expansions greatly improve the hallucination sequences and the creepy atmosphere overall while achieving a much more engaging plot, even if it is somewhat simple.7/10			",333,113,13,20,21,4,33

												This game is still one of the best I have ever played. If you're not good with horror, it's obviously not something I can recommend whatsoever. However, if you play this game for the first time, try to immerse yourself, and you'll hopefully be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I sure was, the first time at least.Considering the time it was made, it has held up very well in all aspects, except for visually, but it is generally only noticeable in cutscenes.The shooting in this game is very solid, with a few very entertaining weapons, and quite decent expansion packs even. From what I've seen of others playing it, if you have no sense of direction, you will get lost as there is no map or anything obvious pointing you in the right direction. But generally, if nothing has happened or a while, you're probably not going the right way, as F.E.A.R. has minor things happening constantly to keep you alert and informed that you're going the right way.I'm having a hard time to say anything bad about this game, that's how good it is. But, if you're going into F.E.A.R. expecting a horror masterpiece, sure it's better than the later installments, you will probably not be too impressed. F.E.A.R.  is a very solid first person shooter, with a horror setting, not a horror game with FPS elements.			",167,23,2,13,7,0,9

I was heart broken to sell some  6 skins that cost 3 dollars .... I cried for days on ended was my slow PC was busy downloading this game called ""Fear"". I finally launch they game and got a error saying something about video .... I paddled my bum and slapped my hamster and launched it up one more time! We're it worked then I realized it was 10:00 PM I only got through the 1st mission ... Why do I keep putting dots .............

												This game is more than a decade old but the level of polishness is something I can still compare with the FPS games of today. Enemy A.I. is really good and the action is fast paced. Don't let the screenshots fool you that this isn't a horror game though. Just when you're so pumped up with all the action, the mood shifts to something eerie, dark, and scary. when lights blink, when you hear that voice, you freakin' brace yourself for what's coming. 5/5 would throw 5 grenades out of panic again			",109,35,9,15,20,0,8

												Alright, this is going to be short, but a must read if you bought this before you ever had steam like me. :)So here is my story. I was really young and didn't have a gaming computer. I first tried playing this game when i was about 11 or 12. All my friends had heard about it and played it. One of them bought it for me to try to play in the dark at midnight in my basement with cobwebs and♥♥♥♥♥♥I still remember that night because I was absolutely terrified because of what I had heard of this game. Needless to say it did not disappoint my 11 year old imagination. Although this game doesn't terrify my anymore I decided to purchase it again just to make a clean run through it with my gaming PC. :) Now onto the review.First off I'll get the rating out of the way for you ADHD people. 9/10 Why? Read on.A.I. (Now we are talking for a game released in 2005 keep in mind) The A.I. in F.E.A.R. is top notch on a scale that matches that of Halo, which is very good contrary to popular belief. Never did I encounter a bug with the A.I. where they didn't search for me and pursue me or sneak up behind me and scare me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I like that in a game haha. I give the A.I. a 9/10 too.Artwork/Textures/Graphics: Not that this is what makes a game, but you can not say that it doesn't contribute highly to your decision in buying games. Again this is a 2005 release. The artwork is never foreign to environment and atmosphere that this game is trying to set which is Dark and Scary. With shading to make you think twice about going around a corner to the shading of the fire on Alma's back, (or however you spell her name that little ♥♥♥♥♥) this game knows what it's doing when it comes to matching it's art with it's environment. I give the Artwork/Textures/Graphics a solid 10/10Gameplay (from beginning to end): From the slow beginning of the ride in the car to the fights with the soldiers to the encounters with Alma, F.E.A.R.'s gameplay keeps you on edge and makes you thinkt hat you'll die at any moment. Oh, and the ending is to DIE for. ;) I won't get too in depth because I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that this game is worth every penny. I kneel before this game, bestowing it's gameplay with a 9/10 rating.ADHD version: Worth the money. Pick it up. Still is a terrific game. Alma, that is all. 9/10			",210,29,4,15,46,1,27

												Not horrible. Good time waster, although it gets a little boring and tedious when you pass by the same backgrounds and ""copy/paste"" landscape after awhile.Remember those cartoons when you were a kid where the cat and mouse would run by the same lamp 20-30 times? Yeah, it's kind of like that.And there were a few times I found myself wishing the current level would just end already. Some of them went on for too long.Still, the slow mo feature/power that you have is pretty cool and the AI movement is sort of clever (especially with the things they can randomly say). Good for a few hours if you're looking for a time waster.			",314,142,6,31,21,0,34

												Was critically acclaimed when it came out and rightfully so. One of the best games ever made. It's engine feels exactly like Half-Life 2. If you play it in the dark with headphones on and really get into it, it definitely has moments that will make you jump out of your ♥♥♥♥ing shoes and blast your pants full of crap. Very solid awesome game and I have great memories of playing it many years ago. 9/10. Unless you are a little♥♥♥♥♥who only plays League of Asians. Fear 2 is not bad but Fear 3 has much more smooth satisfying combat and graphics than 2. Overall it's a great series to pick up if you enjoy FPS games and want something really cool to play through and enjoy while you do. Unless you are the one single stupid fk who downvoted this because he probably has no idea what a real ♥♥♥♥ing game is nor what the touch of a woman feels like.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Sure it's showing it's age by now, the plain looking levels look even more plain now than they used to back when the game first released, and the control layout just seems weird.... but you can't go wrong with this game.  The moment combat breaks out and you're slow-mo spin kicking people through smoke, debris, and gunfire you won't regret it.  The enemies are hilarious to watch in action and listening to them chatter to each other is amusing as well.  However, unlike in other games they aren't just spitting out one liners to each other they are actually giving each other orders and you can use what they say against them to great effect.  Another nice touch is that enemies actually react to being shot.  So if you blast someone with a shotgun and it doesn't kill them they'll damn well be feeling it unlike in most games where a headshot doesn't even throw off a persons aim.  Seriously you can't go wrong with this game.			",154,32,1,56,18,0,29

												I'm about halfway through the game right now (interval 6 out of 11) and I don't see anything changing at all in the other half so I figured I may express my thoughts about this game right now. I'd describe the overall experience of the game to be pretty poor. It's incredibly linear, featuring corridor after corridor after corridor filled with office props and sick♥♥♥♥♥dynamic lighting. I've always heard about FEAR having stellar gameplay due to the gunplay mechanics and smart AI but here's how the gameplay usually goes: you walk through corridors, press some switch, walk some more and hear the occasional ""kill the bad guy"" on your comm link and then maybe you fight some enemy grunts and walk some more. There is a level where you're supposed to run after some annoying fat guy and it was literally corridors - turret - corridors - turret - corridors - two turrets - end of segment. I understand the reasoning behind your character running at an extremely slow speed with no sprinting as it sets a specific horror-ish pace for the game however the entire ""horror"" aspect of the story seems to be a couple of spooky things happening (which seem to completely go away mid-way through the game). Adding to that, there's no survival horror involved, you always have plenty of ammo and are always maxed out on health kits. That being said, you can still be killed in seconds in a firefight. Speaking of fights, I can't figure out why people are praising the AI so bad in FEAR, 90% of the enemies you encounter are grunts wielding the same guns as you and their behavior reminded me of the soldiers in the first Half-Life who would try to flank you or flush you out with nades and sometimes run away from the fight for their own sake. Usually you would just enable slow-mo and mow most of them down and then deal with the rest with the arsenal available to you. The game also completely lacks music at some points and it may take away some of the joy from shootouts.Overall, FEAR is and should be mostly praised for its gameplay as its other aspects are downright horrible apart from the visuals (although they mostly consist of the same environments), if praised at all. In my opinion the gameplay could be improved so much if Monolith completely ditched the plot narrative, uninteresting story and cardboard characters. If you're attempting to create John Woo-styled gunplay mechanics then make the movement faster and add more ""run and gun"" options for people to play around with. IMO: FEAR is still worth checking out for its dirt cheap price despite its flaws and problems.			",326,41,4,35,11,4,34

												Its a nearly decade old game thats still better than games released around these times.Graphics, Gameplay, AI, Design, Story, Characters, Sound, this game could be released today with minimal updates and still be a competitor in the market and with minimal updates if any at all.Unlike most AI in FPS games where they do not simulate thought, they do not do anything more than basic scripting or instantly knowing player location and other information the AI are actually responding to stimuli in the enviroment (flashlights, last known player location, last man standing) and relaying that information via verbal commands. Its very fun to run after the last man left and have him flipping out over being the last out of his small group alive. Or to peak around a corner, toss a nade, and watch the AI go into searching and attempt to flank you if your location is known. THe AI love to flank you and sneak up on you. As appose to Bioshock Infinite where the AIs most interesting tactics rely upon running directly at you or just strafing and shooting. To make a point unlike how the AI in that game don't really follow any rules, the AI in FEAR follow a set of rules that make for predictable, repeatable, and interesting scenarios because the AI can't just 360 instantly and start running around shooting. They react realistically and will attempt to gain cover or a flanking position. Predicting that a guy would come through a hallway and then blasting him is extremely pleasant and lets you use tactics back on the enemies. In Binfinite the AI is unpredictable, random, and just a mess in general. Fights don't feel good when you cannot understand and just run around shooting brainless AI until you win.  The AI arn't ""smart"" in the way some AI are and they cheat, they follow rules and respond to you. That alone is just sooo goood. If you like gameplay, FEAR is the type of game you need to play. Its just a classic thats not better objectively than todays games unless you value production value and flash more than actually having fun and enjoyment out of your own on screen actions. Its a horror game, but its not terribly scary. A few scares scared me, but nothing I would be legit scared for more than a few seconds about. The horror and pschylogical thriller are really just back drops to the great shooting and gameplay and really assist in taking you from area to area without getting bored and while making the game in general more interesting.If you don't own FEAR on something whether that be PS3 or PC this is one of the few games you should just play. It really gives you some aspect on how todays games arn't actually made for ""Gamers"" or people who actually want to play games so much as mainstream casual sheep that wan't to be handed fun points and story and don't understand much more than go from point A to B and shoot all the guys who stand there. I can only imagine there shock when the FEAR AI would come and bring the fight behind them instead of just standing there and letting the player kill them like in todays ""Triple A"" mastershitpeices.TL:DRIts a fabulous game with terrific AI that dousn't drone on but stays fresh for the entire length while having designs that still trump games a decade nearly after release.

Posted: October 1, 2014
												FEAR is a game that has been recommended to me time and time again by so many different people, and I've always been skeptical to try it simply because of the disturbing little girl on the cover known as ""Alma."" Now that I finally scrounged up the courage to sit through the entire game, I discovered that hidden behind the ""horror"" genre this game's title would imply, is a well rounded and excellent shooter game that reminds me of the good old days of PC gaming like Max Payne. So to anyone who's nervous to give this game a try, don't be! There are a few jump scares here and there, but the gameplay is just so much fun that it shouldn't really bother you. The gameplay is pretty solid in this game. You're given a gun, some health packs, and the ability to slow down time which never gets old. The level design is pretty stale which is pretty typical due to hardware limitations at the time, so the environments can be pretty repetitive. You'll fight in warehouses, a large office building, and then more warehouses throughout the course of the short 6 hours campaign. The pacing of the game itself is appropriate as enemies will become more numerous as you move room to room and will test your abilities more and more until they introduce a new enemy type. The variety in enemy types is pretty limited though. You'll fight standard guards, some slightly more heavilty armed guards, heavies, and eventually you'll go toe to toe with some big mech-based contraptions that will take a lot of firepower to take down. But never did I feel like the game was too hard. In fact, I blew threw the game without much difficulty at all (having set the difficulty only at ""normal""). FEAR also appears to be a shooter ahead of its time, with hidden voice recordings hidden throughout the world in the form of answering machines that help create a sense of immersion in the world. Overall, the gameplay is excellent but the level design and environment can feel pretty stale even with the inclusion of nice touches like radio broadcasts and answering machines. The story of the game takes a backseat to the gameplay, as it's incredibly simple and straight forward. You are a soldier part of a special team called ""F.E.A.R."" that is tasked with capturing some bio-terrorist that likes to eat people (something that I don't believe was ever explained). Your specific soldier appears to be special with enhanced reflexes (which explains your ability to slow down time at will during the gameplay), and you continuously throughout the duration of the game have visions of some horrible scene that presumably is from your dark secret past. In addition to these visions, you randomly see some little girl named ""Alma"" that only you and this bio-terrorist guy seem to even know about. All of which is explained towards the end. The ending is definitely a cliff-hanger, making room for the inevitable sequel that is ""FEAR 2: Project Origin."" So the story is interesting, it's not fantastic, but it's interesting enough for to me to be able to remember it so I guess that's something. The graphics are pretty damn impressive for 2006. There are dynamic lights setup in the environment that when shot will actually react realistically to the environment. There is some impressive physics work also that really shines when you're in a slow motion gunfight in a clustered room (like in the office building levels). TV's will shake on the wall, debris from the desks will fly everywhere, bullet casings will independently hit the ground randomly, and enemies and their body parts will rag doll all over the place. It's clear that the graphical limitations of the time limited the developers to some pretty boring environments, but they really made up for it with the fantastic physic effects. Overall, the game is a ton of fun and looks great especially considering when it was made available. The story is interesting and mostly explains what's going on, although it's not fantastic as there aren't really any memorable characters other than the creepy little girl that continuously haunts you throughout the game. It's definitely worth the playthrough and I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the series.  ",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

												This did not age well at all. The story is awful, the cutscenes are worse and the game is so divided by ""shooty shooty bang bang"" and so much empty pacing between it gets super frustrating because you spend more time navigating empty rooms than actually doing anything at all.Don't mind my hours. I've played it and it's expansions back in the day and really was something else... but it did not age well at all. The shooting gameplay is top knotch. The AI do just about everything right and it leaves you wanting more... but that just never happens. Instead you're given some empty shell of a story and try hard jump scares that weren't even scary in 2005. The only reason this game took off was because of the great use of AI triggers and also because it was one of like 3 ""scary"" games out at the time; doom and resident evil were the other two players.People that say positive things about this thrive off of nostalgia. That's cool! I do too! But this game is just dreadful. Especially once you've been exposed to more modern shooters.Is it worth 2.50 when it goes on sale? I guess. You'll only get about that much out of it.			",251,28,0,19,19,1,19

												In many ways The original F.E.A.R. and it's second expansion pack, Perseus Mandate are the best fear games. It's the only game in the series to support deticated internet servers for the best and fairest online play. Also the only one in the series to support custom user creative maps much like Half Life 2 Deathmatch. Probably still the best and hardest A.I. in a FPS to date seriously. While fear 2 no doubt beats this one out on graphics fear 1 more than makes up for it with it's more challenging gameplay, far superior melee combat and better multiplayer.			",160,28,3,12,8,1,15

												The AI is tough, in that the soldiers will actively move around and try to kill you. In addition the main character is not too much of a super hero yet so you have roughly the same hitpoints as the soldiers you kill. It's fun, it's creepy, it's FEAR. The main game will run you 7-10 hours, EP 1 about 5 and I have not gone though EP 2 yet. The expansions are deemed Noncanon by the company that went on to make Fear 2 and 3; Characters that die in the expansions continue to appear in the series. Though I was told if I ignore the deathes for the most part the expansions still apply. Alma. That is the name of the creepy girl that you will see often throughout the series. Like any rage-stricken ghost her motives in the first game are completely nonsensical. Sometimes she kills good guys, sometimes badguys. Sometimes she makes things worse, sometimes better. Some times she wants to protect you, the next thing you know specters are trying to rip out your intenstines. In the first expansion pack she even seemed to be temporarily at peace after bombarding the player with hellish visions, what triggered the peace still confuses me as all the player does is traverse to the other side of a morgue. I only have two complaints. Complaint one is: There is no contractor in the world good enough at his job not getting fired for the monstrocity that is the floor planning of every single building in Auburn. Kitchens become bathrooms become dining halls become maturnity wards and suddenly you may even drop into a sewer or elevator. This often left me disjointed and confused in terms of what direction I should be going even though I never seemed to get stuck enough to warrant a walkthrough. FEAR Obeys 90's shooter laws. Climbing into Vents is often a brilliant and eerily safe idea, side rooms typically have loot, and red valves are usable. Second complaint. It's hinted throughout the game that the Point Man is more or less safe from Alma's outbursts. Of course she can and will kill you a few times but she has her reasons. But this seriously undermines her presence after completing FEAR and moving on to the first expansion.  The second expansion and Fear 2 have a different protagonist so this is more of a gripe about expansion 1's design.			",307,38,5,54,54,2,120

												Again if steam allowed neutral status then this would be easier.The good:- feels like someone played a lot of Half Life- gun fights with the bad guys- weapons- sounds- different types of tools to dispose of enemiesThe bad:- boring and characterless environments, think generic office copy paste- it's just a simple shooter, nothing more- lasts 5 hoursThe extremely bad:- the horror elements - all of it should have been removed or reduced heavilyAll in all, I do not regret buying this on sale, can't wait to see what they did in Fear 2 and 3 :)Edit: Started playing the expansion, if it wasn't for the fact that the gun fights, simple puzzle and tools at your disposal so heavily remind me of Half Life (thanks to recent Black Mesa experiences) I would give this game a NO, but I really want more people to experience and enjoy those good gun fights.Finished Extration Point: gun fights = good, horror elements = very very bad.Finished Perseus Mandate = great gun fights and I like the bonus missions. Less horror elements but some are still there and annoying.			",830,195,29,123,74,9,183

												Good game, poor DLC. The gameplay of Extraction Point is extrmely awful and after almost 10 years of its release, they never even thought of fixing the bugs. I can't play the DLC without being kicked out of server for every 10 minutes. And I was only playing the single player mode. That's a really unpleasant yet constant exprience. However strong you wanna re-enjoy this classic franchise, DO NOT BUY THIS DLC.			",29,3,0,6,0,0,0

F.E.A.R. ReviewFinal Result: 8,9/10F.E.A.R. is a game that holds a special place in my heart. One of my first horror games to the Xbox 360 when it was released back in 2006. What I remember is that I never dared to complete the game. But now, eight years later, I finally picked up the F.E.A.R. Collection to embark on a nostalgia trip. Before giving the full review I recommend buying each game individually and skip the colleciton. You save a few pennies by this.F.E.A.R. is a very old school shooter; the days when shooters still was quite new and shiny compared to modern shooters of today. To be aged, the game is actually quite acceptable to today's standards. Even though the melee can be a little slow at times the reflex-system, or adrenaline system makes up to any flaws. What is better than to be able to slow down time for a few seconds to see the enemy flying backwards in a wave of gore? And the shooting in general feels very fluid; I would rate the shooting in F.E.A.R. to have much higher standard than your regular Call of Duty game out there. Just enough variation in the choice of weapons. But bare in mind you can only carry up to three weapons, so choose wisely. Overall level design and atmosphere is the icing on the cake for F.E.A.R. They have managed to get in the perfect moments for something bizarre to happen. This game is indeed focusing alot on the scare factor and contain tons of scare tactics not for the player with a weak heart. To be honest the intimidation factor is not extremely high as in some modern horror titles. But it contains just enough horror for you to be paranoid around every corner. They did a fantastic job of designing the main antagonist Alma Wade. She will jump at you a dozen times. The only negative factor I can think of kind of ruining the atmosphere from time to time is the A.I. They can sometimes create some hilarious glitches and just be weird in general. But that's probably the price we must take to play an old game. All in all this is a great experience. Not for the faint of heart. Old school classic shooter with very well designed scare and horror factors. The visuals are unexpectedly good for a game of this age and live way over some of today's shooters. I think all horror and shooter gamers will very likely love this series.			",135,16,3,14,19,1,10

												As with most old PC games - where they've been re-released to modern systems through digital retailers without receiving any optimisation - I had to go through the motions of setting compatibility modes and downloading third-party patches before the game would launch. Once I had made the achievement of reaching the main screen I had to reset almost all of the keybindings, as they just weren't up to standard.At first I noticed that F.E.A.R. really shows its age: the animations are quite wooden, especially with the main player's arms (seriously, this is something on-screen for the entirety of the game and they're as stiff as planks). The UI scaling is completely out of whack for larger resolutions, I can barely read the subtitles. It's like trying to read an 8pt font on a 50 inch monitor.I know this is common in FPS games but having the camera located in the player's chest makes me feel a little like like Tom Cruise on the set of his next major blockbuster. I believe this has also caused problems during firefights as enemies will aim at my head, and be able to hit me while I'm crouched, even though it appears that I'm behind cover. This issue persists through the ages, even appearing in games such as PAYDAY 2.I'm uncertain as to what technicality is causing frame-rate issues while enabling slo-mo but activating v-sync in the graphic options has improved this greatly. I can now use slo-mo without the screen stuttering like crazy. There are still a number of issues, such as the camera flying through geometry during short cut-scenes. There was also one instance where enemies were able to shoot through walls from across the map, luckily this was a once-off occurrence.The physics engine is great, it's extremely satisfying to blast enemies and see their ragdolled bodies flying through the air, especially in slow motion. The only problem with this is that the physics is applied to so many environmental objects that I feel is unnecessary, such as cans and general rubbish, which can sometimes cause these objects to spasm violently when they're stepped on by the player.Whilst the graphics of F.E.A.R. don't particularly hold up, the game is over 10 years old as of writing, I found that the lighting and physics are still something to be admired. Even modern games still can't achieve this level of quality. Enemy spawn positions can be odd at times, where a number of soldiers will spawn right in front of my eyes on a single point. Despite the oddity it became convenient since a single, well-placed shotgun blast can take out 2-3 at once.Everything, from the physics, the silent protagonist, and the level and sound design - especially of the enemies when they communicate - all remind me heavily of Half-Life 2 but I found that the A.I. in F.E.A.R. is much more intelligent and unpredictable. They would often outflank me, draw me into a bottleneck, and manoeuvre in such a way that I'd end up missing them only to end up dead. There are also certain special enemies that remind me of BioShock's splicers and Big Daddy's, although their appearances are short-lived.Even though I love linear games I found F.E.A.R. to be far too linear, it's a straight up corridor shooter without much flavour. I also found the game to be very, very dark. I'd often run into walls or closed doors when my flashlight had run out of power.There is a poor amount of variety when it comes to weapons and an even smaller pool of ammunition to go with them. I would often end up running out of ammo for my preferred weapon (pistol) very quickly. For some reason there is a seemingly unlimited amount of ammunition for the shotgun so I mostly relied on that when my other guns ran dry. I don't particularly appreciate there being a limit on having only three weapons at a time when there is already such a small variety of guns to choose from, I don't see why I can't just hold all of them for the sake of convenience. It's the same with the torch, why allow it to run flat if its recharge time is only a matter of seconds. I found these mechanics to be quite silly and limiting when their implementation was obviously to create some artificial difficulty and basic resource management system. It's a nuisance.There isn't much to say for the sound design and soundtrack, it's all very ambient and atmospheric.As for gameplay, it feels like I'm performing the same task over and over again... I'll enter an area, there will be a security lock-down happening, I'll be given the task to deactivate the security system and/or traps and then progress to next area... to be met by further security systems that must be deactivated in order to raise some gates, or activate elevators. To break up this monotony I'll be rewarded by either discovering a civilian or by being reunited with my team. All this progress I've made is soon wiped clean as I take two steps back and have to make up all that lost progress by scaling elevator shafts or taking back alleys. If I'm lucky I'll be extracted by another helicopter. The budget for disposable helicopters must be immense as each chopper somehow manages find itself in compromising situations and soon destroyed. As well as my soldier buddies always seeming to be sidetracked or incapacitated so that I'm forced to take the role as a one-man-army of the hour type hero. It starts becoming a little bit ridiculous and annoying, story-wise.I do wish there was more focus on the supernatural elements and cut-scenes as they were very sparse, and the small amounts of interesting encounters that did happen weren't enough to break up the monotonous pacing of the story and gameplay. I found the slo-mo system to be a huge crutch for me, without it I was very easily overwhelmed by enemies. I actually feel like the player takes a higher amount of damage without it.There was a point where the game's difficulty ramped up excessively where resources, such as med-kits and grenades, became much more scarce. Where before I had been able to hoard 10 med-kits at a time and keep a full supply of explosives, I was soon whittled down to nothing for long lengths and at the same time I was expected to handle hordes of special enemies. It soon became too much for me to bear.Don't get me wrong, F.E.A.R. is a very atmospheric and nice looking game, especially for its time. It's simply not a very exciting or memorable experience, devoid of personality, so much so that I had to force myself to continue playing. I could no longer suspend my disbelief with all of the immersion breaking issues I came across.I've resorted to using cheat codes for unlimited ammo and health so that I can experience the story and continue on with the expansions and later sequels.

												I don't remember what did I think about this game when it first came out, but in 2017 it looks, feels and plays like an outdated tech demo.Everything is dark (literally almost pitch black - you have to use your flashlight all the time, which is annoying, because it needs to be recharged after a minute or so), repetitive and boring. Occasionally the game manages to be exciting, usually in the moment when you're shooting at someone. As soon as they are dead, it's the same boring crap again. Seriously Monolith, the game came out a year after Half-Life 2, and your idea of a FPS is a guy shooting up people in an office building for 4 bloody hours?Not to mention the wonderfully paced narrative, which literally consists of your superior finding and losing the position of a certain bad guy about 11 times.

												Literally terrible. The combat is a joke. There are like 5 points in the game that may make you jump. Otherwise this is just a terrible shooter. Combat it uninspired and only there to make the game feel longer. Calling this game a psychological horror is a huge complement. The story is terrible and never gives you a good answer to anything. $9.99 is about $20 too much to pay for this game. Even better the dlc Extraction Point is literally ALL combat. It's a real thrill! Every time you shoot a guy and stagger him he will spray his gun which will inevitably headshot you or something and do massive damage. There is no replay value in this game. There is not even any play at all value in this game. Anyone that tries to tell you it is good because it is a ""classic"" is lying. Games like Goldeneye are good because they are classic. Not this game. If the levels didn't have combat and parts where you have to go down an extra path to flip a switch or some gay♥♥♥♥♥♥they would be about 5 minutes long. No exaggeration.

												In a word, mediocre.  The setting is disjointed.  The maps are contrived.  The gameplay is nothing special.  The big crime for me however is the spooky factor simply isn't there.  There is this promise of supernatural in the game, but it takes a back seat to just shooting guys in riot gear.  There are moments of ghostly action, but they have zero impact on gameplay.  Conversely, the gameplay is rather irrelevant to the story.  The first couple times something spooky happens you're like omg what's going on, but once you realize there is no impact, no combat related to it, you just start blowing off the hauntings so the whole thing loses apeal.  After 6 hours of playing I was bored with it as nothing was keeping it fresh or engaging.  I felt like I was just struggling through shooting people to get to 5 minutes of unrelated story, and that simply wasn't worth it.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												Don't buy this game if you're looking for survival horror.Though I suppose the gameplay feels pretty smooth, the horror factor and the story are a big disappointment in my opinion. Exept for the occasional jumpscare and fighting in dark hallways the game did nothing to provide me with the atmosphere I was expecting. F.E.A.R doesn't live up to it's name even when playing in a dark room with headphones on. ",37,13,0,3,1,0,9

												The game desperately tries to keep itself interesting by using a few elements of gore and surprise but fails miserably. If you ignore the game's desperate attempts to instill fear in you through the sounds and Alma the girl, its just a mild waste of time and a basic FPS from the 90's era.			",60,4,0,7,3,0,4

												F.E.A.R.: I’m not F.E.E.L.ing it…When F.E.A.R. came out back in 2005 it was considered to be a game changer! Not on the level of Half-Life 2 or anything, but, people loved it! They always talked about how good it was. The horror elements were well done, the enemy AI was fantastic, the shooting was super great, and the graphics were amazing. You had to have a pretty beefy computer to play this game.Maybe back in 2005. Because, man has this game aged poorly. Like, really poorly.Not only does the game look... bad. It’s really not that fun either, sorry to say. Now this is probably due to the fact that I have ten years of games between the release of F.E.A.R. and now to compare it to. I can definitely see how, at the time, F.E.A.R. would have blown my thirteen year old mind. But as it stands, in 2015, F.E.A.R. is very underwhelming. It feels like a pretty standard shooter, with some cool bullet time and horror elements thrown in. I’m sure if I could force myself to play more I would probably get something out of it. But as of four hours into the game all I’ve done is: run through long hallways murdering puppet soldiers in an industrial complex, and an office building, while occasionally being frightened by a little girl. And... she doesn’t show up all that much, sadly.To be fair, there were moments where I was genuinely enjoying myself. Rolling up on fools with a shotgun and slo-mo sliding into them while tearing them to shreds with buckshot is really cool. Like the first 50 times. Then it just becomes an easy “I win” button. Now, the horror aspects of this game were the main draw for me. And trust me, they can be genuinely disturbing and definitely made me jump more than once. But, as you play through the game you can see the seams at the edges of the experience. After about two hours I could tell when the game was going to go from ‘action’ to ‘horror’ just by level design.Big well lit area funneling into a small dark hallway? Scare incoming. Better turn on my flashlight!Eventually I just got bored with the game. There wasn’t enough of the creepy to keep me interested, and the ten year old shooting and level design weren’t doing F.E.A.R. any favors.I honestly spent a large chunk of my four hours trying to figure out where the hell I was supposed to go. Which is the weird thing, because this game is quite linear. Sadly it’s very easy to get turned around, and everything looks the same… Plus sometimes the level designers expected you to intuit where to go without any indication. I felt like I was playing Duke Nukem, or Doom, considering how many times a seemingly decorative A/C vent was actually the way forward. I hear this game gets pretty crazy towards the end, but I can’t bring myself to continue any further. I wanted to try and complete every game I reviewed for this project… but, I don’t really want to spend anymore time on this one. Especially considering I have over one hundred more to do.I think the coolest part of F.E.A.R. is probably the firefights. Although the shooting is rather lackluster compared to today, the effects of your combat are really cool. Glass will break, the walls, floor, and ceiling will have large chunks blown out of them. And large amounts of dust, that actually lingers, will be kicked up. It forces you to move around, and looked really cool. Plus the bloody aftermath was always satisfying...The dust tech is the most impressive part of this game to me. Seriously.Honestly, this game reminds me a lot of Psi-Ops, an old game for the PS2. It revolved around a paranormal military task force fighting against another paranormal military group. It had all of the same hyper violence, weird psychic powers, creepy horror segments, and strange meat puppet soldiers. Expect I played it at the time... so I liked it.It’s not that FEAR is bad… It’s just like an old movie. It was amazing when it came out! It’s just, going back and looking at it compared to ‘modern’ releases, it just doesn’t hold up.Luckily I picked F.E.A.R. up on sale for like $2.75. If you’ve never played FEAR and always wanted to. Watch a let’s play. Or, if you absolutely have to play it, grab it on super-sale. It’s… really dated.Like this review? Check out 100hoursave.com for more. ",138,23,0,25,11,0,26

												Take my review of F.E.A.R with a grain of salt.  I don't like games that make me play in darkness.  At about the half-way point (estimated from walkthroughs), I decided to quit primarily because of that.  However, I also have problems with the ""feel"" of the game:  it feels like I'm a 3rd person in my own game play.  In general, the game treats me as a 3rd party and tells me what to do instead of my being the controlling entity.  And, finally, as a really trivial issue, the f-word density is just too high here.  So, I'm not recommending the game.That said, if you do decide the game's for you, be aware that if you have Logitech devices, you'll need a fix for the framerate issue:https://steamcommunity.com/app/21090/discussions/0/343785380897389173/ ",77,70,0,12,8,0,3

												This game is totally laggy, goes down to 5 fps after 5 min of playtime. I tested it with three different AMD setups.Might need to have Nvidia card to run this smoothly.ps. Have also tested many different AMD drivers with no cigar.AMD Phenom II X6 1090T 3,2Ghz : AMD HD6870 : Windows 7AMD FX 8320 @ 4.0Ghz : AMD R9 290X : WIndows 7AMD Phenom II X3 3m,2Ghz : HD6570 : Windows 8.1I update the thread so you see I have tested three different AMD systems. Seems like only me having this issue due to the feedback, but anyway thats life I guess.If I turn off Vsync I get 15 fps instead of 5 awesomeUpdate: 2016-03-14Reinstall my computer wit Windows 10 with AMD FX 8320 @ 4.0Ghz : AMD R9 290X and run full HD 1920x1080 and V-sync turned off and I get now 10 fps from the start.

												I have a fairly good machine. I can usually run any game on medium to semi high graphics and maintain 30 fps. I had this game on the worst possible settings, which made this game look like Hotline Miami and it ran at a sold, ha get this, 7 AVERAGE FPS.It took me five of the 17 minutes to find my native resolution because the text was so pixilated on my screen from the original resolution which covers a whopping 1/6'th of my average sized monitor when fullscreen.This is the only game I can name that is better on console than it is on PC. There is NO JUSTICE.Edit: Apparently i was stupid and there are fixes for this issue. Will try some and see if they help.			",92,5,0,3,3,1,1

												+ The last 3 levels: Talk about saving the best for last! Intense firefights and jaw-dropping sights. Takes too long to get there, though.+ Slowing down time during near-death shootouts and martial arts maneuvers: Nerve-wracking and satisfying went pulled off well.+ Acting: All the voice actors did a consistently good job! Nothing bad.- Repetitive gameplay: Not fun shooting bad guys in dimly-lit offices over and over again, even with a few spots where a bit of strategising is needed.- Ugly graphics, even with maxed-out DirectX 9 graphics! Drab lighting, colouring, texturing and character design.- Spotty environmental sound effects: With or without Creative EAX Advanced HD, implementation is wonky. Sudden volume jumps and effect changes tick me off.			",68,8,2,1,0,0,3

												I love FPS.  Most the of the games I own are FPS and I've been playing them for decades.  I bought this game because it was on sale and people were calling it ""the best FPS EVER!"" in the reviews.  It's not.  It's physics and combat are very clunky and an early example of ""consolization"" of a game.  You don't self-heal and you can have more than two weapons but something DEFINITELY does not feel right.  There is basically ONE enemy and they pass this off in the story as the soldiers all being clones.  Combine this with lackluster weapons and barren indoor levels and you have some VERY boring and repetitive combat that NO amount of ""bullet time"" can spice up.  Throw in the embarrassing ""scary"" creepy kid and poltergeist moments and you have something that is scary but not in the right way.  Watching the making of video is pretty embarrassing as well and just shows you the over-produced bloat and ego that went into this game.			",31,1,0,5,0,0,1

												meh.i'm somewhat null to alot of stories and games these days because of scarring left behind. this makes it difficult for me to let myself feel much, especially when it's pretty obvious that no one is going to live and that♥♥♥♥♥♥is never gonna go to plan.that means aside from the twist, it was easy enough to guess that the character was gonna end up in a shi* situation and that bad things would happen to good people you don't wanna see hurt. which closed me up. i didn't find much to be scary enough to make my hairs stand on end, but the could be because as a game character you know you can't die otherwise how would you play?then theirs the fact that i was expecting some creepy stuff, but none of it wasn't anything i haven't seen before. mind you, this is my first time playing the game, back on release would i have been more freaked out due to being less exposed to other games like it? possibly...but i didn't play it then. which means i have to judge it on the here and now.and my judgement is, aside from a few moments where i didn't see a erry monster coming at me from my corner i didn't really ever get scared. again i feel that i was emotionally guarded because i knew anyone i let myself get attached to would just die so that is a factor.then, lets talk about AI. there were moments were they pressured you, but there were mostly alot of cheap shots. example, i'm in slow mo mode pounding a guy with bullets on the crappy AR and the guy still manages to get a good shot on me occasionally. often enough to make you think about health and cover even if he's the only guy standing. a)to me this a cheap move or lazy work on the dev's part. it breaks immersion. in a game like this, immersion matters a lot. b) the enemy, unless standing over your head on a walkway are completely silent. the only time you even know if someone is in the same small room as you is if you walk by them and get shot in the back. c) so the next point is, the sound of tracking enemies is crap. d) also their bullet sponges on hard or higher. it's not very bad though, you can still kill them in one clip, but when you get a gun that can literally melt everything but your bones it raises an eyebrow when you shoot a human in the chest and he could doubles over like he got punched in the gut.3) level desing: you know, one thing i hate is getting turned around when i just wont to move on and shoot things. now sure, it's not entirely a shooter game, but it sure as he** is linier in level design. yet, i still can't make heads or tails and go around in circles because in some places it's alittle bit like a maze. then in another place, i spent 30 minutes in one small area trying to move on only to realize i'm suppose to jump off and over the ledge that looks perfectly like it goes nowhere execpt that it's a next level load point. i'll point out, that you get hurt jumping off of ledges in any other situation in-game so why the f*** would i think to jump off that one?4) guns: the guns for the most part aren't bad, execpt that near the end of the game they remove your guns and stick you with the starter weapon. which is a good gun, but that's a BS move. FEAR isn't the only game doing this though, but i still wish they didn't. they aren't the best, personally i've played with better ""feeling"" guns. note: it was the end-game guns that i'm really complaining about. my remote bombs packed more punch than they did.5) as far as i can tell, there is no level select or new game +, which is always a disappointment.given the option, i'd rather play TimeShift again than this. the slow mo and puzzle are more brain food than the weak puzzles installed here. before you say there weren't any, there was...built into the maze level desings. i won't talk about graphics because it's acceptible for the time period, i played at supported resolutions. i do feel the game would have benifitted from a FOV slider though.

Still, unless you get a great deal, this game has some seriously wonky game mechanics, funky graphics, and crashes now and again. don't bother getting this on its own.i'd add that fear 2 and fear 3 are MUCH MUCH BETTER, so if you're more of a gameplay person, get fear 3. its the best. if you HAVE to have the story, get fear 2. it's very important. Fear 1 is really unimportant story wise because most of the content is covered in 2 and 3, effectively sweeping fear 1 under the rug. Thats my 2 cents anyway.			",148,5,0,24,28,1,19

												4 Hours of the same shoting with the same enemies within the same halls makes me bored. It have a little spooky aspect which is the only redeemable feature in the whole game. Slow motion to help with the game, other than that don't expect more. I forced myself to play this after 2 hours to watch those spooky scenes during the game but I couldn't reach 5 hours. Graphics are dated, all assets are copy pasted during the whole copy pasted levels. You may like this game if you want but this is my opinion. AI can't see you when you stand above them on iron stares. AI on hard = adding granades to them to flush you out of your hiding place.There is no way in Hell this would be 2005 game of the year since a lot of great games released during the same year. You search the 2005 release list and see how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this title in compareson to others.Buy on sale only, maybe you will have your worth of money, I know I didn't.			",212,68,1,10,5,2,4

												The short:- Do not buy, not even on sale or for nostalgia. Save your money.- Poorly optimized.- Framrate and lighting issues.- Intrusive autosave screens.- Outdated shooting mechanics that don't age well, unlike some classic shooters.The long:- I would have recommended this game when if came out all those years ago, but even on sale price I couldn't justify it. If you're looking for nostalgia and a fun shooter to play, then I would honestly say save your money. I blazed through this game with little challenge (on extreme difficulty) and I wasn't creeped out in the slightest or completely satisfied with the shooting mechanics - as fun as they used to be back in the day.- The original game is more or less playable, but the higher resolutions aren't optimized, the lighting effects flicker on and off  just enough to annoy you but not enough to deter you from not playing. It might cause some people migraines.- The worst thing is when the game autosaves it freezes the game on a black screen for 2-3 seconds, and this is quite frequent and really breaks immersion. The original, even with these problems, plays fine for how old it is, then the expansion, Extraction Point, plays like absolute garbage; the framerate dives insansely low at many parts rendering this old♥♥♥♥♥game unplayable even on a beast rig, so I stopped and uninstalled it and probably won't touch it again. I have no idea how Perseus Mandate runs, probably the same if not worse. Look elsewhere for older games that are better optimized or have HD remakes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am writing this now because I do not think that I will be able to finish this game. As usual, it’s hard to decide whether to recommend or not when I know others will not be as bothered by certain things as I am, but it is my review after all so here are my issues with FEAR:1.	It did not age well. The sky looks terribly flat and the level design consists mostly of gray corridors. 2.	The game clearly has 2 gimmicks which it wants you to see as soon as possible: the slow-motion effect and flashy gun particle effects.  That is its thing, its selling point and it’s not enough to make a whole game. The game becomes boring after a while.3.	The girl from The Ring. The story of FEAR is actually not that bad but the antagonist is clearly the little girl from The Ring horror film and, again, it feels too on the nose.4.	The gameplay is the ultimate example of a classic PC first-person shooter where you have a health bar that goes down as enemies hit you, and the enemies WILL hit you the very moment they see you from a mile away, which feels unnatural. In a shooter like this, the game becomes about the health bar management and I hate that gamy feel. The good stuff: well, some of the jump scares are quite creative and overall the graphics are not the worst I guess. The AI, despite the annoying super-accuracy and reflexes, is quite smart. Enemies will throw grenades at your last known position and jump over obstacles (smarter than some of the modern AI in games).IN CONCLUSION, I bet it was cool in its day but I am getting incredibly tired of this game. And to prove that this is not just about this being an old game, I am also playing Doom 3 that was released a year earlier and it is a way more interesting game despite having many similar problems.Update: I uninstalled the game and feel sooo much better now. I was forcing myself to give another try because it is a well-known game, but holy moly, am I happy I don't have to play that grey goo anymore.			",69,5,6,5,12,2,7

Sure, Alma was creepy, and some of the scares were sorta effective, but damn, there are other better games that have much more of an impact than this. Plus the sequels were just as bad, if not worse.

												F.E.A.R. is a game that isn't great, but it's great. Played it on XBox 360 forever ago, and replaying it is bringing back the memories. 10/10 for nostalgia. If you haven't played it before, you probably won't like it.			",96,3,0,14,3,1,7

												This isn't the worst game ever. But it certainly isn't one of the better games I've played. I went into F.E.A.R. with high expectations, because almost everyone was saying that this game was amazing. But, and I'm NOT sorry to say, I was rather disappointed with this game.The gameplay isn't anything special. The gunplay is actually pretty bad. There are games much older than this, such as the Half-Life games, with much better gunplay, and the slow-motion just gets repetitive after a while. Put simply, walking through corridors and shooting the same soldiers in slow-mo every few minutes gets old pretty fast.The level design is some of the laziest I've ever seen. Nothing but dimly-lit grey corridors. And that's your lot!Then, there's the story... Or lack thereof. Throughout the game, I had no freaking clue what was going on or what I was fighting for. The game makes no clear explanation as to what you're doing, or why. You're just placed in these random places and shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the occasional paranormal... thingie that comes out of nowhere. There is ZERO narrative!None of the characters were even remotely memorable. Most of them only make appearances that last mere minutes. I only remember one name, Norton Mapes. As for the main character, he was just some generic mute. Nothing more, nothing less.Also, this game is pretty short! I managed to beat it in less than ten hours. And this was a full-priced game at launch? Inexcusable.The one thing I give this game credit for though is the enemy AI. For a game from 2005, the enemy AI is top tier. The soldiers react almost instantly to your presence, even at small things like your flashlight, and their accuracy is pixel-perfect. They don't miss a single shot at all! But that's just about the only thing this game has going for it, really.Overall, I think this game is seriously overrated. It's gameplay wasn't anything special, the story was crap, and it was ridiculously short. But I have played worse. It isn't horrible, but it certainly hasn't aged well and I wouldn't play it again.

												At this point in time this game has aged quite a bit. However F.E.A.R holds quite a bit of charm, the enemy AI is quite clever , the slow motion is fun as hell to use, the graphics are dated but the lighting system has a lot of unique high contrast light sources which look really cool.If you can get it for a bundle price with extraction point and perseus mandate expansions I would say it's worth the play through, otherwise, it's just another aged fps.

												F.E.A.R. and especially it's expansion packs are the best example of a game that is well done but lacks vision. It has absolutely nothing to keep you playing. The gameplay is boring, there's no atmosphere, plot is very thin and there are basicly no characters in the game. Even the 'scary' parts fail to deliver them being revealed before hand. It's modern version of Doom but with less interesting enemies, guns and one of the worst level designs in the history of FPS. Sad case from Monolith who also provided the best FPS, No One Lives Forever. The plus side is that occasionally the game looks good even by todays standards. Although the expansion packs seem to look worse than the main game. Also there are only minor bugs and AI is decent, so you might want to test the shooting part and buy if you like it: since it's going to be that from the start to the finish.			",192,41,1,16,12,4,50

												Not sure why this gets such great reviews.. I felt lost half of the time. Not knowing whether or not I was making any progress until I hit a random checkpoint in what looked like somewhere I had already been before. A lot of the levels felt the same and the shooting felt rather clunky and inaccurate. Even on normal difficulty this game can be pretty tough if you don't find the ammo or healthpacks that you WILL need, but after dropping to easy difficulty, it was near impossible to die and the FPS aspect got really boring. Although it had some creepy moments and got me once or twice with a jumpscare, there definitely wasnt enough ""horror"" to balance out the FPS to really consider this as ""one of the best horror games"". It's not a BAD game, but it does not impress me or live up to what I have heard about the series (which apparently goes downhill from here...)Overall, i'd say a 5/10			",309,46,15,36,6,0,9

												Cannot gain access to Interval 5. The game crashes with an Out of Memory error (With my PC lets just say that would never  happen, and it has never happened with any other game before it out of the over 100 titles on my Steam account) or returns to the Main Menu stating that I have been Disconnected from the server.. Basically they never patched this game and fixed this issue and people have been reporting this issue since 2005, it's 9 years later and they still haven't fixed it, what's even the point in paying out for something that does not work?

												F.E.A.R. is a standard first-person shooter that uses bullet time—that’s honestly all it is—which came as quite a surprise to me after reading the widespread reviews lauding it as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The plot is the typical what-has-science-done, with an Evil Corporation (as if there were any other kind in video games) in pursuit of engineering super soldiers. So a psychic military commander sends his puppet soldiers to take over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, a warehouse emporium of weaponry, medikits, and indestructible office equipment. Enter the nameless, mute protagonist, as part of a special army unit designed to face paranormal threats, and his squad mates, who are consistently separated, injured, and subject to all manner of contrived reasons to keep them from interrupting the solo FPS design. “You’re just going to send him in alone???” the radio crackled for the umpteenth time. The gunplay was praised again and again as being spectacular, but it’s just a typical FPS experience. F.E.A.R.’s own iteration of the arsenal with which any FPS fan is familiar functions exactly as expected, with one exception; kicking people is far more damaging than multiple machine gun rounds piercing through their torsos. The only distinguishing feature of the gameplay is its infinitely accessible bullet time mode, which trivializes every encounter throughout the entire game, even on the hardest difficulty. Shifting in and out of bullet time mid combat is pretty, but nothing near the level of mind-blowing so universally spouted from critics. It is by no means bad; it’s decent, but only that.Enemy AI was next on the list of sheer adulation, and was claimed to be “some of the best AI in shooter history.” Imagine my surprise when armored soldiers, who make up 80 percent of the game’s enemies, loudly proclaimed through their megaphone helmets that they were throwing a grenade at me, which then detonated two feet in front of them. I don’t remember if any of them ever did manage to hit me with a grenade, but I do know they were constantly informing me of what they were going to do, or how many of them I had killed. And for some reason, whether I was hiding behind a box, retreating, or charging head on, they would constantly shout at me, “HE’S TRYING TO FLANK US!” It’s not their fault, I suppose; someone built their armor with megaphones in the helmets… but weren’t they supposed to be psychically coordinated soldiers?I did begin to feel a certain attachment to these armored soldiers, for all their loud, bumbling ineptness. There were many times they could’ve had the drop on me, if only they had not shouted, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!” or something like that when they spotted me. At one point, an armored truck full of them tried to run me over, but when I moved out of the way, they just kept driving, right off a building. Sometimes one of them would shout to the other, “TAKE COVER!!!” to which the other, surrounded by hallways, doors, tables, and walls, would scream, “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO!!!” I even started to let them have all the time they needed to awkwardly wiggle underneath fences or clamber over walls in plain sight of me before I gunned them down. Of course, no review of F.E.A.R. would be complete without mentioning the horror, something which critics across the board have deemed bowel-voidingly scary. But it just wasn’t. Throughout the game, several hallucinations occur that are supposed to be unsettling, but 99 percent of them can’t actually hurt you. With no real effect upon the player, and no way to interact with them, the visions take on a haunted house ride kind of feel—spooky happenings just outside the safety of a cart on tracks. I found myself startled once or twice upon turning around to see a little girl just behind me, but when I discovered that I could move toward and back away from her indefinitely to raise and lower the volume of the scary violins, I couldn’t help but laugh. The ever popular mechanism of discovered audio tapes takes the form of voicemails, but the majority of them are poor voice actors reading aloud passive aggressive corporate squabbles. They failed to flesh out the story to any further degree than what-has-science-done; the game as a whole never delivers on its narrative. Ambiguity is a useful tool in crafting horror, but F.E.A.R.’s story remains largely undeveloped by the end of the game. I think some developers wanted to make a standard action shooter but were also into Japanese horror films, so the result was a standard action shooter with Japanese horror elements that might as well have been delivered from a TV screen.I will close with some of the non spoiler questions this game has left me to consider on my sleepless nights. Firstly, why do dead bodies sometimes randomly fly through windows, and why are there so many in the ceilings? ATC headquarters was taken over by psychically controlled soldiers, right? How did they even get the bodies up there in the first place? Or was it the little girl? Was she just stuffing them up through the tiles so they could conveniently fall down as I passed? And why does the protagonist spontaneously combust when he falls into pits? I did it several times out of disbelief, but sure enough, just before the screen went black, orange flames engulfed my entire body. What exactly are those shinless, tan men who float into me and pop like a fleet of suicidal balloons? And why do the armored soldiers sometimes blast off like rockets when I shoot them in bullet time mode? Machine gun fire shouldn’t send an armored body rocketing across a room, bouncing off walls and screaming.  ",35,4,0,7,0,0,1

												Another horror game, another fail...F.E.A.R. i hate this game.First thing that bothered me during my playthrough, plot! I saw it somewhere else, i swear it! But where... Ah i got! Movies like Ring, Grudge and e.t.c. Really ♥♥♥♥ing original Monolith!I also read everywhere about great AI in this♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Well, its great, but in negative way. They are using covers, supressing fire, even retreating sometimes. But they never stood a chance against me (i played on high difficulty and dint die once) Monolith developed not just a ""great"" Ai, but immitation of Ai. Guys, we never been fooled hard before... Great job Monolith!Graphics are awesome for its times, game was made in 2005. But lightning disturbed me a little, it wasnt scary it was kinda ugly and annoying sometimes.Horror part of the game - it didnt exist. Another thing Monolith fail to deliver. This creature just stand there tried to scare me and my reaction was ""Ahaha what the ♥♥♥♥ is this?! :D"".Well, gameplay is quite simple, because its a ""horror"" shooter game (which is not scary at all) You shoot those clowns which happens to be some sort of clones of your own brother who gone rogue and you need to kill the prick, ahaha.You start alone, because developers cant make decent npcs coop for you and just killed everyone in the start. Cool.Just shoot your way through, save the world? And maybe some love story... Sorry, but no :D0/10 Monolith prooved themselfs to be most ignorant and not creative developers we ever know.

												Sadly, this game is near unplayable for people using some Logitech hardware due to a USB polling frequency issue on Windows 7 and 8 that creates extremely low framerates on even high end boxes. While there does exist a workaround, it basically involves crippleing features of your hardware to bring frame rates out of the low teens and back around or above 60FPS. For me, the dated look and feel of this game doesn't justify the headache.			",380,86,14,65,29,3,78

												I can't pull myself to finish it. At first the combat was fast and intense and had a really cool slow-motion function, until I realized that the next five hours were exactly the same. The game became blisteringly boring. The horror isn't scary, the graphics are mediocre, the combat is repetative (slow-mo, shoot them all, back to real time), the story is painfully under developed with so much potential, the maps are confusing and almost maze-like, its easy with no dificulty increase. Overall I would give it a 5/10 simply because it became so repetative I just got too bored to be interested. I also want to add that I hve no idea why this game would be tagged or considered a 'horror game.' The atmosphere is non-existent, mostly due to poor lighting, there are no scary enemies or monsters. The only thing that scared me was...wait...nothing scared me. The 'horror' aspect was entirely made of jumpscare...al three or four of them. The amount of shooting the same 2 models of guys un the same corridor in the same building with the same guns for over five hours made the 'scary' parts so insignificant I can't see why they didn't just remove them. No to mention Half-Life 2 came out a year before this and is better in literally every aspect, I can't believe this game is so popular.			",189,25,2,15,3,0,4

												No support for widescreen in one of the expansions, that came after the original (same engine, original supported it).Levels feel empty, design is blunt, way too simple. It feels like u run through the same level over and over and over..Weapon variety is not very big. Damage model is non-existent - headshots do not work, althrough you can kill almost any generic enemy with a one-shot surprise attack, even if u hit the leg. After you get spoted, they instantly become tougher. I had one guy (not heavy or robot, simple, generic soldier) who got into explosion, had a grenade and a few bullets and was still standing.It has one of those stories that you will forget after a few hours after you finished it. There is only one character that is actually interesting, the other feel all the same. Also, the main character won't say a word in the situation where you feel like he REALLY should. If u are making a silent character, you need to make sure that there won't be such stupid situations, right?Game is quite repetitive, you'll get tired of it pretty quickly. There are also minor glitches, that will prevent you from advancing, just to make things even worse.FEAR was an average title on release. right now it's outdated and broken. Much better shooters out there, belive me.			",184,44,1,27,15,1,18

For comparison's sake, the newest game I've got while writing this is Assassin's Creed 4 which plays fine with most of the settings maxed out. Perhaps there is a fix of some sort out there but for the moment it hardly seems worth the effort and I figure it's something people should be aware of. Won't post full specs here but graphics card is GeForce GTX 660 Ti, though obviously anything constructed after 2006 should probably be able to handle this game.			",170,37,1,27,17,1,31

												F.E.A.R. is one of those titles that I remember hearing about back when it first came out, but I never picked it up until now.  I remember it getting really positive reviews so I was excited to finally get to play it.  However trying to get this game to play on my modern PC is a nightmare.  I run Windows 8, which I know many of you don't like but it was the only operating system available to me at the time, and I've never had an issue running any games except for maybe a few minor graphical issues in Sim City 4.  F.E.A.R. starts up with the standard copyright and logo screens, but when I get to the Nvidia logo it freezes.  Sometimes I can reach the log out feature on my computer, but most of the time I have to restart my computer because the game either stops me from reaching any other options or it keeps me from using task manager.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure F.E.A.R. can potentially be a fun game.  However, in its current state it is unplayable on my modern machine and as such I can not recommend this game to people with a similar setup to mine.			",81,9,3,3,11,0,3

Do not buy this game, chances are better than naught that you wil not be able to run it with anything like playable settings. STEAM seems to think it is reasonable to push games that have been known to have major flaws. Really STEAM?

												It's hard to like this game after experiencing the future of gaming.Forget graphics, forget low-budget voice acting, and forget the horror tropes that have since become cliches in horror gaming. The gameplay of F.E.A.R. just isn't fun anymore. In between the horror are large (essentially unrelated) segments of killing human soldiers and boring robots through non-branching corridors. Compared to the fights of even Half-Life 1, it is soooo boring.The very artificially inserted cut-scenes couldn't make me continue through this game. After 30 minutes of shooting generic, poorly programmed AI, a single scary moment couldn't make me feel like this was a horror game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished playing through F.E.A.R. With a title like that, I expected a shooter with lots of scares. The thing is, the horror in this game is mostly just creepy; I remember ONE memorable scare (on a ladder) but everything else was just... eh. The ""scary parts"" are preceded by sound effects that aren't sudden but ease in, making it not scary. Many times I would hear this creepy sound coming in, then look around for something scary and see a figure walking around a wall. Oooh. As a shooter, I like the way the guns work and the bullet-time reflex slomo stuff is fun to play around with. As a story, I thought it was interesting but not compelling. As for gameplay in general, there is a lot of backtracking and it can be frustrating walking around looking for the exit to the next section. The enemies are boring with the occasional ""boss"" every once in a while. No monsters or scary things to shoot at here - just soldiers. Lots and lots of soldiers. The game took me about me about 8 hours to finish on normal difficulty. Overall, if you're looking for a shooter you can play when you want to shoot stuff, this game is pretty fun. The slomo fighting is probably the best part of the game. If you're looking for a horror game, don't bother with this one. It isn't scary and doesn't really have a lot of horror actually in it. There's a bunch of blood and skeletons but nothing actually horrifying. Gameplay: 7/10Horror: 4/10Story: Didn't really pay attention. I was too busy waiting for scares, lol. Pretty predictable, 5/10 maybe.			",155,22,6,25,10,1,21

												Ugh, what a drag. Want lots of crawling through ducts and the same warehouse complex area used 30 times? Want lots of audio stings and visual jump-outs trying to spook you up?  This game plays like some Counter-Strike player got high and thinks he's Gorden Freeman, but he's still stuck in CS maps... hated it.			",543,111,16,61,44,6,119

												Why F.E.A.R. is a overrated overhyped game..This game is utterly disgusting, a epitome of bad game design. I was going into the thought of...I remember this game getting the best of reviews I'm sure it is going to be a great horror game. I was completely wrong and you will too if thinking this. This game's horror basis is jump scares. That is all and they come few and far between. The fact that you have to constantly press x like its some kind of starcraft game for the flashlight is beyond annoying throughout the game. You will get lost in this game. The enemies are way too easy and the guns are unbalanced, pistols should not destroy an army within one clip. They try to church it up with some humor with the fat engineer ""newman"" and it just comes off as tasteless and unneeded. The game really jumped the shark when a freakin mech randomly showed up and started shooting rockets.. like really? I have never felt this ill towards a game before but this takes the cake especially for how high it is rated. I should of stopped there but no, This game will give cheap free to play korean mmo's a better experience due to the number of crappy fetch quests you do throughout each mission. Every quest feels tacked on to lengthen the game which will include waves and waves of the same enemies that never ends. The games enemies are beyond easy you should just stay clear of this game I really do mean it...			",164,10,2,6,0,0,0

												Dear GenEric,This is you from the past. The last time you played this game, you navigated an endless series of crates and reused assets. You didn't leave the sewers until chapter three, except in chapter four where it put you back in the sewers. You had five possible weapons to choose from and only two of them were good. I don't care how cool you think the combat looks, or how the enemies might respond to your actions like noise or flashlight usage. They can still see you in complete darkness. It's not worth it.

												Gunplay is fine, though a bit basic.  Controls work, but are a little awkward in comparison to others in the same genre.  Graphically, it looks quite good for such an old game.  Graphics options (via the menus) are very limited.  Changing the FOV requires you to edit the config files.  Not the end of the world, but annoying none the less.  The difficulty is exceptionally low however (I suspect this is because it was primarily a console shooter), and should pose little challenge to anyone with even a moderate exposure to FPS games.  Additionally, if you play ""scarey"" games on occasion, this will do very little for you.It reminds me of a big studio attempt at action horror - it's just not for me I guess.

												As far as ""fear"", this game's developers must have been 10 years old. The ""scary"" bits are comical at best, and I don't understand the cult following this game seems to have. That said, F.E.A.R. is a solid FPS that seems to ageas well as warm milk. It does introduce some rather interesting FPS mechanics with the ""relex"" slo-mo ability, but nothing that hasn't been done before and better. Fun and good for a casual run or two, and definately worth the 2.49 I paid on sale. No more. My advice: If you want a scare, find a better game; If you want a b-movie level of horror and some interesting FPS mechanics, wait for a sale.			",116,13,0,18,8,1,5

												It has some good ideas, runs pretty well on most newer PCs, but it's so generic, the field of view settings combined with how jerky the camera is when you walk will make you sick.Play Max Payne instead if you're into the whole slow-mo/bullet time thing, it has a better story, better characters, and better gameplay.With all this being said though, the game does get better towards the end, but the rest of the game is just so boring. My saves corrupted, I'm not going to replay this though because I have tons of better games to play. It's not a bad game, I am just glad that I got it in a HumbleBundle instead of paying for it full price. I admire the effort in trying something new, instead of just going all out on a Call Of Duty clone, it's tough these days, but ultimately I feel like the game fails.A for effort, C- for the final product. Maybe though, it's just because it hasn't aged well I don't know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Old game, I remember I played F.E.A.R 2 before playing this, and that's when it was brand new stuff. I thought the second was a great game, and usually games that come after are usually♥♥♥♥♥♥on a stick by comparison. However, this doesn't seem to be the case, I'm glad they learned from their mistakes here for their second game, but the checkpoint method (although useful) is so obtrusive, if you're trying to get a horror game, make sure it's immersive so as to keep the person feeling like they're actually in some danger, rather than stopping the game completely so you can save. Nothing takes you out of a game more than the entire game stopping mid stride to save and F.E.A.R does this perfectly. Not only this, but the combat is completely♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know it's an older game, but there is literally no indicator for being hit by a bullet other than your life meter way down in the corner (which in the heat of combat you wouldn't even glance at) and because of this, you just die, outright, I didn't even think that the enemies were hitting me, what couldn't make a hitting noise? Even a little red spot on the screen when a bullet hit you? Hell even after it hit you just something to ♥♥♥♥ing show you just got shot, nobody just keeps walking when they get shot as if nothing happened. As old a game as it is, it's really nothing I'd recommend to anyone, and I don't own a pair of nastalgia goggles large enough to see this as a shiny turd even.			",60,7,1,15,3,0,2

If someone were to go back and update the graphics and controls, it might be worth revisiting, but all it is now is a headache inducing, bouncing, ugly mess. The only reason I even picked it up is because it was part of the FEAR bundle on sale durring the Summer Sale. I'm hoping that FEAR 2 and 3 are as good as I remember.			",227,34,7,20,5,3,10

												This series is truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I can't believe how stupid this series is. I don't really even understand how this game got famous. I guess people watched ""The Ring"" and saw that this game had a girl that was supposed to be as creepy as the Attack-from-the-killer-TV girl was in ""The Ring. (I thought ""The Ring"" was stupid). But in spite of my hesitation, friends told me to buy this game. I've played it, made the stupid choice to buy the rest of the series and hated every step of the way as friends kept saying ""It gets better. It gets bettter.""And it doesn't. It gets worse and worse as the developers released expansion packs, you later realize the story of one of them doesn't fit with the rest of the story. So you try to figure out why the story doesn't make any sense and read that the developers decided one of their expansion packs isn't ""Cannon"" (Meaning, that it's apocriphal. Though it's a story set in the same world, the story isn't accepted into the rest of the series).... Oh -- WELL THAT'S JUST GREAT! So the developers didn't know what they were doing, wrote and made a game that's completely irrelivant, not fun, not interesting and then decides that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child and that you shouldn't have wasted your money... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I'm going to copy and past this same review for every game in this series... What a HUGE disapointment. With all the hype that the fanbase gives this game -- it's bland, stupid, and makes me wish I was playing a DIFFERENT old game like Half-Life.			",46,4,0,3,2,0,1

												In between the worlds of the twitchy PC shooter and the more set-piece driven modern FPS, F.E.A.R fails to impress on a lot of levels. PC gamers of the mid-00's may wax lyrical about how F.E.A.R looked back in the day but separated from the hype that surrounds a new graphic showpiece F.E.A.R is a drab, dull shooter that occasionally manages to create some atmosphere, but mostly feels like squandered potential. No amount of great particle effects and sharp AI can make up for weak weapons and one endless office building.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got to say, I'm a little disappointed in F.E.A.R. I was expecting more horror from the get go, and then when they mention the protagonist has psychic powers, I was thinking it was going to be an updated Second Sight. But, alas, all you get is bullet time, which you will abuse the crap out of. Every level is just dull, maze-like complexes with a constant skirmishes between yourself and an unending army of bland, generic clones. Every now and then there's a very predictable and reused jump scare. Occasionally, you'll get a  creepy thing getting dragged around a corner, but often you miss these because you weren't looking in the right direction, so you just get a musical cue.On the whole, I was hoping for The Ring, but with guns. In then end I was miserably disappointed by:-Spoilers--Spoilers--Spoilers--Spoilers-Being able to shoot ghosts. Seriously, it takes all the horror out of the game if you can just shoot everything. There's no feeling of helplessness or panic, just another wave of enemies.			",308,83,4,26,25,3,17

												I am not recommending this game and I'll briefly tell you why.I bought this game hoping for an atmospheric, perhaps even scary FPS. It was dull and totally not engaging. It plays....pretty well. If you want a shooter game that makes you think a bit and the game is on sale, I guess that's fine. However, this game is extremely repetitive with little changes in the environments. Also, it is not scary or intense at all. I will note that I went from Half-life 2 right to this. Comparatively, this game is terrible. On its own compared to all games in existence, it's adequate.Hey, if it is $1 or $2, grab it. $5 is pushing it a bit in my opinion.			",115,51,6,19,11,0,15

												This game is strange.Well, Its supposed to be. But i don't know if i like the graphics or not. Mostly you're walking around in office spaces and plain corridors and suddenly you might be outside for awhile. Common soldiers to kill. And suddenly you encounter killing machines, and then you arent? It's like plain.. cool!... plain... cool!You easily take damage if you run into things, and this is where your slo-mo ability comes to use, which replenish when not in use. Weapons are OK i guess, but i didn't always find a clear distinction of what worked best in a situation.This is one of those hard to understad stories, but it was still kinda interesting. Not that i was 100% sure what was going on all the times, but i it seems to have a complicated backstory, which is cool.Some of the biggest problems were level design flaws that could make you stuck and looking for that ""hidden"" ventilation to get further. I personally had some lag-issues after awhile, which were fixed by resetting the game. Not sure what was up with that.This game felt kinda like Half-Life in the gameplay. It's an OK game. I can't recommend it, but it's not bad either.			",260,55,4,34,32,1,35

												One of the most overrated FPS games of all time.(I have also played this back in the day and thought the same so don't give me ""for it's time"" bull)No personality at all, bland enemies, bland guns, bland characters, generic gameplay, lame tacked on bullet time mechanic that feels like a forcefull addition just cuz someone thought it's cool as opposed to a fleshed out game mechanic.Don't expect to be scared it's probably one of the least scary FPS you can find, I don't really hold that against it, just an FYI.This feels like one of those russian mass market FPS games that you get thrown in your face fo free when you buy a magazine or something. No real enemy variety, expect to fight special forces and security guards all game and they don't do anything other then move, shoot and occasionally throw a granade. Add bland generic guns to that and every firefight feels the same and boring as hell. Here's how it works, you walk around the corner, see bad guys, activate bullet time, kill bad guys, repeat for 6 hours.Levels are bland sequences of empty corridors with no real atmosphere or character to them.Good points: AI is pretty decent, graphics and effect were pretty good for it's time, story is interesting enough but it's told in such a way you won't care about it at all, since all the ingame characters are kindergarden level of ""black guy"", ""fat guy"", ""asian chick"" and offcourse ""radio boss man"".All in all go play Duke 3D or something.

												I cant force myself to finish the last few hours of this game. I have no idea how this got any kind of critical success.Lets start with the port. One of the most bug ridden ports I have seen. A known bug with logitech devices prevents the game from even being playable unless you disable functions of your logitech devices while you play. Quite a few video and audio bugs. There is mouse support in menus thanks god, but many options lack a drop down menu which will require you to suffle through all the options to get the ones you want.Now for the game itself.This is not a horror game. The attempts at scares in this game are downright laughable. If you buy this game to have a horror expirence you will be very dissapointed.It is to easy! The AI is just brian dead and it throws ammo, health, and armor at you in spades. Never did I drop below the allowed amount of 10 health packs on hand.The enemy variety is so low. You fight the same guy 90% of the game who gets a slight re-skin occasionally.The level design is just awful. To many times did I have to figure out where the hell I was supposed to be going because the office that 50% of the game takes place in, was designed by ♥♥♥♥ing Daedalus (google him). Usually I give structures in games some leeway because some sacrifices have to be made to make it interesting to play in. However, the buildings in this game are to far out there to believe could actually exsist. The guns are boring. You get a choice of 4 main guns (basically 3 machine guns and a pistol), a plasma gun that you get maybe 20 rounds for the entire game, or a rocket launcher which you also get no ammo for.The story has some intrest to it but I dont feel its good enough to wade through this game to find out what happens. Whats worse is this is supposed to be the best in the series. Im not sure if I will be giving the other 2 games shot but since I already have them I might as well. Hopefully they will prove to be a better expirence than this thing.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												Nostalgia leads us to believe some crazy things, so if you disagree with my lack of recommendation, try to consider the fact that I'm reviewing this in 2015 before negging me.I have been wanting to play this game for a while, being a general fan of survival horror and shooters. I was also pleasantly surprised by Monolith's other 2005 shooter, Condemned.F.E.A.R. has some nice gunplay, the slow-motion effects hold up well, and the presentation is consistently good throughout its sound design, score, and graphics. It also has some surprisingly good AI for a 10-year old product. I can see why in 2005 it was a hit in the Hollywood Action Game genre.But we've played 10 years of horror and shooter games since then.I recommended Condemned (and still do) because it does things differently that are still pretty unique today. It focuses on melee combat. Guns are scarce, as should be the case in survival horror. It has forensic tools and a mystery to solve. Combined with a very intense atmosphere (especially in the last couple of levels), it's an imperfect but very interesting specimen.F.E.A.R. doesn't have any elements that haven't been recycled and improved through countless iterations after it. I guess bullet time stuff is not that common, but slow motion itself doesn't save the game from feeling boring and tired.The biggest issue comes from the total lack of atmosphere. Many shooters are gray and brown, but this one's just gray. Early on in the game after fighting through 14 warehouses, I thought to myself sarcastically, ""Well at some point I'm gonna fight through a sewer and an office complex I guess."" The next two main sections of the game were a sewer and an office complex. There is also a dilapidated apartment building to vary things up. The level design feels straight out of the 90's corridor shooter rulebook - every room and path at right angles, endless amounts of zigzagging corridors way too long to be realistic, random recycled assets such as barrels and crates, and very few unique rooms that feel any different from the previous and the next. In fact, while writing this sentence, I was thinking of the original DOOM as reference, and I can safely say that there are more memorable design choices with its maps than in this game. Half-Life 2 came out a year earlier and still tops F.E.A.R. in every respect.It's a shame, because I played this game hoping that the atmosphere is precisely what I would enjoy; I like the idea of a shooter influenced by Japanese horror. Sadly, it feels like a dated and drab military shooter with a couple of hallucinations peppered throughout to break up the monotony. There were times where I had actually forgotten the scary little girl even existed since the game was so focused on its monotone combat encounters. When the girl does appear, it can be mildly startling at times, but there aren't any real good jump scares. Not one. The major hallucinations, where your character suddenly finds himself in another place, lack tension because you quickly learn that most of them can't hurt you. They're just interactive cutscenes with some bloody and/or fiery walls and a few allusions to your character's role in all of this.F.E.A.R. has a decently dramatic (albeit cliché) backstory, but it is revealed too late and without any impact through the use of !!! radio comms as exposition. For a game that throws you into an alternate dimension every half hour, these dimensions could have been used to *show* the drama in a much more visceral way. And if the game's central mystery/twist was trying not to be obvious, it failed completely.So there you have it. The game's central strength is its action combat, which still isn't that bad but nevertheless clunky by today's standards. The story and voice acting are useless, and the disappointing horror elements are kept to a tensionless minimum. That's why in *2015*, without any nostalgia glasses on, it is not worth playing F.E.A.R.Note: Steam only sells F.E.A.R. along with its expansions. While a nice bonus, they were made by a different developer, and their stories were subsequently contradicted and de-canonized by F.E.A.R. 2. For this reason, I won't play them. I guess I might, I dunno. Yeah I probably will. Definitely.			",300,95,2,22,8,1,9

												FEAR is a mediocre shooter and not a horror game. If you're looking for a scary game look elsewhere. It took about 8 hours to finish and only about 5 mins of that even tries to scare you. The gameplay is passable but repetitive. The graphics feel dated. They aren't bad, just dull and empty feeling alot of the time. I think I got this and the other two games at one point for 15 bucks. Probably worth it as a bundle if the other games are decent (which I haven't played yet). By itself, I wouldn't pay more than $2.50 for it. Very meh.			",256,41,3,21,4,2,8

												While this game may have been good in its day, it is utter garbage today. I'm not talking about graphics, story, or gameplay. I'm talking about optimization of code. If a game from 2005 runs at approximately 10 frames per second on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 and an AMD Vishera 8350, something is seriously wrong. It's a shame because I've heard it was a decent game. Buyer beware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R makes me want to cry. This game has such an amazing concept but it's expressed too poorly. F.E.A.R is a first person survival horror experience that is praised by gamers for years. I've only played a decent 3 hours on this game but I know a lot about it and understand the plot and gameplay. There are many things positive about this game....don't get me wrong but this shooter has done so many things idiotic to make it a bad experience for gamers like myself. The plot and storyline are great, expressing a horror theme, inspired by Japanese horror. The use of noise is executed nicely but there is nothing creative about the location this game takes place. Throughout the game you run around bleak buildings that hardly contain any color and the outdated graphics don't do any justice as well. The game isn't suspensful at all and only contains a few scary moments (the ladder part). Other then that you just have predictable jumpscares, blurry images popping up on your screen or someone sprinting by you in the distance. Nothing else is rememberable.. even with Alma and her visions. Her parts are only disturbing, never scary or suspensful which is upsetting since shes a big part of the storyline. The shooting is mediocore and it shouldn't be praised for being average. The bots are also not realistic at all, hardly presenting any movement making the game feel like a old arcade shooter. The reflex time element is creative but it's not nesscary to use, making it utterly pointless. The things that make this game good aren't woven together in a proper way which showcases the things negative about the game. There is nothing special about bleak locations and predicatble faces on your screen. 4.5/10			",78,9,0,3,3,0,1

Some of the weapons sounded and felt great, but others sounded weak and unimpressive. The game is a mixed bag of some good and some bad, but over all I lost interest and stopped playing. Although it can be said that the AI is probably smarter than that of what you would see in a lot of games these days. Which is rather sad.			",124,15,1,15,30,2,39

												A surprisingly fun shooter with a subpar storyline and jump scares that really miss their mark.If you're looking for a cheap shooter that's exciting and tense and desperate, certainly check the game out, but don't expect anything more than that. The developers did a great job of mimicking a John Woo film with bullets ripping through walls, debris flying every which way, and soldiers getting bicycle kicked to the head in slow motion.A big influence on the story was Japanese horror, which means a poorly treated woman with long, dark, face covering hair, and a penchant for aerobics is out for revenge by paranormal means. Horror, when done right, can be an intense thing, but it just doesn't work here. Too much time is spent making the player feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ When you're pulled into your first couple horror segments, there's an immediate change of tone and pace, and after a while you just want to get back into the action parts, because you can't shoot all the 'scary' things.

I guess they run out and our protaganist since he is silent from the moment of birth couldnt ask for one. Also this silence could cost his mates lives, since he cannot notify them about INVISIBLE FRICKING NINJAS IN THE HOUSE. But i was done from one the moment where the choper just left me not even considering returning for me, because they ""were talking fire"". 5 seconds, that all it costed, but we HAVE to go with BULLsmth just ot give a reason to stay on roof and shoot more!

												F.E.A.R. is your standard action plot, based on cliches specific to the genre, while being marvelously adorned with apparently dominating paranormal elements, which grab your attention. By making use of its clever acronym, it promises a tension-fest and often doesn't fail to deliver. While the plot is sometimes left in the background, supernatural events become repetitive and the focus is entirely on its highly realistic shooting gameplay, it remains a decent title even after all these years.Pros:+highly accurate and realistic combat+clever interference of the paranormal in the otherwise quite standardized plot+most of the environment is destructible. You've got smoke from grenades, holes in the walls, lights that go off when the bulbs are destroyed, blood stains everywhere someone gets shot.+there is that uncertainity about the border between reality and imagination which makes up a good psychological horror gameCons:-repetitive level design; in 90% of the time, you won't be able to distinguish one area from another-repetitive combat, new enemies are introduced at great distances in the game and they rarely offer a change of pace-story is pretty disappointing most of the timeNeutral:+/- a lot of focus on the gameplay and often very little story to go with it. If you're a die-hard fan of shooters, this is clearly something for you. Otherwise, it might ruin your experience.Overall, it's certainly a game worth trying, especially if you're a fan of shooters. It deserves a 7.5-8/10 in my opinion, mainly due to its unforgivable repetitiveness.			",131,61,0,13,8,0,15

												I am really disapointed I did not play this game sooner. F.E.A.R. Is by far one of the best horror games I've played. That being said, there is quite a lot of useless combat in my opinion and not enough spooky scaring. What was there scaring wise was phenominal, through the entire game I had goosebumps and was shivering. Though even playing late at night, lights off, headphones on, it wasn't terrifying to the point you check over your shoulder every 3 minutes to see if something is behind you. In the end F.E.A.R. was a good story, though there is quite a lot that is not talked about or never attended to in gameplay. It leaves you with a lot of questions even after finishing it and paying attention to everything that was said. With that being said for a horror game that should terrify you, story is really just a plus. During gameplay in the not so esential combat, shooting is very annoying. Even being an accurate shot in most FPS' killing enemies is very annoying on how much ammo you spend to kill vs how fast you die. So there could be some work done in that area and a little more sense of the story and plot. All in all this was a very fun game and cannot wait to get started on the second one.Enjoyment 9/10Story 7/10Sound 10/10Creepy effect 8/10Replayability 6/10Would I recommend to a friend?

												A decent, but also plain shooter in my opinion, reminded me of Half Life, but with a horror slant. However, I didn't find anything in FEAR especially creepy and the story, largely told through drab voice mails on phones, was both confusing and actually killed a lot of the drama. I expected the enemies to evolve into a more diverse bunch, but they never really did, instead you're gunning down loads of clone soldiers and corporate mercs, which after awhile got rather dull. Level designs were also confusing in places, but I don't regret buying the game when it was on sale or playing it through. The final moments were pretty cool, even considering the game's age.

												When trying and utterly failing at being scary, F.E.A.R makes up for it by being one of the best FPS games out there. I'd personally say the biggest reason as to why is the kinesthetics of it all, everything has such a fantastic punch to it, and everything is fun to kill. Gameplay design wise it's not the post innovative, and is essentially a corridor shooter, but it does so well based alone on how everything is presented. I mean, you go into slow-mo, throw a grenade at a group of clones shouting TARGETSPAHTED and you watch them fly into several directions, busting the walls and casuing some occasionally nice smoke and debri effects.Also the SPAS-12 shotgun can literally turn enemies into mists of blood, so there is that.

												FEAR is actually a really good FPS that holds up really well today. Its a great break from the mindless military shooters out there. This game actually has a very interesting story and will scare you at times. Im about 8 hours in and there hasnt been too many scary moments but when there is, they will make you jump! I always try to use my flashlight during some of the scary parts but in some cases they disable the flashlight and use this noir film grain to really creep you out. As a shooter im actually really surprised how much I love this game. It seems this game is either loved or hated and I love it. The AI is actually pretty smart, calling out postion or ordering out moves like ""He's behind the table"" ""Flank right"" ""Regroup"" and flipping over tables or pulling down cabinets for cover. There is a slow mo feature but I havent really used it. There are some puzzles too and hidden areas. Very Fun game!			",103,19,3,17,7,2,13

												A strange game. It mixes horror and FPS action in an odd way. While the horror segments are dark/dimly lit, quiet, and have jump/atmospheric scares, the action sections are well-lit, have action/military music, and get the blood pumping. Generally, the game goes in a horror-action-horror-action-action pattern. It doesn't necessarily feel jarring, but in a way it is comforting to see other lifeforms around, even if you will be shooting them.Speaking of others, the AI certainly has received lots of attention. They lean, toss nades when youre hiding, run away while shooting, blindfire, and move towards you in two's. I played the game on Hard, but they do have good accuracy and the later enemies have a good way of making you grind through Medkits.This game isn't scary in a Silent Hill sense, but the story is good and the ""hallucinations"" are both creepy/strange enough and give hints onto why everything is happening. Overall, a good FPS, I suggest you try it!			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												Really good game, The DLC for it is amazing and almost as long as the original game itself. I recommend you get both dlcs before giving the game a rating because i have to admit they are way scarier... in fear original there are scary moments and you  never really know when alma is gonna jump out and make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, But in the DLCs you're in constant fear because of new traps added into the game, for example the 'scarecrow' monster from perseus mandate that grabs you and pulls you out of reality when you walk over certain types of blood. A great game, i definately recommend it,                                                                                         9/10			",45,3,0,3,1,0,0

												This game is famed for its spooky atmosphere, which all these years later is somewhat underwhelming, mostly for two reasons: there's too much ""wasn't it great back in Half-Life how you got to explore loads of empty corridors and basements?"", and the plot seems to imply that you're kind of on the side of the scares, so they stop targeting you for a good chunk of the game. Fortunately, this game is also famed for its slo-mo gun combat, which is, make no mistake, still ♥♥♥♥ing excellent. Even after ten or eleven hours it's not boring at all to charge into a room and blast everyone into hanging gardens of particles while they're still emitting pitch-shifted howls and trying to snap off a shot. I'm not sure why I find this so hypnotic while the Max Paynes did nothing to grab me, and yet. So for the combat, highly recommended, but it comes at a sizeable cost of ""ffs, how long do I have to spend rooting around in this damn Armachem building"" and other such protests.

												F.E.A.R is a fun ride. The pacing of the game is pretty good but repetative in places. Nevertheless, it's an accomplished shooter with some really quite decent A.I who will flank you when they can. Mastering the 'lean' is advisable as it keeps you mostly in cover and can really save you at times.The weapon set is not too big but is quite varied. Only being able to carry three weapons at a time (explosives not included) the game encourages you to make a tactical selecton that suits you best. The game supplies you with health, armour and ammo enough to keep the pace of the game flowing nicely. But what about the scare factor i hear you say; well, for the most part it's just very eerie and there are some very creepy sequences early on. As the game progresses it gets a little more tense, but at times i feel the game wants you to feel scared so much it acctually detracts from the horror. That said however there are some genuine jump scare moments where ive just fired wildly in the general direction of what scared me and had a few minature heart attacks.If you like FPS games this one's for you; the weapon design is well done, the shooting feels satisfying and theres lots of blood and ever dismemberment with a well placed grenade. If you're only after the horror or scary element defenatly consider it but its more a good shooter than a survival horror game so don't expect too much on that front. All in all i'd give this a very high 7/10.			",145,8,1,5,11,1,14

Kudos to the developers and programmers of this game.  The FPS is amazing the mood and lighting is scary and keeps you on edge like Dead Space before EA destroyed that franchise.  The sounds and voices change depending on your angle like in real life!  Great physics like in real life!  The detail to the environment is great consiering its 2004.  A must have, grab it if its on sale or wait for one and get it for $2 bucks or so.  Two thumbs way up!  10/10 for me!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10 Year Retrospective Review- Does F.E.A.R. Still Hold Up?Short answer: Yes.When I first sat down to begin my pre-review playthrough, the first thing that stood out to me about Monolith's seminal FPS was just how astoundingly well it has aged. Much like Half-Life 2 before it, F.E.A.R.'s atmospherics, story, and most importantly gameplay are still respectible and even outstanding by today's standards.Story:You assume the role of an elite special forces operative known only as the ""Point Man."" Your mission- stop a rogue psychic commader leading a battalion of cloned supersoldiers. Along the way you'll encounter many different faces, enemies, and settings in your pursuit of your target. The closer you come to apprehending your mark, the more you realize that there are far more parties involved in this incident. A multi-million dollar corporation, a handful of researchers and scientist, and most importantly- a little girl in a red dress. F.E.A.R. is disturbing, convoluted, creative, and dark, and as the story twists and winds like a spider's web you will find yourself drawn in and immersed.Gameplay:Where F.E.A.R. truly excels in more than any other aspect is in it's perfectly executed combat. F.E.A.R. enjoys being caught between the old-fashioned shooters of yesteryear and the more modern flare seen nowadays. For example, you can only carry 3 weapons, but each weapon you'll find is fun to use and different. Or how you need to track down health packs although your health will self-regenerate up to a certain point (dependant on difficulty). Every bit of F.E.A.R.'s gameplay feels polished. The weapons are nice and vaired, combat is tight and responsive, melee combat is surprisingly viable and fun throughout. Crucial to all of this is F.E.A.R.'s revolutionary enemy AI. Replica soldiers are smart, reactive, deadly, and always find ways to surprise you. Just the other day during my 6th or so playthrough of this game I witnessed interesting new tactics deployed by the enemies that I hadn't seen before.Presentation:At 2005, F.E.A.R. was arguably the prettiest looking FPS since 2004's Half-Life 2. Showcasing many advanced lighting and particle effect techniques, F.E.A.R. was an absolutely gorgeous game in it's prime. 10 years removed, it has begun to showcase a few cracks in the paint. Character models are still good looking, and the particle effects still look excellent, but certain items, enemies, and locations are looking a bit dated. None of this is a dealbreaker, though, and where F.E.A.R. truly shines is in it's brilliant atmospherics. Every location you explore has it's own interesing themes, visual design, and flow. Shows dart about menacingly, sounds goad you into checking over your shoulder, apparitions follow you about, and all of it is perfectly scored to an oppressive, disturbing, brilliant soundtrack.Package:Unfortunately, the game's weakest aspect is most certainly in it's replayability. A lack of other gamemodes, multiplayer, or unlockables will surely mean you'll only play through this game for it's single player campaign. The campaign is long enough, and depending on your personal skill will take bewteen 9-18 hours. Fortunately for those who find one lone campaign to not be enough, this version comes with both of F.E.A.R.'s excellent expansion packs. Each comes with a compelling single-player storyline that builds on top of F.E.A.R.'s twisted mythos that will last you anywhere between 6-12 hours. Perseus Mandate in particular is worth replaying for adding several new enemy types, weapons, and a slew of bonus ""instant-action"" missions.If this wasn't enough to win you over, keep in mind that even 10 year's later, I still enjoyed it every bit as much as the first time. That's gotta count for something.Recommended.Pros:-Engaging story-Precise, fun, refined gameplay-Loads of weapons, each as fun to use as the next-Atmospherics rivaled only by the best of survival horror games-Responsive, challenging enemies who've yet to be matched by any other FPS-Comes packaged in with both of Vivendi's expansions, easily doubling the playtimeCons:-Lack of replay value-Neither of Vivendi's expansions are considered canon to F.E.A.R.'s official sequels (sadly)-Some environments can look uninteresting compared to othersDo you know the true meaning of F.E.A.R.?

												Take some solid shooting and mix it with some bullet-time goodness and you get F.E.A.R!The graphics (for the time) are great, the guns feel powerfull and devastating, and the AI is suprisingly brilliant, often attempting to flank you, flush you out of cover, or coordinate to chase you into the cross-fire.And, as the title suggests, the game also has it's creepy moments. Not exactly scary, but they help build atmosphere, and they are a nice change of pace form the non-stop action.Also worthy of note is how the guns in this game interact with the environment. Things get destroyed, large bullet-holes appear everywhere, and smoke/dust starts obscurring your vision when you shoot at certain surfaces, making the environment an active part of the gameplay!If you like shooters and bullet-time: Go for it! If you're looking for true horror, I'd advise you to look somewhere else.			",158,48,0,23,11,3,10

												9/10. Some of the best, most satisfying shooting mechanics In a game that I have ever played. The gunplay is simplistic, but literally perfected in every aspect. The plot is good, but doesn't really ramp up until the sequels. Forgettable characters, all except one...The horror in this game is rarely jump scare focused, but builds up to the few so expertly that a couple of the scares are some of the worst I have EVER experienced. Fear does a good job of creating an atmosphere that makes you so very uncomfortable in and inbetween the shooting galleries. This game does a great job of messing with you and making you paranoid with its artful use of psychological horror.All in all, it's an amazing, satisfying shooter rivalling the best out there with its masterfully built gunplay coupled with the atmosphere and design of some of the greatest horrors. It hasn't aged beautifully, but some outdated level design and visuals is hardly going to dampen your experience of one of the greatest shooters to hit PC.			",56,4,2,6,3,0,2

												+Game is a little aged, but it doesn't take long at all to get into the rhythm. Looked great in 2005 and it still holds up today, provided you're willing to overlook a few minor flubs.+Guns all feel solid. The lineup is a little generic, between the standard pistols, automatics, explosives, and the token rifle/railgun, but for the most part it all holds up -- everything behaves, sounds, and shoots the way you would expect it to. However, the shotgun could definitely use some balancing and the lack of an option to go without dual pistols was a little disappointing.+Story is alright. Nothing groundbreaking and it's hardly the focus, but it holds up without any plot holes.+While the environments feel empty, the atmosphere is AMAZING. The soundtrack does a good job of sending chills up your spine, SFX cues are in all the right places, scenery is designed well and given all the right touches, and the game never does the same scary trick twice. I was left jumping and screaming on multiple occasions, and this is coming from someone who hasn't flinched at a scary game or movie in years.++++The physics engine. Oh mah goodness. Chairs rotate when bumped against, lights flicker when shot, and there are even dangling wires that can be flicked around. The biggest moment for me was in a conference room with a projector hanging from the ceiling and, get this, SHOOTING THE PROJECTOR MADE THE IMAGE IT WAS PROJECTING JUMP AROUND AS WELL. HOW MANY GAMES HAVE YOU SEEN THAT DO THAT?! IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS WORKING MIRRORS.-Environments feel empty. They try to cover this up by having blood dripping from ceilings and making it look like everyone there was already murdered by the time you got there, but it doesn't feel at all like a situation involving terrorists or whatever they try to cover the plot up with. It's excusable since it's an old game and they didn't have the memory to have such sprawling worlds, but you still feel there was a bit more that could be done.-Enemies get old very quickly. You go from generic soldier to generic soldier to OH ♥♥♥♥ INVISIBLE CRAWLER to generic soldier WITH ARMOR, etc. etc. The only saving grace is near the end, which is largely a cinematic experience which is also a bit of a negative. The level design does a lot to mix it up and keep it interesting, but it's not totally foolproof.-Shame about that sequel tho.I just have to mention the reflex/bullet time mechanic as well. I feel it was largely inconsequential. You find plenty of powerups for it and all it was really good for was being a safety net, at least to me. You don't need it to complete the game, nor are you punished for using it or leaving it alone. It's a convenient way of explaining why the player character is such a bad♥♥♥♥♥and capable of dispatching an entire army of psycho-soldiers, but beyond that it's just there because bullet-time was a cool thing to have in 2005. It's not a pro, nor is it a strike against it, it's just there.I'd give it an 8/10.			",98,7,1,13,7,0,13

												What to say about this horror shooter? FEAR is full of so-called jumpscares, and most are great. The game dates back to 2005, but the graphics are going pretty well although its 2014 now.The accompanying DLCs are pretty fun with new features such as weapons and deployable turrets, but can not match the base game			",208,44,10,25,22,1,36

												Yes it is definitely a very good game, it is quite creepy for a pretty old game and it has some pretty good combat and enemies. The graphics aren't the best, but that is to be expected. It has some downsides, but not many. It is worth the $10.00 it cost, in fact worth more, but what ever.			",78,5,0,6,6,0,9

												Impressive A.I. No longer will the enemies just sit there waiting for you to poke your head out. If they know you're waiting somewhere the enemies will look for alternate ways and come flanking. They will also talk to each other and other enemies will respond to that call. This game's A.I. component was way ahead of their time.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												I loved this game the first time I played through it.  It had me jumping at the smallest things in the game.  It had good pacing between action sequences and when it was suppose to scare you.  When I went back to play it after I saw a pack with all fear games in it on sale; I felt the game was dated.  I still think you should play this one before you play the 2nd FEAR game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite single-player FPS games of all time (can't speak for the multiplayer as I haven't done it).  Great action, and the ""paranormal"" side of the game really had me spooked on occasion.  When I first heard someone was making a game called ""FEAR"" I said well, if they're gonna take that name they better be on point (heh heh, little F.E.A.R. humor there) but boy did they ever.

												An absolute must for any horror or FPS fan. Cool gimmicks such as slowmo and decent A.I make this game exciting. The plot is highly orginal and is fun to discover and solve as the game goes on. Enemies have a nice variation from militant clones, to ghosts, with a handfull of unusual A.I characters that play a role in the key plot.  Along with the dark enviorments, this game gets creepy fast. Multiplayer is dead, but i remember it being amazing. Which makes me sad that it is dead.In the end this game is worth getting.

												This game will leave you afraid to sleep incase you have nightmares. FEAR has made me greatly change my tune as to how scary a horror game can really be. Most horror games these days are more focused on action than actually scaring the player, leaving you wanting an actual scare. FEAR does something remarkable, it sucessfully blends horror and action into one game, making for a very intense experience. Overall, I'd give it a 9.5/10 on the scare factor, and a 7/10 on the action factor.			",123,3,0,4,1,1,3

												A great game for it's time.The graphics, animation and design is amazing for a game from 2005. The AI is impressive and still better than most games. The weapons are fun to kill with. The action is designed to feel Tactical yet over-the-top badass at the same time, and it actually pulls it off. It has an intruiging yet difficult to follow plot with some pretty cool ideas. The one negative thing I could say about it is that it isn't really scary. Not even close to what is out there now, like Amnesia. Still, a fun game.I recommend buying this game or at least trying the singleplayer Demo that is on the internet.			",143,7,1,2,6,0,7

												F.E.A.R.F.E.A.R. is a very good game you have to play. It has many creepy suspense moments that will keep you in the moment and on your toes. It has the bullet time slow-motion feature, three 'factions' of enemies to fight and a good story overall. What really stands out in the F.E.A.R. games are the AI behaviour of enemies. Simply amazing. They will use smart tactics to flank you and retreat when needed and camp to ambush you. Do not underestimate the enemy, they are not idiots.For best effect, play it at night :)F.E.A.R. - Extraction PointThis expansion is non-canon. It mainly revolves around you trying to get out of the ruined city after the events of F.E.A.R. The story is thin in this one. But it makes up for it with plenty of satisfying shooting action.F.E.A.R. - Perseus MandateThis expansion is non-canon. You play a completely different character here. You experience the story from a different set of eyes as a member of a secondary team sent in after the first team (from the main game). I found the story and character development much better than Extraction Point. And again, the shooting action does not disappoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing F.E.A.R. for the second time, (first time on PC) was far more entertaining than I expected.  I bought the game originialy because of the found memories I have with it.  But I never thought that the second playthrough would be better than my first.  I played fear for the first time when I was less jaded.  At every corner this game surprised me with how well it holds up to this day.The graphics are amazing for a game made so long ago.  The lighting in this game is still some of the best you can see.  It really makes you wonder why these guys arent making more games.  The sounds, graphics, controls are all excellent.  Im so glad I took the time to replay this title.Hearing the hearding footsteps of enemies as they creep around a corner and catching them off guard in slow mo is some of the most satisfying gameplay you will ever experience.  There is also an illusion of level destruction that makes all the gun fights that more viscrel.  Lights sway objects and bodies fly into the air when the right amount of force is used.  I recommend this game to anyway who loves a good FPS with sci-fi/horror goodness woven in. Graphics -  5/5 Sound -  4/5 Control -  3/5 Misc -  4/5			",74,17,0,25,3,0,4

												F.E.A.R. is a science fiction horror shooter, blending influences from Hollywood action movies and Japanese horror films. It's solidly designed but lacks originality.The story features elements seen elsewhere plenty of times already, including cloned super soldiers, psychic abilities, mysteriously returning dead characters and a creepy little girl turning up unexpectedly. The principal antagonist is somewhat memorable, but the story itself is not, though it is presented in a way that does make you want to figure out what's really going on.Graphics used to be a strong point when the game came out. They are holding up decently, but due to the dominant grey and brown tones the game is not particularly pretty to look at.Gameplay is where the game still shines. It features precise gunplay, a Max Payne kind of slow motion ability and an outstanding enemy A.I. Enemies take cover, throw grenades, circle around you, retreat and flank you whenever they can, providing you with challenging opponents.Level design, on the other hand, is genre standard. You'll sprint down plenty of tubes and corridors, do your share of air duct crawling and generally keep circumvent locked doors. Your objectives are usually limited to leaving the area. There is limited puzzle solving, but the puzzles only ever involve finding and pressing buttons to clear and obstacle. The game can be completed in about 6 hours.F.E.A.R. is a bit of a modern shooter classic, but I found it to be fairly average. It's A.I. and gunplay shine while the story is unimaginative and the level design is drab. Pick it up at a discount, but do pick it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon. This game was ahead of its time both graphically and gameplay. The story goes you play as Pointman (or as I tend to call him John since he doesn't have a real name) who is a rookie on special military team known as F.E.A.R. They are the people you bring in when things go ""bump in the night"" You are soon thrown into a nightmare and a conspiricy that includes you, Paxton, and a little girl named Alma. All three of you share a story that is told through the game and laptops that are really meant to be found to understand the background and what really went on. The gameplay is really well off. The A.I. is smart even smarter then A.I. in mutimillion dollar budget FPS's. They will run to cover and stay in cover till you stop firing. They will try to get around and flank you and much more. The combat can get challanging in some places, especially with the honking robots that pratically needs explosives to take down and can kill you very quickly if you're not careful enough.This game, if you haven't played it will give you goosebumps. Alma is already already a terrifying entitiy but given she can take you to a alternative world where fire and (I think ghosts) can kill you, forget it. Paxton can be just as terrifying in some brilliantly lighten rooms and with no music playing you're left to wonder if you're truly alone. The two expansions while they are fun aren't as good as the original and given they aren't cannon makes it even less enganging knowing John and his team never went through the stuff they did after the original F.E.A.R. game. But that doesn't mean they aren't fun, no, I've enjoyed them very much and they even turned up the ""scare factor"" in the expansions then in the original. In all I say F.E.A.R. is one of those games that you will probably never find again in today's world and its hard to create a horror game that is actually horror. When I played this back when I was younger, man was I freaked out. This was one of the first horror games I played and I'm glad i did. Got me into the genere in the first place. I would recommend this and the not so scary sequels to really anyone. This game series you play for the story and the horror. The next games... while their not AS scary as this one, they're still worth a playthrough or two.			",180,11,4,10,7,1,14

												Fear is one of those games that has a lasting memory. No, it didn't revolutionize the horror genre or provide an experience such that the FPS genre is better off as a whole, but it did enough things right with such a unique setting that I still remember nearly every level of this game almost 10 years later. The combat in Fear, all things considered is actually pretty fantastic. The bullet-time mechanics provide an optional means for less experienced gamers to gain the upperhand on the enemy and can be ignored by veteran shooter fans looking for a tougher challenge. The gunplay feels good and the enemy uses intelligent tactics most of the time to try and snuff you out. The horror aspect of the game comes in bursts and segments the different action components of the game. While some of the horror comes from the sudden jump scares, there's really a lot to be said about how well the developers were able to build an atmosphere of terror and loneliness. The lighting and music are enough to keep you moving forward even though the hair on the back of your neck is sticking straight up.The last part of this game that surprised me was how solid the story was. I was thoroughly enthralled with how focused this game directed you forward and how the set pieces were so interesting;I wasn't bored by the game's linearity or it's lack of choices. While not on my top 10 list, F.E.A.R. is a game that every shooter fan should play through at least onceSalty's Verdict: 8/10			",248,30,3,22,10,0,52

Coming out in early 2000's, the graphics make it modern but, compared to today's standards, gritty enough for the 'retro' scare effect(kind of like a Silent Hill). Mechanics are functional, story is very good, and, again, a legitamitely scary game. Highly recommened for fans if scares or just FPSs.			",179,74,0,46,14,0,23

												F.E.A.R. - 4/5 - great shooter, multiple ways to fight out of situations. pretty spooky at some points too, but never really flat-out scary. the game makes you want to be in an outdoor level. minus one for minor repetitiveness. Completed in around 10 hours.Extraction Point - 2/5 - Way more repetitive than the base F.E.A.R. game, more (cheap) scares than action. Ending is incredibly cliche, but then again, maybe it wasn't cliche at the time that it came out. Doesn't really explain much in terms of F.E.A.R. story, you could easily skip this and not miss much. Completed in 5 hours.Perseus Mandate - 3/5 - More action than scary moments. Just use the shotgun and you'll win. More story content than Extraction Point. Fairly enjoyable because there was a new enemy to fight. Completed in 5 hours.			",60,2,5,3,2,0,2

												Taking cues from Japanese horror films as well John Woo action films, FEAR creates a beautiful hybrid between the two genres. The game puts you in control of a member of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) a SWAT team of sorts that specializes in dealing with the paranormal. The game consists of basic first person shooter mechanics, but the game's real curve ball was bullet-time (or slow mo) à la Max Payne. Combining that with its amazing graphics (which still hold up fairly well) and particle effects, as well as spooky atmosphere-- all which made the game stand out amoung the other shooters at the time.Think the slow motion made the game to easy? Think again, F.E.A.R features some of the most amazing AI ever programed into a game. Enemy squads would work to flank you, and if you hid somewhere too long you would most likely find yourself face to face with an enemy hand grenade. Killed one enemy? The remaining squad would notify its members via radio and strategize accordingly. The game wasn’t just a pretty and intelligent, but extremely atmospheric thanks to its level and sound design. Dispersed between the intense gun fights you would find yourself in dark spooky hallways encountering Alma, a creepy ghost girl heaily inspired by The Ring. Sometimes she would appear in the corner of your eye, other times she would outright startle you, and then there would be moments where you would find a corpse with its flesh melted off and hear a girlish giggle in the distance.  Shooters that try to be scary often fail miserably, but it was with great skill that Monolith actually pulled off balancing horror and action in FEAR.The game was followed by a number of expansion packs as well as a couple of sequels (each worse than the last) which failed to capture the magic of the first game. Monolith later revisted similiar terrirtory with its equally excellent “Condemned” a first person horror game that focused more on hand to hand combat. Both games are worth your money and time.

												One of the few games that actually scares the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. (the other being ""System Shock 2"") It took me awhile to actualy  beat the game. (about a year for about an hour a day) I was playing on the hardest setting and didnt realize months later that I had the ability to ""slow"" down time. All this time I was playing it on the hardest setting and just slodging my way thru the game.  DAMM!! (There goes my life hours down the toilet)  However, I will say Its a good game with a truly scary unique storyline. (However unbelievable that story is) I mean they could have come up with a better excuse than a general who can control a whole battalion by mind control and eats his victims faces.

												I remembered this game being a lot more unnerving, but that was purely in retrospect. I also remember being more impressed by the AI and difficulty than I am now. The atmosphere, though unique enough to stand out in my memory, is ultimately ruined by how repetitive the clostrophobic level design is, and how most places end up looking way too similar. There is never a large enough outdoor area or interesting change in location and textures to really give you a breath of fresh air. It's all labrynthine offices, labs, and abandoned complexes with little outdoor exploration. The biggest change up in terms of level location are the stages that take place in delapidated ghetto homes and what's left of the city, but it's hardly much of a difference. I mainly enjoy this game out of nostalgia, and for being able to hit everything with the butts of my guns. The combat it also somewhat rewarding in how each gun kills enemies, such as nailing them to walls, shooting off different body parts, and straight up blowing them to bits. The more I think about it, the more I want to (slightly) recommend it. Maybe it's still retained its freshness for someone who's yet to experience it.			",253,20,1,22,10,0,7

												I really wanted to play a horror game but it is not what i meant. I expected far far more from the creators of not one but two of the best FPSs on my list praised by me: Blood and Alien vs Predator 2.The athmosphere is hell heartstopper, the weapon system is good (but with a bit of boring selection), the graphic is marvelous, though not much variety.So why it's not a real horror game? Because 95% of the time YOU FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN BOTS!!! So much effort, so much possibilities. . .lost to boring bots. Practically this game is COD in a bloody enviroment.Nonetheless the game is good. The AI is something astonishing. I hate AI but i appreciate this kind of reaction scale. The only level not has human bots worth the whole pain against them.note1: Alma is cool, Fettel is not.note2: Crates. . .Everywhere crates. This game is famous for the amount of crates it provides.7/10 Good horror warFPS with bots and crates.			",908,272,23,118,57,7,145

												All the reviews of F.E.A.R 2 and 3 go on and on about this original having all the scares, and this is true to a certain extent - FEAR may be a little dated now, but it uses simple visual tricks and excellent sound and music to create scary moments.The story is nothing like as strong as other FPS games like Bioshock or Metro 2033 and you may get bored listening to other people's ansaphone messages - you can always do the old Ace Ventura, and drop their voices down an octave using slow-mo. Either that, or just shoot the telephones off the table. Decent shooter, good AI and lots of blood! Campaign is 5 hours if you're hurrying.			",82,7,0,14,2,0,13

												+Game is a little aged, but it doesn't take long at all to get into the rhythm. Looked great in 2005 and it still holds up today, provided you're willing to overlook a few minor flubs.+Guns all feel solid. The lineup is a little generic, between the standard pistols, automatics, explosives, and the token rifle/railgun, but for the most part it all holds up -- everything behaves, sounds, and shoots the way you would expect it to. However, the shotgun could definitely use some balancing and the lack of an option to go without dual pistols was a little disappointing.+Story is alright. Nothing groundbreaking and it's hardly the focus, but it holds up without any plot holes.+While the environments feel empty, the atmosphere is AMAZING. The soundtrack does a good job of sending chills up your spine, SFX cues are in all the right places, scenery is designed well and given all the right touches, and the game never does the same scary trick twice. I was left jumping and screaming on multiple occasions, and this is coming from someone who hasn't flinched at a scary game or movie in years.++++The physics engine. Oh mah goodness. Chairs rotate when bumped against, lights flicker when shot, and there are even dangling wires that can be flicked around. The biggest moment for me was in a conference room with a projector hanging from the ceiling and, get this, SHOOTING THE PROJECTOR MADE THE IMAGE IT WAS PROJECTING JUMP AROUND AS WELL. HOW MANY GAMES HAVE YOU SEEN THAT DO THAT?! IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS WORKING MIRRORS.-Environments feel empty. They try to cover this up by having blood dripping from ceilings and making it look like everyone there was already murdered by the time you got there, but it doesn't feel at all like a situation involving terrorists or whatever they try to cover the plot up with. It's excusable since it's an old game and they didn't have the memory to have such sprawling worlds, but you still feel there was a bit more that could be done.-Enemies get old very quickly. You go from generic soldier to generic soldier to OH ♥♥♥♥ INVISIBLE CRAWLER to generic soldier WITH ARMOR, etc. etc. The only saving grace is near the end, which is largely a cinematic experience which is also a bit of a negative. The level design does a lot to mix it up and keep it interesting, but it's not totally foolproof.-Shame about that sequel tho.I just have to mention the reflex/bullet time mechanic as well. I feel it was largely inconsequential. You find plenty of powerups for it and all it was really good for was being a safety net, at least to me. You don't need it to complete the game, nor are you punished for using it or leaving it alone. It's a convenient way of explaining why the player character is such a bad♥♥♥♥♥and capable of dispatching an entire army of psycho-soldiers, but beyond that it's just there because bullet-time was a cool thing to have in 2005. It's not a pro, nor is it a strike against it, it's just there.I'd give it an 8/10.			",98,7,1,13,7,0,13

												This game is famed for its spooky atmosphere, which all these years later is somewhat underwhelming, mostly for two reasons: there's too much ""wasn't it great back in Half-Life how you got to explore loads of empty corridors and basements?"", and the plot seems to imply that you're kind of on the side of the scares, so they stop targeting you for a good chunk of the game. Fortunately, this game is also famed for its slo-mo gun combat, which is, make no mistake, still ♥♥♥♥ing excellent. Even after ten or eleven hours it's not boring at all to charge into a room and blast everyone into hanging gardens of particles while they're still emitting pitch-shifted howls and trying to snap off a shot. I'm not sure why I find this so hypnotic while the Max Paynes did nothing to grab me, and yet. So for the combat, highly recommended, but it comes at a sizeable cost of ""ffs, how long do I have to spend rooting around in this damn Armachem building"" and other such protests.

The gun selection is not all that great, and the enemy diversity is not the best, but it makes up for it in a well thoughout balance of this aspects. This is augments by many fun puzzles and rooms to navigate as well as a great blend of horror. To add a cherry to the cake, this game features some solid DLC to show the story from different perspectives. I only hope this game is not forgotten or ignored due to its progressively worse sequels.			",261,78,1,32,14,3,27

												F.E.A.R: For those that never played this game, this is one of those games where you shoot soldiers, and also expierence paranormal activity. The game itself is awesome. It is not that scary, but creepy. 10/10 worth playing.Extraction Point: I am disappointed to the sequel of F.E.A.R. where it is so short, it is a 4-5 hour game. The pshycological expereience has just been upgrade, it is must scarier than the original base F.E.A.R. game. 8/10 notthing to be excited about, but a good sequel for the base game.Perseus Mandate: This is on a different timeline where you play as Seargeant instead of Point Man. This game takes place the same time you see the ATC assassinate a civilian (forgot the name). I got a few scares here and there so the pshycological  horror of the game has made a great improvement. Lots of gun blazing than the other 2 games. I believe this game is better than the last 2, as it is much longer than the Extraction Point game, but a bit shorter than the base game itself. 10/10Overall, this is not a miss, it is a must have if you are a fan of horror games.

												This game was, and still is pure amazing. if you play games like Doom, or Deadspace, you will enjoy this game. this game no long supports multiplayer, but that doesn't matter. this game came out in a time that games were mad for the single player storyline and not just the multiplayer. if you are looking for a good single player action horror game this is your game.

I sunk many happy hours into this game and laughed at being able to scare the AI which was the first time I had seen an AI react to my presence in a believable way.

												[h2]Multimonitor review[/h2]9/10Everything works out of the box. No need for ini tweaks or external programs. Although there is no fov options the game adjusts fov on its' own. There is suppose to be a way to adjust manually but I found default option working really well.Graphical gliches are farily minor. I encountered this weird camera behaviour when hugging walls and leaning.While most GUI elements are spanned they are not streched and don't distract gameplay. Bigger issue is that ui is really small.There are couple of ingame ""movies"" (eg. the eye thing at the start of the game) which are streched but they only last 1-2 seconds only consists of cheap jump scares.Pics are taken with 5760x1080 resolution (23"" monitors), maxed out graphics and 4xaa. On my system game runs really well even in heavy fire fights.(radeon 6990, phenom ii x4 3.6ghz 4gb ram, win 7 64bit)[img]http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/44230686482662321/5FD868CF002D1AE98539CFFB2BCDC9B9C132F887/[/img][img]http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/44230686482651248/E6444202AFE40A057D51B3E4836C59944EEA9421/[/img]			",61,4,0,7,3,0,3

												Excellent FPS game that still holds up to this day. The atmosphere, the lighting, the physics, the gameplay and the level design all come together to make this a solid classic. I feel especially the dynamic lighting deserve extra praise; there is something wonderful about jumping from the sight of your own shadow. There are a few jump-scares thrown into the mix, but I would say the horror element of the game comes from the creepy atmosphere.The plot is relatively thin, but it works. It delivers what little there is of story and it is consistent within its own universe. Mostly it succeeds in moving the player forwards so you can enjoy the gameplay, the differing ways to approach a fight and still give you a bit of a chill even though you are a soldier with superhuman reflexes.Favorite part of the game is in Extraction Point, where, after having fought your way through countless enemies, a whole squad of them run away at the sight of you, with only a lone soldier covering their retreat. THAT is attention to detail and how you make the player feel like a badass.In short, if you like classic shooters like Half Life or No-One Lives Forever, you will love this. If you want to see what the fuzz is about; this game is nine years old at the time of writing, I recently played through it, and I would argue that it looks better than modern games. It certainly plays better.			",231,83,2,36,15,2,35

												Have you ever watched The Shining? This game is a lot like it. Everything seems normal and sane until a door falls off its hinges when you force push it open. And I have nothing else to say because that's how far I got until I quit. You have not felt such a sense of dread until you see a door fall of its hinges. As I Alt-4'd my way off this game I wondered, what is the story of that door. Did it have a family? A wife? Maybe a few kids? Why is this relevent? It's not. So it's pointless to talk about. When I was told this games was scary I thought it was Star Wars Prequel scary. And I'll be dropped kick by Jar-Jar Bink if that wasn't what I thought going in. But, that door man. That god damn door. Recommended only if you live in a house that isn't haunted and has lights everywhere. And of course the classic shotgun on string security system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To this day I find it shocking that many FPS titles don't follow F.E.A.R.'s AI or weapon mechanics as an industry standard.  Every kill and combat encounter has a satisfying feel to it, from the levels of stopping power and 'oomph' behind every shot to the enemy AI that actually reacts accordingly to the player's approach.  Tactical retreats, using grenades to force the player to move from cover, communicating with each other, using suppressive fire correctly, etc. etc.I will freely admit, it doesn't take a lot to make me flinch or jump.  Some of the 'horror' sequences weren't all that scary however, slightly unsettling at best.  The game's plot isn't anything profound or groundbreaking, but holds up fine.  The gameplay is what makes F.E.A.R. a gem though.			",164,22,4,13,27,2,27

												IMO the best shooter after Half-Life and STALKER. It uses the Slow Motion technique (borrowed from Max Payne) so well that it becomes fun to use it and see the game physics truly shine. The only bad thing would be that some levels can become kinda repetitive, but that depends on the player mostly.It's a great game with interesting characters that has aged well, because it keeps looking awesome, and keeps playing fine too. Also the AI is perfect, probably the best AI in conjunction with Halo.			",173,5,0,5,2,0,3

												It is a great game BUY IT! Horror and FPS are pretty well tied up. Gunplay is satisfying and fun while there's still a bit of strategy involved. Combat is dynamic, enemies are regrouping according to the situation, they cleverly use cover, lean from it and communicate together. I had to conserve ammo and med-packs so it got tense sometimes. Game is really atmospheric and there aren't these cheap stupid jumpscares. Every one of these vision are rather cool and you will definitely have goosebumps.Story starts in the middle and is gradually revealed to the player, there are also voice messages that help you understand world and the game does a pretty good job in this.With a great gun variety, slow-mo, creepy ambiance, exciting story although sometimes repetitive enviroments it's still an outstanding game well worth your money and time that everybody should play.

												Sure,this shooter may be old,but don't let that turn you away from a true great mix of shooter action and horror structure.One of my favourite horror games is FEAR,this is in my opinion the best of the series and ,whilst it does show its age,it's so much fun to play but at the same time can scare the pants off you.The game is told through first person,this brings you close to your environment and limits your view - plenty of times I spun around to check what may lurk behind me.The premise is simple,Alma is a creepy women who stalks you around all the time and is the origin of many jump scares.The story isn't great but it doesn't detract from the whole experience as it is simple and clear - not complex at all in my opinion..The graphics are dated,however the atmosphere is creepy and tense,the game supports this by giving you gameplay that is simple and straight forward - no packed HUD or mechanics to understand.The game isn't perfect as within the nearly 9 hour campaign there are several shooting sections that can feel a bit tedious.But this is simply a underated classic that any horror fan will enjoy due to its simplicity and ,most importantly; a perfectly balanced mix of fast paced shooter action and tense,hand-sweating tension that the horror atmosphere creates.

												This was a pretty good game. It's a really good shooter and I like the slow mo power your character could enable thanks to his enhanced flexes. It was fun taking out a room full of soldiers in slow mo before they can take a shot at you, and hear they say ""He's too fast for us."" The story is pretty good too. At times you can get a pretty good jump from something scary jumping at you. The AI was pretty good and would actually try to flank you. It woudln't be uncommon for you to end up having enemies sneak up on you from behind. There is a decent assortment of weapons, each which are effective against certain types of units. The graphics are still decent. I played this before, longer than the time listed on this account. I would give it a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Discovered soon to be a great game. Very enjoyable, not many FPS like this around.[Goodies]- Spooky in an smart way- Great Hardcore Gameplay and Action moves- Does not really have a ""storyline"", but does have story. ( We start to be aware of it together with the gameplay feelings and events)- There is no destinction, but we can play more Tactical or Agressive.- Graphics: Old game? you will forget that soon.. Its graphics still kick butts!- Sound: They're just awesome. They multiply the spooky-factor and actively change our gameplay.( you can listen to enemies going coward or motived over killing you; ..and i love the ""...f##k.."" when they realize they cant escape a well placed granade )[So so]Music: Its not awesome nor bad, but serves its porpuse well.PlayTime: 22 hours (enjoying the game, exploring every corner.. screeshoting the gore and playing football with enemy heads)Score: 8 / 10--------------------------------------Extration Point Expansion--------------------------------------[Goodie]This expansion starts right where the main game ended. After all that kickass and explosions our mission is to get the hell outta this mess! We soon discover our greatest enemy is not gone.Things that changed:Some things will change a bit, like the introduction of mini-turrets but it remains mostly the same.[So So]Story: I found this expansion lacking a little more story elements, still advise to play if you dont want to miss a thing :)PlayTime: 8 hours (enjoying the game, getting scared like a little girl.. screeshoting the gore and cleaning my pants multiple times)Score: 7 / 10--------------------------------------Perseus Mandate Expansion--------------------------------------We are assigned to a new mission that.. has everything to do with our character. [Goodie]Almost as big as the main FEAR.. hurray!Story: It gets back the story details, and doesnt seem a little forced anymore, unlike the 1st expansion.Bonus missions: We get some short bonus missions/challenges that are also fun to play. I said fun.. not easy hehe.PlayTime: 16 hours (enjoying the game, being picky about how to blow enemies up, and struggling for my life at the end of the game)Score: 7.5 / 10			",197,34,4,38,20,3,49

												STORY:F.E.A.R. starts players off by putting them in the shoes of a faceless soldier that no one seems to like and also has 'very good reflexes.' Across a city that I don't believe is ever named, you and your squad run around killing soldiers that don't seem to have any real significance whatsoever, as well as seeing haunting images of corpses and this weird little girl that's just standing there all the time. If you play a game for its story, stay away from F.E.A.R. This game makes the Gears of War franchise look like a literary masterpiece.GRAPHICS:Though old and outdated, the game still looks fairly good. Character models stand out as the best moving visuals, but what really stands out are the bloodied, corpse-ridden halls and rooms you'll come across throughout your journey. The horrific sights of grissly murder stand out amongst the best of gaming's horror environments.GAMEPLAY:This part is more or less good and bad. The gunplay is clunky and awkward (luckily, it was significantly improved in the sequels) and you'll find many of your deaths due to the bad gameplay. However, the enemy AI are absolutely amazing. They'll react to your footsteps, so crouching in areas where they're unbeknownst to your presence is a good idea. If they see your flashlight, they'll react to it and dive to the sides, taking cover before you can squeeze of a shot. They'll flank, rush, and suppress your positions. The monster AI is lackluster in comparison to the human AI, however, and the jump scares in the game fall flat. This is more action than horror.VERDICT:With a terrible story, boring jump scares and awful gunplay, F.E.A.R.'s replay value is very low. However, environment eye candy, fantastic AI and subpar multiplayer (assuming you can find anyone online) give this game at 6.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think it's one of the very few first person games, where you can see your body. Even for a game released in 2005, the physics, lighting and especially AI, don't disappoint. If you're into FPS games, get F.E.A.R.; it's deliciously good.			",123,8,3,7,7,0,6

												It is a great game BUY IT! Horror and FPS are pretty well tied up. Gunplay is satisfying and fun while there's still a bit of strategy involved. Combat is dynamic, enemies are regrouping according to the situation, they cleverly use cover, lean from it and communicate together. I had to conserve ammo and med-packs so it got tense sometimes. Game is really atmospheric and there aren't these cheap stupid jumpscares. Every one of these vision are rather cool and you will definitely have goosebumps.Story starts in the middle and is gradually revealed to the player, there are also voice messages that help you understand world and the game does a pretty good job in this.With a great gun variety, slow-mo, creepy ambiance, exciting story although sometimes repetitive enviroments it's still an outstanding game well worth your money and time that everybody should play.

												FEAR tries to be different to normal FPS games by trying to be add a horror/psycological aspect to it. Whilst the sections where you encounter Alma Wade are sometimes creepy, it doesn't vindicate it to be a scary game, especially when the majority of the game is just shooting people in low light areas. Plus when you are dual wielding pistols, or carassing a combat shotgun, during the psycological sequences you never feel in any danger and defeats the point.The story is generic, I lost interest in it quickly and I have forgotten most of it. The FPS aspects are solid, usual gun roster, varied grenades and the slow-mo great but a little over powered. There is no auto health regen, which was the main reason for me getting tense during this game, yet you can have 10 health packs in your inventory which again slightly ruins it.To sum it up the game was an enjoyable FPS, gameplay solid, story stupid, graphics don't seem dated , sound and music great so 6/10. Also Nortan Mapes can go ♥♥♥♥ himself.			",50,13,1,5,14,0,19

												A fantastically spooky shooter which takes and gives to the best. Bullet time gunplay from Max Payne, living storytelling from half-life, creepy girl from The Shining, and some mild puzzling, all comes together so well you can almost forgive it for being so god damned linear. It gave way for similarly creepy games like Dead Space (linear) and Bioshock (audiobooks).And let's just talk about the AI for a second. WOW. Creative, smart, tough, and not cheap. The weapons are pretty standard with some unique ones.I'm looking forward to going through both expansions (included w/ steam version of F.E.A.R.) and F.E.A.R. 2 too. Multiplayer is shut down fyi.

												Discovered soon to be a great game. Very enjoyable, not many FPS like this around.[Goodies]- Spooky in an smart way- Great Hardcore Gameplay and Action moves- Does not really have a ""storyline"", but does have story. ( We start to be aware of it together with the gameplay feelings and events)- There is no destinction, but we can play more Tactical or Agressive.- Graphics: Old game? you will forget that soon.. Its graphics still kick butts!- Sound: They're just awesome. They multiply the spooky-factor and actively change our gameplay.( you can listen to enemies going coward or motived over killing you; ..and i love the ""...f##k.."" when they realize they cant escape a well placed granade )[So so]Music: Its not awesome nor bad, but serves its porpuse well.PlayTime: 22 hours (enjoying the game, exploring every corner.. screeshoting the gore and playing football with enemy heads)Score: 8 / 10--------------------------------------Extration Point Expansion--------------------------------------[Goodie]This expansion starts right where the main game ended. After all that kickass and explosions our mission is to get the hell outta this mess! We soon discover our greatest enemy is not gone.Things that changed:Some things will change a bit, like the introduction of mini-turrets but it remains mostly the same.[So So]Story: I found this expansion lacking a little more story elements, still advise to play if you dont want to miss a thing :)PlayTime: 8 hours (enjoying the game, getting scared like a little girl.. screeshoting the gore and cleaning my pants multiple times)Score: 7 / 10--------------------------------------Perseus Mandate Expansion--------------------------------------We are assigned to a new mission that.. has everything to do with our character. [Goodie]Almost as big as the main FEAR.. hurray!Story: It gets back the story details, and doesnt seem a little forced anymore, unlike the 1st expansion.Bonus missions: We get some short bonus missions/challenges that are also fun to play. I said fun.. not easy hehe.PlayTime: 16 hours (enjoying the game, being picky about how to blow enemies up, and struggling for my life at the end of the game)Score: 7.5 / 10			",197,34,4,38,20,3,49

												So many things about this game make this one of my favorite shooters. The atmosphere is dark and foreboding, the weapons all have a punch to them, and the enemies actually behave intelligently and challenge you, even on the lower difficulty settings. Originally I purchased it for the 360, but when I saw it on sale I had to pick it back up. The graphics are kind of underwhelming nowadays, but for a game from 2005, it's suprisingly pretty.

												F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon. This game was ahead of its time both graphically and gameplay. The story goes you play as Pointman (or as I tend to call him John since he doesn't have a real name) who is a rookie on special military team known as F.E.A.R. They are the people you bring in when things go ""bump in the night"" You are soon thrown into a nightmare and a conspiricy that includes you, Paxton, and a little girl named Alma. All three of you share a story that is told through the game and laptops that are really meant to be found to understand the background and what really went on. The gameplay is really well off. The A.I. is smart even smarter then A.I. in mutimillion dollar budget FPS's. They will run to cover and stay in cover till you stop firing. They will try to get around and flank you and much more. The combat can get challanging in some places, especially with the honking robots that pratically needs explosives to take down and can kill you very quickly if you're not careful enough.This game, if you haven't played it will give you goosebumps. Alma is already already a terrifying entitiy but given she can take you to a alternative world where fire and (I think ghosts) can kill you, forget it. Paxton can be just as terrifying in some brilliantly lighten rooms and with no music playing you're left to wonder if you're truly alone. The two expansions while they are fun aren't as good as the original and given they aren't cannon makes it even less enganging knowing John and his team never went through the stuff they did after the original F.E.A.R. game. But that doesn't mean they aren't fun, no, I've enjoyed them very much and they even turned up the ""scare factor"" in the expansions then in the original. In all I say F.E.A.R. is one of those games that you will probably never find again in today's world and its hard to create a horror game that is actually horror. When I played this back when I was younger, man was I freaked out. This was one of the first horror games I played and I'm glad i did. Got me into the genere in the first place. I would recommend this and the not so scary sequels to really anyone. This game series you play for the story and the horror. The next games... while their not AS scary as this one, they're still worth a playthrough or two.			",180,11,4,10,7,1,14

Weapon-impact: You really feel the weapons. It's incredible and satisfying.2. The AI. No other game has ever come close to having as tacticool AI as this; Your enemies feel like real thinking beings. They use grenades logically, they flank silently while having their mates shoot suppressively at you, and they actually manage to take you unawares more often than you'd think possible.

In between battles you are confronted by ghostly mental attacks, but they are rarely even able to kill you; but more for story.  The real game is just shooting people.

												By far one of the greatest (and saddly somewhat overlooked) shooters of all time in my opinion; this insanely paced action/horror title is an absolute must. The combat is fast,frantic, increadibly visceral and enhanced to a very high level of tactical application and reward by the amazing inteligent enemy squad A.I. The scares will leave you sleeping with the lights turn on all night, and often unwilling to move any furthur for fear of what might decide to pop out and spook you next.Buy this amazing game, its well worth your time, and money.

												When it comes down to shooting stuff, FEAR is one of the most satisfying experiences you could hope for. The enemies are challenging, so taking them down in slow motion is a thing of beauty. Let's take this scenario: you see a group of enemies on a lower level; you quickly throw a grenade towards the farthest ones, jump with your feet kicking in slow motion for the nearest enemy and after taking him down you quickly turn around towards the panicked remaining soldier, sending him away with a blast from the shotgun; during all this time the enemies shout and swear, trying to coordinate; dust, debris, sparks and glass shards are falling in slow motion from the bullets and explosions.While the visuals are not that memorable, the sounds of the game will remain with you long after completing it. The story is passable; the horror aspect kept me in tension, even pulling some nice scares occasionally.In conclusion, one of the best shooters ever made.			",432,142,13,52,33,5,73

												Taking cues from Japanese horror films as well John Woo action films, FEAR creates a beautiful hybrid between the two genres. The game puts you in control of a member of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) a SWAT team of sorts that specializes in dealing with the paranormal. The game consists of basic first person shooter mechanics, but the game's real curve ball was bullet-time (or slow mo) à la Max Payne. Combining that with its amazing graphics (which still hold up fairly well) and particle effects, as well as spooky atmosphere-- all which made the game stand out amoung the other shooters at the time.Think the slow motion made the game to easy? Think again, F.E.A.R features some of the most amazing AI ever programed into a game. Enemy squads would work to flank you, and if you hid somewhere too long you would most likely find yourself face to face with an enemy hand grenade. Killed one enemy? The remaining squad would notify its members via radio and strategize accordingly. The game wasn’t just a pretty and intelligent, but extremely atmospheric thanks to its level and sound design. Dispersed between the intense gun fights you would find yourself in dark spooky hallways encountering Alma, a creepy ghost girl heaily inspired by The Ring. Sometimes she would appear in the corner of your eye, other times she would outright startle you, and then there would be moments where you would find a corpse with its flesh melted off and hear a girlish giggle in the distance.  Shooters that try to be scary often fail miserably, but it was with great skill that Monolith actually pulled off balancing horror and action in FEAR.The game was followed by a number of expansion packs as well as a couple of sequels (each worse than the last) which failed to capture the magic of the first game. Monolith later revisted similiar terrirtory with its equally excellent “Condemned” a first person horror game that focused more on hand to hand combat. Both games are worth your money and time.

												I bought this a while ago while it was incredibly cheap and played it a bit at first without ever getting hooked. Not so long ago, I decided to finish this game before moving onto another one. This game delivers an above average fps experience but lacks a good story to support it. The level design is well made, the maps are straightforward most of the time. It reminded me of Mirror's Edge at times since the pacing can be similar. However, I bought this game because I wanted horror. This game contains very few spooks and you only get down to spookytown at the very last Interval. It's a shame because if it had the potential to be 2spooky but it's still a good FPS.			",127,27,1,14,2,2,14

No.The story is very good. A little confusing at first, but by the end. Really good.Quite touching and sad too, if by the end you look through all the gore and gunfights to the meaning behind WHY all this scary crap happened.Plenty of guns. You can only hold 3 at a time however, so choose wisely.You can carry 3 types of Grenades too. Hand to Hand combat is fun. And nothing beats a flying scissor kick to an enemies face!

I played through this game in about a week and it did have a few scares up its sleeve and all the while I was having fun blasting away evil clone soldiers and using my slo-mo power.The game has a unique story and was scary to me at a few points. The gameplay is fantastic because of the slow-mo power and the ability to upgrade your health and slow motion duration throughout the game.

So if you like shooting, horror (including your generic creepy little girl), slow motion, lens flares, and physics, then this is for you.			",210,11,1,16,4,1,8

												This game will leave you afraid to sleep incase you have nightmares. FEAR has made me greatly change my tune as to how scary a horror game can really be. Most horror games these days are more focused on action than actually scaring the player, leaving you wanting an actual scare. FEAR does something remarkable, it sucessfully blends horror and action into one game, making for a very intense experience. Overall, I'd give it a 9.5/10 on the scare factor, and a 7/10 on the action factor.			",123,3,0,4,1,1,3

												So you want a game that balances creepily quiet moments with intense firefights, you found it. Just the balance between the two is amazing, unlike F.E.A.R 3 & F.E.A.R 2, it's not all about shooting and killing. I will admit the game has some amazing jump scares, and when I started playing it, I couldn't stop. While going threw the game your constantly looking for med kits and ammo, which makes it so much more tense on you, but also a lot more enjoyable. The graphics are something to look at for its year, but even if it did look like♥♥♥♥♥♥ the enemy AI is amazing. The enemies work together to combat all of your strategies, and hard mode offers quite a challenge. I world recommend this game to anyone, it easily made my top ten, and I'm sure it's also on many others.			",162,24,6,21,10,0,23

												I had fun playing this game when it first came out. At the time, it felt like one of the scariest games ever made, but is probably dated at this point. The environments are repetetive and bland, but the action and the enemy AI are second-to-none. And, as far as I know, this was the first game to have bullet-time, which is totally awesome!

												This game is fantastic. It's a firstperson shooter that has elements of stealth and, well, fear, and has a perfect amount of each. All the mechanics are well executed and while the control scheme may be a bit awkward at first, you get used to it. The story is fantastic, and the game offers some background you can learn optionally, but instead of reading a diary like in games like Resident Evil, you can listen to peoples phone messages and download data from computers and have someone from HQ read it to you. This helps with the flow of the game and makes it feel more real. One thing I found interesting was the SlowMo mechanic. By pressing control, you can trigger slow motion, allowing you to better focus your shots or avoid enemy fire. Throughout the game, you can find injectors to increase your total health and reflexes(time you can use slowmo). There are also health packs scattered around which restore 50 health. Unfortunately, the medkits are placed poorly, and at some portions of the game you'll find yourself with too many health kits, and at others none with low health. You can melee with MOUSE2 in three different ways: 1. A Bicycle kick 2. A standard weapon melee or 3. A slide kick. These attacks can be extremely useful in close quarter combat. As far as enemies go, you have your standard bad guys, which get more powerful as you go on, a heavy who carries a dart like gun or a rocket launcher, and robots. There are a couple different types of robots, giant missile-launching mechs and security turrets to name a few. You can hold up to three weapons at a time, and this can become a really fun issue. I hesitate calling this an issue, as it doesn't really feel like one, but the somewhat large and ever increasing variety of weapons at your disposal forces you to make sometimes challenging choices as to what you want to equip. The game is set up in multiple stages called ""Intervals"" and each one is loaded one at a time. Other than upon death, start up, and  interval change,  there are no loading screens, which really helps with the games immersion. The game is quite realistic despite the polygonal graphics, and this is helped by the stealth mechanics and difficulty. If you leave your flashlight on before you turn a corner, and there happens to be an enemy there, they will come shooting, and you'll  ruin your chances at a one hit kill by surprising them. F.E.A.R. also has a fantastic physics engine and almost anything in the game can me knocked over or sent flying by your melee. The horror that is present is provided by the eerie environment and sounds provided, as well as some perfectly executed jump scares. Not giving too much away, every once in a while you will be transported to a different area, where you move much slower and are occasionally greeted by strange, evil creatures coming out of black portals. This creates a great sense of tension that is not easy to achieve. There is also some other paranormal activity to remind you that those forces are still there. I found my heart racing at certain parts of the game, and sometimes even too afraid to peek around the next corner. Without a doubt, F.E.A.R. deserves its title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, one of the best FPS games to ever exist. Although the story can be cheesy at best, the gameplay more than makes up for it. A truly nerve-wracking atmosphere combined with unmatched A.I. sets up for awesome moments, and the Slow-motion feature still works very well even with the older graphics. There are moments where the game's age can bog it down, but bar that it still is a great game. If you've played FEAR 3 and you didn't enjoy it, at least give the original a chance.One can only hope for an HD remake!			",181,17,4,8,13,2,21

												I consider this to be one of the most memorable shooters ever, alongside games like Half-Life and Return to Castle Wolfenstein.This game is a near-perfect blend of action and horror. The scares are psychological, fueled by scripted sequences and blood-soaked environments that are so much more effective than jump scares and dark corridors. The action is very intense and stylized, and the story leaves little to be desired.			",170,3,1,10,7,1,4

												All the reviews of F.E.A.R 2 and 3 go on and on about this original having all the scares, and this is true to a certain extent - FEAR may be a little dated now, but it uses simple visual tricks and excellent sound and music to create scary moments.The story is nothing like as strong as other FPS games like Bioshock or Metro 2033 and you may get bored listening to other people's ansaphone messages - you can always do the old Ace Ventura, and drop their voices down an octave using slow-mo. Either that, or just shoot the telephones off the table. Decent shooter, good AI and lots of blood! Campaign is 5 hours if you're hurrying.			",82,7,0,14,2,0,13

												Updated 2014:  This game, including DLC, has the best/creepiest atmosphere of any FPS Ive played since the original Half Life was released and in that regard it is actually better.  The game engine is a little clunky dated now, but the atmosphere still stands up.  This one is still worth playing getting on to near a decade later.Both DLCs now come with the game.  Extraction Point is a continuation of the original game, though the engine seems to have regressed with no native widescreen resolution support.  That is easily remedied by editing the cfg file. Project Origin is a side story to the game and other DLC.  You are a part of a separate FEAR team sent in the Armacham facility on a reconnaissance / data collection mission in parrallel with team #1.The overall story here is execellent.  Use of what now seems to be a pretty dated game engine still holds up to make you jump in your seat.Play in the dark, with headphones on, on a harder difficulty and I guarantee you will♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself a few times playing through this content.

												Since I don't feel like typing out F.E.A.R. every time I refer to it, I will now proceed to call the game ""Mike"". Mike is a gem of a first-person shooter that many games mimic now. Not only being a beautifully dark, depressing, shadowy world full of paranormal happenings geared to make your eyes bulge and your hair turn white while it stands on end. If you're interested in giving Mike a try, duct tape the hairs on the back of your neck down, turn on all the lights in your room, and get a cup of warm tea or coffee, because this game gets  super unnerving really fast. Not only does Mike get the Survivor-FPS vibe perfectly, but it also integrates bullet-time better than the original Max Payne, and has physics nearly as beautiful as Half-Life 2. After playing Mike for about an hour and a half, I'm finding it hard to find anything seriously wrong with the game, because when you get down to it, it's a hell of a lot of fun, no matter what your original opinion was before opening it up for the first time.

												F.E.A.R.F.E.A.R. is a very good game you have to play. It has many creepy suspense moments that will keep you in the moment and on your toes. It has the bullet time slow-motion feature, three 'factions' of enemies to fight and a good story overall. What really stands out in the F.E.A.R. games are the AI behaviour of enemies. Simply amazing. They will use smart tactics to flank you and retreat when needed and camp to ambush you. Do not underestimate the enemy, they are not idiots.For best effect, play it at night :)F.E.A.R. - Extraction PointThis expansion is non-canon. It mainly revolves around you trying to get out of the ruined city after the events of F.E.A.R. The story is thin in this one. But it makes up for it with plenty of satisfying shooting action.F.E.A.R. - Perseus MandateThis expansion is non-canon. You play a completely different character here. You experience the story from a different set of eyes as a member of a secondary team sent in after the first team (from the main game). I found the story and character development much better than Extraction Point. And again, the shooting action does not disappoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FEAR has been out for many years... but even today, it has some of the best, if not THE best AI in the industry. The graphics were awesome when it came out and some of the effects still rock even by today's standards. But... enough of that. FEAR is one awesome sci-fi horror fiction enclosed in a 1st person shooter with enough atmosphere to fill an entire city. The musical score is near perfect and the story is epic. Through the entire game you get the feeling you are playing through a movie... something few games can master. +1 to the story and another +1 to the great atpmosphere. A game very well made.

												So just right of the bat I can tell you I do not like scary games that do not involve monsters .Then why did I pic up this game?I saw one of my favorit Youtubers play F.3.A.R and when I saw this game and the secound game cheap on the steam sale I thought to myseld.Hu I might as well pic these games up to know the full story.I think you can guess I never finnished the game by the amount of time spent in it and yes I didn't finnish it.The game was to creepy for me so I sat very freaked out playing it myself so I watched a letsplay instead of this game, so if you think that does not qualify me reviewing this game then stop reading here.The game:It is a horror action game it has alot of creepy elements in it and you fight against supersoldiers mechs and spirits.The story is given to you in bits so you keep trying to piece things together but some things if you ask me you got from the firs clue.I am not going to spoil the story for you but it is okey.Combat:The combat is good and if you have played FPS before you will know exactly how to play from the start.The weapons feel saticfieing in both sound feeling and estaticly and atleast I liked useing them.Graphics:You can clearly see that this is an older game but the graphics are good for an older title and it is´t bad.It is the other way around actully the lower quality leavs more things to the imagination and serv the setting well and makes it alot creepier.Summery:If you like horror or creepy games this game will be well worth for you to pick up and I think you will have a great time but be ready for a pretty combat heavy game if you are not in to that then skip this game it will not be worth it.If you pick this up get your gear and make yourself ready for your First.Encounter.Assault.Recon mission, I hope you come out alive			",129,18,0,32,6,4,14

												The game has aged, however, I still found it enjoyable. The only feature that I disliked was the repetitive nature of the fighting. All of the enemies are part of a clone army and generally appear in groups of 4-5. While there is a slight deviation between enemies in various areas of the maps, I find that the game starts to get boring around the 5th or 6th stage. I marathoned this game though, so it might be better to just space out your play time. Don't bother with the addons, Extraction Point sucked and Perseus Mandate is only slightly better (the gameplay is completely the same, only with more gliches).Enjoyable game, for the right price. Definitely give it a try.			",36,4,0,1,3,0,0

												F.E.A.R is an elegant mix of action and horror. It's vicious, bloody combat is interspersed with moments of gut-wrenching tension. The excellent balance struck between these two elements, and the way they interact with F.E.A.R's surprisingly enjoyable narrative is perhaps the game's strongest aspect. While F.E.A.R's gun-play is a bit dated, it still manages to be a treat regardless. weapons feel great and there is a real sense of power and importance behind every shot. This effect is further enhanced by a bullet-time ability which not only provides the player with another fun tool to play with, but also serves to show off F.E.A.R's beautiful particle effects and gore. With such good combat, it is a shame that F.E.A.R suffers from poor enemy variety. While there are a handful of special enemy types, you will primarily be fighting similar sets of human enemies throughout the game's duration. In addition, levels have a severe lack of visual variety. I spent much of the game creeping through similar looking offices and ruined buildings. Despite this, I rarely got lost, as the game does and excellent job of guiding you through it's levels while still giving you the freedom to explore, often rewarding you with weapons and upgrades for doing so. FEAR's atmosphere and lighting are also note-worthy, serving to ensure you are always on edge, even during the game's calmer moments.Interspersed throughout F.E.A.R's combat are moments of intense horror. the game does a great job of directing your attention to just the right spots through the use of clever sound and light cues. while the risk of danger in these scenes are minimal, they do serve to break up what could have been an otherwise tedious string of combat segments. They are paced to perfection, never feeling drawn out or overdone. These scenes also provide a means of engaging narrative delivery, which often left me excited to see what would come next.F.E.A.R's story is engaging and serves to tie the experience together. It's psychological themes fit together nicely with the game's dark atmosphere. Much of the story is presented through audio logs and radio messages, which allows it to develop without slowing down game-play. unfortunately, the game's voice acting, while not terrible, tended to stick out in the midst of F.E.A.R's more serious tone. Despite it's flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed F.E.A.R. it's many parts all fit together well, forming a game that I recommend to anyone interested in shooters or horror games and is able to look past many of the game's aging elements.

												This is a pretty cool shooter where you play some tweaker who suffers from periodic hallucinations. He can get so high at the press of a button that time slows down but it only lasts a little while and you go back to normal pretty quick. His continued abuse of stimulants keeps screwing with his head though, and he might be a pedophile or something because I keep seeing a creepy little girl pop in and out of his vision sometimes. Aside from the protagonist suffering from some serious psychosis this game isn't all that bad, all things considered.			",249,41,0,41,11,0,21

												9.5/10, easily one of the best FPS games of the decade. Tight gunplay, good enemy AI, solid level design (although a little bit repetitive), and fantastic atmosphere. Horror is a major theme, and FEAR pulls it off better than any shooter that I know of, in fact better than the vast majority of horror games in general. There is much more to it than jumpscares and dark hallways too, the game transports you into dreams and hallucinations that show snippets of the game's lore while delivering a legitimately terrifying and unsettling experience. Both of the DLCs (which are included when you buy FEAR) are every bit as good as the main game, and each of them are nearly long enough to qualify as standalone games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shooty shoot slow-mo death sim.What this game does right+ Slow-mo bullet-time and ragdoll physics makes fighting enemies an absolute joy.+ Destructive surroundings makes every encounter aftermath feel like the lobby scene in the matrix.+ Reasonable difficulty, knows what it's about and delivers on that promise.What I didn't like- Horror sequences were not scary, almost always scripted. Who cares about ghosts when you're a death-machine with a fully-loaded shotgun? Annoying breaks from the otherwise fun combat.- Story was eh. But this isn't really a game you play for the story in the first place. ",229,118,3,102,24,1,57

												This is an absolutely brilliant shooter. I played it when it was new and now I got it again. Glad I did. This game is old enough not to be dumbed down yet new enough not to feel completely dated. Funny that when it was new practically nobody could run it at max graphics but now it's super smooth on any decent computer. Fear sports amazing AI, very balanced game mechanics and it is actually scary. The level design is excellent. Not having recharging health feels like a breath of fresh air nowadays. I strongly recommended this game as well as the sequel to whoever missed it when it was new. They really do not make em like this anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have completed fear and it is one of the best games i have ever played. The combat sytem is my favourite part of the game because i feel like it is actually satisfying when you killand in a first person shooter i feel like that should be a priority.If you are going to buy the game play it in the dark at night, with headphones at the highest volume you can stand but if you don't do that it is still extremely fun. The graphics may be a bit outdated but if you can look past that this will be a great experience. This is the best game in the franchise by far.			",53,0,0,6,3,0,1

												One of the best FPS's of all time, the only flaws are some repetitive level design and lack of enemy variety. Impressive AI helps to keep the action fresh and fun despite this.Extraction Point just offers more of what made the first game so much fun. While it is a solid expansion to the core game, I wish it were a little longer and offered more in the way of a continuation of the story. Perseus Mandate on the other hand just outstays it's welcome, it's supposed to close off the F.E.A.R. story with a bang! Instead it's very dull and the ending is underwhelming. Absolutely nothing new is added to this and it has the weakest gameplay of any F.E.A.R. game.			",273,80,5,24,17,5,23

												An absolute blast, worth every penny. This game is a amazing shooter, the AI is wonderful. It's one of those games that you just need to show your friend for them to love it. The expansions are amazing aswell, and rediclously underrated, keeping true to the original FEAR unlike FEAR2 and improving oupon existing mechanics, adding new weapons and enemies, etc.Only cons I've found to this day is:Overuse of hallucinations during gameplay, especially in FEAR Extraction Point. Not as bad first time around.Lack of extra levels, if you want more chances are you'll burn through perseus mandates bonus mission in 15 minutes and wish they made moar. You could say FEAR2 is that moar but it feels like♥♥♥♥♥♥in comparison to the first ones.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But now as I play through the single player again it brings back that nostalgia and great feeling when I hit slow mo and blast the crap out of enemies with my pistols or a shotgun.  The game may be dated but still holds up to my standards.  I grew up on games that didnt use regenerative health and this will always be a gem to me.  The atmosphere, and even the graphics hold up to my standards to these days.			",211,3,8,12,6,1,14

												Ah, F.E.A.R. What can I say? Well, it's an excellent game that offers some solid shooting mechanics and the occasional spook. The spooks, although few and far between (this actually works in the games favour) are very effective and really add to the games already deep and eerie atmosphere. The shooting is just so well done with each gun having a nice punch to it not to mention the slow motion is very, very well implemented. The huge amounts of blood, bullet casings and smoke particles left after an intense fire fight really just look awesome and help give the game a truly cinematic feel (Ubisoft, start taking notes). The excellent shooting coupled with fantastic atmosphere and marverously well executed scares make this game action horror done just right (Capcom, also start taking notes). The story is actually quite good in F.E.A.R. Not excellent or mind blowing but pretty good granted that you don't already know the whole plot before playing which is kind of  a hard thing not to know in the modern gaming world. The music in this game is also very good. Like really, really good. It's mostly comprised of this breathy and low fi sounding music which works beautifully with the games already strong atmosphere. The enemy A.I is also very good with the enemies talking to each other and working together to try and take you down which can, at times be quite challanging. However there are some parts of F.E.A.R that really don't hold up so well. The level design is sometimes slightly maze-like and other times quite linear. F.E.A.R. also has quite a lot of frustrating backtracking which really does break up some of the tension. There also isn't much enemy variety in the game. You got shooty guy A, shooty guy B, guy with gas mask and teleporty ablities and some robots. That's about it.Those last points aside, F.E.A.R. perfectly combines elements of action and horror to make for one hell of a game and one of my personal favourite games, let down only by it's slightly frustrating level design and lack of enemy variety.  F.E.A.R. Final Verdict - 83/100Yes, I score things out of 100. Yes, that's pretentious. Deal with it.			",150,22,5,11,13,0,5

												Got the collection for 5 euros so I had to give it a try. First of all, the game was released in 2010 I guess, and it doesn't even really look or feel that bad at all; physics works well, graphics still holds up even today, slow-motion might be a bit used trick in games but in F.E.A.R. you really enjoy (or at least I did) when you shoot at enemies with your dual pistols and you see sparks flying everywhere, blood splattering from enemies to the wall behind them and then their bodies collapsing to the ground after filling them first with bullets. I also noticed myself being on my toes all the time because the atmosphere really is agonizing. Can't wait to get to play the sequels!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets call this 'baby's first horror game.'  Game is divided up into 'horror' and 'action' segments.  Meaning in the first you see creepy things and in the second you shoot clone soldiers.AI reactivity is pretty good, even if all encounters have scripted beginnings (enemies wont spawn until you reach certain points, the game gives you rocket launchers before you fight robots, etc).  They throw grenades and quickly flank you.  There really isn't any stealth potential aside from catching enemies in the middle of their scripts.Horror elements are only scary if you jump easily.  Game objects will fly across the room, random blood pools, lights flicker, or you have a weird hallucination, but nothing will attack you.  The only times you need to shoot in horror segments are against slowly moving phantasms, against ninjas (which only show up in two segments), and at the very end of the game where phantasms appear outside of hallucinations.Not too difficult on 'hard', an OK game for cheap.

												This game is a lot shorter than i remember it, it took me less than 6 hours to complete this game from start to finish and this is whilst i was searching for as many collectibles as i could find.Whilst this game may not be as long or as scary as some of the more modern games that you play in the present day; this game should still give a few jumps and make you feel rather un-easy. If you are a fan of horror and/or paranomal then this game may be for you.I would certainly say that this game has some replay value as you challenge yourself on harder and harder difficulties, there are also the collectables that will give you some back story; these are all voiced collectables so you wont need to read endless pages of text to find the backstory.Please also note that the muliplayer feature of this game is no longer active and the only game mode available is the single player campaign.Overall i recommend this game, but if a creepy bloodsoaked girl constantly pursuing you to try and ruin your day is not something you can handle; perhaps give this game a miss.

												F.E.A.R. Cocktail1 part The Matrix1 part The Ring1 part AkiraThe end result is merely a sum of its parts, no greater and no less. F.E.A.R. is a case study in a game that ought to have been legendary, but settled for merely great. The narrative is straightforward but captivating, the pacing padded with overly long segments of repetitive corridor segments. The gunplay is satisfying, the slow motion mechanic a joy to use, the visceral ragdoll deaths of the enemies unique to this day. F.E.A.R. excels when it's shocking you with Alma's apparations, depositing snippets of story in the form of phone messages, hacked laptops, and terse communications, and in the throes of combat, where clever enemy AI has them flanking, ambushing, and surprising you with startling cleverness.Yet, the gameplay never goes far enough. It introduces a variety of enemies, from your standard grunts, to heavily armored and armed soldiers, to mechs, floating droids, turrets, wall-crawling ninjas, and others. The disparate enemy types are never thoroughly mixed together, a clear missed opportunity, the groups often operating as solo encounters. There are no 'boss fights' as many would expect of an FPS, either. The game's length works against it here, highlighting the repetitive nature of the fights.The long runtime of about ten hours hurts elsewhere, too. The writing is inconsistent. F.E.A.R. relies on a less-is-more approach, giving the player just enough to make inferences and guesses, but not so little as to be lost. Actual dialogue is surprisingly realistic. It's not written like an action movie, full of macho one-liners and forced urgency. Your mission coordinator, Rowdy Betters, is jaded and no-nonsense, treating the assignment like a job, and is by far the strongest voice acting performance. However, the game's story isn't complex enough to fill 10 hours. About halfway through you'll simply roll your eyes at Alma and Paxton Fettel's cryptic apparitions, as the plot is easy to guess and the shocking nature of their appearances runs stale.The story nosedives with the introduction of Norton Mapes. Little more than a parody character, he's part Cartman from South Park, part Dennis Nedry from Jurassic Park, and horribly out of place. I'm unsure if he was cooked up to break tension or simply give the player someone to laugh at, but his appearance is such a heavy detriment to the game's story that, if rated on a 10/10 scale, I'd drop F.E.A.R. a point, or even two, due to his jarring presence. It cannot be emphasized enough what a horrible addition to the game Norton Mapes is.The gravity of the story is further stymied by the lackluster ending segment. Alma's power is never truly felt firsthand once she is freed, and the reality-warping might of her psychic power is let down by the obstacle she most often employs: the strange psychic zombie-ghosts that float towards you, which die in one hit, and you fight in such number that they lose all impact. Her nightmare segments fail to impress. By the ending, you've guessed the story and its twist, and have experienced so many nightmare segments that hers aren't very impressive. Then, the facility explodes, you survive, and the game ends with a classic horror movie twist. It's an unsatisfying conclusion, too heavy on trope and too soft on revelation.F.E.A.R. remains a unique gaming experience that gets many things right, but many things wrong. It's still worth a play even to this day, but don't expect to be blown away by it. It's incredible that this game came out in 2005, hardly showing its age. It's a shame this game didn't go all the way. The potential inherent in the formula is off the charts, but it's lacking that final oomph to really set it over the top.			",241,34,2,18,8,0,23

												F.E.A.R:-------------F.E.A.R is a game that hasn't aged well over the years since I played my old retail copy.Featuring some of the most boring environments in gaming history and notoriously bad pacing, the first half of the game is a slog. Even worse, the scares completely fall flat and the game is a cakewalk on anything other than the highest difficulty, which still feels too easy at points.Despite all its baggage, when F.E.A.R finally hits its stride, it's excellent.F.E.A.R Extraction Point:------------------------------------This is the best F.E.A.R has ever, and will ever be. If you're looking for classic F.E.A.R gameplay with good pacing and fantastic encounter design, this expansion is better than the original. It's light on story, but it certainly has less ""walking down a hallway"" moments than the base game.F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate:---------------------------------------Completely forgettable. It's not why you're here.			",230,26,2,14,8,1,16

												This is one of those games that really set a bar. A bar that no one has bothered to try and reach let alone climb.Alot of people praise the A.I. in FEAR and for good reason, it was unique in it's purpose and methods. it would actually use tactics that are adjusted according to how YOU act in gunfights and how YOU fight. Unfortunately it doesn't shine too well when you charge in and kick it in it's ♥♥♥♥♥ face.The game is fun enough if you dont mind spending 90% of it in an office building, still if you've ever had a fantasy of shooting up the workplace this isn't a bad way of nurturing that feel.Play the game on hard or above to get the most out of it. otherwise the A.I. will act REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												F.E.A.R. is one of the best games I have ever played. First Encounter Assault Recon has got to be one of the most iconic horror games ever made and creates its feel from atmosphere and an incredible story. This game mixes a fast-moving FPS with a grudging horror so perfectly that the two ganres seem like they were meant to be. The characters, the main Villan especially, are likeable and, in Paxton Fettel's case, downright perfect.Now, yes, this game is old, but I am an avid believer that graphics don't matter. How good a game is should depend entirely on the gameplay and story, not how pretty it is. It's like finding your soul-mate. What they look like or wear isn't what you fall in love with. It's who they are and F.E.A.R. is just this kind of beautiful that doesn't come around anymore (speaking metaphorically.) It's the Marilyn Monroe of horror: Old, Iconic, and beloved. Is this the perfect game? No. Of course not. Even Marilyn Monroe had stretch marks and meat on her bones, but that didn't make her any less beautiful. F.E.A.R. is the same way. There ARE a number of glitches in the game, some that make it hard to continue, but those are so rare that you'd need to reload the game one-million times to actually get it to happen once. It also has some slow moments that get a little boring and some map areas that will have you walking in circles for hours, but that's just part of it's charm. The game is INSANELY scary, too. The little bug that this game creates under your skin will crawl through your flesh and eat your bones. It's not just scary, either. It's exciting with its wonderful gun-play and it's sad with its heartbreaking plot. You'll feel for the villan as much as you want to kill him. GET THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. TAKE THIS GAME TO DINNER. LOVE THIS GAME LIKE A FRENCH BEAUTY QUEEN BECAUSE, DAMNIT, IT DESERVES IT!			",50,6,0,5,4,0,2

												This game and it's DLC are all really good. While it's not a truly horrifying game, there is always a slight tension and you never truly feel safe and some scares work really well. All the guns have a use and purpose, although once you find one that suits your playstyle it's unlikely you'll change your weapons often. There are all the standard weapons, plus some unique ones. You also have a full complement of hand to hand combos (although I never use them) that work well with the Slow-Mo skill.			",63,3,2,9,1,0,1

												I've tried over and over to get this game to run on my PC without success.  Everytime I think it seems to be working, it will start to stutter like crazy.  Just cannot figure it out and have given up trying.  Bummer because I played through the game years ago on my old X360 and loved it.  One other thing, even if I could get it running decently, it does not seem to support my X360 controller without some MAJOR screwing around with setup files and such.  Another bummer because again I played it no problem on my old X360 with controller.  I guess this is just a bad PC port, and while I love the game, I cannot recommend this version of it.

												F.E.A.R. is one of my Fav's in survival horror, this is mostly based on tatical stuff too which is cool. the AI in this game is pretty good if you ask me, and even tho the Cut-scene's are a bit Dated. it does not take away from the experince you get from this game			",244,43,3,14,10,2,1

												This was surprisingly great..It feels like how modern shooters would be if they had followed the vein of doom and quake....It's a bit short so maybe wait for a sale but this is the most fun I've had with a shooter since modern warfare. And a really refreshing change of pace.			",149,38,4,28,6,0,5

												Excellent shooter with a horrific background. This games mix intense firefights and scary moments. The story is also nice, which is rare for a FPS. Graphics are also nice, and the illumination is really nice with the shadows.There is also a slow motion ""power"" you can use a bit like in Max Payne, which is very useful for the hard situations. Regarding the expansion packs, the first one, Extraction point, is a nice sequel to the regular game. The only thing is maybe it has less ""scary moments"" since there are few during the campaign, but a lot at the end.The second expansion, Perseus Mandate, is really great. You follow another group during the events of the first campaign. There are nice features added, a good challenge with more nervous firefights, and nice scary content. I really loved this expansion.To conclude, I strongly recommend this game, specially because you can have it for a few $/€ during sales.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good cinematic FPS! Easily one of the better games I have played! My only real regret is that it took me this long to pick it up and begin playing it!The game is also LONG! Which is a huge plus in my book, and should be in yours too. You definitely get your moneys worth with this purchase. So, unless you are someone who doesn't have much time to invest into a game, and just want a quick bang-bang, pew-pew experience, then get this now, otherwise stick with the single player CoD campaigns for your pew-pew thrills. This one will take several hours unless you just rush through without exploring. I am already 6+ hrs into the game, and I think I am only about halfway through the main campaign, then I still have the 2 included expansion packs to begin!The game is also challenging, so if you want a game that's a breeze and practically plays it's self, then again! This might not be for you, but if you want a challenge then this game should be in your library.Now, the game lists it's self as a horror game, and I just do not agree with that assesment. Sure there are a few ""gasp moments"", but only because the game relies on jump scare tactics, and I don't conisider loud noises or quick rushing objects appearing out of nowhere to be horror. To be fair, I believe jump scare tactics might be the only way to cause a fright in a FPS, as real horror comes from escaping and fearing for your life, not gunning down everything in your way in a hail of gunfire.So, while I don't consider it a ""Horror"" game, I do consider it an excellent FPS that should be in everyones library!ProsGood graphics for it's age.Fantastic Storyline!Challenging gameplayBullet time!Impressive AIMany hours of gameplayIncludes two expansion packs!ConsClumsy default controls(Can be reconfigured to your liking)Game maybe TOO challenging for some novice gamers even on easier settings.Some maps get boring and slightly repetive.RATING: 8/10 ",1069,580,27,165,108,9,134

												This is a great FPS. Combat has you using guns (keine Scheiße), melee (slide and bicycle kicks are dope) and a cool slo-mo ability. You might think that the solo-mo is just there so be cool, but it's acually pretty useful. The enemy AI's are very smart, have quick reflexes and are generally deadly, so slowing down time really helps you with that. The graphics are excellent for 2005 (the lighting is still impressive today). Judging by the title, you might think that there are some horror elements in this, and you are correct. In between firefights, there are hallucinations or visions that are supposed to creep you out. While they didn't really scare me (just one small jump), they succeed in giving the chills with disturbing visuals and great sound design. The only gripes I have with it are the fairly repetitive scenery, somewhat short length (almost 7 hrs for me) and the fact that it took a small while for the game to really suck me in. Overall, a fantastic FPS that anyone into the genre should try.			",199,21,1,17,8,0,17

												I have completed fear and it is one of the best games i have ever played. The combat sytem is my favourite part of the game because i feel like it is actually satisfying when you killand in a first person shooter i feel like that should be a priority.If you are going to buy the game play it in the dark at night, with headphones at the highest volume you can stand but if you don't do that it is still extremely fun. The graphics may be a bit outdated but if you can look past that this will be a great experience. This is the best game in the franchise by far.			",53,0,0,6,3,0,1

												I've played this game many-many times over, each time feeling very satisfied with the experience, but also amazed to think how good the graphics was back then when the game was released. This is also among the first, first person shooter games that added slowmo as an ability, which makes the game a whole lot easier, but none the less it's such an awesome ability to have. The horror elements of this version of the game is good, but lacking compared to the expansions. The game is also relatively long, with a very good story line. Over all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a good plot, high action packed horror/psychological horror game.			",234,22,1,20,11,0,29

												To me, F.E.A.R. is one of my favorite FPS games of all times. I really like the atmosphere, and I love the way how they merged some horror into it (not intense horror like today's horror games, but enough to give it the mood occasionally). I would consider it more of an FPS than a horror game, as I feel the atmosphere and enjoyability more than actually being scared to death. I've never played a game that has given me the same experience as this. If I had to choose my top favorite FPS of all time, it would probably be F.E.A.R.			",102,13,0,11,7,0,0

												F.E.A.RF.E.A.R can be compared to the Doom series in terms of gameplay. The weapons and bullettime are a very cool aspects of the game. The story isn't to great but the gameplay makes up for that. The levels are pretty big and have a cool design the graphics are still pretty good. Unfortunatly the ragdolls thent to spasm out sometimes and the walking sound can be anoying as hell if there is no other sound. Oh and I recommand playing this game on extreme or high at least because the bullettime makes the game really easy. The lightning can be a little buggy sometimes.The game also has a detection system so you can be a little sneaky. I highly recommand buying the game with the DLC because I found the DLC even more entertaining then the main story the DLC.7/10Extraction PointThe DLC was very cool and continues from the end of the main story. So I recommand playing this first before you play Perseus Mandate. The only thing I found kinda disapointing that you couldn't change the resolution to 1920 x 1080 without a workaround. To change the resolution go to C:\Users\Public\Documents\TimeGate Studios\FEARXP\settings.cfg7.5/10Perseus MandatePerseus Mandate is an awesome add on and a must have to all people who played and liked F.E.A.R. The storyline is much better and there are some cool new enemies and weapons added. There also is a lot more action. 8/10			",273,30,6,23,30,5,37

												When trying and utterly failing at being scary, F.E.A.R makes up for it by being one of the best FPS games out there. I'd personally say the biggest reason as to why is the kinesthetics of it all, everything has such a fantastic punch to it, and everything is fun to kill. Gameplay design wise it's not the post innovative, and is essentially a corridor shooter, but it does so well based alone on how everything is presented. I mean, you go into slow-mo, throw a grenade at a group of clones shouting TARGETSPAHTED and you watch them fly into several directions, busting the walls and casuing some occasionally nice smoke and debri effects.Also the SPAS-12 shotgun can literally turn enemies into mists of blood, so there is that.

												F.E.A.R. nowadays is indeed outdated graphically. No surprise there. But despite its dated looks, F.E.A.R. possesses some fantastic gameplay, and firefights wrapped in a remarkably eerie, mysterious story with inspiration drawn from Japanese horror.F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point is the first expansion which continues the story after the suspenseful cliffhanger the original game left off on. In this expansion you get tougher, and more intense firefights along with more paranormal activities.F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate is the second expansion, however, rather than continue the story you play as a different member of a secondary F.E.A.R. squad investigating a project known as Perseus Mandate during the same time-frame of the original F.E.A.R. Like Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate ups the ante from the original, however with less to be spooked by, and feeling sub-par to its counterparts.All in all, a classic FPS that rightfully deserves to be in your game library. I highly recommend. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some time ago after first getting an Xbox 360, I grabbed FEAR and Gears of War, thinking they both looked fun. Gears is fun, sure. But FEAR turned out to be my favorite FPS ever. It's not really the gameplay that stands out, but the story, and the feeling of the game. Even without any of that it would be a very fun single-player FPS, but the sheer creep factor made me replay it again and again. Monolith created an enemy both terrifying and supremely tragic in Alma. FEAR might not scare most people, since it is at its core a series of Matrix-like gun battles and jump scares. Doom 3 tought me that monsters in a closet can't scare you if you've got a gun. You many not fear Alma. But you will glimpse into her mind, and you will know her terror of loss, entrapment and sheer, unbridled rage. Fear not sewers and empty warehouses. Fear instead the shadows of your own mind- for that is where Alma lurks. ",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												FEAR, played thru the game, wow.... it is a very well written game that really draws you into the story and action. You never really know what is going to happen next.... AI was some of the best that I have seen in an FPS, hide, when they re-load, duck into cover... Very nice flanking. I really enjoyed this game.. MP is a free add on that you can get from the site. Check it out if you are not afraid  :)   Bad joke..  know, good game... Trust me			",459,97,8,54,24,7,63

												Despite the not-so-subtle acronym, F.E.A.R is actually a fairly strong title. As a Horror-style game from 2005, is it worth playing?As a game from 2005, it may be a little dated for modern gamers. Yet, despite being old, it isn't unbearable, and sometimes it's outright good. Dynamic lighting is something even modern games lack, yet FEAR manages to make a lot of atmospheric design choices that make you overlook the actual quality of the graphics. The level design, use of shadows, and the sound all make up for a dated look.Speaking of sound, the audio in this game is often fantastic. Bullets rip through the air, footsteps can reveal enemy positions, and the 'horror' moments of the game are made all the more tense because of the audio.Does it work as a horror game?Unlike a game such as Amnesia, FEAR is a horror game where you are armed and capable of defeating potential menaces, which reduces the amount of raw tension usually present in horror titles. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that it is an FPS game with horror elements, much akin to Dead Space. If you enjoyed Dead Space, FEAR is very similar, with slightly less emphasis on Sci-Fi and a little more on the modern paranormal. FEAR also crosses territories with Half-Life in terms of look, feel, and storytelling; combat is often done in narrow halls, yet they are not so constricted that something cannot sneak up behind you, or that there isn't a different angle to attack from.The game's difficulty is also somewhat irregular, though not necessarily in a bad way. At normal difficulties, enemies are easy to rip through, but can return the pain quite well. A bad grenade, a turn taken too fast, or being snuck up on can leave a player with a third of their health gone in an instant - and that's on the normal difficulty. However, smart use of the character's ""Slo-mo"" power, attentiveness to surroundings, and smart use of the game's more powerful weapons (proximity grenades are excellent for covering your back and alerting you to a flank) will make the game seem easy to the point where the player will not take damage for long periods of time. Since difficulty can be changed in-game, you are free to set it to hard (or very-hard), but normal will be enough for most players.Are there jump scares? Yes, and they will shock you into wasting your ammo, I guarantee it. However, with only one or two exceptions, most of them are harmless to the protagonist; trying to predict them just makes you more tense. Both the severity and frequency of cheap scares go down near the mid-game though, allowing players to focus on the action and the brief bits of story (though I have to admit, some of those scares were fun in retrospect).If you want a more modern, darker Half-Life 1 and you enjoyed the kind of tension Dead Space offered, FEAR is probably right up your alley.Ah! One more thing; there is an FPS issue for those using Logitech mice/keyboards. Go to your Device Manager and switch off anything labeled ""HID-Compliant Device."" Don't touch anything that doesn't say exactly that. There should be guides to help you if that's not enough. But yes, if you're wondering why your shiny new computer isn't giving you crisp FPS on a game from 2005, that's why.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recently replayed, after reading a discussion on whether FEAR was better than HL2.  I personally think HL2 is better overall, but they're both great games and FEAR excels in areas where HL2 falls short in comparison.PROS:Excellent enemy AIGreat pacingGreat enemy encountersGreat lightingWeapons*Bullet time mechanic is fun to use (I'M SHOOTING ROCKETS OUT OF THE AIR HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥Spooky at times (if you're into that)CONS:Very linear gameplayMap design is not great**Spooky at times (if you're not into that)The shading has not aged well* I love the weapons in this game, particularly some of the more unorthodox guns you come across later on.  They all feel appropriately powerful, and bullet impacts kick up dust and blow giant chunks into walls like you would not believe (it is incredibly satisfying).  That being said, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the weapon sounds do not hold up by comparison, especially when compared to the audio from HL2.** The maps are very labyrinthian; there's only one path from the start of a level to its end, and the path you take between encounters with enemies doesn't make very much sense in a narrative sense.  I frequently forgot where I was supposed to be heading, and relied on the presence of enemies to guage my progress through the level.  Occasionally the path taken will fork, and the player can find extra supplies or upgrades if both routes are explored, but the slow walking speed makes this tedious (routinely, I would walk halfway down one path, and then halfway down the other, until I figured out which one was the critical path).  I can't complain too much, since this is standard for this kind of shooter, but it is still a negative aspect.Overall its a great game, and if you can overlook the somewhat poor level design you will find a shooter which has aged magnificently.

												Still one of the scariest fps's today, and probably the best single player campaign of any of the fear trilogy. If you are a fan of horror and fps games and have not yet played this I highly recommend it. I've played through the campaign twice and I still get scares from it. To be specific though the horror isn't psychological it's mostly jump scares but like any decent horror movie it will have you expecting something to pop out when there's nothing there and it will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you when you least expect it even if only for a few seconds. Having said that the game does tend see saw between action and horror in the early stages. A lot of people say the ability to slow down time makes the game too easy, but it's entirely optional and on the highest difficulty you'll find plenty of challenge the enemies do a lot of damage and you can't take a lot.The game has aged very well almost 10 years later the AI is still as good or better than the AI in new release games, enemies will run away and regroup if you let them, and search the area if you go hiding, they also communicate with eachother throughout fire fights yelling out your location or warning eachother when you've thrown a grenade near them. They also cry out when they've been shot or as they die, which makes them feel more lively than enemies in other fps games.			",24,10,0,6,10,0,3

												This game is pretty sweet for it's price. (Especially if I would've bought it on sale).Pro:The level designs are excellent and the short story seems to be nice.The fist combat feels exhilerating, particularly when I catch those moments where I jump-kick enemies and get away with it.The sound effects are really pleasing to listen to.Con:The muzzles of the guns don't make that flashing light effect when I fire them, but I guess it can be ignored.

												This is a good 1st person shooter. The only thing I really did not like was the supernatural stuff, which caused the game to take control from me, while some unnecessary spooky scene played. It happened too often, and I think the game could have existed without all that nonsense. What really rankled was there are ghosts here that can actually harm me. No, ghosts aren't real. Only living things can harm me. If you believe in all that superstitious claptrap, this might live up to its title.Good, though, even with the nonsense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, but not the best shooter out there.  The scare factor was mostly from jumps until the end, when things finally got a little more sureal.  That's the thing though, it was at the end.  All the way through the middle section of the game I was wishing for new enemies or some kind of major plot point, but it never came.   There were a handful of new things along the way, but they were really just cut and paste versions of what you already fought up to that point (enemies had different colored armor and took more ammo to kill).  Regardless, it has a spark to it that has it's origins in the good ol' days of shooters.  The guns you find later are over the top and fun to use, the melee is effective and varied and while the story is a bit bland in the middle, it IS awesome by the end of the game, making me glad that I finished it.  One thing is for sure though, a lot of other new-age shooters sure could have taken a page out of this games book when it came to gunplay.  Super white hot shootouts, recoil that would keep you guessing about the next shot, damage physics and lighting that made simply pointing and shooting difficult.  All around, I liked F.E.A.R., though I won't be visiting it again.  I would recommend it to any shooter fan or horror fan that is craving a solid FPS with few flaws and great firefights.

												I bought this game off steam because for some reason my CD copy doesnt work anymore. But anyway, I bought the Platinum Collection awhile back, and even though the expansions are non-canon now, they're still a blast to play through. The base game however? Best game I've ever played. Amazing shooting mechanics, smart and responsive A.I., very dark and interesting story that doesn't result in just mindless shooting, intense atmosphere and it has some really really good scares. And also, the graphics have aged surprsingly well! I remember at launch this game was a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to run!If you search around, there IS a way to get the multiplayer working, but it was obviously a lot better when it was still supported. It was super simple multiplayer (TDM, DM, CTF etc.) where you just pick one of 6 extremely well balanced guns and go. Also had incredible maps, dedicated servers, all the things a good multiplayer community needed. ♥♥♥♥ing incredible game. 10/10 would play again and again.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												I am a fan of survival horror. My favourites are Silent Hill 1-3 and Resident Evil 1-3.Usually I am disappointed by so call new survival horror games such as Resident Evil 5, Dead Space. These are good games but not great examples of survival horror genre.F.E.A.R.  actually caught me as a surprise. I've got goose bums and shivers few dozen times. That is quite rare. And all of this due to good atmosphere and games ability to keep a right amount of unpredictable tension during the game.+Atmosphere (rare chance to feel psychological horror)+Sound+Gameplay (ability to use slow motion makes everything x10 awesome. Somehow I did not notice this feature during first half of the game :D)+Great AI (enemies don't run straight into you while you are shooting at them, they take cover, shoot from corners, try to surround you whenever they can)+Nice variety of guns-Repetitive levels-Not impressive graphics (well you play this game not for graphics anyway. Explosions are good though :))-Story is a little bit lacking for my taste. Forgettable. Don't play it on normal difficulty it's way too easy. Unless you are new to FPS.			",123,36,5,16,6,2,12

												Honestly with a name like F.E.A.R., when I first played it I was expecting... well more fear lolol. But despite that, this game IS a classic. The storyline was intriguing and the AI and actual FPS gameplay was well done. I think the FEAR AI has been one of the most applauded AI of it's time for the shear tactics employed by the enemies. Really well done. If you are willing to go through the dated graphics (and trust me I seriously think it's worth it), then I think you will have a good time on your hands.F.E.A.R. - Extraction Point continues the story where the original F.E.A.R. left off. Again, a lot of good storyline, good enemy AI, and there is some actual fear in this iteration... really there was. Some good creepy moments to be had.F.E.A.R. - Perseus Mandate is another piece of the puzzle, although I think with a separate/alternate timeline of events. Uses the base game so the AI is good, but I got a lot more darkness and creepy vibe with this version. Really warped feel to it. Good play.			",72,3,1,3,5,0,2
