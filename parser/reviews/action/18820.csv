												Think the alternate version of Mario Kart for PC. This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c it’s worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....

												A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: ""EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA<3"" (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.

												The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than ""Punchbowl"" and ""tag"" no matter what I set it to.I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.

												Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected  to the internet at all times in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise).

-Quick Review-Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you.Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though ""Woa! This sound really good"" I called my brother over and said ""doesn't that sound like it has good potential?""I clicked ""quick game"" and BAM all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.Game Play: The first game I played was some type of ""Soccer"" (or ""Football"" for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game.Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended).Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore.Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being ""it"", whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.Achievements: There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.Price the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.Conclusion: AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.

												I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention:1.) There's rarely any servers.2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag.3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.Some upsides:1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag.2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.

It's online population isn't much and rarely there are public servers on but if you can get some friends to play this game with you it's a TON of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zero Gear is like Mario Kart for PC. Tons of customisation, great characters to choose from. Nice to play with bots and multiplayer. Whilst most people would prefer to just get out their DSes and play the actual Mario Kart, this is a flawless alternative for PC gamers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zero Gear is one of the best options of games to play casually with lots of friends. You can't exactly say it's a racing game because it is a lot more, you can race, play soccer, play tag, play pachinko, play basketball, hockey, a weird game where you punch other players in a precipice. Yeah, the usual stuff. Oh, and you can do all that with a completely customized car,  in fact, you can customize it the way you want, no need to pucharse anything. The game is really awesome to play with friends, don't even consider playing alone, bots suck and online community is dead, only buy this if you have friends. Zero Gear is full of OMG moments, it is simply incredible to play and provides lots of fun. The game don't try to be realistic, it takes a Mario Kart style aproach with items and stuff. I like the game a lot, my friends also do. Recomended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is nothing like it appeared to be in the trailer. Steering is terrible in the game, and the physics are a bit off, causing issues when racing. The item box things don't really give you anything useful to use against your opponents. A lot of the stuff cannot even be used as a weapon to interfere with your opponent unless you're literally right up against them. There's also not many weapons in those item boxes. I think I noticed four. Do not expect large games either. There seems to be no single player mode, and it just randomly sticks you into multiplayer with just one person. It gets extremely boring and the challenge dissipates easily. You also cannot pick the game mode you want to play. You randomly either end up in a racing game, or a remake of that carnival game where you throw a little ball down the lane and try to get it in the holes, but you play as the ball. Making characters can be a bit fun, but you're still limited to a select few base designs. There's a custom color editor though, which is a nice touch. This game is a stinker though. Pass on it, believe me. You're better off getting a Wii emulator and playing Mario Kart Wii than wasting money on a wannabe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has so much potential to be great, unfortunately it has just a few flaws that do enough damage to ruin the game. You'll see a lot of people give positive reviews without actually playing the game often. I don't know the origin behind this, maybe they got the game really cheap or free and decided it was worth it and that's all that matters. I bought the four pack for $2, but I won't let that impact my review at all because I see the bigger picture that I'm probably not going to play the game a whole lot, no matter how much I want to try and play the game.The game's positives are many. You have a variety of levels that all have their unique game modes associated to it. Think of it like Mario Kart but much more variety. You have this unique take of Tag where sometimes the person it loses points rather than gains, which is closer to the traditional sense of tag (the person ""it"" would want to tag someone) and then sometimes it gets ""flipped"" where the person it gets points, thus wanting to run away from the other players. If the player reaches zero points, the ability to become it is then in the middle of the map. Additionally, there is weapons in the middle of the map you can gather as well. First player to get a full bar of points wins. You also have this cool soccer ball mode where you obviously got to get the sockerball into the goal using either your own vehicle or a boxing glove to act like a kick. You have racing and probably numerous more. They're all great ideas and were well thought out. The game has a garage menu option where you customize your character and vehicle. Not only do you get to select the stuff your character wears or your vehicle style and its wheels, but you also get to customize everything's color with all colors possible using this box and its slider that adjusts brightness (color grid or something, forgot what it's called). The vehicle styles range from your typical vehicle to a tank, my favorite is the skull vehicle. The wheel options are good as well, some are goofy and some are less goofy. I picked the tires with spikes on them to match my skull car. I have the skeleton character and I made him wear the bugging out eyes and a top hat. Yes, you can even customize the color of your character.The game has an alright soundtrack. It isn't good, it isn't bad. It's just fine. No complaints from me. The graphics style is cartoony, but it's enjoyable for all ages despite it. Now for some of the negatives that absolutely ruins the game, thus its low price and obscurity. The items the game has does have a healthy variety, not to the scale of Mario Kart or even Jak X: Combat Racing, but the variety is fine. I would have liked to have seen more variety however.The items, however, can also ruin the game for the player using them.In the game mode, Flipped, you gotta tag people, remember? Well, with the force shield, nobody can touch you and you cannot touch anyone, so how do you tag people when you need to? Flawed design. The force shield also doesn't protect you from everything but rather the players actual vehicle, so bombs and stuff appear to still hit you... unless that's a bug. Additionally, some weapons help the player you're using them against more than yourself. Bombs, for example, can blow the player forward and they have a fast enough recovery where you still wont catch up to them. Mario Kart did it right where you, despite it being unrealistic, fly upwards more to slow you down. This, I imagine, can be even more frustrating in a racing game where you push a player ahead of you rather than help you. The items could use a bit of a revamp, perhaps even a filter for specific maps. For example, the Kickit map only has punching bags, perhaps flipped should only give the shield to players that can use it for their best interests or not have it at all.The second worst thing about the game is the camera. I use a controller because mouse and keyboard just doesn't make sense for some games, racing being one of them (wheel>controller>mouse and keyboard). However, both mouse and keyboard have this same issue, the camera is just too frustrating. You could reverse and it IMMEDIATELY snaps backwards but sluggishly continues forward. It should be a bit faster snapping towards the direction you're driving. You could try to turn and the camera feels a bit off, it's hard to see where you're going, especially when chasing someone on an open map. You can use the mouse to move the camera, which is actually good. The controller, however, is painfully useless. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing racing game and they somehow made the camera horrible for controller players. The absolute worse of the game that just ruins it entirely, no matter how many positives, is the controls. The controls make the game so unplayable that you'll have to relearn everything you have ever gotten from driving games. The turning specifically. The turn isn't imemdiate, there is input lag. This input lag is frustrating. It makes timing really hard. You know what's worse? The way the turns work. You LUNGE left or right. There isn't a good system of turning because there isn't an easy way to turn slightly left or right, you'll probably zig zag around stuff you're trying to get because of it. There is jumping and *kinda* drifting that *kinda* makes things easier, but not by enough. You'll have to invest a lot of time to get used to the game and even then I don't think you'll fluently be able to drive to what you are targeting. Online community doesn't exist. No players online. That's probably because of the turning controls and what not. When hosting your own game, I notice that, even as host, I lag with my friend. I only had problems with him, so that suggests that maybe there is some type of connection similar to Super Smash Brothers Brawl. That's not a good thing, especially since it causes not just me but my friend to teleport, reset all over the place, or go under the map. That's not something the host should go through. If the developer would invest the time to, at least, fix the camera and controls to be less frustrating, the game would be able to get sales, easily, without having to sell a 4 pack for $2. However, the game seems to be dead both online and the developer side. I really like the idea, but I refuse to say it's worth buying no matter how many laughs I had with my friends because I was more frustrated with the controls than I was having fun. Not to mention the laughs my friends and I were making were more related to how bad and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the game is. If you're adventureous, you might wanna try buying the game on sale to experience it yourself. If you're looking for a good PC Mario Kart or something, look elsewhere because this is not it.edit: to update, this game is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ However, my friends and I never touch it because other games, like Rocket League, are better. Don't bother with this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been asked time and time again to review this game simply because of the controversy it has. I want to say before I review this I am a straight non white male and I have checked my privilege . Ok now that we have that out the way let's start the review. Zero Gear Solid: interplanetary Global Warfare is a multiplayer racing game with a strong single player that has layers of depth that I've never seen in a video game before.THE STORY: There is two factions the blue which fight for equal rights for all races, genders, and sexual orientations. The red fights only for the white straight privilege and for political freedom for the panda race which has recently been discovered in a secret lab in naughty Korea. The pandas have superior brain function and can rationalize thoughts before we can and they have decided that we settle the war in a test of strength and will power. THE ZERO GEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Zero  Gear is the missing link between kart racing games and Gone Home because you either win the series a hero or go home a lesbian CIS scum.THE GAMEPLAY: The game play is superb, the combat is a mix between counter strike and the CQC from Metal Gear Solid 3: The Twin Snakes. You start out with 2 weapons a gun and a knife, the gun is dependent on your rank and which team you spawn as. If you have just started red will have a 1911 with a switch blade while blue will have a glock and a Ninjatō. They both have their pros and cons but blue is a bit stronger in my opinion with their strong CQC take down. The driving is really like you're driving a kart!  The turning is tighter than a 3-year-old and the drifting is like real-life  You can't  .THE SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack was produced by none other than Aphex Twin! unfortunately they could only afford one full length song so that's what you get. There is shorter snippets and those produced by my homie Madlib. On the soundtrack I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one, if you've heard the soundtrack what did you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why? The Soundtracks for the Zero Gear over the Court of the Crimson Trout Mask..............................Forever.OVERALL: I think this a pretty fun game for 99 cents but anything above that is kinda eeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh. This game is fun with the mates and LANing it would stop the lag issues. I'm feeling a solid 7 on this one.PROS:FUN WITH MATESDEEP STORYCAN MAKE A PANDA DRIVING A SHOE WITH SHOE WHEELSCONS:LAG SPIKES CAN PUT YOU FROM 1ST PLACE TO LAST♥♥♥♥ING DEV ABANDONED THIS GAME ;_;ONLY A COUPLE MAPS AND NO MOD SUPPORT			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually pretty good game.The developers seem to have abandoned it to work on iOS trash, and there's hardly ever anyone online, but there is a custom map-making tool and a bunch of custom fan-made characters and hats and stuff out there.The racing isn't as ""tight"" as Mario Kart or Sonic Allstars (well, at least it doesn't have boatin' and flyan), yet it is good fun, and since all movement is physics-based, arena modes like football or tag can be heaps of joy.The game officially supports 8 players, but just change that one variable in the server.txt and you can play with up to 15 friends online.The lack of splitscreen is a minus.

												What do you expect from a race game? Well one thing is for sure you probably didn't think about ice cubes, tornado's or loving robots and yet that is what Zero Gear is. It is a really fun game to play with a low amount of players, however the gameplay gets repetitive and quickly boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The closest you'll get to Mario Kart on the PC. The developers NimbleBit are now renowned for their mobile games but this is where they started. They may deny it now but they really had something here and it's a shame to see that there is no additional support. There could've been tons of DLC in-terms of both cosmetic items or tracks. The online feature here is incredible it's a great game to play with a group of friends, myself and a few friends played this every day for weeks before it got repitive. Even then a few of us loved it so much we tried to create our own tracks by looking through the map files built-in to the game.  If the four pack is on sale it's a must buy for sure but it will get repitive after a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zero Gear ist ein sehr spaßiges, multiplayerbasiertes Rennspiele alá Mario Kart. In verschiedenen Disziplinen, wie Rennen, Pachinko, Football, Boxen, etc. tritt der Spieler gegen Fremde, Freunde und Bots an. Leider ist der Online Modus so gut wie ausgestorben, aber wenn man ein paar Freunde zum Mitspielen hat, macht es immernoch sehr viel Spaß. Ich habe selten so viel bei einem Spiel gelacht.Zero Gear is a multiplayer kart racing game like Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, but for PC! You play in various game mode against strangers, friends and bots to optain the victory. All in all it is very funny to play with your friends, even if the multiplayer is dead. You will laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off every time, kicking your friend out of the track.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I went into this game expecting a mix between little big planet and mario kart. To keep it short, it is neither. It's a basic racing game with power-ups that barely work and are uninteresting. There are no more online servers, so I was playing against bot the whole time. Was getting a bit bored, but then...SOCCER WITH CARS! The concept has grasped me since the dawn of ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars"" and I've wanted something like this ever since. They did it on Top Gear and now I can do it n my PC! The mode is great fun, but nothing like the playstation game. You get an arena and a boxing glove power-up. If you have a playstation, get the supersonic game. If you don't this might entertain you. But not more than 99 cents worth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a kart-racing game which can be enjoyed alone or with friends, I'd say with this game you've struck gold.As simplistic as it is it's incredibly enjoyable and with the price, it's basically a steal for the amount of fun you could have with this game. The customization is impressive and creative and gives the player a chance to make their little avatar unique! I can basically assure you that unless someone specifically tried to, you would not have two avatars that looked exactly the same. With a wide range of colorful and fun accessories, karts, wheels, racers AND hats, you're sure to have a blast with it!Multi-player can be a blast with this game and your bound to lose track of time. Each track this game has to offer has the replay value X1,000,000 and there's a little bit of something for everyone! A few even have shortcuts, so keep your eyes peeled! If you haven't guessed by the ""About the game"" section, there's more than 1 gamemode to enjoy! So if racing isn't your cup-of-tea, there's other things to enjoy. 10/10 would GREATLY recommend this game to ANYONE!Happy racing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BUT: controlling and timing feel awkward (when trying to change directions, the car reacts way too harsh) and multiplayer is pretty much dead, so you better have some friends to play the game with, because playing with bots does not feel rewarding - especially since there is no singleplayer campaign whatsoever.

												Zero Gear could be a very interesting cart combat game with a lot of well implemented things: Creative courses, funny gamemodes, many customization possibilites. BUT: controlling and timing feel awkward (when trying to change directions, the car reacts way too harsh) and multiplayer is pretty much dead, so you better have some friends to play the game with, because playing with bots does not feel rewarding - especially since there is no singleplayer campaign whatsoever.

												So to start off dont spend $5 on this game, wait for a sale.  This game however is moderitly fun and worth a dollar.  The miny games that everyone complains about are tons of fun.   My only complaint is the online is nearly dead andthe bots suck♥♥♥♥♥  6/10 and definatly worth a dollar... not five.			",226,43,5,29,17,3,12

												Zero Gear is a multiplayer kart racing game with only 1 active server left. It's basically a clone of Mario Kart, but Zero Gear does offer different modes, customization and some other small features. The racing, however, is terrible. I don't know if this game is aiming to be a realistic kart game, or just another arcade racer, but in any case; it just doesn't work. I lost count of how many times I *tried* to collect a power-up, only to miss it 80% of the times. 'What ?! That's ridiculous !' I kept telling myself. 'Maybe with some practice', I thought. Well, that helped only a little unfortunately.If you release a kart racer where you can't even properly race then you basically know it's a waste of time. Zero Gear = waste of time.[Rating: 47/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this is what Nimblebit were making before Tiny Tower and all that other garbage! Flimsy as ♥♥♥♥ and not as much fun as it looks like it is. It's also multiplayer-only, which means unless you like playing with stupid-as-pies AI, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck because it's a virtual ghost town. So in summary, why not put on your cargo shorts, waddle down onto the comic book shop, and play pretend with the Warhammer 40k miniatures? It's more fun than this is going to be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is game is really fun and had a lot of potential but the developers gave up on it, so intern the game slowly died. But if you and some of your buddies have it, it will make a great multiplayer game.			",303,79,22,28,33,3,46
