												One of the best tactical shooter ever and 2nd best in Rainbow series after Rainbow Six 3.Great scope for tactics. Very nice customization.Teammates don't run into your line of fire or block you, like they do in Vegas 2.Teamwork feels so good! Multiplayer is still alive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hardcore gaming carrier started with this game...When I saw the games trailer on youtube it made me work trough my whole summer vacation with my dad for a new pc in order to play this game, I was 16 years old.In this game I have met with my best friend and had a lot of good times and last but not least me, my brother and my friend were one of the best players in the game.It was an unfortunate that the game didnt have good servers so we always had to deal with the high latency but still I think it was the best fps shooter in its time, the story and the online game mods, character designs were unique and still a lots of games today miss these playable options...10/10 would breach trough the window again! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game. This and it's sequel are the only Rainbow Six games I've played, so I can't say that the original ones are better or anything like that. What I can say is that if your preference for games is Call of Duty and you don't want to expand your horizons, then stay far away from this game. But.. if you want a challenge with a gripping story line, lots of replay value (I've done the campaign three times now, and about 70 hours of terrorist hunt). It is a step between your run of the mill shooters and super stealth games (like Splinter Cell). You can run and gun and make it.. but it is very difficult.. but by the same token, you don't have to wait for minutes studying patrols movements. Bottom line.. I'm anxiously awaiting the next Rainbow Six installment (if it ever comes out), because I enjoyed this game so much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A great shooterAlthough this isn’t the most tactical shooter, it is still great fun to play as a whole and online. It has its greats moments, however it is possible for this game to become a twitch shooter and there are a number of things that held the game back from being great.- Weird AI movements and actions- Your own squad members making silly remarks- Voice acting isn’t too great- Good graphics			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Rainbow six series was one of the first video game series I ever played; I love the sense of realism you get from them, compared to stale first person shooters. Rainbow Six Vegas has a very entertaining story. Near the end of the first mission I was hooked; I grew quite attached to the main character Logan he was enjoyable to play as. I found myself constantly changing my loadout for the mission, no gun is without purpose. If you ever have ten dollars lying around, I’d suggest you pick up this or its sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Play Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon, run this game as an adminMajor Theme: An old yet reasonable console port with meatBought at Price: $5 - bought during Steam saleThrowing ""Tom Clancy's"" on a title usually means that the game is going to have some meat, or say solid content to it. The only downside is that this means Ubisoft is the sole publisher/developer of the title; boy do they love console ports.Rainbow Six is an anti-terrorism organization who tries to stop threats before they become the front page news. With this, you lead a team with 2 other squad mates to tackle challenges that take place in close quarter building environments and city streets.By commanding your squad mates, you progress through the challenges in the cohesive story. The single player story is about 10 hours’ worth of content, which allows you to get to know characters and game mechanics well. As with many other Tom Clancy games, there is always a sci-fi twist that doesn't seem ""out of this world"".With your squad mates, you can clear rooms, rappel down the sides of buildings, and coordinate to take enemies out. If one of the squad mates manages to go down, the other can be ordered to revive them. In the more likely event that both squad mates go down, you revive them with a ""hypo"". While there is an ""infinite"" health system in place, you will still find yourself dying quite a bit.Biggest issues out of the game? Let's start with checkpoints, checkpoints, checkpoints... The worst thing known to humanity continues and was a ""feature"" back in the day. Rainbow Six doesn't escape this, and it will make you rage. People still arguge about checkpoints somehow defeating ""save cheating"" (the ""art"" or plain intelegence to save before big battles). This is simply untrue due to the fact that consoles simply couldn't save that much data back then. It was a technical reason (and poor one) that has infected modern games. The ""blur"" or what seems to be some horrible pain effect isn't good at all. Because it's a console port, the memory and cpu usage had to be kept down and this horrible awful effect does its job. It is also strangely not optimized that well, so systems on the edge of requirements will suffer frame issues when effect kicks in.Multiplayer, while it does exist, requires an Uplay account, and then a small chance of someone playing multiplayer as well. There are no dedicated servers it seems, so a peer-2-peer system is in place. Only good thing that seems to come from multiplayer is the very precise customization options, it even surprised me in fact.Using an older version of the Unreal engine, AI has issues following and getting into positions sometimes. Once you play enough, you will get used to it. I came in knowing that, and automatically accounted for it. Your experiences will vary in this regard with high certainty.Keys are places in odd spots on your keyboard, and there's quite a few to remember. Left alt for instance changes squad engagement rules and then pressing and holding r shows the gun equipment radial menu. V, B, and N are for room entering commands which change based on engagement rule set.Beyond these aspects, I had fun playing the title. It was unique, yet required some chasing to get it to work on Windows 7.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rainbow Six Vegas was an effective and divisive reboot of the Rainbow Six series. It took the previously slow and tactical shooter series into a much more modern cover shooter direction. I say divisive because Rainbow Six Vegas caused a split in the fanbase between people who wanted a faster cover shooter and people who wanted a slower game where you plan your movements before executing. Rainbow Six Vegas largely takes place in the titular city of Las Vegas. You play as ""Logan"" an operative for the titular ""Rainbow"" special forces team who enters the city to combat a terrorist threat. The storytelling is a bit muddled and you generally don't pay attention to it that much. It mostly serves to get you from point A to Point B and shoot some baddies. What Rainbow Six Vegas is most well known for it's cover shooter gameplay. While it is faster than all of the previous Rainbow Six games it's noticeably slower than say, Call of Duty or Gears of War. The game is built around using your squadmates to move to different positions so you can flank or take enemies out from a distance. It's much more forgiving as well since it has regenerating health and the enemy AI is fairly dumb. Since you die very quickly the game doesn't devolve into run and gun but it still feels much slower than it should.Besides the campaign, Rainbow Six Vegas also has multiplayer and Terrorist Hunt. The latter is where the game excels in my opinion. In Terrorist Hunt, you and a few friends can team up to take out AI enemies in a series of multiplayer maps. It's very enjoyable and replayable and is where the bulk of the time you spend playing the game will end up. Deathmatch is also available but good luck finding a game for it.It's hard to really describe the original Rainbow Six Vegas without describing how much better it's sequel was. While I do recommend the game if you're a fan of modern shooters and desire something that requires slightly more thought behind it, the sequel comes generally more recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that got me into tactical shooters. I'm not much an FPS player, but RSV and RSV2 are the games which hooked me. The ability to give squad commands, take tactical advantage of an area and outfit your PCs aren't exactly innovative to the Rainbow Six franchise, but the fluidity of commands, the simplicity of the learning curve and the improved AI are what make the Vegas games my go-tos.

												Rainbow Six Vegas is yet another part of Rainbow Six series, tactical-themed FPS. This time around there are no more planning and you control only two other squad member. Yet it's all good fun. It came out in 2006 and was made by Ubisoft. Also, it was made for X360 first, so it came into PC territory like a proud direct port, lacking slightly in options and not optimized very goodly. At least it got patched up since then.It also came out for X360, PS3 and PSP. The first two should be similar, but PSP is different game. You play solo in that one. It doesn't interest me not even slightly, I am here to see squad members work along with me. You are supposedly saving those two squad members, being lone wolf.Technically, well, yea. Port from Xbox 360. Used to be unoptimized, but I am sure that computers nowdays can easily just power through it. It still however rarely freezes for half-minute. Steam Overlay doesn't work either, have fun alt-tabbing.Even worse, PC version did not support widescreen monitors at release! And while they patched widescreen in later, it still doesn't every wide resolution and even worse, the HUD is still designed for 4:3 monitor. So do some full-screen graphics. Like ""to be continued"" screen. Oh, yea, cliffhanger alert.But I am pretty sure that there are fan patches to fix those.Multiplayer servers were supposedly shutted down, but it actually still works, just requires UPlay account, at least now. Yep, new players will have to fancy around with email adress as nickname, from what I understood. Well, at least it works.Community seems to be kinda there. One times I tried there were no servers, other times there were 5 of them, with players. Seems like people only play Cooperative modes only nowadays, you will not find any Competetive players vs players. Sadly, they all seems to be quite protective, as all the servers I encountered were password protected, so I didn't get to check out multiplayer in these few days.And well, what can I say. It sure was made as a show off for Xbox 360, showing off itself with Unreal Engine 3, while trying to be accessiable to new players. Though, to be honest, I really dislike graphics in this part. That's because while they are cool on technical side, the art style is just awful. Or, rather, it feels like developers applied a really bad brown hue blur effect all over the screen. Music also isn't hot, being urgent but not very awesome. Shame that Rainbow Six main theme is gone.Oh well, at least Vegas setting is kinda cool.Also, yep, this Rainbow Six is now all about telling a good story and having fun. Not more planning before mission, head into action, main hero. Take on them with your regenerative health, until you get instakilled by sniper shot and realize that you can't just charge on even on Normal. Nope, it's still tactical, somewhat, sorry Doomguys.It also got cover system implented, where you hold a button and go into third person mode, as Logan hides behind a wall. You are supposed to spend most of your time in this mode, but personally, I kept forgetting that I can do it and instead kept crouching behind corners, aiming and shooting from the first person mode. Ha. But hey, here is a cool feature that you can do a blind fire from behind cover. Enemies can do it too, also. Gotta snipe those hands.And thankfully, you aren't alone either, for you can still command to your other teammates. Or more exactly single squad. Made of one explosive black guy and one haxor chinese guy, because yay Hollywood must-haves. No offence there, just stereotypical. Yep, just two people who you can't command separately, only to both at same time. To be honest, I am dissapointed that there are so little, I was expecting to get the second such squad and never recieved such. Rainbow Six Lite, gentlemen.But thankfully, they still beat their Rainbow Six Lockdown rivals into jaws, as these two people actually have good enough AI to follow you fast and be reliable at clearing the rooms. And while levels are linear, you get few options on how to enter. For example, you pretty much always have two doors, you can tell them to bang and clear one set while going through another. Or you can also peek under door with snake-cam and call out two priority targets and just tell them to open door, they take out priority targets very fast and accurately while breaching. And I gotta say, I love hostage situations in this game, even if they are scripted.Also, fallen teammates can be saved and made alive again, while you can't. Knowing this, you can guess how this team works. Answer: Like a horrible friends.But yes, thanks to this small squad being reliable and easy to control, I like this game a lot. After all, the reason why I liked single-player tactical shooter is because of working together with friendly AI and making tactical choices and this one more or less provides it, while being accesable tojust launch and have fun. I think that I would take it over Rainbow Six Raven Six, for I don't care about 1-shot-kills so much and AI of teammates in that game acted too dumb. As well as I like ability to be able to order more or less good during gameplay.But with promise that they bring back planning someday or let us play with more squads at the same time.Still would rather take SWAT 4 though.But oh well, this one is fun too.Oh, and there is terrorist mode. In single-player you play solo, so I wasn't so interested. It's quite hard and enemies will try to storm your positions just fine.Oh, yea, and there is multiplayer. I didn't get to try it. I know that it has unlockables. But most of stuff you got to play in single-player is there too, easy to access.But yep, pretty fun shooter where you get to order around to two squadmates and do some job. Shoootiiiiing!

												I have some minor gripes with this game like not being able to select your squadmates loadout and not being as tactically indepth as earlier Rainbow Six games or the first Ghost Recon but I still really enjoy it.This game is more forgiving than the earlier Rainbow Six games but it is still not for the faint of heart as enemy fire is quickly fatal and may require you play over a section of the game repeatibly until you get it down to a science.I'd highly recommend this game for someone who likes a challenge and enjoys a somewhat tactical SWAT 4 type experience.

												Being a fan of the books and the films that are based upon them i almost jumped out the first floor window when I found that 'Humble Bundles' were doing the Tom Clancy Collection. Its a whole lot of fun, obviously the graphics look somewhat outdated as it was released around 2006. It's pretty clear that Rainbow Six: Vegas is an accomplished action shooter. The story is presented via briefings and overheard terrorist conversations. All of the voice-overs are well done here so it's a pretty decently presented plot. Once again the pc people seem to have been sacrificed to make the console gamers play. Default key positions are pretty strange in some cases, but it seems to me that this was one of the first games i can remember that W A S D became the default forward, left, right back controls (these however can be made to any of your choices) The whole cover system is brilliant as as soon as you go into 'cover' the camera changes from first to 3rd person view, allowing you to see enemies and therefore plan your attack.The weaponry seems to be accurate to the original weapons and from what i can tell the friendly AI is actually quite stupid, as is  the enemy AI (shooting through walls to name one) R6:Vegas on older systems is a serious system hog, but on a 2012 machine the graphics are ramped up to the maximum and it doesnt twitch which has got to be a good thingRecommended for a quick pickup and play when theres nothing else on			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes, I would recommend......to fans of smart first person shooters that provide realistic tactical challenges and options.>|< Quantatitive Rating = 9 out of 10 >|<______________________________Observations and other musings...One of my all time top picks and definitely a title I would not only recommend, but also buy again if it came out in a remastered edition...that's new higher resolution graphics and physics...not a redone to the point of spoiling the spirit of the original. Only a few other games capture the tactical look and feel of actual close quarters combat: This title doesn’t nail it but it get pretty damn close with the ability to plan on-the-fly and execute tactical maneuvers to place you, or your team, or both in advantaged positions flanking and enfilade fire. There is a moderately good storyline to keep the action going and stitch together each level as you go along through the predetermined paths. There is enough space to each area and possible approaches that it doesn’t  always feel like your on rails. The kit choices are again moderate in quantity and configurations. There are varieties of different classes of small arms and several weapons within each class, but some of the characteristics are a little off at times. The customizations are a nice touch but there could have been more. Once again, this is a favorite of mine. If you like something that’s a little more than just on-rails first person shooter for a decent price, this is it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is based on hunting terrorists in Las Vegas and true to other Rainbow games, a single head shot can kill you or your enemies. There is no tactical planning or waypoint setting, but a map can be overlaid in real time to show enemy/friendly positions and objectives.During the game different approaches to reach objectives can be made which may involve fast roping, abseiling or ladder use to traverse drops and climbs. Your team of two non-player characters can be sent to any location within view (but not separately) and are reasonably reactive to incoming fire taking cover and returning fire when required. The range of weapons and customisation is vast and picking the correct weapons for the scenario is vital for success. My favourite action is being able to sneak view under doors and tag enemies for the NPC's to attack before door entry is made. Onto the health system, there is no health bar in this game. Instead when you are shot your vision becomes blurry. This means you have to take cover and rest until the blurriness has gone. It may not be a realistic health system but it adds to the intenseness of firefights and works very well.There are a ton of weapons to play around with. Sub machine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, shield. All of these are tweak able with different scopes, magazines, laser sights etc. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Srsly, if your sick of Call of Duty but you still want to play a good Modern FPS that doesn't have the problems that every other modern military shooter has, buy this. 1. it actually requires skill and tactics. 2. Compared to the average FPS this game is actually kinda hard. 3. The loadout customization is really good and your choce of weapons and gear actually matters. 4. while i havent played any online matches yet, the character customization in multiplayer is better than any other FPS ive ever played. 5. Actually decent storyline 6. Srsly buy this game, this is really good for a triple a modern fps. Also, the cover system works VERY well and this game has really good controls. Also for about as hard as it is, i would say about as hard as mega-man 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such an excellent game to play even without friends, amazing story that hooks you from the very beginning with plenty of terrorist hunt maps to play over and over after you beat the story or want to take a break from the intensity. I've seen very few problems with this game but they're only minor, such as your team mates getting in your way while firing at the enemy. Every suggestion that I have for this game is fixed in the second game but there are still a few things in this game that are better than the second in my opinion, like being down in the casinos more and actually being on the strip. I've been to Vegas and insde most of the casinos in this game and can say this, they've done one hell of a job with how everything looks because I felt like I was in Vegas again with how detailed the developers made the places. 10/10 from me.

												I originally got this game as a present from my dad when I was 13, In early 2007. I was a shy kid and when things weren't great at school or at home this game always gave me somewhere I could escape to. I estimate from 2007-2013 I put in around 6000+ hours on vegas 1 and 2, all while competing on the gamebattles EU ladder. Along the way I met some of the best people I've ever met online. I met one of my best friends to this day in a fateful LVU terrorist hunt, in which we discovered the finer points of the MAC11 :). We put countless hours into the game and went from 10 bar scrubs to top ladder players and sadly, saw the game die slowly and the MLG endorsement end. However, the amazing community kept both vegas 1 & 2 alive for so much longer than anyone expected. Quite simply, buy this game. It combines counter strike esque shooting mechanics (recoil is different however) with a fantastic cover system suited perfectly to competitive play. The maps are incredible, some will remember rainbow six 3 favourites such as kill house and presidio alongside newcomers like calypso casino and casino vaults. The player customisation is great also, custom camos, loadouts and even a hilarious face cam player model on the XB360 version. I just have to mention the ever hilarious VIP game mode in which one team has to escort a glock wielding VIP to a safe zone all while another team seeks to prevent it. I was so sad this game mode never made it to vegas 2!tldr; a hidden gem among the bloated FPS genre. BUY THIS GAME !! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall an enjoyable game and unlike other mindless shooters. I originally purchased this game, hoping to get an experience like SWAT 3 and SWAT 4. This is much more action packed and has  Hollywood production written over  it. Its Challenging at times, and infurating in others. Especially when you dies because an enemy NPC spontaneously respawns 3 feet in front of you. Your teamates AI often times doesnt help you cope. But enjoyable overall. Im looking foward to what R6 has to offer in the games following this.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Gorgeous highly detailed environments. The themed casinos really feel alive. There's a lot to just wander around and marvel at.+ Music and ambient sound effects double down on the immersion.+ Large range of weapons to choose from.+ Satisfying cover based combat.+ LAN multiplayer is lots of fun.+ Terrorist's voices add a touch of comedy. ""Should I just run into the bullets?""+ 360 gamepad support.- Getting insta-killed from nowhere sucks. Especially since the checkpoints are few between.- Hard to make out enemies sometimes from the environment.- Enemies can see through things you can't, like foliage.- Didn't think much to the story. It was kinda weak. It feels tacked on.- You won't bother with half the weapons. SInce they are too poor to be useful.- Dull and uninspiring first couple of missions. Game doesn't excite until you get to Vegas.- Tactical gameplay lacks depth. Essentially is just moving your team upto doors and getting them to go in first.- Lack of resolution options. Had to choose 1920x1080 and get my TV to downscale to 1360x768.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a cover based FPS with some nice mechanics. It's got some good replay value because there's multiple ways you can take your objective, one time breaching explosively through the door, and the next time coming down through the windows on the side of the building. It's one of my personal favorites, however because it is so old, the online community for it is obviously very, very small, so I'd suggest picking it up if you've got friends to play it co-op with. There's up to 4 player co-op in the story mode, however the co-op was somewhat of an afterthought, so I would suggest putting on the no-respawns setting and playing it on the hard mode as myself and one friend who never played it only both managed to die 3 times through the entire story mode.I'll recommend it for the co-op primarily.

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas in my opinion is just like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon except you're in an urban setting and there are some situations where it's really up close and personal. Just like Ghost Recon, you can command your squad members to take cover, take care of a personal objective (hacking and placing charges), and even handle door situations like (flash & clear, open & clear, breach & clear, and grenade & clear for examples.) All in all if you're into first person shooter (and it only goes into third person shooter mode when you're taking cover), then I highly recommend you guys or ladies to play this game. It's awesome and a lot of fun! Some missions on this game are challenging but it feels pretty good once you overcome and beat it! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, it's a Tom Clancy game, so expectations are high. And it does live upto your expectations. The story is good and so is the twist. It has a good choice of weapons, the assault rifles being the best ones. As a FPS game, you get to shoot a lot of enemies and thus, you won't be disappointed at all. The only problem that i felt was that you get too less health, just a bullet or two and you are dead. Overall, this game is highly recommended to all FPS fans out there. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Timeless classic. Highly recommended. I don't want to say too much on this game, as I feel it is another title that requires a good playthrough without too much spoiling of the delicious details. Although Vegas was quite a departure from the traditional gameplay mechanics of the Rainbox Six series, I was a happy adopter of the more action based systems. The mechanics are tight and responsive, the teammates are slightly derpy but do their jobs decently well, the set pieces and locations are spot-on and awe inspiring, gunplay is superb and combat intense. I played this predominantly on Xbox 360 at release, but the PC version still holds up quite well.This is not a game that you EVER play on normal or easy. You have to play this game on Hard, and it will be hard. You will die a lot, but you will also learn a lot. I say this, because the game encourages you to take each scenario you face as carefully and realistically as possible. The game is entirely about tactics. You must plan your route, scope out locations, take enemies down with minimal risk and protect VIP's.Without saying too much more, if anything I mentioned above interests you, you should waste no further time and acquire this game. This game does all those things and far more, almost to perfection.Would suggest using an Xbox 360 controller, as over time the PC port has suffered some compatibility quirks and engine shortcomings. Do not expect the online systems to work, although LAN functions correctly. [WITH PORT FORWARDING]9.3/10P.S Port information for LAN is as follows. I understand this is a common problem. Google 'Port Forwarding' for more information if you are unfamiliar, it has probably been at the core of any of your LAN woes.TCP: 80, 3074UDP: Range between 3074 and 3174			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A casual and accessible tactical shooter that is a joy to play, even if it is no Ghost ReconCompared to more hardcore Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, RB6V can feel like a simplified generic shooter. That may indeed be the case, but it's fun and quite replayable, especially in co-op mode.The gameplay is reminiscent of Gears of War, except you're in first-person mode when not in cover, and you can issue basic tactical orders to your teammates. You'll probably never actually do any fighting from first-person mode, however, because your ability to take damage is very limited even on Normal difficulty, making it almost impossible to win a gunfight without using cover (which puts you into third person view, and lets you blind-fire if you want which is pretty cool).A few of the basic tactical options like the ability to change the weapon rate-of-fire and attach suppressors are present, which is much welcome. You usually have a choice between going all Rambo into the next area, or playing it safe by going in stealthily and taking everyone by surprise with a few well-placed stun grenades. You also get to feel like a badass in some sequences, rappelling down the side of a building then crashing through the window and saving the hostages.The game can be hard at times, but in a way that feels justified and encourages you to rethink your strategy instead of yelling at the screen. It can get frustrating when you fail a mission because an AI teammate went down, but that's not too common because the AI is quite smart and is often capable of clearing a room without your help. Co-op is where this game really shines. It's essential to coordinate the attack plan before opening the next door, and that makes for particularly satisfying breach moments, as you mercilessly pick off those terrorist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then yell ""Clear!"".As is typical with Ubisoft, the game wasn't well optimized and had many performance issues at launch. In 2015, that's no longer a problem with any modern PC able to nail this 2006 game, but there are still a few annoyances that show how little the devs cared about the PC. You can't use the steam overlay. You can't bind controls to mouse thumb buttons. Your choice of screen resolutions is limited unless you edit the ini file. The graphics options are quite limited. If you want a fun co-op shooter that does a decent job simulating tactical special ops behaviour without being too hardcore, get this game (and an extra copy or two for your friends).

												Mix together a bizarre regenerating health system that seems to randomly choose whether you die in one hit or not, which defeats the purpose of regenerating health, and cover-based shooting in flashy, claustrophobic Casino environments and you have Rainbow Six Vegas.I beat this on the 360 when it originally came out and had a fun time with it, though I don't remember it being anywhere near this frustratingly bull♥♥♥♥♥♥  Enemies will no-scope you from cover from 200 feet away with a shotgun and insta-kill you *SOMETIMES* or maybe do barely any damage to you.  This inconsistency makes the game feel like bipolar mess which can either make you feel like breezing through it, or smashing your keyboard in rage because of being one-shotted by some♥♥♥♥♥hat hiding behind something you should clearly be able to shoot through, only to reload the checkpoints.  And yet, I still found myself wanting to push onward and beat the annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It combines a beyond simplified interface compared to previous Rainbow Six games with no pre-planning, but offers reasonable weapon customization.  You can freely add a silencer to almost any assault rifle or pistol, and it gives you the option of using the shield which I found worked and sometimes it didn't.  The AI is reasonably smart, and will try and flash bang you, use lethal grenades when you're using the shield a lot, and I found that they can lose track of you during a fire-fight.  Silencers appear useless at first because of the linearity of the game, but I found it helps keep the AI guessing where you are, so that they won't always be able to find where the fire is coming from during combat, or right before, so it's less about finishing objectives undetected and more about utilizing stealth as a way to ambush.The objectives are quite visually appealing with lots of interesting design choices in the environment, and enemies don't just instantly ragdoll when you kill them, as you'll see a mix of ragdoll with the physics of where you shot them plus an animation based on where you shot them, which makes kills very satisfying.  Overall, Rainbow Six is no longer the tactical shooter it was.  It is now a Cover-shooter, with tactical elements.  I suppose the change was evident from Raven Shield to Lockdown, but it seems they've done what Lockdown couldn't, which was making the game interesting for the player.P.S. For some reason, Vegas 1 looks better than Vegas 2, and plays better than Vegas 2 as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Rainbow Six Vegas games are some of the very best games for co-op that I've played. Afterwatching Achievement Hunter's playthrough of the games I picked it up for my dad and I to playand we have spent countless hours doing mostly the Terrorist Hunt gamemode, but also the co-op campaigns on both Vegas 1 & 2. As good as these games are for co-op, and they really, really are, as single-player games they're just not worth it. Or at least the first game isn't. The campaign is atrocious alone. The writing is garbage, the characters are some of the worst I've seen in a  video game and it's just not fun whatsoever. Terrorist Hunt is always really dull alone and extremely hard. As a single-player game it's one of the worst of FPS, as a co-op game it's easily one of the best. It's a nice sub-series off of the Rainbow Six series but it's a shame Ubisoft decided to keep going with the same more arcadey very much less tactical approach for Siege as well. Vegas isn't very tactical but honestly I don't mind for a sub-series and the cover system is one of the best I've ever played with and it's what makes the game unique. This game is seriously a blast and I couldn't recommend it more if you have friends to play with.Lack of hours is due to all my time being spent on Xbox 360 where I've spent very likely more than 200 hours at least.The Great:++Co-op is incredibly fun++Terrorist Hunt is a blast that somehow never gets old++Cover system is perfectly simpleThe Good:+Lots of Terrorist Hunt maps+Decent array of weapons and gadgets+Very good optimization. Getting 300fps at 4K on a GTX1060+Supports 4K resolution+Very low amount of glitches, only found a couple in a looong time of playing the game+Loadout is niceThe Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:+-Controls could be more refined for mouse and keyboard use-+Average length single-player+-All story-elements are removed for the single-player when doing co-op. Honestly this is a goodthing, but it really shouldn't be-+Terrorist Hunt really isn't designed for single-player, but it still works well enough+-Sound design is nothing special and music is nothing but clicheThe Bad:-Not ugly, more just very dull to look at (brown saturated)-Voice-acting is very poor-The single-player is nothing but a complete bore, but the gameplay does hold it up enough-Checkpoints have huge gaps between so don't die-Single-player campaign is fairly easyThe Horrible:--The writing is incredibly bad--The characters are some of the most forgettable in FPS historySound: 5.5/10Graphics: 5.5/10Gameplay: 9/10 (with co-op) 6.5/10 (single-player)Content/Replayability: 10/10 (with co-op) 6/10 (single-player)Overall: 9/10 (co-op) 4.5/10 (single-player)Again, absolutely recommended for co-op, absolutely not for single-player. 6/10 replayabilityfor single-player if you like Terrorist Hunt alone otherwise there's practically no replayability.
