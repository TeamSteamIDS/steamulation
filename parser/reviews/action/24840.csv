												Medal of Honor used to be an amazing war game, i played countless hours of vanguard and European Assault as a kid on the ps2. Medal of Honor: Airborne is the last great game in the series. Being dropped into the battle with free will to explore and edit your own load out is an awesome feature. One of my favourite things is the cover/peak system. when aiming down sight you can move your mouse to peak around corners/over obstacles, its a great feature. This game has ages greatly, it still has decent graphics for a game made in 2007. The only bad this is the campaign length and population of multiplayer servers, but mods for A.I bots in multiplayer games are available to download. Overall if you want a strong WW2 shooter that is not Red Orchestra 2 buy this, But don't bother with the seise from this game on....			",164,8,25,9,9,1,31

												Probably the best MOH game. After that, MOH games became something like a joke. The game is highly replayable, especially if you are like me, meaning that you want to upgrade all the guns and get 5 stars in every difficulty. I didn't use the multiplayer and I don't intend to, but the campaign is really awesome. This game is highly recommended. And remember guys, don't let the tanks crush you.			",372,143,15,33,42,8,47

												Please bear in mind that this review will be about the singleplayer, and the singleplayer only. I haven't played the multi, and does not plan to do so. Why? I'm an SP man, that's why. So, let's begin.If you've played the original MoH series, it could get really different. Instead of a more realistic game, you get Band of Brothers: The Shooter. And I love every single minute of it. You get six rather short missions that you can complete in about 5 hours (or in my case, 7, because I'm a terrible aim), and each mission lets you refight one airborne operation of the war. The first two takes place in Italy, and it quickly grabs your attention if you let it do so. Fast paced action with loud guns, and more enemies that you can count. The more you kill, the better your weapons will be. For every kill, your weapon gets experience, and when it ""levels up"", you get an upgrade for it. Like grenade launcher for the M1 Garand, better scope for the Springfield, dual mag for the Stg44, and so forth. Maybe not entirely accurate, but certainly gives you a feel of progression.Try to stick with a weapon if you like it, tho. Some weapons appear only in early game (like the Kar98k and the Mp40), sor maybe it's wiser to use something that will be present a bit more frequent to let you get ammo for it. I recommend the pistol, because it doesn't require you to get additional ammo for it - you have infinite bullets. And that's cool, because on lvl 3, it's a really powerful weapon in short to middle range firefights. But the rest repends on your gamestyle. You can level up grenades too. Spam Gammon grenades for supernazis, and you can bear quite an amount of them to help you get baddies out fo the way.The cons? Well, they are present. It's not much a historical game, rather than a historical based shooter. The Kar98k was used throughoutly the war, as well as the Mp40 - and believe it or not, not every men had an Stg44, and there wasn't any (or rather - that much) super nazis who could shoot the 15kg (possibly more) MG42 from the hip. And it's a bit frustrating when you go back to a place after they shot you, and it's swarming with enemies. Oh, before I forget - spawning. If you die, you'll make another jump where you can choose where to deploy. Rather neat function, that contains some interesting elements as there are skill jumps on each level, like land on the balcony or the catwalk.Overall, a good game. Really short, so I'd recommend getting it on a sale or if you are really don't have much else to spend you hard earned money on. If you want a bit more realistic FPS that have the Airborne in it, try Brothers in Arms - especially Hell's Highway, but it's just my personal preference.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												Funny thing is this 7 year old game is made better than most FPS's today. The lean feature so simple, so useful, so often forgotten.  Something about the WWII games are just more fullfilling to me.  Upgrading your weapons is easy just kill with it.  While it's on sale for 2.49$ the only reason not to get this game if you enjoy fps is that you  already have it.			",180,9,2,18,9,1,4

												This game is an enjoyable shooter, adding enough to the formula to avoid the feeling of the same gameplay that you experienced many times before. The game can be a little restrictive but the campaign mode is enjoyable and is sure to satisfy World War II FPS fans. If only they could make more games like this but change the setting (not WW2).

												I had this game on the ps3 and I loved every second of it. for a 2007 game the graphics are still pretty good. This game is notorious for gliches. In the campaigne the weapons that you collect you can upgrade them as you kill people and it makes the guns way better. But the campaigne is about 10 missions I think but they are kinda short and long depends on the difficulty. Suprisingly multiplayer is still pretty active i joined one and theres about 72 people playing online. The combat is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dope I'll tell you. So that concludes my review I hope this helps you. and I give this game a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""It looked like an easy victory, but after the last battle; we can see it's not as easy as we thought."" With the WWII Spam of the early 2000's, you would think they would die out. With the release of Medal of Honor: Airborne WWII Is back and has a few different changes. Should it be a good pickup? Or just another game that's late of the WWII Spam?Story/Design: Airborne invites players to fly and dive into the skies of multiple famous battles as Boyd Travers. Not much about the guy, but hey, none really did with the other WWII games. With select battles from other MoH titles like Market Garden, and of course Normandy. (Since every WWII game needed a reference to the battle of Normandy.) There isn't too much story to it, just going to objective to objective and accomplish them. They range from taking out a group of targets to go and blow up some artillery guns to help your other airborne comrades. The game is decent looking, a medium rig could run it but it looks quite nice on a great rig. With it being released in 2007, even some of the other games had a few better sounds. The firearm shot sounds don't ruin the game, but with others at the time it could be a bit better. With the story, there isn't much to it. Objective here, and objective there but luckily you're doing objectives during more famous battles that are usually well done and you can choose how you go to each of the objectives instead of a linear path, which is a spectacular change from go here, cut scene and follow the linear AI path. Gameplay/Mechanics: No more running and gunning or running out and blasting each brain-dead AI in the face to reach the next objective. MoH Airborne takes things to a new level with some great changes added to the WWII FPS standards. As you dive out of the plane at each start point and choose where you would like to land, it is all up to you. Either landing in safe zones with your team or directly in enemy sights; the enemy AI is brutal and ruthless, able to hit you from rather large distances, and can seem a bit cheap at times; but it's much better than having brain-dead AI who just sit there until you shoot their face. Of course with the AI being so brutal and checkpoints usually not showing up until you finally clear an objective; this can lead to starting from the plane over and over and over again. It's fine the first few times, but after the 6th time of doing the same thing you'll want to just rage quit. The game is more slowly paced than a few other FPS's. Aiming down the sights will stop your character from walking around and instead be able to duck, lean, and raise your character instead of just walking around. This is a better choice so you can take it more slowly since the AI will be on your trail the whole time. Shooting hundreds of Nazi's and common soldiers will with the same gun will lead to a level up system to it, causing the game to slow-motion for a few seconds and to tell you what you unlocked for the following gun. Whether it be extended mag, reduced recoil, or better fire rate this can help you choose what gun firearm you love to use most and is a welcome addition to the standard FPS. The game can offer replay ability for the ones who want everything unlocked, such as landing in certain spots while parachuting. For the gameplay, the AI is brutal and the checkpoints can be rather annoyingly placed. The gunplay is fun and great to control with a great gun level up type system.Overall this is one of the best WWII games I have played, with smarter AI and a few different takes on a few things; although not being a completely perfect FPS experience, it's definitely a step in the right direction for a WWII game. 8/10 Excellent WWII FPS			",207,29,2,22,4,2,16

												A wonderful game for every fan that ever was of the Medal Of Honor based games.  Along with a very immersive campaign, this game is very rewarding and very tough when you get to its later stages.  Along with some nice gunplay and upgrades along the way, the game's soundtrack is flawless and its combat always keeping you on your toes.  Along with offering some multiplayer after you've finished the campaign, this game definitely was a great addition to my warchest as it should be yours.

												Airborne may look like another generic WWII fps shooter but there is brilliance that you won't understand until you play a mission or two. I can't think of any other game that has the same mechanic, you see the battle in Airborne is open. You can choose to land anywhere or go anywhere in the battlefield. At any moment you have multiple missions to do based on the real events of Airborne battles in WWII leading to a magnificent Flaktower at the end.It is not perfect.. The aiming is a bit broken, the game is too short and the checkpoint saves sometimes don't work taking you back to the start of the mission everytime you die. But it's still damn fun to play!

												Pros:+ Being able to land anywhere at the start of a mission.+ Weapon upgrades+ All weapons feeling unique+ Semi-open world level design+ Very good looking graphics for its time+ Variety in Axis troops encountered+ The final two levels, in gameplay terms, being awesome finales+ Well-choreographed cutscenesCons:- Occasional glitches and bugs, especially with the enemy ragdolls- Enemy AI, especially in earlier levels, is quite disappointing- What feels like an excuse plot unless you pay really close attention to details- Forgettable supporting characters- A bit too short, but kind of expected considering there were only so many times the Allies launched Airborne operations in Europe during WWII.- The final level, in historical terms, jumping the shark, machine-gun wielding Wolfenstein-esque Nazis and all.In short, I'd give this a 7/10 since overall the game was a fun experience, the disappointments mostly stemming from the final level in terms of historical accuracy, me being a fan of detail and all. I would recommend getting this game if you love World War II shooters.			",45,0,0,0,1,0,0

												For a game that's almost 10 years old, the graphics are SUPERB.  Gameplay is a little clunky.  LOVE how it's sorta open world, it's not a 'tunnel' linear type game, you are free to bomb around the map and find your own way to objectives.  Another thing I kinda find neat, is the firing, the accuracy >> I find it's very challenging to land shots, I feel it's more simular to firing a real automatic weapon in real life, as compared to like Call of Duty where 90% of your rounds are dead on.  Love the soundtrack, the music in the game is great and really adds to the feel of the game.Parachuting was bogus, however >> I found it incredibly hard to land properly, and not get a 'botched' landing.....ah well, it still let me play even though I face planted on every jump, lol!!I bought this for $10, not on sale.  Worth it so far.  If you are a hardcore fan of WWII shooters like I am, DEFINITELY scoop this up if you see it on sale.  Gonna give this game a 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After a long line of disappointing games in the Medal of Honor franchise that just never could recapture the magic successes of Allied Assault, we finally get Medal of Honor: Airborne that combines high presentation values and good, fast-paced fun. While there's definitely some good entertainment value here, the campaign is short, and the multiplayer isn't incredibly deep. Still, it's a good game overall and the best game in the franchise in some time.Medal of Honor: Airborne takes a different approach to World War II shooters. Instead of starting players out in each linear level on a path where there's no variation, EA LA decided to let us choose where to start each mission by throwing us out of a plane. Once floating in the air, it's a matter of steering the parachute to the best location to start the fight. Where the best location is depends on how you want to play the game, a mechanic that certainly is useful if you want a challenge or find that it's more fun to start out in a certain place on a map. It also provides an opportunity to drop into a new location if the previous one was a little too difficult or even complete one of the five different skill drops (drops in very specific areas).

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Yes, it's WWII, so don't expect a hyper-complicated story, groundbreaking visual design, or creative weaponry. But, the shooting mechanics are good, the weapon upgrade system encourages you to experiment with different weapons, the AI is competent, and the respawn system of parachuting in as well as the nonlinear mission objectives provide some nice tactical depth to an otherwise straightforward shooter. The battles always feel big with multiple moving fronts (and new ones opening up with AI allies parachuting in), but you'll never be far from the action. ",46,7,4,1,4,0,0

												A timeless WWII classic that is a must-play for any WWII gamer who wants a good 'ol fashioned shooter with a unique first person cover system and great gameplay. One note before you buy this game is you may get a ""video card not supported issue"". I believe this was fixed because on my new PC I got a popup to set up game settings, similar to Rust and The Forest, and I've had no issues, but I can't 100% confirm you won't get this issue. If you do get it there is a few simple fixes relating to your .exe and setting up custom launch options and it's just a simple google search. Pros-Gunplay is smooth.-Characters are realistic and have some decent dialogue when you're fighting, even if a little repetitive outside cutscenes.-Ability to choose different routes when assaulting your various objectives, with different routes through houses, tunnels, and even going up and through rooftops. You also have the option to land anywhere in your mission, which can give you either the extra edge, or you land in a terrible spot either with no movement or completely surrounded by Germans.-Entertaining story taking you through various parts of the European Theatre, with some small fictionalized enemies and events to fight through and against.-Ability to upgrade weapons through kills. Want a thompson with a drum mag? 3rd unlock. Want a trench shotgun with a bayonet? I can't remember which upgrade but you'll get it. Want that special dual magazine loading MP40 giving you a total mag count of 64 rounds? Yep, 3rd unlock and it's awesome.-A small multiplayer following averaging from around 4-12 players on 1 or 2 servers. Really friendly community, and expect to see the same guys on different servers. They're all really nice and fun to play with, and they're always welcome new players.-Graphics hold up even in 2015, especially on High settings. The game still looks beautiful.Cons-Possiblity of motion sickness or vertigo due to the verticality of the maps and cover system. This game can make you feel ill or give you headaches after a while if you're not careful.-Lack of movement with cover system. Not neccesarilly a true ""con"" since the cover system is WASD based, but it can sometimes be a little awkward.-AI can sometimes be too easy, even on Expert, enemies generally go towards MG positions despite taking fire, and don't run from cover often, allowing you to rush them and hipfire. Then again, this game is from 2007, so it's to be expected, it just makes the game a little boring at times.Overall I give the game a 9/10. For $10 you'll get a pretty fun ride, pretty good multiplayer, just be careful that you don't get sick or hurt your eyes, and that you may plow through the AI at times.			",106,3,2,12,1,0,4

												The Brothers in Arms series is my favorite in the WW2 FPS genre, but this is definitely my second favorite. It's essentially the same formula you see in most WW2 shooters, but instead of having linear levels, each mission is a reasonably large map with multiple objectives that you can take on in any order. The game drops you into the map by airplane, and you can parachute to wherever you want to start (there are designated green smoke ""safe zones"" where the enemies don't spawn, but you're generally free to experiment with landing wherever you think would give you the best advantage). You can find a decent amount of standard WW2 guns throughout the levels, and each of them has 3 levels of upgrade attachments that you unlock after getting a certain amount of kills with each one. With that being said, there's a reason it's only my second favorite. For one thing, the game is really short - it only has 6 missions, which each last somewhere close to an hour each. They're largely unconnected, and for the most part the other soldiers are all just a bunch of faces, with no real narrative or characters to give more purpose to the nazi killing like you might be used to in other shooters in the genre. The game's AI is also pretty severely lacking, and tend to navigate the levels in a way that hints that they weren't really ready to make a game where you aren't on a set path. It's not usually noticeable for the enemies that are spawned into the game when you first begin a mission, but for freshly spawned enemies and allies it can be pretty bad. Overall I'd still recommend it, if only because it's so old now that it's only $10, which in my opinion is worth it for a game as fun as this even as short as it is. But if $10 for 6 hours isn't enough for you, it might be better to wait for a sale. Either way, I'd recommend it if you like WW2 games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superb game. Even the graphics are great for an 11 year old game. Really enjoyable. Would love to see a new WW II game instead of the new war games.Please not, it took me some research to get it working on a modern PC with a newer PhysX version. You need to install the legacy driver (http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html). This also works for an AMD graphical card!			",406,63,52,28,41,2,35

												One of the best MoH game for the last generation.Surprisingly the game aged pretty well, it still looks very good thanks to the Unreal 3 engine. I really loved the Physx effects, particularly the ragdolls, still one of the best I've seen in any of the FPS I've played.Soundtracks are great and the sound effect is really realistic too.Few things I did not like though. The screen flashes really bright when taking enemy fires.Also, despite the good visuals I also find it very taxing to the eyes. The controls are not as tight as any of the previous MoH games. Aiming down sight can be quite tricky at times, particularly when using a sniper rifle.Multiplayer is non existant nowadays, but the short single player campaign offers enough replayablility.May not be the game for everyone, so best to get it when there's a steam sale! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is worth playing through at least twice even now in 2015, as most of us are aware now graphics and compatibility issues can make current games a nightmare. The ability to land wherever you want on the map is a large part of the fun but it also is a decent game in general. Getting headshots with rifles and other guns feels rewarding as well as mowing through Nazis with assault weapons. The MG42 adds some realism and you'll know when the enemy has it as well as learn to fear it if you don't take it out immediately. I'd recommend playing this game on the medium difficulty setting first so you can unlock all the weapon upgrades and learn the safe areas of the game as well as get used to the cover system first. It's a fun game and most of the time when you die you get to parachute in again but there are some glitchy enemies that you'll see firing at your teammates then a quarter of a second later will instantly turn to face you, it's not too often but it can be frustrating on your first playthough. On one level the enemy snipers may fire through walls so be careful as you move up and your teammates don't help too much in that same tank factory level but as long as you use the right weapons in the right situations you'll usually be fine. The best guns are: shotgun, STG44 (you can take the scope off when you unlock it), Gewehr, Garand (and unzoom this gun), and the Springfield but the upgraded Thompson, Bar, and K98K, etc. are enjoyable to use as well. The whole premise of the game is you can land wherever you want and I've avoided whole trench lines and seen some potential landing spots right at the objectives where as other times its fun to land on rooftops with the Springfield Sniper. The campaign is short but play thorugh it more then once and try different tactics, it will be worth your time. If you have a new copy of PHYS X it may not work with game so download it from here, it's the legacy version, no uninstall needed. Enjoy the flying and glitchy bodies soldier, you're with the Airborne now.       https://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html ",32,1,0,5,0,0,2

												Medal of honor airborne has always had a special place in my (and brother's) heart, as it was our first FPS, ww2 shooter, and console game. We both played it quite a bit and mostly forgot about it after the mongol hordes of COD, Halo, and Battlefield dominated the FPS market. Coming back to it, Medal of honor was really a pivital game for my love of history and especially WW2. It was very nostalgic to hear the ""Jumping out of an airplane is one of the safest things a man can do"" line, and walking through the missions i did as a kid. The game got better with age in all honesty. It was so special to play a 8 year old game and have more fun than you would with a shooter form 2016. The gunplay is simple, easy to use, and the weapon upgrade system is such a relic to modern FPS. I wish it returns someday. This game has very good audio for its age. every clap and ching of reloading, firing, aiming, and step you take sounds so well done. The game is relatively short, which is somewhat of a shortcoming, but if you can pick the game up on sale, its 100% worth it. I love this game for how simple it is, but the fun moments in its simplicity will stay with you for a long time, and thats why i fully recommend MoH; Airborne.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Medal of Honor games, if you ask me.The weapon upgrades can be cool, but can be a little weird, seeing as if you use the Thompson a lot it just turns into a Tommy Gun, which some will like but I personally dont... BUT I did find a work around for that, and disabled the ones I didnt enjoy getting. My biggest gripe with the game by far though, is that its just not long enough. Only spanning 5 levels you can beat it in like... 5-7 hours, if you drag them out and such. Those levels are also designed pretty well, and when you're dropped into the fight you can take on any of the given objectives in any order you'd like, its just open-ended enough to be enjoyed for that. Its not a horrible looking game either, for being almost 10 years old.Decently fun, picked it up for $5 to have some nostalgia from when I got it on 360, enjoyed it all over again. Worth the $10 if you're not picking it up on sale, but defintely worth the price whenever its on sale. Enjoy!			",207,14,0,24,12,0,42

												I don't know if I can take this game seriously or not. The game paints itself as a serious game revolving around paratroopers in WW2. However, the game itself is hilarious if not unintentionally comedic. I only recommend this game as there is no neutral option and I picked it up cheap on a sale.The game started off well, the First level you fight the Italians. This is pretty cool because in every WW2 game they are always overlooked, but they are only around for half the level then here come the Germans. Using the iron sights allows you to lean or look over cover via the movement keys, which is something not seen a lot in shooters.The AI in this game is horrible. Your teammates are paper and will run directly into fire. I haven't seen an ally stay alive for longer than 30 seconds. The enemy loves to melee and they will run directly at you just to melee you. When they use cover the animation is so rough it's like they are teleporting from looking over the cover vs peeking around the cover. Sometimes when you shoot a soldier his body will ragdoll as if you shot him with a cannon, they really get some incredible air time. A lot of times the enemy doesn't follow the same rules as the guns you use. Many times the enemy will shoot through cover or in the case of a sniper they will fire it like it's a fully automatic rifle when the rifle is bolt action. Lastly, there is only like, 8 stages.

PROS:+ good old WW2 shooter fun+ weapon upgrades+ non-linear map progress+ parachuting challengesCONS:- compatibility issues on some operating systems- graphical glitches- clipping through objects- only 6 missions/maps- unskippable mission briefingsComment:I have a soft spot for WW2 shooters so I got this one too. The difference between this MoH game and the others is that it feels more like a multiplayer map with AI bots instead of a real campaign. That is both good and bad. Good because at the time the WW2 FPS genre was crowded and needed a different approach. Bad because it seems incoherent, like 6 random separate missions. While all 6 are big maps it still feels like the game could have used more. Combined with glitches and bugs it seems like the game was rushed and lacks polish. Not much to talk about the combat, standard FPS with iron sights and a various arsenal of weapons. Worth a mention is the weapon upgrade system which is nice. This is probably the last Medal of Honor game I enjoyed, before the franchize moved into modern times. If you like the WW2 setting and would like some quick shooting fun go get this game. However, because of the issues it has maybe wait for a sale.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Don't let the fact that this game is 10 years old dissuade you from buying it, especially now that its on sale. The game is hard to get used to as it simulates weapon recoil, so no run and gun per se (more on that later). AI can be a challenge if you let the enemy dig in, and knowing when to push is key to victory. As such, it does simulate somewhat accurately a real gun fight.Regarding the run and gun: you can use it, provide you think it a bit through ""on the spot"". For example, in the last mission you have to push aggressively while maintaining cover just long enough to keep pushing, while taking out the enemy while they reload. Dig in, and they will overrun you. Push to far ahead, and you will be taken down like a shooting practice mannequin.Expect to die a lot. Expect to curse at the game designers and their families even more. But that is the beauty of this game: it shows you that achieving victory in WW 2 required the sacrifice of many brave men, because sometimes you have to die to achieve the objective.Pros-Scales rather well to 4k resolution-Land anywhere, fight the good fight from anywhere (just like a real airborne)-Varied enough weapon set (Lugers rule)-Simulates WW2 fighting rather well-Scenes before you jumpCons-Freaking hard (until you get used to it, then its challenging)-Graphics are a little dated IF you get pícky about it, but its not that bad (at 4K I didn't notice i that much).-It is a little short (still, 7.4 hours of solid gameplay for what I paid is well worth it).Buy it. You won't regret it.			",256,141,2,41,8,0,14

												Bought this game by accident while drunk after getting home from a party.  Played it for an hour and found it fun enough to keep, but not fun enough to play a lot.  Recently I've had some sort of a Medal of Honor itch. I really wanted to relive some of those great memories I had with the earlier games.  I tried the first game on an emulator, found it charming but dated. Frontline looks ghastly these days.  Allied Assault, which was by far my favorite back in the day, has not aged that well either.  It was groundbreaking at the time, but it has not aged the way other classics such as Half Life have.  Then I came to this game.  The main difference between this game and the others is it seems to depart from the setpieces and story focus of the other games and is almost entirely gameplay focused. There are no pre-rendered cutscenes, everything happens in game.  Each mission you choose your weapons, jump out of a plane, control your parachute and decide where to land, and start completeing objectives. You can coplete them in whatever order you want.  You can also choose your combat style, etiher you can take point and advance with an SMG, or lay back, hit the rooftops and provide covering sniper fire for your squad as they advance.   The health system is also a nice combination of regeneration and old school depletion which was done even better in the new wolfenstein games.  The graphics aren't great but they aren't terrible either. The weapons feel nice, especially the Kar98 and the Thompson, and you recieve upgrades the more you use them.  The more you play this game it can kind of feel like you are playing a multiplayer Call of Duty with bots and can get old for sure, but as far as the Medal of Hono games go, it's currently hte most fun to play.

												WHO DOES THE ARMY TRUST THE MOST?ARBORNE!WHO DO THE LADIES LOVE THE MOST? AIRBORNE! WHO DO THE NAZIS FEAR THE MOST?AIRBORNE. As a long time medal of honor fan,  medal of honor airbone proved to meet my expectations, however, i was also quite let down in other aspectsPros-afforance technology allows you to use almost anything as cover, and both allies and enemies smartly take advantage of this as well-weapon proficientcy. Scoring kills with weapons gains you xp for it. Gain enought xp and u gain attachments for ur weapons, usually scopes, stabilizers, and increased magaizine capacity-ability to control where u land allows u to do the missions in the order you wish toCons. -WAYYYYYY TO SHORT. 6 missions only. I finsihed it in an afternoon-weird points system. Every mission is scored out of 5 stars. Kills give u points, while dying deducts them. However, there usually isn't enough enemies to kill on easier difficulties to give u 5 stars, so one has to sometimes kill eveey enemy without completing any objectives (because they auto save after every objective completion) dir, and go through it again-highly incompetent allies. Theres a reason ehy i rename the game as mom simulator.All in all, the pros vastly outweigh the cons, and is highly enjoyable, though the difficulty may be a bit high for beginners on normal difficulty, but thays what casual difficulty is for ",52,6,0,4,8,2,10

The atmosphere WW2, the soundtrack and the course of the story is very well, graphics for the time are great and camera movement with some motion blur realistic is really fantastic.Critic points: - Game is too short, (almost 7 hours if you spend to kill and be strategic).- Weapon arsenal's too limited. - Excessively linear, but isn't bad if you want return to take some items in somewhere.In summary: I like it, totally recommended. A war game that you can play and enjoy a Saturday afternoon.			",140,3,2,4,3,0,11

												This game can be infuriating. But it can also be a lot of fun.It took me 12 hours to beat the game and then go back and get all the weapon upgrades for every weapon and the grenades. AI IssuesThe enemy AI is extremely dumb and very spastic, they will hunker down against an object and keep repositioning themselves so they become impossible to shoot sometimes and they can straight up teleport because of the AI's cover system. They move around so much even when un-alerted, they give us sufferers of ADHD a bad name. They can shoot you through walls and the tiniest cracks in them and other objects. They never miss a grenade throw and some single enemies can chuck EIGHT grenades at you in a split second. They've thrown grenades through tiny cracks in the walls that are impossible for the grenades to fit through and yet they still manage to go through. Your teammates are just useless cannon fodder but amusingly they'll sometimes band together and run at the enemies and all of them melee a single enemy at once running this devilishy satisfying fist train on them and insta kill the enemy sending their body FLYING. The enemies do this too, even to you, they'll come around a corner while you're reloading and ONLY ever do it while you're reloading and run the train on you and instantly kill you. Your teammates WILL ALWAYS get in your way and probably get you killed, they can softly push you around and block your ironsight peeking and they'll do it all the time. They'll run through you and in front of you and sometimes they follow where you're aiming and do nothing but follow your crosshair to be shot, like no joke, seriously. The enemy AI are also aim-botting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. No matter what weapon they're using, they'll shoot you from a far distance and get a headshot and take 50% of your health. And other times, they're super dumb and miss every shot, but most of the  time they land every shot even if their gun is aiming at the ground and they're running the other way. Their bullets can apparently eject out of their barrel at a sharp 90 degree angle and they can blindfire around any object and ALWAYS hit you. It's never missed me once, even when I'm behind cover. And a common problem, you'll enter a new area before there's any cover and you'll be shot by every enemy there at the same time instantly killing you. Your teammates will almost always cause the RPG enemies to hit you, they'll run across the battlefield and the RPG enemy fires at them and it completely misses them and hits you even if you're behind cover even when the RPG enemy has no clue where you are, thanks to your useless cannon fodder buddies. I died more times because of this than any other means of death in this game. It happens with the tanks too. I've walked through a door my buddy ran through only to be hit in the face by a tank shell and insta-killed.Enemies also have infinite clips and randomly reload even if they don't need to and RPG guys? They can fire as many rockets as they want without reloading and then all of a sudden they decide to reload the rocket launcher only to fire it at you again before they've even dropped the rocket in the launcher, and they can be facing the other way and then just turn around and fire instantly exactly where you're standing, all enemies do this though so it's to be expected, even snipers can one shot kill you like this as well. And mind you, this entire time, I'm playing on NORMAL, not HARD. I tried hard and it's almost exactly the same, but their weapons do more damage, that's the only difference, you can be shot twice by an MP40 and die but it can take a whole clip from a Thompson to down a single enemy. And even in normal mode, most enemies can take more bullets to their face than you can but a grenade at 20ft away or rocket of the same distance is insta death to them but not you if you have full health.Your buddies will also almost always fail their grenade throws and it bounces back right on top of you which can damage you. Your grenades also kill your buddies, so if you throw one, your buddy will 99% of the time try to play fetch with you and be blown clear across the sky where he is truly part of the Airborne now.BugsThis game has no option to adjust FOV and I had to adjust it using the fixes provided on PCGWiki. It's a normal problem with UE3 games and you need to adjust the FOV every time you start a new level, with the fix you just hit Page Down to make the FOV accurate. Also, get rid of the sprint effects if you don't want to get motion sickness.You can get stuck in the map, especially on stair cases or closed quarters, normally you can just crouch, jump or sprint out of it but sometimes you need to kill yourself.Parachute landings are borked? My landings always range from terrible to perfect and the drop points are kind of dumb, they're really hard to even see because of the super restricted camera angle while parachuting and you need to apparently play a level five times just to get each secret drop location and they're not highlighted once you find them on foot either even though it tells you ""Secret Drop Discovered!"" and sometimes they don't even work or are really wonky, I've landed the exact same way on multiple secret drops and it's a 50% chance I'll succeed in the exact same method.Game uses some kind of mouse smoothing that causes your crosshair to move over objects instead of directly on them. And for the love of GOD, do yourself a favor and turn off the motion blur. There are also bugs with the DOF in this game too, it takes FOREVER for it to accurately adjust to where you're looking and sometimes if an object near you is close to your crosshair it won't adjust at all, your teammates can cause this to happen too if they're inside you.ConclusionBut despite all that? I really like this game. It pisses me off, but the gunplay, graphics, audio, controls and especially the ragdoll system all make up for it for me. It's an incredibly short game, only ten missions that you can beat in twenty minutes each. But for some reason, I really liked this game. I've played all the Medal of Honor games and even though this game feels like it's missing polish and feels rushed, I enjoyed it for some reason. It feels like a good productive time waster that doesn't require hundreds of hours to beat or collect everything. I feel the length was perfect.			",447,55,23,28,18,4,40

												You know, I some what blame this game for getting me into reenacting, however I haven't regretted that choice and I definitly do not regret this game, sure if you're going for the historical accuracy of WW2 you wont find it here, I don't remember a point in history where a gasmask wearing German was hip firing an MG42 and taking a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of rounds to the face like he'd just recently replaced his skull with a titanium cage. But none the less it is a good game. It brought something new to the table, the ability to fall from the sky and land anywhere on the map making it almost like a 'spawn where you like' kind of thing, all I can say is that if you get it you probably wont regret it. Probably.			",159,9,2,17,17,0,32

												As the years have gone by since 2007 its become very clear what an outstanding game this is. Game developers would do well to look at this game and learn from it. It's amazing how many times I've played through this over the years. Everytime I've found a new aspect to the level designs, or some upgrade that I was not aware of. The AI is outstanding. Soldiers flush you out with grenades and, as the game proceeds, start using increasingly scary tactics against you. Nothing is more impressive than a German soldier tactically out manouvering you and wacking you to death with his machine gun butt. Got me ! ... And not for lack of good game play skills ! This is where the true tribute to the heroes of their time is in this game. Sure you can mow down bad guys if you want, but you only get a few chances to do that and then they get THEIR chance. The weapon modelling is on the most part very good. The Sgt44 feels especially dangerous with the mag sound changing as it empties. You have squad buddies but there's not a squad command system here. But even without that you feel like they are reacting to what you're doing and are by your side. You can also go ""lone wolf"" if you want to. Altogether outstandng stuff and a real classic !

												Medal Of Honor: Airborne, another WW2 Shooter that doesn't do anything wrong but also doesn't do anything special either. Aside from the paradroppings, the game pretty much is a linear shooter, enjoyable but still linear.The graphics are obviously dated but some of the environments look pretty nice. Depending on the difficulty, it will take you around 6-8 hours to beat. Only recommended to WW2 Shooter fans.			",1619,637,54,225,180,17,281

												It's a good game with some unique gameplay while parachuting into open levels and choosing where to start the missions. There's also an interesting AI system used with the enemies called Affordance AI. Which causes them to move around and take cover in a fun and engaging way. Most of the guns feel great especialy the sniper rifles with some cool lensing effects on the scopes. There's not much of a story but there's a couple of shocking moments that make up for this especialy towards the end. I also liked the way the missions are introduced and I think the developers made some good design choices to encourage immersion. I played casualy through all the missions in about 9 hours and unlocked around a third of the extra content and weapon upgrades. The last two levels are particularly good and where the game really comes into it's own. There's some replay value here too with all the unlockable stuff. There's also a multiplayer mode which I didn't try. However I read online that a group called War Lions has kept this mode alive. The game runs in 1080p at a solid 60FPS for me, on a GTX 980 with Windows 10. I read that some people have needed to install legacy Physx drivers to get it to work, I didnt have this problem. The graphics still look pretty good and can be ehanched to look even better with SweetFx. The game is unfortunately fairly blurry though when moving around. However motion blur can be disabled by editing the .ini files which helps this a lot. The FOV can also be increased in the same way.So with a few tweaks the game runs pretty good for me, certainly enough to enjoy the experience. It can still be a bit blurry but it's definitely worth playing regardless. At the time it was released in late 2007, the developers seemed to be genuinely trying something different and for the most part it works. It reminds me of Wolfenstein (2009) I even got a bit of a supernatural vibe off one of the Nazi enemies during the later missions. I had a lot of fun with this one and I highly recommend it.

												Medal of Honor: Airborne a.k.a. MOHA is a ""based on the true historical facts"" FPS game which take place in WWII(as you can see in the pictures above).This awesome video game was published in far 2007(7 years ago),but I've bought it only in this year.SingleplayerAs a big lover of WWII features I expected to have a fun by completing the missions. The operations,in which I was dropped form the airplanes,were not as astonishing as I had expected.The singleplayer mode is kinda boring for a man of 2014. I've seen the same scenarios in COD series before,so I was not excited by this aspect.But on the other hand,the gameplay is unique,different from COD engine and many other games.Shortly speaking,if you played this game the year it was published,you would totally be excited by the innovation...Multiplayer...but then,I met with the multiplayer mode.Frankly speaking,I thought it would be a typical multiplayer where you have to eleminate all the targets and get the higher score on the table(Then be proud of yourself at the time you go to bed and think about to beat your K/D ratio record the next day). I was wrong,terribly wrong! At first,there are only few servers(about 10) and in only 3 or 4 servers you can see the marks of the ""Civilization"". My first imperssions were like: ""- OMG,am I playing the extincted game or what?"", ""- Where are all the people?"" or ""- This should be really bad multiplayer because of the few buddies playin it?!"" etc.  Yes,there are not thousands,hundreds or even tens of people on this servers,but about 40-50. The servers where everybody know and respect each other. I made new friends regarding to this awesome game. We are speaking,joking,having a lot of fun every evening in TS and I complain about a single thing - I would have bought it before.ConclusionIf you are a man of war,If you are a great fun of WWII games,If you like WWII featured multiplayers,or if you just want to make new friends and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game[/b]Medal of Honor: Airborne is for you!

												Underrated WW2 shooter. If you're a fan of this particular genre, I would go for this. A few cons about this title:Seems to suffer from consolitis, not many options graphics wise. It also lacks mouse smoothing which makes scoring head shots difficult. You will definitely notice this while using iron sights. It must be due to the porting to PC. As blasphemous as this sounds, you should consider playing it with a controller. It actually makes scoring head shots easier. This game is also a serious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥on the hardest difficulty setting. The enemies will beat your♥♥♥♥♥if you play gung ho. This game is also cheesy in the sense that it respectfully plays tribute to the heroes of WW2 in a way that might make you cringe. Gore is absent, this isnt the gritty experience that was COD:WaW that overshadowed this gamePros:This game has a couple cool features such as challenges to earn medals and weapon upgrades that must be earned from scoring kills with the particular weapons. The level design is also spot on. Since you are airborne, you parachute onto the map and have a little freedom to land where you please. You can land in a safe area or far behind enemy fortifications. But be warned, on higher difficulties, the fascists will cave in your skull. Despite it's mentioned shortcomings, I would still recommend this to anybody who is a fan of ww2 era first person shooters.			",115,3,0,14,3,0,4

												Medal of Honor: Airborne exemplifies the importance of the soldiers in the Airborne Division. While the game doesn't inherently have a story, it does have a flow of the various operations the 82nd Airborne Division played a part in. In my opinion, that's what makes this a great WWII game. It's a classic FPS with simple gameplay. There's nothing to hate about it. It's not perfect, and sometimes the fighting is repetitive. It's also relatively short. But it's a great game, nonetheless.I give it an 8.0/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												I grew up playing Call of Duty (2003) , United Offensive (2004), and Call of Duty 2 (2005). I recently bought the original Medal of Honor (1999), Allied Assault (2002), and this game (2007) to see what I was missing out on, and to compare them to Call of Duty's franchise, game-to-game based on release year. Medal of Honor has no comparison due to it's release year so I'll leave it be, but Allied Assault is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to Call of Duty and United Offensive. However, I think Airborne beats Call of Duty 2 as far as the gameplay, controls, and story go. The medal awards like a strip clip for a Mauser are interesting and give the player something to strive for. The leaning is like Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014). While you're aiming down the sights (ADS), you can use WASD to lean left, right, up, and down. Hold Shift and you're able to walk around while ADS. The controls feel intuitive and the graphics hold up against Call of Duty 2.			",115,18,0,15,12,0,1

												Overall, Medal of Honor Airborne does a very good job of creating a unique atomoshopere that most first person shooters lack. Medal of Honor Airborne is a very immerisve first person shooter, the ambient sound and overall feel are excellent, and the shooting mechanics are very fun and easy to get use to. The story and map design is also a plus, the unique idea behind paratrooping into battle is nice, but not exemplified enough. Another drawback is the poor AI, allies in this game are essientally useless, you will notice that you are literally killing everyone, and doing most of the workload, and the enemies are always darting around and sticking their heads out in the open, also, this game doesn't have much replayability, after you beat the game, there is little reason to pick it back up and play it, the other difficulties don't expand on the game much.In the end, this game is a steal for the price, it is a great game in the Medal of Honor series and one of my favorite WWII FPS in recent memory.

												Medal of Honor: Airborne (MoH: A) is essentially an overlooked game that offers a worthwhile experience especially given its low cost. The gameplay offers an emersive atmosphere with detailed graphics and awesome WWII sounds. However, MoH: A has a few drawbacks that will sometimes have you bashing your head onto your keyboard. The biggest of which is the increasing difficulty that carries on throughout the campaign where new enemies are introduced that are stubborn to your virtual bullets. Still, if you're looking for some good World War II action based upon the famous paratroopers of the era, then MoH: A is a no-brainer.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												TLDR: if you can get the game on sale, it's a good way to spend an afternoon.Picked up this game for around $3 USD, and beat the campaign on normal difficulty in about 5 hours(let the game running while I was AFK for a bit).  Campaign was enjoyable enough if you're in the mood for an old-style WWII shooter.  Word of caution: some guns feel frustratingly bad due to randomized bullet dispersion.  Firing the pistol and the Thompson from anything further than about 10 meters was especially egregious.  The other frustrating thing was the German ""super-soldier"" guys the game invents for mini-bosses.  I assumed they could not be killed by bullets because of the cutscene in which they are introduced, in which one shrugs off a bullet.  This is not true.  They just take an exorbinant amount of damage to kill.  I had better luck killing them with AT grenades and rockets.Overall, while the gameplay felt unrefined and sloppy at times, I enjoyed the quick nostalgia trip.  Well worth my time and the small amount of money I paid.			",43,12,0,8,4,0,3

												The title has great gameplay and presentation, but the issues that plague it — the sudden inclusion of out-of-place enemies and the woefully unbalanced multiplayer portion —tend to drag down the overall enjoyment level of an otherwise spectacular game.The lack of narrative finesse and the toning down of the scripted events was a good call. It’s not quite the open world shooter that was promised, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.Medal of Honor Airborne delivers the most compelling MOH experience in recent years. If you’re looking for a fun, chaotic WWII game this Holiday season, Medal of Honor Airbone is a great choice.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												I was very suprised with this game (after I got it to work). It took me by suprise on how fun this game is. With the new fps games that give you linear gameplay and cinematic explosions and destruction its kinda unrealistic and yet still fun but can make it boring since everything is always the same... but this game just pushes you out of a plane and wherever you land is where you start your mission.. the game lets you do whatever you want when ever you want as long as you dont die.. the verticality that you get with this game is great cause you can just sit up on the roof and snipe nazis like theyre paper targets.. run and shotgun their guts out... or stay by your men and shoot an m1 grande into their heads.. it lets you play the way you want.. now there are some issues with this.. 1) its quite short, 10 hours if you take your time.. 2) playing the multiplayer is basically suicide since theres so many people on a distant roof sniping.. 3) if you dont have teh physx program you gotta look for it on teh internet and download it.. but even before that, your video card may not be supported (which means you gotta youtube it or know a bit about computers)so i give it a 7/10..

												I recommend this game, but only to fans of WW2 and when it is on sale. This review is based on the singleplayer only though, as I haven't played multiplayer and suspect it is dead, like most of the tacked-on MP modes for these types of games from this era.I played this game years ago back on the Xbox 360 and therefore remember many parts of the game, so it took me less than 4 hours to complete on normal difficulty. I doubt it would take more than 5 hours for a new player however, even on the harder difficulties.The gameplay overall is good, as you get to spawn out of the C-47 transport plane and land anywhere on the map to start. You can achieve the mission objectives in any order, altough some orders are certainly easier than others.The gunplay is somewhat funny. It's hard to describe, but it feels very strange. Bullets often fail to register hits on target, and some guns perform very strangely and randomly.There is a standard amount of American and German weapons from the war, and they all have 3 levels of upgrades as you gain kills with them. You cannot take these upgrades off however.Movement is very clunky, and you often feel slowed down by some strange force, and your inputs will get stopped. The story follows the 82nd Airborne throughout the war in 6 missions, from Operation Husky to the Ruhr. The characters, and plot of them is truly nonexistent.Overall, its not a great game, but also not a bad one. Again, I would only recommend to WW2 fans when it is on sale, since unless you plan on replaying to grind the upgrades on all the weapons or hunt for some token in-game medals that don't show up on steam, there is little content.

												Not your traditional MoH, but still a great game nonetheless. What sets Airborne apart from previous MoH games is that you are not a single agent sneaking behind enemy lines; instead, you are a paratrooper dropping into a large scale battle. The “one man army” feeling is nonetheless preserved, for better or worse. Fellow NPC paratroopers accompany you throughout each mission, though their combat effectiveness is questionable. They neither help nor hinder you very much in gameplay, though they at least provide cinematic backdrop for sense of a larger scale ground battle. Perhaps the biggest difference between Airborne and past MoH games is its nonlinearity. At the beginning of each level you (as the title might suggest) jump out of an airplane and land on the battlefield. During this jump you can steer your character towards anywhere you want to land (to an extent). Upon landing you are tasked with completing a number of objectives which are spread throughout the map. You may carry out these objectives in any order you please before a new area is unlocked through which you will complete the finale to the mission. This is a far cry to previous games of the series and in some ways it is therefore lacking. There are much less cinematic moments in Airborne that the series has been known for (like running across a family having dinner in Frontline), and entire missions take place in relatively the same battleground. In this vein, the game is somewhat disappointing. However, this it makes up in replayability. The singleplayer campaign clocks in around 5 hours long on normal (which is a bit short), however the freedom to start missions (almost) wherever you want and complete objectives in any order you want allows for exta hours of gameplay in comparison to MoH’s generally more scripted level design. In addition, there are various unlockables and collectibles such as weapon upgrades (unlocked by killing enemies) and “skill drops” (marked places on the map where you can land).If collectibles aren’t something you’re particularly into, the gameplay itself is a blast. Each weapon is punchy and satisfying to use. At the start of a each mission you can choose your own loadout, allowing for multiple playstyles. Want to land on a rooftop and pick off your enemies with a sniper rifle? You can do that. Want to run and gun through the streets with a thompson? You can do that too. To that end, the game allows you to choose your own pace. You can race through the mission if you please, completing objectives as quickly as possible, or you can simply take your time, picking off enemies one by one. In gameplay, Airborne truly does feel a lot like a MoH game, yet more open to different playstyles. One unique feature in Airborne is a Ravenshield-esque leaning system. Whilst aiming down the sights you can press the WASD keys to lean your character to and fro in different directions. Unfortunately, whilst doing this, you cannot move from where you are standing (unless you hold shift as I later found out). It is by no means a bad feature, but its implementation is strange and makes movement in the game awkward sometimes. The game would certainly benefit from the ability to toggle this feature but alas, there is none.Airborne offers a new experience for MoH veterans, perhaps not one they may have hoped for, but a fun one nonetheless. Hardcore fans may have trouble accepting Airborne as a true MoH game, and maybe it isn’t, but it is by no means worth passing up.			",170,16,2,16,14,0,27

												Don't buy this through Steam. I downloaded the game, launched it and it came up with ""your video card is not supported"".Okay, that's fine. Easy fix. Just followed the steps online and it launched without a hitch.Now here is the really annoying part: To change the graphics settings you need to launch a seperate .exe file and change it through there. Problem is, when I launch the moah_setup.exe it comes up with.... ""your video card is not supported""! I've spent at least an hour trying to solve this issue and nada. This is unacceptable as to even get the game to launch correctly you need to manually change the settings in the folder in order to run it. Great Game, but locked at 20 fps because I can't change the damn settings.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At this point there are 9586 WW2 first person shooters clones out there (maybe not that much, but there are many)This is the best single-player experience I have ever had with any of them, not that I played so many of them to say this one is the ""best"", but 90% of these games are linear keep-running-and-shooting-brainless-enemies. In this one, each scenario is designed not as a going-from-point-A-to-point-B linear thing but as a very big ""square"", where you fall from the sky (and choose where to fall) and team-work your way out of each situation and objective with your AI team-mates. There´s always more than one way of flanking a certain situation, there´s always more than one objective you can choose to go to (or fall into) The game is specially fun if played in the hardest level of difficulty, where you really feel the need to ""supress"" and you get supressed most of the time (you even get routed away if you want to survive when you see those nazis outnumber your guys and charge against you, those are funny moments)This one is an """"old"""" game now, by modern super-graphic standards, but it aged very very well, and  if you want a single player experience that ""feels"" a lot like a multiplayer with lots of moments of script, right now is selling at 2,5 dollars, it´s really a bargain and it´s worth it.

												Some people complain about the game,but actually they don't  like mechanics of the game.I've played on Expert, it was an amazing experienced gameplay. Almost every weapons have a poor accuracy and high recoil, it s hard to control them while firing. Play this game for about 30 min - 1 hour and you gonna used to it. The mission in the game is fun but you can't expect a good storytelling like COD because this is MoH, in this game you feel like you are one man army anyway because teammates have a bad AI, they just run into enemies and die. After all,I recommend this game when It sales over 50%			",158,6,10,12,10,0,14

												A fine WW2 FPS, with an interesting upgrade system and a unique aiming system.It does have a few issues here an there, such as being very short. You'll also have to get used to the game's awkward hit detection and tolerate some bad AI every so often.However, despite its issues it manages to be a very entertaining game. It's fun trying out different weapons to see what upgrades you will get next and the level design is great. The areas are pretty big, but there's always places to hide. Moreover, the game allows you to take on most objectives in whatever order you feel like you can travel wherever you like in the level.I say it's worth checking out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Medal of Honor: Airborne is a wild, wild WW2 ride. Over the course of six missions (not much, yeah), you parachute behind enemy lines, complete various objectives in any order you want, then move on to some grand finale for the level. The weapons you use level up with kills, like scopes and taped magazines. There isn't much meat on the story, but the locations are diverse enough to make you want to finish the game at least once.Some of the better aspects are sadly uncommon in most modern shooters. You can start anywhere you want on the map thanks to the parachuting mechanic, then complete the level in almost any way you want. Even though the gun leveling can be grindy for underpowered weapons like the Kar98k, it's worth it for the enhancements and fun mods that come with it. Can anyone say full grenade restocks for rifles with grenade launchers, and a dagger for the MP40 that sends enemies flying on melee kills?Unfortunately, the game is short, and aside from the completionist stuff you won't find much of a reason to keep going after replaying the best levels. Also, the melee system is pretty weak without the BAR's bayonet or the MP40's dagger: enemies will charge you and bash you to death while your screen flashes white, all while your wimpy melee attacks fail to hold them off. The difficulty has serious slopes to deal with, especially when you deal with several sniper nests at once in the 5th mission. The last mission is almost a cakewalk compared to it, even with all of its unique challenges. The multiplayer is basically dead, so don't expect to find many people to play with. Also, the game has an issue with PhysX that requires manual fixing. There are guides on Steam that explain how to do it in a straightforward way.I would recommend getting this game on sale for half off or more. It's a fun experience overall, but it's too short to justify spending more than five dollars.			",103,2,0,1,4,3,4

												God, you know where do I begin? I had this for my Xbox around when It was first released, I loved it at the time. I decided one day to go and look for it, no luck. ""Screw It!"" I said, and then I bought it on Steam. I still remembered a lot of it, but It still was so damn good, I think maybe even better playing it again on the PC. Like all Medal of Honor games (No, I'm not including the new ones that EA ripped out of their♥♥♥♥♥ they have such great soundtracks. Airborne had a fantastic soundtrack and had some songs from the originals, which is damn awesome. Now, the sounds in this game are the best I ever heard. Not even joking with that one, they're really awesome. Weapons are a blast to shoot and the non-linear gameplay added into a World War 2 Paratrooping game is fantastic. Awesome idea. I would be glad for EA to make a second one. No, not with modern warfare compete with crappy Call of Dudy, but actually once again World War 2. Please, can a big company make a World War 2 game again? Like the old days? Please Call of Dudy or Medal of Honor, just make one, like the classics.			",255,18,6,10,7,2,30

												At a first glimpse, it LOOKS promising and the very idea of jumping out of a plane hadn't been done before this game, so obviously it was innovative in its own way. This doesn't unfortuneately pave the way for the player for a smooth and enjoyful player experience. With a dumb A.I (almost ""Crysis-dumb""), lack of graphical enhancements and a hitbox that makes you bald from all those frustrating moments,  it has some serious problems, which obviously the developers didn't tend do. Given that this is the last entry of the series in the WWII setting, it's a letdown considering how successful MoH: Allied Assault was. Long story short: it's a serious letdown for any MoH fans and yet another cliche filled game, with a story obviously inspired by the TV-series Band of Brothers, released the same year (2007). Too bad it wasn't as successful. This game get's 1,5 Nazis out of 5!			",184,33,10,8,11,1,31

The parachuting in aspects and huge maps make each ecperience different every game; though not as different as the destruction from BF:BC2.

												Easily the best Medal of Honour game ever made, it's just unfortunate that the story is so short. But it makes up for fantastic mechanics. You can sprint, aim down sights, jump over cover and hide behind it while peeping up to shoot the enemy. A new mechanic added is the ability to jump down into the battle via parachute. No other game before this has let you do that,. you can fly down to any location on the map, whether it's safe or full of enemies that will shoot you as soon as you land.This mechanic is also present in the multiplayer aspect of the game which makes for an incredibly fun experience.If DICE were to ever make a WW2 based Medal of Honor game again, I would love to see the Allied Assault game and expansions remade in the Airborne engine. That'd be a dream come true.I recommend this game fully, it's incredibly fun and the multiplayer is still active today, so have some fun while it lasts!			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												This game really has a unique style of play with great visual affects to back it up. The graphics are really great and the single player action really does a great job at keeping you entertained through the whole campaign. The problem with this game is that it feels repetitive when you get close to the end of the game, I wish there was a more in depth story and missions. There were sometimes in the missions when I didnt know were to go and I was wondering around for awhile to get back on track because it doesn't always guide you with the little mini map. The sounds of the guns are good but not great. This game has alot of potential to be something really great but lacks with the single player aspect and not much support with the multi-player. The multi-player is laggy and has a small community of die hards.  Its a great single player game, but just make sure you get this one on sale.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												A great fun oldschool fps.Pros:- Good graphics for the age (2007).- Good gameplay.- Cheap (Got it for £4 on G.2A.).- Easy to run.Cons:- Multiplayer is pretty much dead but still fun when you get a game.- Gun disapears but still usable .- Leaning can be sometimes annoying but sometimes useful .- nVIDIA Physx causes the game to sometimes freeze on start up but you'll just need to reinstall it.

												Well it's Medal of honor! I read about others having issues getting it to work but I have had none. My pc came as is I did not build it like others do and I have never had issus with any steam game! Now to get done to the game....its great but I am writing this as I play the first mission. I can say it's worth the money! As the world war II guy I can say this is how medal of honor should be.It's the last good one and 2007 was the tail end of my game gen. I was not a pc gamer I was a ps2 gamer but now I put my money into steam. It works for me just be aware it might not for you as others say.			",83,8,6,4,16,2,8

												Medal of Honor airborne is a good world war 2 shooter. The  Mechanic in which you parachute down and decide what objectives you take on is pritty cool. While it doesnt grant you the ability to craft your own stroy it is a fun way to do things. The nazi doom fortress at the end is just an awsome mission. Play this game.			",302,21,4,48,14,1,38

												Used to have this on the Xbox 360, then the PS3, and then the Xbox 360 again (because I sold it and missed it... a lot). Playing through it again made me realise what a great game this is.It's fun and enjoyable to play, and I really like the open world style it is (you choose which order you want to do the first few objectives in before the big objective happens).It's addictive, and the upgradeable weapons is something I rather like, spices things up a little.

												I played this game when I was younger along Medal of Honor Pacifics and I must admit that they were really good even though they were not as great as Medal of Honor Allied Assault plus its expansions, It's really short and unfortunately it has no bots mod like Medal of Honor Allied Assault does.It may not be a gem like Medal of Honor Allied Assault is but it is a great game that is worth playing a few times.The guns are pretty nice to use, the weapons upgrades are a great addition, the shotgun is real fun to use.The maps are big enough for a game of this genre.The music is real great.Overall it's pretty good.8/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

Posted: September 3, 2016
												I love this game. I played it a whole lot on my Xbox360 years back and I thought I'd jump back in and check it out again recently. I may be biased because of nostalgia.Good Points:- Fun FPS gameplay with a 'drop into the battlefield from the air' twist.- A variety of fun weapons which you can upgrade the more you use them (skipping an 'experience/level-up' mode for a simpler weapon-levelling one).- Each mission feels unique and has its own atmosphere. Everyone will have their own favourite mission. (That being said, the gameplay doesn't varymuch from *stuff gun in hand and run into battlefield to blow things up.* But this game makes that fun, and somehow feel varied.)- Even though it's a little old now, the graphics aren't antique; pretty good for a game nearing a decade old.- Sniping is my jam and this game does it well. You feel powerful when you can headshot a helmet from the other side of the map. You don't complete many/any objectives doing this but it's fun all the same and is encouraged due to vertically versatile maps.You'll have lots of chances to snipe.- Spotting a stick grenade as it lands at your feet and kicking it back into a cluster of enemies. - The final mission is lovely. A huge AA obstacle swarming with the enemies you love to dread (you'll know the ones) that to all intents and purposes seems undefeatable. But you worm your way deeper into its machinery and ... well you'll find out the rest. You feel great when you finish the game and will want more.- Gammon grenades. Pack a Comp-B charge into a grenade the size of a small melon and underarm it into an Anti-Aircraft turret. Just do it.Bad Points:- Short campaign! I could have played a campaign twice as long. (Would love an Airborne sequel.)- Upgrading your weapons (with one or two exceptions) gives you only one of two final modifications: granade launcher attachment, or scope attachment. I guess you either have to love blowing things up or sniping things. ***SNIPING THINGS***- Glitches. Prepare to see a fallen enemy turn his ragdoll body into a twisted knot of limbs once in a while. You get this in many games. You know the drill: don't look directly at the glitches.- My laptop runs the game perfectly except for a little lighting bug where some characters and objects in cutscenes occasionally look opaque black. The projector image in the briefing tent doesn't show up because of this either. I know the missions so don't need the briefing but I can imagine it might be annoying for a new player who runs into the same bug.- Parachuting is hard to control on the PC and you'll run into lots of invisible walls in the sky if you try and parachute too far. That first ten seconds of a mission isn't a detriment to the game though.- CAMPAIGN TOO SHORT.Overall I'd rate a 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  Yes, it's WWII, so don't expect a hyper-complicated story, groundbreaking visual design, or creative weaponry.  But, the shooting mechanics are good, the weapon upgrade system encourages you to experiment with different weapons, the AI is competent, and the respawn system of parachuting in as well as the nonlinear mission objectives provide some nice tactical depth to an otherwise straightforward shooter.  The battles always feel big with multiple moving fronts (and new ones opening up with AI allies parachuting in), but you'll never be far from the action.			",153,34,0,50,13,0,53

												Medal of Honor Airborne is a game where you jump out of planes, and land into a battlefield where you can go to any objective you feel like, the enemies are smart and they increase in power every level, and soon you will end up fighting crazy enemy types, sadly, the multiplayer was shutdown, but the singleplayer is where its at, its a well done game and is not overdone like new games have done these days, it is a great game, and hours of fun FOR EVERYONE!

												This isn't a BAD game. Medal of Honor: Airborne is fun for half of its campaign, and it has things that set it apart from both the other games in the Medal of Honor series, and other FPS games - especially the paradrop system, which is a neat way to try out a new approach to getting past its nasty difficulty. While it is fun, it has several glaring problems that make it difficult to recommend. First, the difficulty. Airborne seems to be a cover-based shooter (Not with the systems like in Gears of War or other such games, but there is an emphasis on not running-and-gunning). Enemies do a lot of damage and rip through your health easily if you're not absurdly careful. This is enjoyable at times, especially when you only realize after you land that you're surrounded and manage to fight your way out regardless. Later on, the difficulty ramps from unfair to unforgiving, with juggernaut-type enemies that are extremely difficult to take down and snipers that seem to be able to fire through their own cover, making it impossible to counterattack. The less said about the sniper-accurate rocket launchers employed against you, the better.Second, the AI. The enemy AI is fantastic, and they put up a challenging fight throughout the game. They react how you would expect a trained army to react, pinning you under suppressive fire and using grenades to flush you out of cover. Later on, this again becomes relentless, especially when you compare it to the ally AI, which is comparatively pitiful. Your allies are either gunned down in seconds, run directly into your line of fire, or take cover near you and inadvertently push you into enemy fire. The enemy AI is almost too good when your allies are held against them, because you can never count on their support. (I also encountered a glitch where having an ally even nearby would cause the crosshairs to 'x' out as though I was aiming at a friendly, when I was aiming at an enemy instead. This got old, fast.)Third, and most damning, was the gunplay. I can only describe it as excessively slippery. Without turning the sensitivity near the bottom, I was unable to hit just about anything even when given time to line up a shot, and when scoped weapons came into play, I might as well have been hip-firing with the pistol. I'm not even bad at first-person shooters, generally. I had to grind to get the upgraded SMG and pistol to even stand a chance in close combat, and when the juggernaut enemies came into play later, it was a crapshoot whether they could be beat or not. Not to mention, this cover-based shooter seems to have infinite enemy spawns - meaning that bizarrely, the most effective strategy was to try and sprint across the flanks of the enemy to get close enough to spray-and-pray. TLDR: Brutally difficult, shoddy ally AI, bad gunplay, INFINITE ENEMY SPAWNS. It's still aged better than older MoH games, but that's not stiff competition, and you're better off spending your money elsewhere.			",136,5,1,15,24,2,28

												Controllable WW2 parachuting / Unrealistic scenes of battle compared to what really happend / Nazi super soldiers / Overpowered mp40 / falling 50 feet and living / dying every minute on easiest difficulty /  5 million pictures of the same exact nazi commander / blowing up an ancient 2000 year old temple / destroying alot of useful technology / parachuting into cities / melee every single enemy witha stick grenade and flying them 20 feet / 11/10 will never play again			",34,2,0,2,5,0,6

												The AI in this game is the most stuipidist thing besides the bot AI in Red Orchestra 2. If you even dare peek your head out you'll get shot. They'll only target you. Not your Allies. And your Allies. Jeeze. They just stand in the middle of the battlefield calling out to you and others. Occasionally shooting and mossing their shots.  But. The maps are fairly fun and decent. Guns are great too. Besides going iron sights and getting ridiculous sensitivity i had to hip fire my bloody sniper and my M1 Garand.  I bought this game because it reminded me of Band Of Brothers. It's okay... Just that the AI is stuipid.  really dumb. 7/10. I've played worse.			",157,11,2,15,4,0,13

												This game is ""not compatible"" with my 4700mq/Gtx760m... OR my 8350/R9 390 OR my 8320/GTX950. This game has serious compatability issues. As I have tried this on three different computers and I can't even try to launch the game because of this ""This game is not compatible with your hardware"" message. Be ready to return this game.If you can et this game working, It is a blast of nostalgia. The graphics are on par with games of it's release and helped innovate the shooter genre. I hope that this game is not: ""not compatible with your hardware""			",182,41,8,18,21,2,27

												english is not my native language so stick to this and my laziness to write without captions and stuff ^^ opinion counts lolMedal of Honor: Airborne was the last WW2 MOH released in 2007 a special feature was that you get airborne can steer where you land and so on which is pretty cool how ever there are some problmes with that and the game itself but first lets start with the good sides of the game+health system with a mix of permanent hp with medkits and regenerating health+airborne feature+fighting with ai mates+free levels do and go where you want on the level and do witch objective and in which way you want it to be done+weapon upgrade system use a weapon enought and you get an upgrade like dual mags,polished bolt,5round clip,better shotgun ammo,foregrip,compensator,rifel grenades,and more+different types of enemies and weapons also feel different from each other actually that should be expected in a gameneutral:ratings on missions-medals to unlock i dont really am after such stuff but its something you can go for OKAY AND NOW THE NEGATIVE PARTS-the thompson feels really ineffective without upgrades the mp40 just feels much better without upgrades-the Mauser pistol is only usable very late in game which means you get a pistol with weaker damage than the colt and no upgrades since your colt would probably already have some already its just to late to get some and to inneffctive to go for some since it will be very hard then because of the weapon and level-unupgraded shotgun could be abit stronger it feels so useless unupgraded and upgraded hmm not really good mps would always do allmost the same job  and be more more effective on range-some upgrades ruined  my loadout the g43 a semi automatic rifel as  3 third upgrade got a scope which also gave it the sway and far less usability in shorter rangers and i already had a sniper for long ranges which also would be better at that job (long range fighting)-all enemies have weapons of course but it feels like they drop them rarely  there have been moment where i was out of ammo and only had my pistol and those werent to few and the pistol is very unnacurate -some special landing zones are just death traps you get surrounded or basicly are then and die without or a low chance yet the game tells you how importen safe zones are yet again there are special lading zones who are difficult but some just ridicoulesly diffecult especialy on hard to survive-in about the last 3 missions your guys feel more like a bad  distraction  eventho thats where you would need them most and sometimes i saw them hang abit back eventho i needed them infront of me or to advance because there was the enemy -a sniper rifel can be steadied if you pull the trigger slowly works on console but not really here mostly you have to deal with the sway or waste one bullet then hold the left mouse boutton  and click to shoot or what i just found out press right click and minimaly after it hold left click but the game of course does not explain it  ( how the steading works on pc)-the games does not explain how to do a perfect landing it says slow down but in reality -have enought space before youre are on the ground a moment hold w (going forward yep so much to slow down) swipe up with the mouse atleast that workd for me 80% of the time -the normal multiplayer doesnt seem to work anymore i cant login maybe there are other ways to play online probably there are or THE FOLLOWING PART WILL BE LIKE A EXPRESSED LIKE A SMALL RANT BUT BASICLY ITS TRUE - NAZI STORM ELITE soldiers with the mg42 can kill you in an instant to 1 secound on expert probably also on normal  and eat bullets like juggernauts also grenades expect gammon grenades  and they are accurate as hell and just so many in the last level how many? i guess 20 and i dont thing u have 2x 20 40 gammon grenades well it feels  unfair  especialy when you are supposed to strom the 2floor hq area i would call it in the last mission  its basicly a death trap that you have to go through took me hours and its so cheap alot of soldiers feels like 4-6 of those storm elites small window where some of them and others shoot out and rocket launcher guys from above yea......sure  lets just say they are an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and even for the parts before that you will not have enought grenades to deal with all of them  you dont need to deal with all 20 in total in this mission but it will mostly come down on hard to die gammon get grenades kill them do 1-2 objectives die the grenade ammo chest is refilled repeat at least this was how it was for me which was on expert ",24,3,0,3,0,0,0

												Disclaimer (Sorry for my english)I will start from the beggining. This game is AWESOME, but it`s AWESOME for me not that it has great graphics or a wonderful multiplayer, no it doesn`t, but this game and aspecialy Medal of Honor series lie deep in my heart, because these were my favourite games in my childhood (Allied Assault, Spearhead, Breakthrough, Pacific Assault, Airborne and so on) and thats why I can`t say anything bad about them, because I love them the way they are. But still, I will let you guys know my neutral opinion about this game. It is underrated, people just dont even know that this game exists, because call of duty, counter strike and other popular shooters rule the gaming market. The singleplayer is short, the AI sometimes (ussualy) makes stupid things, texture problems (minor), bugs and so on. But the story for me was very interesting and the way you enter a mission each time is truly something new: after jumping of a plane the game lets you decide wich objective you want to complete, where you want to land, what guns you want to use. Personaly I replayed the singleplayer ALOT of times, and every time it didn`t get boring for me. My personal rating would be 9/10 for the singleplayer.Multiplayer- very unbalanced, each time you die (allied side) you spawn in your parashute, yes it is fun to get on top of the building or take a view over the battlefield, but it is a pain in the butt when you get spawned killed by the enemy, because they see you, where you landed, also the maps are small for the parashuting, you don`t have so much landing spots to choose. Also there are currently 3 servers running, sometimes I see 50 people playing, sometimes I see empty servers, it`s a shame that it happend like this. My personal rating for the multiplayer would be 7/10In the end, my rating is 8/10 for this game. I would reccomend buying this game if you`re a fan of WW2 games, if you`re a fan of MOH series, or just you like to parashute from the skies and kill bunch of nazi soldiers :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just doesn't quite live up to expectations. Cool idea, but feels boring by the end of the game. If the player had more control over the drop in that would have been great, but you'll always drop in pre-determined areas. It's hard to describe the combat because it's always in flux. Sometimes things will be too easy, other times too hard, and it sorta feels like there's no real consequences to running and gunning everything. For a AAA title such as MoH, this game is more of a B+. If you're really hard up for something WWII flavored, then go ahead and get MoH:Airborne. Otherwise, buy something else.

												One of my favorite wwii games and series up untill 2010. When the series was ruined by modern warfare. Both, Call of duty and Battlefield took this game into a direction where it didn't belong. MOH should stay wwii. I highly recommend this game. the campaign is very re-playable. The only issue with this title is that you have to uninstall any physx you have and install the ageia physx that comes with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had to downgrade my Phsyx in order to get the game to run at all. There's a 50/50 chance of the game not crashing on EA's unskippable loading screen. The whole game crashes when you try to start the 3rd campaign mission, not to mention the buttload of bugs. This doesn't even remotely feel like a finished game, despite being sold as one. There are way too many game breaking bugs to even make the game playable from beginning to end. If you can get this game to run, its worth a play, but in the state it is in, EA or Steam need to get some kind of patch out for all the compatability issues.			",196,37,1,30,36,0,23

												Medal of Honour: AirbornePositives:+ Really fun shooting, loved it throughout the game.+ Mission design is varied and good.+ Weapon selection is numerous, the game includes all the classic World War II guns, like the MP40, Thompson, STG 44, Luger and more.+ The graphics are nice for the time period it was released in, and they're still pretty decent today.+ It's been awhile since I've played this title, so I don't remember much of the story. I suppose that indicates it's not a memorable story, but at the same time nothing terrible comes to mind. Hence, it must have been alright.Negatives:- Extremely short game, takes around 7-8 hours to finish. - Very linear, no replayability, restricted exploration.Overall Score: 7/10Medal of Honour: Airborne is a really enjoyable First Person Shooter. However, it's quite short so you don't get much bang for your buck, unless you buy it incredibly cheap on sale like I did. Therefore, I recommend it at under $2.50 (believe it or not, you can get it for that price if you look around).			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Sorry but personally I can't recommend this game. Head bobbing, horrible mouse input, weak gunplay (in comparison, Half Life, Unreal and COD2 had far superior gunplay) and motion blur that I can't be bothered to go to the files and edit it out. Sorry but this is a no for me. On the plus side, the physics of the game isn't as wonky as people set to make it to be. Pretty decent physics for its age.			",231,16,0,13,2,2,29

												I have to say, before I tried this game I though Battlefield 1942 was the best WW2 game out there, I mean, in a casual sense, of course then you have Red Orchestra but that falls more in the tactical FPS sense so we'll just leave it like that. Based on the MoH games before it, this is surely the best one, out of all of them, yes, even MoH 2010 and Warfighter and one of the best WW2 ones. You can't spawn in mid air and land where ever you'd like in any other game other than this one, using the Unreal Engine 3 this game will blow your mind, graphics are top notch, gameplay is pretty good actuall, the only problems I see in it are the: short but good campaign, technical difficulties and small but active and friendly community, there is even a mod for the game on ModDB that adds even more realism to it, just get it, you'll have nothing but fun once you start it, and if you can't start it, don't worry, that's when the community kicks in and helps you out, so search the forums for your answer and don't worry, it will be there, somewhere, I wouldn't of said it was a friendly and active community if it really wasn't.

												Pros:-Interesting concept-Runs smoothly with very few bugs-Story is interesting at the least-Very easy to pick up and play, no matter of the player's skill levelCons:-Can be a bit confusing where to go.-Criminally short single-player campaign-Some enemies can be hard to deal with the wrong loadout.Overall:7.5/10While it is affected by a few annoying bugs and glitches, MOH:Airborne still stands as a fresh and interesting entry into the huge market of WWII games. If you're a MOH fan or a WWII nut in general, this is a must buy for you. If you're just an fps nut, then i'd still recommend you pick it up due to how diverse and unique Airborne is from the stale military shooters.  I'd recommend you get it on sale seeing as how the multiplayer is mostly dead and the single player won't be worth a full $10.			",107,16,4,11,4,2,8

												A very interesting mechanic poorly executed.Being able to jump out of a plane to land anywhere on the field is a neat idea. You can land on a roof and shoot your way down, or land behind the enemy and flank them.And that’s about where the good ends.The weapons have a neat level-up mechanic. The more you use a certain weapon, you will earn attachments for it, and make it better. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the game when you don’t have any proficiencies, the weapons are incredibly difficult to use. I remember having a rifle, looking down the sights at an enemy’s chest, and emptying entire magazines without a single hit. The inaccuracy of the weapons in this game can make it very frustrating.The enemies scale, and get more difficult as you progress. That’s good. The highest level enemies, though, are laughable and unrealistic. Also, after five legitimate missions, the sixth and final mission feels like a giant spoof of the entire game.Lastly, the game’s big gimmick is parachuting to any place on the battlefield. I never once learned how to land correctly. The instructions were not very clear, and after failing all three times in the tutorial, I was approved and sent off to war. I played every mission, and made countless landings, and botched every single one. I was upset that I couldn’t do it, but even more upset that I couldn’t LEARN to do it.This game was a novelty when I was looking for something I hadn’t played before, but it’s not something I’ll ever go back to with fond memories.

												It's below average in my opinion, game itself lacks a couple of contents, Let's start with Campaign,the Campaign kind of makes no sense at all, in my opinion and the game is way too short which is dissapointing.the missions are also reppetitive, they will introduce you to new units in some missions, but then continues recycling those units, and the game itself in my opinion is quite boring, it's just ""parachute, do objective"" done. there is not much interesting parts in the game, such as long missions. for me, the missions are extremely short.Now, onto the Gameplay mechanics/gameplay featuresthe gameplay mechanics are pretty okay, in my opinion abit unique, but something new is always interesting eh? mybe that's just me, you can't walk while aiming. you can lean, and do commence melle's, that's pretty much it. you also get weapon upgrades like in Red Orchestra 2, but you will find some upgrade abit Overpowered, and there are less guns, since most content are recycled. you also encounter vehicles durinng gameplay, but they are very boring and reppetitive. you'll see, some objective are the same ""blow up this and that"" just different target, checkpoint system can get annoying too, the game dont automatically save, it save when you reach a certain place, even if you completed 1 objective, it still won't save.Story is also odd. you play as this dude called travis, i think, and hes basically a rambo version of The U.S Airborne during WWII, he can do everything and the airborne relies on him. ALL THE TIME.for you history buffs, expect to be dissapointed, this game has weird contents you'd usually see in Wolfenstein.overall, this game felt rushed.			",56,1,0,7,3,0,10

Because EA (once again screws you over) only likes you to play this for so many years before they want you to buy a new one. I mean I might need to make my computer dumber by making it Windows XP and take my GPU out as well. Don't worry. When clicking ""View Support Information"" to fix your problems with this game, it takes you to a flashing blue screen once you select your language. This must be coming from the reports of EA's staff having seizures of making the Origin client.			",148,13,3,8,4,3,1

												If you have an NVIDA card, don't buy this game.  There's a problem where the physX have never been updated so you can't play it on modern cards if you have updated NVDIA physX.  Honestly it was a great game when I played it on the Xbox and when I wanted to start playing it again it didn't work at all on the PC.  I've tried to forcefully change the physX version however all that proved to do was waste my time.  All in all, if you're running AMD, cool beans, if you're running NVIDIA, you will have regrets.

												I'll have to made a confession here in first hand, I pirated this game once, And of course I do have all the technical problem (Driver, Video card not support etc.) You name it!! Anyway the experience I got from this game was really mix, mix enough so I could specific like this.+ Great grpahic for its time, but even still 8 years past. It is still looking good in graphic.+ The soundtrack, Hell!! Made you felt like you were starring in Saving private ryan or those WWII movie!!.+ Upgrade system was fairly developed. But not to the point of ""Loadout"".+ Voice/Soundtrack was in a very fantastic quality.+ Airborne mechanic might not be that ground breaking, But it's still fresh and welcome to play with.- Blandddddd gameplay-The enemy AI dumb (but with a bullseye accuracy) but the Allies AI was the worse.- Too short (5 mission)- Weapon, I blast MP 40 at very point blank on the enemy face. And all he do was yelling and charging me with melee, suppose Nazi zombies theory was real huh?     So in final, if you ask me should I recommended this game to you? Wellllll If you were looking to jump from the plane and blast grandpa gun to nazis face without much care of character develop or storyline, This is the game for you. If not I say you stay clear of this game would be for your own good.			",132,39,0,11,2,0,4

												One of the criticisms of the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games is their painfully linear nature, Airborne was an attempt to address that issue. Unfortunately the implementation is pretty lacklustre and the maps end up feeling a bit like playing a multiplayer game with bots. The missions aren't terribly interesting as you typically just run from waypoint to waypoint planting det charges on various things. There is no real overall story and your squadmates are just anonymous generic soldiers...if the story gave any of them names I certainly didn't notice. The game is also painfully short, my playthrough was padded by sections where I'd get briefly lost working out exactly how to get to the next objective.That all said, the combat can be entertaining thanks to solid shooter mechanics. That alone ensures there is some fun to be had here to kill a few hours after a Steam sale, there are plenty of much better options though.			",348,129,5,34,18,2,23

Posted: September 4, 2014
												I am a pretty big fan of the good ol' Medal of Honor series, but as much as it hurts to say this, I can't really recommend this one. Yeah, I've played for mere minutes, but there's a reason for that. First off, upon my first start up of the game, I was waiting ever so patiently for it to install all the useless stuff, only for it to tell me that my graphics card is not supported. Now, because I have an Intel HD 4200, I can understand why this wouldn't work. Obviously, I wasn't gonna call it a day there. I looked around, searched the forums, the Googles, and found something called PhysX Legacy. Several places said installing this would make it work. Did that, no difference.I then found someone saying to just rename the setup .exe in the games files, and upon doing that, the game actually started up.And now, to the actual game itself.Because the setup was renamed, the game kinda ignored all the graphical stuff, and does not allow me to mess with the graphics settings. When playing a cutscene, most, if not all the characters are simply black silhouettes. I was watching as one of them was showing me my objective in a town in Italy, which just turned out to be a blank wall. So, if you end up like I did where your card is not suppoted, you can't do much about the cutscenes.Now, the gameplay. The first mission, and probably every single other mission, starts out with you jumping out of a plane. You parachute into the town, your objective to take out AA and artillery guns. Now, this is just my opinion, but I didn't like the fact that it didn't matter what order I completed my objectives. I found myself running through the empty streets, from one side of the town to the other, all of a sudden running into some firefight close to the objective. I've played Allied Assault, European Assault, Rising Sun, Vanguard, and the missions were all linear and not really picky. I think that's how it should have been with Airborne. The idea of choosing how to do the mission is cool, but something about the topic and the way it was executed just makes me think that it's not as good as it could be. In Vanguard, you did the same thing, jump, land, and one by one finish your job. In Airborne, you jump, and you can finish the mission as you please.The shooting is a bit odd to me, but that's probably because I'm used to shooting without iron sights, like in the old MoHs. You can sprint, the health bar is different than just about every other MoH, giving you 4 bars that can regenerate with either health packs or just over time, so long as the bar is not empty. In Vanguard, it worked like CoD, get shot, wait a few, its like nothing happened. In the older ones, you had 100 health, and could only get more if you picked up bottles, medkits, etc.I do not reccomend because the game is simply too much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get up and running, and if you have the problem I had, you will not be able to toy around with the graphic settings. Hell, there isn't even an option to do so, other than brightness and whatnot. The multiplayer is also a major disappointment, as there is only 10 or less people playing. Allied Assault has more players than this game, and that's a game from 2002. If you're concerned about the story of it, it's World War 2. Not your forte? Go back to your futuristic bolonga. Medal of Honor Airborne was probably amazing in its day, but in 2014, it only causes problems and disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story mode:There are only 6 campaigns in total. I spend less than an hour to finish a campaign. Overall, it has a very short story line.I don’t feel any FPS sense from this game, it is not realistic at all.The mission guidelines are very bad. You will not know your next objectives and the directions.You can only arm a few type of famous WW2 weapons.Online:The multiplayer mode is dead as there is no people playing on the online server.Conclusion:I am a WW2 fans and I love Call of Duty (COD) 1 very much. COD has a better play styles, stories and more online servers than this MOH game. This MOH game should performs better as it released few years after the COD launched, but it does not. I feel disappointed to this game.If you are a WW2 fan, buy this game when there is on sale.If you are not a WW2 fan, never buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have bought this game expecting it to live to the standards of the original Medal of Honor or Call of Duty games. Sadly, it didn't.While the game does not have any ""glaring"" flaws, it just does not work well. The story and cinematics are not in any way compelling or remarkable, the gameplay is monotonous, the controls are not very user-friendly (at least for me) and the only interesting part (jumping from the plane) is only used rarely.I played the first two missions, uninstalled the game and I won't be coming back to it again.

												As a veteran of many shooters in last 15 years, I feel pretty comfortable writing this review. I also feel cheated and betrayed, both by developers and people who wrote positive reviews about this... monstrosity. I'll try to be brief - combat doesn't work. This game has hands down the most awkward and non-functional aiming and movement controls I've ever seen. Imagine trying to play Call of duty wannabe with DayZ controls and you'll get portion of what you'll experience. I've tried to get used to it. Cannot be done. No amount of sensitivity tweaking has helped the feeling as if I was playing with gamepad, only I was still holding my mouse. That's how inprecise and awkward aiming and movement in general feels. There is also leaning system, and it's useless. It's not that the leaning system is a terrible idea, but it's executed horribly. Wolfenstein: New World Order actually uses that feature well, but here, it's just infuriating. While running, or even moving, your screen jumps up and down, which will make you sick and always completely disorient you. Seriously, I've never seen this - a game where every movement results in confusion. They got every. Single. Damn. Thing. Wrong.It doesn't even matter that all the singleplayer maps feel like playing a long, tired team deadmatch with bots, that they're completely uninspired and that enemies are absolute morons that run and jump around like rabbits, but become quite dangerous because of their perfect aim and sudden spawn. Fundamentals are completely broken and with that, even if the game had the most amazing campaign I've ever seen, it wouldn't save it, because playing it just isn't any fun. There is nothing in this game that would keep anyone who was some sense of decency to come back. I will recommend almost any other FPS over this, just play the previous Medal of Honor, hell, original Call of Duty, even though it hasn't aged well, is still a good, satisfying game - get that over this and enjoy your time. Airborne was first truly miserable Medal of honor game and the less people remember it, the better.			",325,78,2,53,49,2,53

												So far MOHA is one of my least mosy favourite WW2 game. I love the concept and all of that however the game just doesn't fall through I don't know if its the terrible cover system compared to a game from 2004. The story I had no attachment to so I have decided to give up for now but the real problem with the game is how it feels like a arcade game thats trying to br realistic or at least thats how I felt.I like the idea of it being free roam and being able to land in secret places in the map however if you just find were these locations are then all you have to do is jump and you get the award. here are many glitches like this in wich once I shot a enemy three times in the head and to my knowing it is not physically possible for a man to be hit it the head by a sniper rifle shot and continue to keep on killing other soldiers.Again I loved the idea of this game but had it been done by a studio without a time limit to push out their game I think it would of been a much better game. Although the Call of Duty franchise has no substance anymore it would of been better had it been done by a Call of Duty studio when they did games not just about killing a generic terrorist every year or maybe by the team from Ubisoft who made brothers in arms then maybe it would be a game worth spending more then £2.00 on like I did.In conclusion I would never recogmend this game to someone. I only really enjoyed the cutscenes inside the plane and parachuting parts but they were shortlived. Has nobody played COD2			",114,11,4,14,36,0,43

												Terrible game! Extremely dated graphics for 2007 with broken physics and A.I. Terrible, just not fun at all. Nothing like the original (even ignoring the graphics). Remember, the original (Allied Assault) came out around 2001? This looks like it's using the same engine. The problem is the PhysX installation which is impossible using a more recent Nvidia driver. Maybe it runs fine with a Radeon, I wouldn't know. I would stick with the console release of this game and skip this one on Steam--it's too high maintenance.			",129,19,1,20,10,0,22

												I'm not a big fan of the FPS genre so I might just be wrong, but from what I've seen in this game, MOH:A isn't a very good game. There isn't much to the game in terms of story, and usually you'd expect more from the gameplay. But then the very clunky control scheme is what pretty much ruins the experience. You can't move at all while aiming, which can get really annoying and disadvantageous. I'm not saying you should be able to move as quickly and as freely as usual, but at least you should be able to inch around a bit to get a better position, angle, or whatever. And this probably wouldn't have been as frustrating if the muzzle-loading process of some of the rifles weren't so terribly long. And yes, I'm playing on Hard mode. Simply switching to a lower difficulty still doesn't cut it.Another sort of nitpick I have with this game is that when you shoot at an enemy, there is very little if at all any realistic signs on the target if it's been hit. It could be anything, be it a moan, blood splatter or at least falling back a bit due to the impact of the bullet, or whatever. But here you only know you've hit an enemy when they die, apparently. This just makes no sense because ... seriously no human can endure getting shot without a wince and still keep shooting until they're down. That's just ridiculous.Not a very good FPS overall to me personally. I don't know much about this genre, but certainly there are things that the Call of Duty series has been doing way better than this game even since its first installment.			",252,43,6,21,21,3,33

Lots of shooting through or around enemies when there is a clear line of sight.  I ended up using only my hand gun during the first mission because it seemed to be the only effective gun and it still sucked :(I played all the old ones and this one is just set up for console..

												The controls are loose and over-sensitive, weapons feel disconnected from the player and have no oomph (Call of Duty suffers from this same problem), the FOV is nauseating, there's an arcane checkpoint system without proper manual saving that reaks of consolitis, missions have no continuity and are not even set up properly - gone are the lengthy briefings with their history lessons and detailed explanations of your purpose and the stakes for failure. This game feels completely unrelated to its predecessors. It feels like an arcade standup, all it needs is an ""Insert Coin"" after each death.All AIrborne achieves is to make me want to reinstall Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, a superior WW2 experience, a superior FPS experience, and a superior narrative experience. The franchise is dead.			",113,12,0,7,12,1,24

												Terrible, just terrible, picked this up for 2.79 after reading band of brothers and wanted something WW2. I regretted wasting that money on this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ not only is it riddled with weird visual and gameplay bugs, the game plays like a dumbed down call of duty knock off, expect lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, brain dead AI and weak ineffective guns, whilst enemies can fire through cover and pick you off from kilometres away. You know when you see a kid in your class, who you can tell is just not smart enough to be there? who you can tell is just not going to be good enough? that's this game and the people who made it. That's probably the reason there's only one medal of honour every few years, is because they suck. Games like this are just kind of insulting, I didn't expect much historical accuracy, but this game throws all that ""history""♥♥♥♥♥♥right out the window, to the point where the ""airborne infantry"" won world war 2 single handedly, releasing games like this is a bad ♥♥♥♥ing idea because it gives people the idea that a mediocre game with a terrible story is an acceptable standard. Avoid at all costs.			",182,35,3,18,10,1,33

												there's a must have mod for this game called Hajas Her mod for Medal of Honor: Airborne, it makes the weapons more deadly , yours and the enemy's.  This is my favorite of all the Medal of Honor games , I bought it on sale for the singleplayer campaign alone. It's one of my favorite First person shooters. A steal at 2 dollars and fifty cents.

												I gave this game a decent chance. I had to get over the wonky controls and the weird cover/lean system. That was all fine, what eventually made me lose my mind is having to start a game over from the beginning everytime you die. Ok so key here is not to die. Then the game crashes to the desktop at the exact same spot everytime, which means when I start the game it's from the very beginning of the first mission. In other words I can't even get passed the first mission without getting a bunch of curveballs thrown at me.Dang shame, the idea for the game seems fantastic if only it would work on newer PC's.

												This was such a disappointing experience. After a promising first level, the game falls so hard.So much missed potential, but this game is dragged down by stupid enemy spawns, putting the player against impossible odds, axial aiming that was clearly designed for a controller, and repeatedly going from an open ended level design to a very linear design. I really wanted to like this game. Seeing the entire level as you drop in is amazing. Choosing where you spawn in the map, brilliant. But it's when the game spawns 5 snipers and multiple squads of enemies around my entire friendly force of 4 guys that I get a little frustrated. At least this game still looks nice, even to this day. No problems running it either, though this just may be me.Fun fact: The steam version is the European version, meaning to swatzikas and a M rating. The American version (which can be obtained through Origin or a retail version) is only rated T, but has swatzikas. Kinda dumb who insensitve Europe is to the swatzika, huh?			",81,4,0,7,6,0,20

												Here's my experience of the first 3 hours:-You aim right at their heads and shoot like 5 times ... they are still standing there ... they shoot at you ... YOU'RE DEAD-They come to melee ... you blow your shotgun at them at point blank ... they are still punching you like a f*ucking retard ... YOU'RE DEAD -Shoot a f*cking bazooka BEHIND THEIR COVER (not into the cover) ... They don't even flinch ... they shoot at you with their panzerscresck (whatever the f that is) ...YOU'RE DEAD. -Throw a grenade into a room full of enemies .... 1 guy died... all the other guys run out to shoot at you... YOU'RE DEAD-Throw all grenades (6 or 7 grenades) into a room full of enemies ... all ran out to smash your face with their guns ... YOU'RE DEAD-Parachute into the green zone with 2 other guys.... the 2 guys got shot by 2 snipers in the front ... you're all alone fighting the snipers ... you have only one cover to hide from the snipers ...  then a group of germans came from behind aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnndddddddddd  ... YOU'RE DEAD-MGs are shooting at you ... try to aim and shoot at them to avoid getting hit ... can't move when you aim down sight ... YOU'RE DEAD-get hit everytime you pop your head out of the cover ... screen shakes like your character is jerking off everytime you get hit ... you can't aim for sh*t ... YOU'RE DEAD-Aim your gun at the first floor ... shoot in burst ... 10 bullets later and your gun is aiming at the second floor (Cauze realistic recoil)...  the guys on the first floor shoot at you .... YOU'RE DEAD-Shoot at a tank with a bazooka. ... try to run away ... can't run while you're reloading ... can't skip reloading animation ... tank blow you up ... YOU'RE DEAD-Throw a grenade while behind cover ... somehow AI teammate decides to run right in front of you ... grenade bounces back ... YOU'RE DEAD ( this has happened multiple times)-Enemies come from behind ... all your AI teammates push toward the objective ... you're left alone ... 7 guys shoot at your back at the same time ... YOU'RE DEAD-Enemies somehow magically appear close to you without showing their presence on the radar ... YOU'RE DEAD-Try to shoot at the guy who is about to take you down (you only half a slot of health left) ... AI teammate decides to run right in front of you (AGAIN) ... You shoot your teammate ...your teammate does not move... your teammate blocks all your bullets.... your teammate then proceeds to move aside just when you run out of bullets ... guess what ? ... YOU'RE F*CKING DEAD-Enemy blind-fires behind cover and somehow hit you all the time ... you lost half your health and decide to duck behind cover... pop your head out to shoot back ... can't hit the enemy cause he is blind-firing again... YOU'RE DEAD-5 guys charge at you ... you spray your thompson at them (50 bullets) ... 2 died ... the other 3 then proceed to bash you ... YOU'RE DEAD-Enemies stay behind wooden cover ... somehow their guns glitched through the cover and help them shoot at you ... you shoot at their cover hoping that the bullets would penetrate it and hit them ... NOPE .... YOU'RE DEAD- 3 teammates are standing in front of an MGs nest ... they shoot at the MG guy ... MG guy is still alive... you aim at the MG guy while he's busying fighting the 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ... MG guy somehow spots you and decides to stop fighting the 3 useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and shoot you instead ... YOU'RE DEADVerdict: you know the feeling when you aim your crosshair at a guy's head with an ak-47 while standing still and shoot at him and he's still alive and he turns around to one-shot you in CS:GO ?

												I don't have much of expectation for nearly 10 years-old game. However, since an overall review of Medal of Honor: Airborne is mostly positive and I am very satisfied Medal of Honor: Allied Assault in my younger days, I decided to try it.Sadly, I don't impressed really. Here is my opinionsGood:1. Many interesting features  like upgradable weapons, customizing loadouts etc. 2. Good game concept  (parachuting into map, unordered objectives).Bad:1. There are too many glitches ( unexpected teleportation from a balcony to the ground , suddenly unable to move).2. Campaign mode is very short.3. Shooting mechanisms are horrible that even older games of Call of Duty and Battlefield series are still much better.4. Cannot prone.Well, it seem that a lot of people like  Medal of Honor: Airborne, but I will recommend my friend to look for something else.			",23,0,0,0,0,0,11

												It's a decent enough game. The shooting is pretty terrible. The graphics are pretty bad even for their time. Most of the weapons have fairly bad sound effects. The maps are all pretty similiar. The weapon upgrades are hilariously odd, your final upgrade is a bayonet... that you slap people with instead of stabbing...  The ""award notification"" system is bugged I think. There's only like 5-6 missions. There are no collectibles really. There's little to no story and most disappointingly absolutely no characterization of yourffellow airbourne soldiers.  They're all just cookie cutter, carboard cutouts. No names, no attempt to form bonds etc. You're all just nobodies. The pros are you actually JUMP out of airplanes at every mission start and land where you want. Immersion is pretty good. The actual gameplay is pretty fun, though nothing innovative or new here. Even for it's time. It's probably one of the 2 or 3 worst MOH games but hey, for $10 it's worth it. It'll give you about 5-7 hours of entertainment.			",296,21,5,30,46,2,95

												The Good: Decent graphics, different level design approach, fast paced, it doesn't last very longThe Bad: Botched paratrooping mechanic, ridiculously difficult, monotonous level progression, dead multiplayer, brings nothing new to the tired genreMedal of Honor started the first person shooter World War II experience back on the original PlayStation. As time went on they redefined the genre on PC with Allied Assault. It helped put WWII shooter's feet on cinematic ground. Frontline was the series last good game, and slowly after that the series fell flat on its face with mediocrity, with EA only caring about money. Airborne continues this trend and it's dead obvious how little effort they put into the game.You play as a soldier named Travers (like we care at this point) and you go through various WWII scenarios that you have probably gone through dozens of times before. The first thing you will notice about Airborne is how repetitive it feels in comparison to other WWII shooters. It doesn't do anything new and re-treads the same ground that we are sick and tired of. EA tried to make us feel different about this with a new approach to level design. You play as paratroopers that jump out of planes at the start of every level onto green flares. These are safe zones and contain crates of health, ammo, and grenades. Once you hit the ground you will notice that your mini-map is pointing to various objectives. No longer do you follow a linear routine and take it one at a time. Pick a direction and run, but that's when things start going bad.Every map plays out the same, shoot some enemies, push forward, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. The enemies will keep coming in different pockets of the maps until you advance and take them out. This isn't a new trick, and just gets old quick because that is all you do. Place a charge on this AA gun, blow up this equipment, blow up these thanks. No thanks. I have done this countless times already so why do I want to do it here? The whole ""non-linear"" map idea doesn't really work because it makes the game ridiculously difficult and you will die dozens of times every level. Every time you die you jump back out of the plane loosing not objective progress, but advancement progress. If you just pushed back a huge group of enemies and die you have to do it again. Your objectives are just checkpoints, and this gets frustrating beyond anything you can imagine. The game throws way too many enemies at you, but there are even problems with weapons.The game has a nice upgrade system for doing so many kills. For example, the MP40 will upgrade with a double clip, reduced recoil, and a knife melee attack. This is the most interesting thing in the entire game, but EA for some reason made the guns inaccurate to accommodate for upgrades. Guns jump around more than you are used to and no matter how well your aim is you always miss about 60% of the time. Once you hit the less recoil upgrade it isn't so bad. All the same WWII era weapons are here (except the Sten) and it is yawn worthy.Thankfully the game is short with only 6 levels, so you can beat the game in about 6 hours. No matter how you slice it the game is just extremely hard, repetitive, boring, and unoriginal on every level. They even went back to the health pack system which is just archaic in design. You would think at least jumping out of planes is fun? Not really because if you don't grease or flare your landing you botch it and it involves a nauseating and disorienting animation of your character wobbling around while getting up and pulling the weapon out in a weird way. While this is happening guys are shooting you and you will recover with one health bar left. Nice job EA for screwing every single thing in a game up that you possibly could. Even the graphics are pretty bland and aren't anything special.Overall, Airborne is probably the worst Medal of Honor game I have ever played. Monotonous shooting, ridiculous difficulty, screwed up paratrooping mechanic, failed level design, and a retread of a genre everyone is tired of. Do yourself a favor and skip this unless you really need a WWII shooter fix. Forget about multiplayer as well because there are only 6 maps and no one is playing online anyways.~Score: 5/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

Call Of DerpyI was sooo close to recommending this game.  I had one mission to go and I figured I might as well finish it before posting my thoughts on it.  It turns out the game's last mssion was effectively unplayable for me.  The rest of the game was just fine.  The last mission was a glitchy, stuttery parade of pain and frustration.  I gave up and uninstalled the game with extreme prejudice.The game is like a generational bridge between the old Playstation 2 Medal of Honor games and the more modern Call of Duty games.  If you have never played a Medal of Honor game before, you will probably be saying to yourself ""COD does this so much better"" as you play.  And it is largely true.  But those of you who have played Medal of Honor since the series started will find some nostalgic fun factor here.The game also introduces a unique element to the series; verticality.  I don't mean wall-running or double-jumping like modern shooters.  But landing on the battlefield via parachute means you can go land anywhere.  On roofs, scaffolding, etc.  and you can also leap or climb to places that was not possible in the classic MoH games.  Enemies can be placed in high places as well and this adds a subtle new twist on the series.EA took a bold but awkward direction with this game.  They invested time and money into new (for the time) rag-doll physics technology.  Most of the time it's pretty impressive.  Most of the time.  Enemies you kill may stiffen and then fall backwards, or they may lose all motor control and slump over.  When I compare this to the death animations in Call of Duty: World At War, I like this better (most of the time).  Yeah, COD:WaW has dismemberment and more blood, but in this game they have a better sense of weight.But then there are the other times...  Times when the rag doll simulation isn't so natural.  Maybe 5% of the time it just looks weird.  And then there is that 1% of the time where it just gets SILLY!  Bodies will pop five feet in the air, or shake violently.  One time I saw the enemies gun got stuck in a wall and the corpse's hand would not let go of it.  Other times a dead enemy's body part will get stuck on... nothing.  It will hang from the air.  It can get pretty ridiculous and you will get a chuckle now and then.  Sometimes the derpy physics will even effect YOU.  And you don't have to be dead for it to happen.  I was walking along and I was suddenly tossed 15 feet to one side like I was hit by an invisible car.Like all of the classic Medal of Honor games the enemies seem to get more durable as the game progresses.  On the last mission I was using my sniper rifle almost exclusively because the other weapons seemed to do very little.  Some enemies required more than one hit with the sniper rifle.The game starts pretty slow but it gets pretty fun in the middle.  Operation Market Garden was quite fun.But the game went completely crapular for me on the last mission.  Wildly uneven and stuttery frame rates, graphical and audio glitches constantly.  Controlling the player was difficult and laggy with each stutter.  When things started moving again I would find I had completely oversteered or walked farther than I intended.  I use a 6-core i7 and a GTX960.  There is no reason a game of this age should suddenly act like this.  The crazy level of difficulty on the final mission combined with the glitch fest was too much for me.  I tried for several hours to complete the final mission but just gave up and uninstalled the game after it had depleted my very last drop of resolve.The game is quite fun in the middle.  But I can not recommend it.  2 or 3 fun missions is not enough to warrant a purchase.  Esp. if it decides to break down on you for the last mission.  Maybe get it if it is dramatically discounted in price.			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

												Awful game. Unrealistic in the worst way. You need 4-5 bullets to kill a single enemy and when you kill one, he can easily take off and fly like hit by a superpower bomb, Plenty of bugs, and you can get stuck in some corners. Absolutely unrealistic weapons, tactics, added to that you can't move while you aim. AI is just stupid. This is no more than a shooting arcade US propaganda.			",28,1,0,6,10,0,16

												Medal of honor: Airborne is the 11th entry in the long running Medal of honor series, It's a follow up to the fantastic Pacific Assult. Does it redeems itself a worthy successor. we shall see that.MOH:A Sets it self apart from other games by putting you into the shoes of Pfc. Boyd Travers in the 82nd Division, A paratrooper. As a airborne you start every mision by parachuting from a plane and actually controlling where to land on the map. But the distinctiveness ends there. After parachuting to the ground zeros it becomes a generic shooter like all other WWII shooters. As a airborne i was hoping to see some mission in which i'll be the one to control the plane or providing support to the ground forces. But as it stands out no missions were designed around it. Since you are a Airborne the game gives you the ability to land anywhere on the map. Yes any where!!! all the objectives are given to you before handedly. You can tackle them in any order. After completing all the objectives a Final objective is given per map compleating it will finish the mission. eventhough the out come of the mission won't depend on the order you choose, it's a very fun mechanic. I was surprised as this didn't make it's way to next iterations of the franchise.If we talk about the graphics here thegames looks fine considering it's been 10 years now. Some of the animation are odd like if the granade explodes either on the ground or on the concrete floor only dust will rise and all grande dust will rise in same way. Most other things looks fine.One of the most frustrating things in the game are Hit boxes and gun play. The hit boxes are random. Sometime enimies will die in one shot sometimes they will be standing after tsking multiple headshots. Guns iteslves feels like the are potato shooters. The recoil is moderate. But it feels like bullets are made of sponge. a lite breeze of air also makes them go crazy.it's very frustrating. The 2 main things to do right in a shooter are Hit boxes and Gunplay. But MOH:A gets it wrongSingle player story!!!! I really don't think anyone needs a plot to shoot nazi's in the face. Soooooo.... It's aaaaaa... good!!!The game is Now 10 years old. So installing it on new hardwares will cause some problems. For starter it will not support the newer graphic card. You should find a workaround it. But is it worth the pain to finding a workaround just start the game? I'll say YES. Even if the 2 major factors (Gunplay & Hit boxes) are flawed you should try this for it's open map and tackliing the objective on player will.One of the most influential shooter of all time ""CALL OF DUTY 4: MODERN WARFARE"" release same year. Is it on par with that? i'll say NO. The polish, CInimatic vibe and story makes COD 4 a much supprior game. So if you are thinking of buying MOH:A wait till it is 70-80% off. I cannot recommend this game to all. But if  you are bored with Modern military shooters, had enogh of phew phew laser guns you can always try MOH series(NOT 2010's reboot or warfighter) And all others can try the earlier iterations like ""allied assult"" or ""pacific assult"".

												Pretty decent World War II FPS. The market's pretty saturated with these types of games, IMHO, and this one's very similar in premise to, say, COD:WaW. You get a gun, you mow down Nazis, occasionally face against German tanks. That's it. The missions feel very same-y, with plant explosives at A, then go to point B and do the same, before heading to point C and repeating it again. But the unique part is that the missions are semi-open world. You can do them in any order. You can go do C, before backtracking to A and then completing B. What I like the most is the weapon progression system. Use enough of a weapon and you 'level up' your skill with that particular weapon and unlock attachments for them. For example, you get increased damage for the M1911 for example, and a scope for the STG-44 (which is a horrible attachment to be honest).So, is it any good then? Well, if you enjoyed the simple run and gun type of gameplay of, say, the older Medal of Honours and the million WW2 shooters back then, then you will like this one. Pick it up while it's on sale though for some simple FPS fun.			",121,10,3,10,9,0,22

												Having rented this game back on the xbox around the time it came out, I had fond memories of a slightly above average WW2 shooter with some great levels. Unfortunately, it seems that nostalgia clouded my recollection of this game.  While not terrible, it is certainly no more than an average WW2 shooter.  Question is, is it worth $10?If you have an itch to replay the highly oversaturated WW2 genre of the 2000's, then I would say this game is worth the ten bucks.  If you are just looking for a fun shooter, save your money for one of the million better FPS games out there.The hook for this game that attempts to seperate it from other WW2 shooters is that you are a paratrooper.  This is reflected in the the level design through the gameplay mechanic of you begining  the levels by jumping out of a plane and steering where you want to start.  It's an intresting (if a bit shallow) gameplay mechanic that lends to some fun replay value for a few levels.  For example, do you land on streets with your allies, or behind enemy lines in the thick of things? Landing on roofs, towers, and german soldiers before ambushing them is probably the best part of this game.As for the shooting itself, its pretty sub par.  Often the bullets will miss their targets for no reason, even when aiming directly at enemies. I understand that the sub machines guns should have a shorter range then rifles, but its just way too short to be taken seriously.  While long range shooting can be more effective, it takes way too long to pick off enemies from a distance, leading to tedious games of whack a mole while germans run around taking multiple shots to the head.  Close range combat is much more fun, but due to the sloopy shooting mechanics its quite dangerous.  In later levels, where the enemies become quite tough, its just not an option you can rely on, and you'll be back to tedious cover shooting.  Another thing to note concerning the shooting and weaponry is that allied weapons become pretty obsolete in the long run.  Since you are  a paratrooper and are dropping into enemy territory, there are not many american weapons laying around.  Since you burn ammo fast due to crappy shooting, you'll often rely on german weapons (which in my opinion are better anyways).  Since you use them more, your weapons will ""level up"" and upgrade faster, which flat out makes them objectively better.  You can even select them from the drop load out, so there is really no purpose for allied weapons.The AI in this game is attrocious.  On your side, your allies are completely useless, standing around and shooting at walls.  The most notable thing they do is step in front of you when you are priming grenades and zooming through scopes, and they are SKILLED at diving in front of your rockets.  As for the enemy AI, it ranges from dead as a doorknob to spawn of hitler.  The AI will often charge you with no sense of self preservation, with sometimes multiple nazi officers running in front of a firing squad to try and melee you.  It also seems that the nazis were researching into psychic powers, as if you aim at an enemy they will literally instantly know where you are and that you are aiming at them.  I cannot count how many times I went to flank an enemy or snuck up on one from a distance only to have them make miracle dodges or just turn around and snipe me.  The AI also only guns for you, which is very annoying.  Simply put, the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.As for the levels themselves, they range from tedious to imaginative.  There are only six levels in the game, and with multiplayer being dead this is all you have to play with.  I would say two of the levels are great, two are average, one is sub par, and one is♥♥♥♥♥♥  The last level in particular is the most memorable, and encompases the best that the game has to offer.As for the technical side of things, this game is clearly a console port slapped onto PC.  The controls are fine, but the engine doesnt take advantage of the PC and the draw distance is pretty short, which is very noticeable when dropping.  Also, there is WAY TOO MUCH motion blur in this game.  It really can hurt your eyes if you have a larger montior. Before rounding out this review, I should mention there are quite a few MURRIKA moments in this game, complete with wailing trumpets and dripping patriotisim.  Its pretty stupid sometimes, and the story is completely forgetable.  It's actually nonexistent, now that I think about it.  There are no real characters and there is no real plot to follow.  Its just shooting things in WW2.SO, in the end, I would recomend this game ONLY if you really want to play a simple WW2 shooter that isn't Call of Duty. At $10 it's not a rip off, but its not really a deal either.			",100,30,1,16,11,1,10

												This is amazing. Got it on sale for $2 dollars. Only an hour in and i love it. The Positives:The graphics are slightly outdated but are still impressive for 2007. The combat is probably the best i've ever played in an FPS. It's immersive and weapon feedback is rather responsive. Crouching system and aiming is pretty authenic. Has lots of realistic aspects too, loved the enemy response times too, lots of cover and fire situations (can get old, but really build up the intensity.) Also loved the soundtrack. It's so amazing how the single-player can be so good. The Negatives: The save system is pisspoor, don't really favour the checkpoint system either. Missions are way too hard, literally took 54 minutes for me to complete the first one.I had to look online to just launch the game (on Windows 8) and multiplayer doesn't work for me, but otherwise it's awesome.Overall:The game is great. Can't describe it with wording. One of the undderrated gems of the FPS Genre.  Buy it, it's worth even the full price. P.S: Only an hour into the Single-Player and adore it. Couldn't help myself from writing this review. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												at first, MOH airborne seems nice enough. you have the pretty graphics, the stellar gameplay and good use of audio. then the realization hits you: ""why am i dying 24/7"" or ""why isn't that guy dead yet"".you see, Airborne is a game that is so mixed up in competing with other games that it falls flat in the gameplay department.the parachute drop is fun but that's it. i had better fun playing MOH vanguard which was a whole lot better. the game is HARD! even on casual which allows you to absorb and ungoldy amount of bullets (20 to 30) before touching down. even a rocket won't stop you. let me repeat that, a german launches a rocket at you while you land and you do not die.something wrong? yeah... something is wrong and it's name is der flakturm. this ""level"" was only put in to mess with gamers who were disillusioned with the games rather easy enemy ai. Not here, no siree bob. the enemies will swarm you, elites will pulverize you and there are snipers outside, along with halftracks and MG42s.  do i recommend this game? maybe. if you want a hard game to while away 6 hours then by all means get this. the upgrade system works real well and briefly slows down time so you can get a few extra shots off while the upgrade installs but everyone else should steer clear.

												A solid gaming experience, especially if you set this to Hard levels. In the long line of MOH games this one is fairly competent.The graphics aren't as advanced as games these days are, but for the $2.49 price tag well worth the gaming experience.At times on Hard mode this game is really challenging. What's good about this game is that you're able to level up your particular weapon of choice the more kills you get which makes for interesting gameplay.It's a shame this game doesn't include Steam achievements.One MAJOR PAIN IN THE♥♥♥♥♥is that the AI mechanics are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have been in crouch plenty of times, popping up, shooting, then advancing to the next cover. Often friendly AI will simply run in front of my line of fire, blocking me, and then I get hosed by enemy AI. I've also thrown grenades only to have them bounce off AI who sit in front of me firing. Completely idiotic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MoHA was suppose to breath new life into what was a somewhat dying franchise. Instead it killed it so hard that it needed a reboot that also didn't live up to expectation. It only takes a few hours of playing to see the faults.First off, the concept is not bad on paper. At the start of each mission, you get to jump out of a plane, and land where you want. Again, great on paper, but the reality of it is that there are very few places you can actually safely land without becoming a bullet sponge. It also gets real ♥♥♥♥ing annoying that you have to do this over and over each time you die.The next problem is the lean/cover system. The idea is again, good on paper. Whilst aiming down sights, you can lean or go prone using the movement keys, or move slowly by holding the sprint key. The problem is that this doesn't work under stress. I'm use to being able to move whilst in iron sights, and I am use to using other buttons for lean. There is a reason this has not been used again.EA obviously saw Crysis and thought it would be a good idea and put it into a WWII game, therefore it has a 'non-linear' level form. This doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing fit with the theme. These are well-planned military operations. People go certain places and do certain jobs in a certain order. You don't just run around willy-nilly doing whatever objective seems like it would be the funnest. AI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Allies constantly rush towards Nazis and die quickly. They also have a habit of getting in the way of you when you are trying to ♥♥♥♥ing shoot someone. The enemies themselves constantly leave cover.The difficulty comes from a few parts of this game. First of all, health drops are barely around. THIS IS A HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM. It really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks dying after playing for 10 minutes, because there are no ♥♥♥♥ing health kits available. It's not hard to add a few health kits. It's simple level design. You also can die really quickly. MG 42s tear you apart before you can blink. Enemies can bum rush you and melee you to death. I've had enemies do this to me, whilst surviving automatic gunfire. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Apart from that, damage does seem fairly balanced. Now I understand an MG 42 would tear you apart in real life, but this isn't ARMA, and it's sure as hell annoying having to go back to a checkpoint when you are just rapidly killed by an MG 42 nest that you either couldn't kill in time, or didn't see. The weapon-upgrade system is pretty meh. I don't understand some of the upgrades. For example, the shotgun gets a bayonet, but why not instead the M1 Garand? It makes more sense as the shotgun is designed for close quarters. IT'S A SHOTGUN FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE! The M1 however is better at long range, and it would make sense that if an enemy catches you off guard that you may have to stick them.Story is non-existent. There is no reason to care about your fellow soldiers. They're just cannon fodder. Just go mission to mission shooting that and blowing up this. I honestly couldn't care less by the second mission.Here's an idea, how about make it you're the squad leader, and during mission planning, you choose where to drop. Maybe one drop gets you closer to the enemy, but is very risky, or one takes you to close to good high ground where you can pick off some Germans. This would give merit to the whole 'jumping out of a plane' gimmick, and allowed for a more interesting game. Having played Allied Assault, I can easily say its a much better game, despite being much older. Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was also based around paratroopers, but did everything much better (except you don't get to jump out of a plane). 8/10 Major Fret's would send this game to the gas chamber.

												Not a big review. This is just to inform people of the port.This is one of the best WW2 type games of the Medal of Honor genre, although a bit short.The game does have a bit of replayability because of the weapon ranks, medals, stars etc. you can get.The port is bad. I don't reccomend buying this game if you don't like ini editing and mouse acceleration.MA is impossible to turn off but happens the heaviest during iron sights. it can be tweaked snd i'd reccomend to go to pcgamingwiki for it.I've had quite a lot of times where the MA in aim causes me to overshoot targets and miss.Simply turning the sensitivity down doesn't solve it because that'll making moving around too slow.The menu looks stretched and weird. Also, if you happen to play the game and your char suddenly starts spinning in one direction you need to unplug USB cables. I had my Thustmaster T16000M Joystick plugged in which somehow caused this to happen.Apart from that the game isn't very buggy in itself.If you tweak the fov it'll reset at sprint/jump etc. and jump back to whatever when you stop.Enemies someimes fly through the air or die randomly.(pretty funny)			",107,8,0,17,12,0,19

												The last decent Medal of Honor game that ever came out, you really cannot go wrong with Medal of Honor: AIRBORN. While the game is reletively dated (needs some fixing for newer machines), it still holds up for its entertainment purposes. It also has a good system for leveling up weapons, and difficulty settings which adds to the replay value. Even if you beat the game, you'll eventually come back to play it again. I've beaten the game 3 times now, and I'm replaying it once more. So I reccomend you buy it. now.			",114,26,1,10,12,2,25

												After all my days of sitting and playing WWII shooters, Medal of Honor: Airborne hits me from nowhere and basically shoves it's manliness in my face.Have you ever seen FullMetal Jacket? Yeah, that ""best war movie ever made""? This game, feels a lot like that movie.The game has me making decisions that make me feel like a real soldier in war, without making it all difficult. There's games where they tell you what to do, and there's games like this that point in the direction, but whatever you do from point A to B is your decision; go rambo, team up, sneak past obstacles to whip your enemies with the clip of your gun, the limits are far from opaque. You can do what the game intends for you to do, or you can man up and instead of landing in the safe zone, land RIGHT on that AA gun, blaze your guns and plant that explosive to see your allies walking in on your stunning victory. Never has a WWII game felt so true to WWII.Finally they don't ""emotionlly connect you to your allies"", people are dying left and right in real war, there's no time for that, there's just self strategy and perseverance.So lay it all on the line, be the savior of your allie's life, or be the biggest ""badass on the battlefield"", the choice is all yours. I feel dirty for complimenting EA but, this game is just pure win on all corners. They must have fired a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of people after they made Mirror's Edge, because EA seems to have had their true glory days. Medal of Honor: Airborne is a masterpiece.			",174,23,6,7,12,1,6

												The madal of honor series in my personall opinion has been mostly focuesd on the singleplayer aspect of the games and this is a great example of that. Fun singleplayer with great cover mechanics as well as weapon upgrades to make your experience even more badass. My only complaint is that i wish there was more of the singleplayer.All in all i give it a 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is amazing. Got it on sale for $2 dollars. Only an hour in and i love it. The Positives:The graphics are slightly outdated but are still impressive for 2007. The combat is probably the best i've ever played in an FPS. It's immersive and weapon feedback is rather responsive. Crouching system and aiming is pretty authenic. Has lots of realistic aspects too, loved the enemy response times too, lots of cover and fire situations (can get old, but really build up the intensity.) Also loved the soundtrack. It's so amazing how the single-player can be so good. The Negatives: The save system is pisspoor, don't really favour the checkpoint system either. Missions are way too hard, literally took 54 minutes for me to complete the first one.I had to look online to just launch the game (on Windows 8) and multiplayer doesn't work for me, but otherwise it's awesome.Overall:The game is great. Can't describe it with wording. One of the undderrated gems of the FPS Genre.  Buy it, it's worth even the full price. P.S: Only an hour into the Single-Player and adore it. Couldn't help myself from writing this review. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(This review is for single player)The concept of being able to start a level from any point of the map is really cool. It can give you a real strategic advantage or totally screw you over.The weapons are pretty well balanced, with you recieving better guns as you progress through the game. As you use a weapon you can level it up, which adds attachments to said weapon that largely improves it.Now the enemies...Medal of Honor: Airborne has a system where the enemies get tougher as you near the end of the game. Now this would seem like a great idea, if it wasn't for the fact that the tougher enemies get equipped with 1 shot kill weapons such as sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and mg42s. Enemies in this game seem to like to charge the player too often, and you'll find yourself overwhelmed before long.It's a cool concept, but it could have been done better. I enjoyed the game (not so much towards the end), but I'd say it doesn't have too much replayability. If you're a masochist, I'd really recommend this game.			",168,13,0,21,3,0,0

												Not a big review. This is just to inform people of the port.This is one of the best WW2 type games of the Medal of Honor genre, although a bit short.The game does have a bit of replayability because of the weapon ranks, medals, stars etc. you can get.The port is bad. I don't reccomend buying this game if you don't like ini editing and mouse acceleration.MA is impossible to turn off but happens the heaviest during iron sights. it can be tweaked snd i'd reccomend to go to pcgamingwiki for it.I've had quite a lot of times where the MA in aim causes me to overshoot targets and miss.Simply turning the sensitivity down doesn't solve it because that'll making moving around too slow.The menu looks stretched and weird. Also, if you happen to play the game and your char suddenly starts spinning in one direction you need to unplug USB cables. I had my Thustmaster T16000M Joystick plugged in which somehow caused this to happen.Apart from that the game isn't very buggy in itself.If you tweak the fov it'll reset at sprint/jump etc. and jump back to whatever when you stop.Enemies someimes fly through the air or die randomly.(pretty funny)			",107,8,0,17,12,0,19

												MoHA was suppose to breath new life into what was a somewhat dying franchise. Instead it killed it so hard that it needed a reboot that also didn't live up to expectation. It only takes a few hours of playing to see the faults.First off, the concept is not bad on paper. At the start of each mission, you get to jump out of a plane, and land where you want. Again, great on paper, but the reality of it is that there are very few places you can actually safely land without becoming a bullet sponge. It also gets real ♥♥♥♥ing annoying that you have to do this over and over each time you die.The next problem is the lean/cover system. The idea is again, good on paper. Whilst aiming down sights, you can lean or go prone using the movement keys, or move slowly by holding the sprint key. The problem is that this doesn't work under stress. I'm use to being able to move whilst in iron sights, and I am use to using other buttons for lean. There is a reason this has not been used again.EA obviously saw Crysis and thought it would be a good idea and put it into a WWII game, therefore it has a 'non-linear' level form. This doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing fit with the theme. These are well-planned military operations. People go certain places and do certain jobs in a certain order. You don't just run around willy-nilly doing whatever objective seems like it would be the funnest. AI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Allies constantly rush towards Nazis and die quickly. They also have a habit of getting in the way of you when you are trying to ♥♥♥♥ing shoot someone. The enemies themselves constantly leave cover.The difficulty comes from a few parts of this game. First of all, health drops are barely around. THIS IS A HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM. It really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks dying after playing for 10 minutes, because there are no ♥♥♥♥ing health kits available. It's not hard to add a few health kits. It's simple level design. You also can die really quickly. MG 42s tear you apart before you can blink. Enemies can bum rush you and melee you to death. I've had enemies do this to me, whilst surviving automatic gunfire. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Apart from that, damage does seem fairly balanced. Now I understand an MG 42 would tear you apart in real life, but this isn't ARMA, and it's sure as hell annoying having to go back to a checkpoint when you are just rapidly killed by an MG 42 nest that you either couldn't kill in time, or didn't see. The weapon-upgrade system is pretty meh. I don't understand some of the upgrades. For example, the shotgun gets a bayonet, but why not instead the M1 Garand? It makes more sense as the shotgun is designed for close quarters. IT'S A SHOTGUN FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE! The M1 however is better at long range, and it would make sense that if an enemy catches you off guard that you may have to stick them.Story is non-existent. There is no reason to care about your fellow soldiers. They're just cannon fodder. Just go mission to mission shooting that and blowing up this. I honestly couldn't care less by the second mission.Here's an idea, how about make it you're the squad leader, and during mission planning, you choose where to drop. Maybe one drop gets you closer to the enemy, but is very risky, or one takes you to close to good high ground where you can pick off some Germans. This would give merit to the whole 'jumping out of a plane' gimmick, and allowed for a more interesting game. Having played Allied Assault, I can easily say its a much better game, despite being much older. Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was also based around paratroopers, but did everything much better (except you don't get to jump out of a plane). 8/10 Major Fret's would send this game to the gas chamber.

												It's a little arcady for a Medal of Honor Game, but is fun to play. The control scheme is horribly awkward and takes plenty of getting used to. The weapon customization is nice, although it'd be nice if you could customize it yourself and pick attachements rather than level a weapon up and be stuck with it. It is fun to play and intense, though.7/10 would get frustrated with the controls again.			",53,2,1,7,5,0,3

												Bit Sized ReviewThe Good:-WWII levels are varied and have interesting design-""Droping in"" Mechanic makes it so you start each level (and each respawn when you die) by parachuting into it where you want to-Level design allows you to take on objectives however you want-Aiming allows you to lean around corners and cover-There are quite a few weapons, and getting kills with them automatically unlocks upgrades-Price is pretty lowThe Bad:-Aiming down the sights causes you to stop and aim, takes some getting used to -Single Player is only 4 hours long-Not a lot of replayability-Multiplayer is almost completely dead-Story line is very boiler plate, not that interesting-Graphics and enemy AI do show their age here The Verdict:If you want some more WWII shooter action, you can do a lot worst than this. It is not a bad game and on sale it's actually worth the price just to jump in and kill half a day on. I would recommend it when it's on sale since the MP is pretty much dead however.

												Long before my days on steam, I had an old hand-me-down XBOX 360 a friend of mine gave me. One of the older models as I remember it. It went to hell, but I still keep it in my closet for memories. I remember that my absolute favorite game for the 360 that I owned was Medal of Honor: Airborne. I played that game so often that I deleted the save data on my XBOX time and time again just to beat it again. I did not have a lot of games back then. Nor did I have an internet connection. I was crushed to find my game shattered behind my dresser one day. It was extremley saddening. My days with this game were filled with joy and tenseness, as I ran through Adanti finding the best places to land and take on the entire opposition from one spot. And the stress that was The Flak Tower, clearing it from top to bottom. This game gave me a lot of great memories. If you're a fan of WWII stuff in general, or enjoy the Medal of Honor games, then this is a must have. This game got overlooked when it was released and in the years that followed, but I assure you that the game is well worth the price tag, especially during sales. It's easy to pick up and so much fun to play. My only complaint is that more people should play and get more multiplayer servers set up.			",75,12,2,5,7,2,3

												Good linear WW2 shooter, with decent gunplay and weapon variety. Mission based, you start by dropping out of a plane and you can choose where you land and therefore what angle you tackle a mission from.You can upgrade your weapons which is cool, based on how much you use them but you have no control over the upgrading, and there are three upgrades per weapon.I've played through the game twice from start to finish, but it honestly isn't an absolute must, I just enjoyed the weapons a lot.

												Is there a ""okay"" handsign? Because the game is just okay.The start was pretty impressive, even though it is an ""old"" game, the graphics still looks good. Furing my first jump out of the airplane, I was pretty impressed, it's an atmopshere! But it could not exists the whole game. It as tense, especialy the last jump was spectacular, as your airplane was hit by AA guns, and was breaking apart. Well done. The weapons feel good, recoil is there, but the irons ights do not work. I tried to use them, the sight was pointing at the enym, but I fired an entire magazine without hitting? What is that supposed to be? After this ""dissapointment"", I was using the crosshair most of the time. and I mostly hit. There is also a pretty nice upgrade system in the game. The mroe kills you get on a weapon, the more expirience you get, and you unlock some more or less usefull upgrades. But it can go very fast, but looking back how short the game was, it is well balanced. It would be nice if I could detach the upgrades, because if you upgraded a weapon completly, it gets to easy, double-64 round amgazine for the MP40, 50 round magazinges for the Thompson, it is just spray and pray. Another fact that I dissliked, is that most of the weapons get scopes. I don't want to have a scope on my G43, or STG44. It is not usefull. And there is no option to detach it. Speaking of weapons, every weapon got it's own stats, damage, fire rate, recoil etc. If you look at the stats you might think: Hmmm, this does pretty good damage. Nope: The further you get, the more bullets the enemy can withstand. This is laughable, enemies can kill you with a few hits, but they can survive up to two magazines. The Nazi Storm Elite is just ridicolous. The first mission was good, well balanced, the enemy dies as fast as you. It also felt good.Second mission, not bad. The third mission was average, but the fourth and the fith and the sixth are just ridicolous.I was so mad during the fith mission, because the enemy, can kill you with a few shots but you can't shoot back if you hang in your chute. I was killed so often by respawning snipers. This is another thing, enemies will respwan if you die and you have to chute to the battlefield. The Checkpoint system is also pretty bad.The fourth mission was also significant. The escalation curve is pretty high, the first time you meet the Panzerschreck troops, you will swear and curse. Because they can knock you out with 2 hits, but you can't see them because they are in cover and well camouflaged. The enemy AI can also shoot through smoke walls, smoke you can'T look through but they can. The Jumps are another thing, I was able to complete, ONE good jump, you will always fall on your face, if you jump. This costs time. And can cause your life. Despite that, I enjoyed the game.I forgot to mention the wayfinding system. It does not work. You will get lost very often.If you are looking for a game that you can complete during a weekend, buy it, 10 Euros is it worth.edit: THis si getting worse and worse. Enemy AI is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly good. Sometimes they shoot you through walls, or clone troopers, spawn in each other that they run you over in a wall of flesh.6/10			",99,3,0,5,10,0,26

												This game is very well made, the soundtrack really brings out the action with its intense brass orchestra.the graphics and textures are very, very good considering this game was released in 2007.one thing I didn't like was the agony of dying and having to start again from the last checkpoint (which is every objective), and sometimes it would stress me out a bit, but i learned to go with it. There are only 6 missions in the game, but every mission is very long & action packed and will definetly keep you thrilled to coming back for more. I definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for hours of fun and action!.P.S.I already had this game in a Box & CD set. but i ran into PhysX problems. I downloaded the Legacy Drivers from Nvidia's site and it didn't work. so I ended up buying the game on steam, and ran into the same problem. i installed the Nvidia Legacy drivers (for PhysX) and this time it worked for me)			",93,14,2,2,11,0,2

												This game will change the way you look at an FPS forever.The graphics look as good as most CoD: MW's and play much better.It's not a legendairy game in the same sense MOH: PA was, but it sure will make you wonder how it was made ithat many years ago. Now, the game feels a bit rushed, you can't move and aim like in most FPS games but logically you shouldn't move and aim in the first place. This FPS also adds a lean feature while you aim wich can get you that pesky kill while still in cover. You can also choose which objectives to hit first, nothing pre-determined like in most FPS games. The campaign is a rather short where if counting the tutorial,it is seven missions long, which kills replayability and for an old game with little to no multiplayer, it's a major hit to it. Even though it's an old game, there was a server on the multiplayer I saw with a whopping (and I say that since it's no where nea a new game) fifteen players. I do recommend this game for people who want to waste some time or want to revisit the MOH series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Repeat. - A good weapon upgrade system with a nice slow-motion effect with every level-up. - Great cinematic sequences with beutiful maps. - As in all other Medal of Honor games, fantastic soundtrack. - Low price, worth every penny.  The only negative thing about this game is that there is a clear feeling through out the game that this game is a typical game made to fit both a PC format but as well a console format (PS3, Xbox). Still, a good and entertaining game!  ",150,21,0,12,5,0,26

												Played this game years ago and finished it not too long ago. For those of you buying the game please take a couple notes.You need to edit some of the things in the files such as delete the launcher and then edit the binaries so the game plays in the correct resolution. Aside from that:Pros:Brings something different to the table when it comes to gun upgrades.Different compared to other games during the time and if you play smart it can be fun.a good amount of replay valueCons:If you arent careful you will die often. Zero Punctuation makes a big note of this.Controls. The controller layout is pretty much stuck and is unlike any other shooter you will play. Prepare for fruturation when it comes to muscle memory.Short storyYou dont have the option to take off gun attachmentsOverall if the game is on sale its a great deal and interesting kind of game to play.

												A solid gaming experience, especially if you set this to Hard levels. In the long line of MOH games this one is fairly competent.The graphics aren't as advanced as games these days are, but for the $2.49 price tag well worth the gaming experience.At times on Hard mode this game is really challenging. What's good about this game is that you're able to level up your particular weapon of choice the more kills you get which makes for interesting gameplay.It's a shame this game doesn't include Steam achievements.One MAJOR PAIN IN THE♥♥♥♥♥is that the AI mechanics are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have been in crouch plenty of times, popping up, shooting, then advancing to the next cover. Often friendly AI will simply run in front of my line of fire, blocking me, and then I get hosed by enemy AI. I've also thrown grenades only to have them bounce off AI who sit in front of me firing.

												at first, MOH airborne seems nice enough. you have the pretty graphics, the stellar gameplay and good use of audio. then the realization hits you: ""why am i dying 24/7"" or ""why isn't that guy dead yet"".you see, Airborne is a game that is so mixed up in competing with other games that it falls flat in the gameplay department.the parachute drop is fun but that's it. i had better fun playing MOH vanguard which was a whole lot better. the game is HARD! even on casual which allows you to absorb and ungoldy amount of bullets (20 to 30) before touching down. even a rocket won't stop you. let me repeat that, a german launches a rocket at you while you land and you do not die.something wrong? yeah... something is wrong and it's name is der flakturm. this ""level"" was only put in to mess with gamers who were disillusioned with the games rather easy enemy ai. Not here, no siree bob. the enemies will swarm you, elites will pulverize you and there are snipers outside, along with halftracks and MG42s.  do i recommend this game? maybe. if you want a hard game to while away 6 hours then by all means get this. the upgrade system works real well and briefly slows down time so you can get a few extra shots off while the upgrade installs but everyone else should steer clear.

												Very solid FPS set in WWII.The campaign consists of 6 long missions and offers 3 difficulty levels. I've played on the highest (Expert) and each mission took me ~ 90-120 minutes (with the exception of the last one which required a LOT of tries) due to slower approach.I haven't played multi-player yet (and probably never will) so I can't review that part of the game.Things I liked:- Non-linear approach which allows me to land almost anywhere and choose the way I want to beat the given part - this is definitely a unique selling point of the game.- Wide selection of weapons and their upgrades. Each weapon has 3 upgrade which gradually unlock after given number of kills.- Enemy A.I. which utilizes cover and even though the enemies don't respawn, they're able to create a very tight defense which can provide very long gunfights.- Cover system which makes the Expert difficulty challenging, but still fair.- Springfield rifle; the best in-game weapon, hands down.Things I disliked:- Unbalanced difficulty in case of otherwise fantastic last level. Groups of MG-42 wielding elite soldiers which can take you down in a second, combined with sparse checkpoints can be quite frustrating.- Severe lack of physics. Soldiers are the only in-game entities which are affected by a physics system, which is quite flawed. Some soldiers get thrown back by 5 meters when hit by a bullet. Some others fly 20 meters up when hit by a grenade. Fortunately, these hilarious events are not that common.- Weird hitboxes. Some soldiers can survive 2 headshots while others die immediately when hit in their foot.- Censorship. I hate Nazis as much as the next guy, but replacing the swastika by a different symbol (regular symmetric cross) is not the right solution, especially in case of a game which takes place during an important part of history. The same with almost no blood - it makes a war game more fun to play which doesn't feel.... right.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the game and will probably play it again some time in the future - and I'd recommend you to do the same.

												I'll keep this short and sweet MOH Airborne was an odd move for the franchise. It felt a little confused when it came out and it still does today.The unique feature of being able to drop anywhere in the map is fun, if i a little limited seeing as map sizes aren't that big. It also limits the story to combat missions where the airborne dropped so you miss out on quite a lot of famous 82nd action.Combat wise there is a weapon upgrade system which is nice, if not historically accurate. That pretty much sums up the whole game really. It feels more like playing Indianna Jones Airborne (right down to something about the music) rather than a shooter. Enemies can be bullet sponges, guns feel a little weak and the enemy variety and missions towards the end of the game rove into fantasy territory.If you haven't played through it and you are looking for a half way decent shooter with a hook, a slightly different take on a familiar setting or you are just bored then it's worth playing. Don't come expecting much and you will be happy.p.s. this is my third play through I fire it up once every 2 years or so just to remember it.6.75/10p.p.s This score would be in the 7's if it weren't for the fact that the game is very short (yes it has a little replayability but not much)			",280,32,2,25,26,0,48

												Pretty decent World War II FPS. The market's pretty saturated with these types of games, IMHO, and this one's very similar in premise to, say, COD:WaW. You get a gun, you mow down Nazis, occasionally face against German tanks. That's it. The missions feel very same-y, with plant explosives at A, then go to point B and do the same, before heading to point C and repeating it again. But the unique part is that the missions are semi-open world. You can do them in any order. You can go do C, before backtracking to A and then completing B. What I like the most is the weapon progression system. Use enough of a weapon and you 'level up' your skill with that particular weapon and unlock attachments for them. For example, you get increased damage for the M1911 for example, and a scope for the STG-44 (which is a horrible attachment to be honest).So, is it any good then? Well, if you enjoyed the simple run and gun type of gameplay of, say, the older Medal of Honours and the million WW2 shooters back then, then you will like this one. Pick it up while it's on sale though for some simple FPS fun.			",121,10,3,10,9,0,22

												Usually, I am a huge fan of WW2 FPS, but this one just doesn't deliver. The game plays like a bad port from console, as the mouse translation is strange to say the least. Aiming is difficult, and movement is over sensitive. The graphics have held up well, and are impressive for such an old game. This is NOT a realism shooter, and this displays in the very run and gun gameplay, and super nazis. Some weapons are very unbalanced, sniping is over-powered, both with you and the enemy AI. Unfortunately there is next to no story in the game, where there was great potential for one.Overall this game is really let down in a number of ways, Im sure it would be fun as a console game, but it isnt well suited to a PC platform.

												Was about to uninstall this game and decided to play it one last time..this game is great. Its got some problems and does get old after a while but the concept of parachuting in and completing objectives however you want to is great. The game is a direct port with no graphics settings but it runs at a solid 70 fps for me and looks like the games that i can usually only run at 30 or so (it has bloom, DoF, motion blur, all that good stuff). The lighting is one of my favorite parts as well, on the night maps there are some really beautiful scenes.Bottom line the game is a lot of fun and looks great but is very short. At $5 though its completely worth it. There's never anybody playing multiplayer anymore but when there was it was a lot of fun, in mission-based multiplayer matches players get to paradrop in to the match which was also awesome. I'd love to see multiplayer become active again..maybe some day..			",132,17,7,8,7,1,3

												MOH has always been an outstanding series in the FPS genre.  Until, of course, their recent and final release known as Warfighter.  Airborne puts you in a position of the 82nd Airborne division.  Just like Vanguard, you push up through Sicily and into France to clear the way for Operation Overlord; also known as D-Day.  For a game that released almost seven years ago, its still amazing.  Yeah the controls are a little wacky, especially with the ADS when it comes to completely stopping.  After getting use to the controls, its fun and easy.  What I always liked about the MOH series, is that as you progress through the campaign, the missions get harder no matter the difficulty.  The campaign is a good 5-6 hours depending on how much time you take.  Every time you die, the game respawns you back in the plane.  Now, that does sound bad, but it isn't actually, since you get to parachute back down to whatever objectives that was not finished.  I think it was the right step to take when developing this game.Due to its 32-bit limitations (if pc is 64-bit) it will break in the setup menu.  Just accept everything and start it from there.  The game would keep crashing if you do not proceed.  Everything else that's in the game, I would rather for you to figure it out and expierence yourself.  Ima give this game an 8.9/10 just due to the 32-bit limitations.			",83,2,0,6,2,0,3

												Medal of Honor, the United States of America's highest military honor and what the game is named after. This game makes you feel a part of the war, with intense firefights, great visuals (for 2007), a solid campaign and outstanding audio. The challenge of this game really makes you think on your feet to earn rewards (which come in the form of weapon upgrades). Recommended 8/10.			",190,5,2,16,3,2,10

												The high metascore is just another example of EA and Activision games being overrated. This game is basically another run and gun shooter. The guns are satisfying, and the way the enemies die is pretty satisfying. The graphics also aren't too bad for Unreal Engine 3. That's the best I can say for it. It's mediocre, and a lot of the time playing will be spent glitching out or paratrooping back into the fight as clone trooper Boyd Trevors ID#236. It's a mediocre game to the very core, so I regret buying it.			",13,3,0,1,0,0,0

												Medal of Honor: Airborne is a fair game, well worth buying. It presents fictional battles during WWII that nevertheless play off of the main storyline. You take the place of an American paratrooper, who works to eliminate the Nazis. Airborne presents a useful upgrading system, where you can improve several weapons based on the number of kills you receive for each. The controls are familiar, but present some new functions that work like a charm, once you get used to them. I did see some small blood puffs, but took a keen eye to place them. The graphics for this game are fairly good, doing a very good job of using the environment and lighting to generate an atmosphere that, along with the soundtrack, fit Airborne like a glove. As for the gameplay itself, I want to say this--Casual is Casual, Normal is Normal, Veteran is Veteran. I highly suggest getting used to the game before advancing to higher levels. The enemies are also class-based--they certainly get tougher later in the game. This is perfectly exemplified by the deadly Nazi Storm Elite trooper, who wears a bulletproof vest, a gas mask, and walks calmly along while carrying a mini-gun. I will never encounter anything scarier in a game than walking around a corner to find myself face-to-face with this horror. All in all, Airborne is a good game, and is definitely worth buying			",117,7,4,8,2,0,9

												This game is an old but really fun game, but here is a small review to help you choose if it's worth the money or not.Pro's-------1) Many ways to complete objectives, not so point A to B.2) Upgrades on weapons, I found myself using all the different weapons to see all the upgrades on them.3) Graphics are really nice for it's time, still hold up to this day.4) I found the bugs funny but it's completely up to you.5) Classic soundtrack from Medal of Honor:Frontline which is my favourite FPS game to this day.Con's-------1) REALLY short campaign, like I beat it in 4.5 hours; You could prob do it in less but I was just enjoying my time.2) Normal difficulty+ is a large nade spam most of the time. 3) Some of the upgrades you find a really similiar to the other weapons. Such as SMG's.4) You can have some weird framerate problems at random points and of course the bugs but I won't count them here.All in all, I played this game a while back when the 10th Medal of Honor Anniversary and I had a blast then and still do now. Sadly the multiplayer is kind of dead so you don't see as much action but when you do it's a pretty good time.Hope this review was good enough for some people and help them if they want to buy it or not.

												This game is very well made, the soundtrack really brings out the action with its intense brass orchestra.the graphics and textures are very, very good considering this game was released in 2007.one thing I didn't like was the agony of dying and having to start again from the last checkpoint (which is every objective), and sometimes it would stress me out a bit, but i learned to go with it. There are only 6 missions in the game, but every mission is very long & action packed and will definetly keep you thrilled to coming back for more. I definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for hours of fun and action!.P.S.I already had this game in a Box & CD set. but i ran into PhysX problems. I downloaded the Legacy Drivers from Nvidia's site and it didn't work. so I ended up buying the game on steam, and ran into the same problem. i installed the Nvidia Legacy drivers (for PhysX) and this time it worked for me)			",93,14,2,2,11,0,2

												I recommend this game due the following facts, - This game has a shotgun. Ka-boom! Chak-Chak! Repeat. - A good weapon upgrade system with a nice slow-motion effect with every level-up. - Great cinematic sequences with beutiful maps. - As in all other Medal of Honor games, fantastic soundtrack. - Low price, worth every penny.  The only negative thing about this game is that there is a clear feeling through out the game that this game is a typical game made to fit both a PC format but as well a console format (PS3, Xbox). Still, a good and entertaining game!  ",150,21,0,12,5,0,26

												I think that, this game is very playable.AI can be a problem - our enemies are sightly stupid, but in these times, when this game was produced, other AI in games wasn't in good condition.But... Who cares! WWII game! Turn it on and kill some nazis!			",66,3,0,11,9,1,28

												Usually, I am a huge fan of WW2 FPS, but this one just doesn't deliver. The game plays like a bad port from console, as the mouse translation is strange to say the least. Aiming is difficult, and movement is over sensitive. The graphics have held up well, and are impressive for such an old game. This is NOT a realism shooter, and this displays in the very run and gun gameplay, and super nazis. Some weapons are very unbalanced, sniping is over-powered, both with you and the enemy AI. Unfortunately there is next to no story in the game, where there was great potential for one.Overall this game is really let down in a number of ways, Im sure it would be fun as a console game, but it isnt well suited to a PC platform.
