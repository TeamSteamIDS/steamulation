												There is alot of carnage in this game and alot of blood. The animation when you run a zombie over is really funny as they cling onto the car. The gameplay is well done and keeps you engaged. Some of the game modes feel repetitive but overall it was a good experience. There is racing and free roaming in this game which makes it fun to play around with. This has everything a good horror driving game should have and more. I really enjoyed this game and if you want some crazy carnage and want to kill zombies at the same time then this is a game to definitely pick up.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												This was nice to play. People who like Carmageddon will probably like thisPositives: Good graphics quality. Really good I guess for the time of the release, no worse than in more recent Carmageddon: ReincarnationFun physicsNice maps with destructive elements and stuff like ramps or tunnels to perform stuntsCars eating zombiesCars setting zombies on fireCars getting energy from eating and dismembering zombies for a nitro boostYou get to race and eat zombies with your car inside the Large Hadron ColliderGame-appropriate music that goes well with munching zombies at high speed and wrecking opponentsNegatives:An incredibly stupid lore that is hybrid of partially being ripped off S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and adapted to the Cern environment. Serioulsy, if you are trying to get people to play who know what the LHC is, it would be better if you worked more on the lore.Very small selection of carsCampaign's plot is far below average, if the game took itself less seriously, the plot would have been more appropriate.Colours in most places are far less vivid than in Carmageddon and for the amount of nonsense lore the game has, it takes itself too seriously. If it had more of Carmageddon's senseless fun, it would have been better.Overall, I would recommend to buy this game if you like killing zombies with cars and getting bonuses for that. But maybe better to buy this when on sale.			",124,13,1,5,10,0,21

												If you ever wandered what kind of baby would come out if 'Carmagedon', 'Need for Speed' and 'Flat-out' had a three-way? Well look no further! This is the b.a.s.t.a.r.d child of such orgy!The game has a very good arcade driving controls similar to Need for Speed (as in easy to hop in, but takes a bit of training to master), it has a World map that you can drive around between missions which is similar to the classic NFS system since Underground 2, the world is post apocalyptic and it has zombies that you can smash on the road with your car as well as classic search and destroy missions like Carmagedon, and you can even participate in arena deathmatch like in Flat-out.This game would be a CLASSIC if only it had two more things present:1. Multiplayer to enjoy the carnage with your friends, or race each other or wreck each other in Destrucion Derby.2. Replay system - one of the best thing in Carmagedon or early NFS games was the replay system. Sometimes during the race, some crazy random sh*t happens, a situation that is either so hilarious or so awesome that you would want to watch it again in slow motion or frame by frame. A good replay system that would allow you to do that and record your replays and share, along with multiplayer would make this game an awesome game that I would pay 20$ without hesitation.If I was a publisher I wouldve bought this game IP and make a remaster with those 2 things. Believe me, it would be epic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite a fun little racing game, although I would wait for the price to drop.I bought it some time ago during a Steam sale and definitely got my monies worth.  It has the usual racing modes you would expect from an arcade style racer and the zombie infested cities give it a nice twist.  Sometimes it can be fun to kill a bit of time ignoring the races and just running down zombies while testing new car upgrades.			",163,31,15,29,35,0,30

												In a city where the zombie apocalypse has taken over, the buildings crumble, grass grows through the pavement and you still have a cherry ride to drive. Clutch is a post apocalyptic racing game that's geared just as much to racing as it is dull side events that feel like I'm a dog playing fetch. All of the races take place in three major areas, a small city, a neighboring freight yard and an underground network of tunnel tubes.Clutch plays like other arcade racers, you have an accelerator, a brake, headlights, a respawn and a nitro boost. This boost of your runs on zombie blood. Sure you can still jump off ramps to refill your nitrous, but for the most part you need to be ramming into what were once your fellow human beings. Think of it as saving bullets at the expense of fuel. Well the game has neither, so just ram those zombies dead and boost away!In terms of upgrades,you can purchase a variety of side slicers, bumper spikes and nitrous boosters. The boosters consume less fuel and last longer. The side slashers are automatic, they extend in an instant to give you extra reach to get that sweet zombie nitrous nectar. These upgrades are all vehicle specific and four hours into the game, i feel like I'm at the last event and there are only three vehicles with one skin each. Even with only one skin, you can still select your skin, which means there has to be more. You'll have to unlock the upgrades by winning events and then purchase with cash that you'll get from winning races, events and destroying other racers.There are giant glowing spheres in several key locations. Each color does something different, gold gives you more cash, blue refills your nitrous, green either repairs your car or completely repairs your car. That's right if your car runs out of health it explodes and you lose the event. Purple gives you three times the damage.Something interesting to note is that the vehicle models take damage, which is cool. Blood covers your hood and turns your headlights red. Your car lights on fire when its low on health, but even when you are repaired to full health, your car still looks damaged.In some races there are wind tunnels that will dash you forward faster than any nitrous boost. In other events such as demolition derby there are air vents that will launch your vehicle into the air. It adds to the arcade feel and makes me want to like the game more than I do.Its similar to other street racing games where most races are closed circuit and block off sections of the city. I can only imagine the logistics of flying in arrow signs and heavy cement blocks during a time of zombie crisis to setup a race course. One of the first problems is that the arrow signs when racing can be knocked down and by the third lap, you need to have every dark corner memorized that you turn here. There is a mini map, but it does little more than show you yourself, other racers and where spheres are locatedRather than selecting each event from a menu, you need to drive to them, following an arrow at the bottom of the screen to guide you. In one way, that could make the game more immersive, but in another, its a prolonged stay in a city that you'l lalready be competing in over and over.The best side missions are the demolition derbies. Like the races, you face off against five other competitors. Other cars, a hum vehicle and a giant piece of construction equipment to keep it interesting. This piece of equipment runs as well as one of the other cars. You can flip other cars over and ram them. Of course if you're driving a low to the ground vehicle, you can watch as they use you as a ramp. The challenge here is destroying three or more vehicles before the time runs out.Completing one even with a rank of T(een), M(ature) and C(hild?) in each event will unlock a the next. The game is more than races, and for me that's where it takes a wrong turn. I'm happy if a racing game has more than races, but the vast majority of these feels the same, but with a twist for difficulty sake.Its all stuff like collect X number of artifacts before time runs out. To get more time, you touch the floating artifacts with your car. For each one you touch, a new one spawns and your arrow will tell you where its located. You can also see it on your mini map too, but if its out of range, you'll rely on the arrow anyway. One of these events early in the game stopped me after completing each tier of collecting Y number of artifacts and then I went onto the next tier. This event lasted far too long, which I suppose is why the game cuts in and says done with this tier, would you like to do something else?Oh but that's just where the formula begins! Other events include saving sports cars from zombies. The cars spawn in one at a time and you need to rescue the car before its destroyed. Then there's a how many zombies can you kill before time runs out? To add time to your clock, you need to run over special bio hazard zombies that will douce your vehicle with some blue liquid to drain its health. You need to kill 100 or so zombies or fail. These zombies are sparse, but you can usually kill three at a time.The game keeps ramping up the challenge with these side missions. The missions add other cars to hinder you. Others have you competing against other cars to see who can get the most artifacts. This would feel more fun if it was in the daytime and I could see where the objects spawn rather than relying on my arrow. Then I could get some strategy involved so I could see this and that car can reach the object long before I can, so I should hang out here and wait for the next one.The final event forces you to clear out all zombies from a tunnel either in thirty, twenty or ten minutes, depending on what rank you want. This alone is tedious enough, but the fact that its dark and you need to rely on headlights makes it worse. To top that off after a few minutes, the game sends three cars after you.The game is easy to pick up and play with no complex mechanics. It plays well on a keyboard or 360 controller. One problem I do have is the chase cam is relegated to four angles (front, right, left, rear) rather than having full control. Hey I'm still happy there are four angles. There's also a variety of cameras to chose from, hood, bumper, far chase cam, near chase cam and so on.As for the graphics and music, both are worth mentioning for both good and the bad. The music is some mix of 50s and 60s style surfer rock'n roll. There is a little more diversity than that, but it got old fast.  The graphics do look convincing. Its more of a beautiful blue sky over a dreary city. The zombies and gore are fair and convincing, but no one is playing for the zombies.I'm really on the fence about this one. From a technical standpoint, the game is fun, easy to play, but its a little too easy. So its good for children other than the whole zombie gore factor. There's no wow factor that other racers have. A wider variety of courses would have been appreciated rather than racing in the same city for two hours and then the other two areas for an hour or so a piece.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												For those of you who played Carmageddon, back in the late 90's, this game is the spiritual successor.Created by a Russian based development house, the game is all the more charming for it.Gone is the cliched smart♥♥♥♥♥♥teenage driver, who is trying to find / avenge his family / girlfriend / teddy bear , instead you play as a Hunter who will take on various missions, thus earning upgrades, etc.The missions are of the standard type Kill / Capture mostly, with Escort and Timed runs thrown in.The controls are simple and easy to pick up, so the learning curve is minimal, letting you get straight to the fun.And this is where other racing games have seemingly lost their way, because they focus more on a teeth grinding level of challenge, invoking frustration. It involves a time commitment to play those games - is it a game or a relationship ?With this game, I can pick it up, play it, and leave happy, because it gave me a fun experience.And that is exactly what I paid for. Fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Combine Carmageddon, Need for Speed Underground, and Burnout and you get Clutch.  A high-speed, octane-fueled, zombie splatterfest.  Unlockable upgradable cars and a wide open city-track makes for an enjoyable romp through this apocalypse.  While cars are damagable and show the effects of getting hit, it doesn't have the absurd deformation that Carmageddon offered.  The driving feels solid and doesn't have that 'RC car' feel like many games have lately.  The music is a good mix of appropriate tunes and songs can be skipped if they're not to your taste.

												Clutch obviously took it's inspiration from Carmageddon and perhaps a little of Destruction Derby. Because the comparison is so obvious I just needed to compare the two. The main difference, aside from the graphics ofcourse, is that the Carmageddon series are way more extreme. In Clutch you will be killing zombies instead of humans. Carmageddon is a lot faster and the maps are bigger and more exciting which also results in more extreme and higher jumps. Carmageddon's cars are more fun and overall there's more humour in the game. Overall Carmageddon beats Clutch on every level. That doesn't mean this game is bad, far from it. Like I said before, the maps are not as interesting and can be pretty boring with lots of grey. Aside from that, the graphics are obviously better than the first 3 Carmageddon games so this game could be a pretty good game to relive those days.... weren't it for the fact there's a new Carmageddon (Reincarnation) coming up (still in Early Access).Clutch is a cheap(er) choice but if you got some money to spend, Carmageddon: Reincarnation might be your better choice which also includes the 3 classic Carmageddon games.

												I used to play Clutch when I was a child. I have reinstalled this game recently- it appealed to me. Let me present you my short review:Gameplay:Zombies included. Cars included. There should be more enemies on the map to make a real slaughterhouse.Graphics:The game looks quite nice- partly destructible environment, zombies can be dismembered in a variety of ways. Heads-up display is nasty in my opinion- too many indicators on the screen.Soundtrack:Pleasant music, but slaughtered zombies scream like normal people.This game is worth buying: it can provide you with lots of fun- this mix of zombie slaughter and racing is really entertaining.

												Underneath Clutch's snarly, indie, East Euro exterior beats the heart of a very average racer that gets repetitive quickly.  Sure, the races take place in a zombie-plagued future, but your tasks are essentially the same as in every other arcade racer out there, just with a ""STALKER-ish"" paint job.  There's fixed checkpoint races, (semi-) random checkpoint races, demolition derbies, ""ram the other racer"" races, and variations on these themes.  The fact that you're mowing down zombies between point A and point B is kind of exciting at first, but then you realize that there's far better arcade racers out there (say, the first GRID) and far better mow-the-peds-down racers out there (the old, but still vital, Carmageddon).  If you absolutely have to motor over zombies I'd recommend the top-down ""Zombie Driver"", which, while still an indie eyesore, gives you actual missions and guns.  Clutch: 2/5 stars.

												I really wanted to like this game but there's more issues to it that makes it not worthwhile. Granted it has a few gems to it. I mean come on, who doesn't like fast cars and killing zombies at the same time.The game mechanics are generic but the physics are believeable enough. The hud is extremely confusing unless you pay close attention and die so many times in demolition. Demolion mode has some quirks to work out with the A.I. but otherwise generally decent. Now this is  personal gripe so take it with a grain of salt, I like customizing my cars....alot. From moving the decals to upgrading pistons in the engine. This game just gives you paint job with no choice in decals whatsoever. However, you can upgrade yur car's weapons which is decent....It's not.And getting new cars is a challenge in itself considering you have to litteraly beat the everlasting hell out of the other car you want. And even then, there may be the case your car is slow enough to be overtaken by a snail  that the other car can leave you in in it's dust blood and zombie infested wake.All in all the game itself had potential, and it could have used some major developing before being turned loose, but the mediocre customization, confusing as hell story, and difficulty of getting something better than that clunker you get at the start almost make this game dead in the water.4/10 ""The Diamond in the Rough zombie driver.""

												""Zombies and cars and guns, oh my!"" 5/10Hmm, let’s see here, a racing game where you run down zombies. Zombies...how lame. I sure am sick of zombies in video games these days…oh okay, this game came out in 2009. ""I guess it might be fun for an hour or two."" And it is…for about two hours this game is pretty fun. Then you’ll be like, running down zombies in your spiky car, and you’ll think to yourself 'this game sure is incredibly repetitive even for a racing game’, and then you’ll turn it off, and then you’ll uninstall it, and then you’ll forget about it forever.If you spend $10 on this game…don’t spend $10 on this game, because it’s worth about a buck twenty-five tops. Not to say that there's anything wrong with this game though. I mean, the controls are good and are somewhat reminiscent of Daytona, the graphics although outdated aren't bad looking, the soundtrack is acceptable and fits the carnage, the racing is decent, and there are various modes to play such as straight up racing, demolition derby, and other zombie hit em’ up type challenges. But still, even with the diversity in modes, this game still won’t entertain you after a few hours. Maybe if the developers got off of their high horses and lowered the price somewhere closer to a buck twenty-five then I could maybe recommend this game for the few hours of entertainment that it will dish out. But no, they insist on asking for $10 for this zombie racing game that was originally released over 6 years ago; which is basically just a newer, inferior version of Carmageddon. Darn it, now I kind of want to play Carmageddon.The best part about this game is how it tries to shove its awful story directly down your throat; presented before each challenge in stylish dialogue boxes made up of terrible writing that sounds like some drunken Russian wrote it. “Oh, what’s that? Everyone in the city is zombie? You guys want to race? Oh yeah, and we can also go around helping people being attacked in their cars by zombies.” Give me a break, why can’t these people just drive away on their own? Their cars work fine, and they do drive away when you help them anyway! And wait a minute, I thought everyone in the city was a zombie except me? On second thought, I can’t even recommend this game for a buck twenty-five. No, no, this game is worth more like forty nine cents; which is about what I paid for it; so I guess I can’t be too mad.

Then you’ll be like, running down zombies in your spiky car, and you’ll think to yourself 'this game sure is incredibly repetitive even for a racing game’, and then you’ll turn it off, and then you’ll uninstall it, and then you’ll forget about it forever.

												Wouldn't advise anyone to rush out and buy this one and especially not for £9.99, where alot of people have said its like carmageddon which is on the store too!, well yes you could say that if it means running into other cars and running over zombies, i've found at the start it got exciting then superboaring very quickly faster than i could get from 0 to 60, the intro has a great car however it's not the car you start off with, also from the games decription i thought it would be a zombie defense game where you would run over zombies to survive nope, there's quite a lack of zombies.Not very much to say other than that the game seems to haven't had anymore work done to it since it was released and their last news story was about NFL clutch players which was completly irrelivant, it could do with some achivements and major revamping, as its nothing like what i was expecting as i said i was expecting dead rising amount of zombies attacking me instead i got a deserted town with derp zombies not even attacking.

												i have mixed feeling about this game.is it terrible? no, it's not.is it fun? maybe it can be, fome a litte hours.basically, there are no reason to play Clutch. There are better driving games around (i feel the combination drive-zombie to be completely without sense)So, I recommend you to not buy this game or, if you are curious, wait for a (massive) price drop just to have fun for some hours			",364,124,12,77,26,2,71

												The rampant translation errors and lack of any sort of tutorial led me to expect the worst, but this actually plays pretty well for the first hour or two. The handling is pretty smooth and there's a clever mechanic whereby hitting zombies gives you nitro, meaning that swerving into as many zombies as possible is often the fastest way to get around.Unfortunately, once I unlocked a faster car and got to some of the larger races, I realized there's some incredibly blatant rubber-banding going on and it absolutely killed the game for me. It's frustrating as hell to get out in the lead in your zippy little sports car and gun the nitro only to have a hummer zip past you. This alone pretty much ended my interest in the game.There are some other problems. There are a lot of side missions to do for cash to buy upgrades, but they're all variations on either hunting artifacts or smashing zombies and it gets old really quickly. There's very little feedback or information (not even a spedometer) and things are really rough around the edges. For example, the UI may or may not display your objective progress depending on how it's feeling at that moment. Honestly, without the rubber banding this would have been a fun if slightly clunky semi-open world zombie-murderin' racer. As it is, it's just not worth investing the time in completing dull side missions and upgrading your car just to have the game decide that you should be in third place now.

												You will enjoy this in the first 15min and then you realize, there is not much content and you are pretty much stuck to one race track with repetitive given tasks.8 game modes? Well it feels like only one when you are almost all the time on one track.Zombies are cool and I love them. but they dont add anything to this game. cars feel sluggish to maneuver and the customiziation is also just thrown in. I never felt like soemthing changed.The pricetag is way too high. should have been a 3€ game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a surprisingly fun game with ineteresting gameplay features, worth picking up if you want a game to mess around with while not being a serious racing game. I mean running over zombies.. how could that not be fun right lol. Also has some arena gameplay where you try to destroy other vehicles before they get you, could of been better if the game had a bigger budget but that also is why its not more then $10 and I got it for $1 on Bundlestars.com ",828,182,39,108,113,8,138

Played it for endless hours on the PS3 (It's called Armageddon Riders on there for some reason) and when I found out it was on PC called Clutch I bought it right away! Right now I only have like 20 minutes in the game but I see myself playing this much much more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple yet enjoyable racing game not a AAA title so don't expect it go in with expectations of playing a casual pass time and you'll enjoy it.  I got it for $1 worth least $5 but i can't say it is a $10 game. Game has many diffrent styles of play open world street racing demolition derby what i unlocked so far. Car customization and upgrading. Do i recommend it?sure on sale $5 or less pick it up for a casual pass timer.			",328,34,12,43,15,0,54

												At the moment Clutch is only 2.99 Euro and at this price, buy it. But the normal price of 9.99 Euro is too high in my opinion.The story is simply stupid and it does not help at all that the short story snippets are triggered by particular missions, which you can play without any order.But apart from that, for 2.99 the game offers quite some fun. What is not to like about a car that eats zombies?PROS + the various racing modes are fun+ pimping your cars for maximum zombie destroying (and eating) power is fun+ great soundtrack+ wreaking havoc feels very satisfyingCons - ridiculous story, which is barely there anyway- a bit repetitive after some time			",160,19,1,7,12,0,11
