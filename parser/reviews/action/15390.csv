												This is it.THIS is the Brothers in Arms game that still holds up to this day.Easily one of the best cover shooters to EVER exist, the grim, mortifying atmosphere is only made more authentic by the immersive, tantalizing sound design, the (finally) accurate gunplay, and beautiful visuals.Absolutely worth picking up and replaying after all these years.WE NEED MORE SHOOTERS LIKE THIS!EDIT: Coming back 2 years later, and I am still pleased!

												Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was an amazing experience and an example on what modern military shooters should do nowadays, yes, looking at you, Call of Duty and Battlefield. At thing which bugs me about modern shooters is that every single one of them has its focus on the repetitive multiplayer where as today most of them play essentially the same, just as the campaign. We need more games like Hell's Highway which are not glorifying war but show the human side the soldiers have instead of how many times they can yell ""♥♥♥♥ YEAH, AMERICA!"" while pulling out the flamethrower to ""burn them, burn them all!!!""The men you fight along in Hell's Highway feel human and just as in the older Brother's in Arms games, the main focus lies in the single player. If you want to buy this game for a killstreak loaded multi player to ""pwn scrubs"", you are wrong here.A roughly about 10 hours long campaign (I played on Veteran difficulty)  will keep you motivated with a nice tactical component to command different squads such as the MG squad or the assault team as Matthew Baker, to surpress the enemy and use the element of surprise to flank clueless and somtimes dumb acting enemy soldiers. The commanding barely gets old and as you hop around different hubs of the hot areas during the war. Those range from wide fields to close battles in troubled cities and villages as well as asylums and collapsed buildings.The thing which does get a little repetitive are the objectives you have to achieve using those methods of commanding. Most of the time you find yourself having to destroy 88 cannons and sometimes drive a tank around in which you are mostly safe even on the higher difficulties. Really annoying did those things only become in the end to me, as the game finally came to a closing, during the last hour of gameplay. The story itself kept motivating as protagonist Matthew Baker's mind started to crumble and he realized more and more and war is insanity. The ""To Be Continued"" in the end was a huge bummer to me though, especially because Ubisoft doesn't seem to care at all about this amazing series which could definetly standout amongst ""Call of Boredom"" or the recent development of the""Battlefail"" games.It doesn't need amazing graphics to make a good game. While Brothers in Arms may looked fine back in the day it is quite outdated for the modern standards. Second to none facial animations, horrible lip-synching at times but nice destructability of cover and physical correctness of the debris look damn fine as well as gore and ragdoll of fallen enemy soldiers. Also the sound design is great and as the bullets fly over your head  in cover and the enemies speaking correct German, which is a rare thing to see to be honest. The atmosphere is really great and makes you feel as if this was an episode of the critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers""-TV show. The developers really did a great job in capturing an unique and equally terrifying experience.Overall Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is a technically and gameplay wise far from flawless but also an unique and tactical game which definetly gets a recommendation for me, even if solely for the atmosphere and the long campaign.Grab this game if you are sick of modern shooters and/or glorification of war.

												10/10This game has been released more than 6 years ago and playing it still feels incredibly realistic. The graphics are truly beautiful, the setting is in the Netherlands, which is a plus on its own, and the story is great. If you have played Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood before, the first and second game in this series, this game isn't anything like it. The controls are better, the guns are and many more. Nevertheless, the game ends with a cliffhanger and after six years there hasn't been any talk yet about the fourth game of the series... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ""I never asked to be a squad leader, but I had no choice."" - Sergeant Matthew 'Matt' Baker Side noteI abused the summer sale to finaly purchase the Brothers In Arms Series over Steam as I already own the DVD versions of it. I did it in order to review it for you guys, not to mention the fact I am tired of the discs. This series is the most authentic World War 2 video game you can find in the video games market. Unlike any other kinds of games, you are really leading your men during battles and their faith in the battlefield is in your hands.Now, to the point, Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway review.IntroductionIn Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway you are playing as Staff Sergeant Matthew Baker also known as Matt. You are leading your men through Holland during Operation Market Garden, an Operation that had the idea of punching through the German lines in order to open a highway to give a quick end to the war and be home by Christmass.After Normandy (First 2 BiA games), Baker's platoon is folded into a brand new Reconnaissance platoon. The recon platoon relies on their jeeps for fast movement through the battlefields to recon and harass enemy positions. The squad is broken up to two teams assigned into jeeps.GameplayMovement - Movement animations are great and realistic. Whether you are walking, running or getting behind cover it feels like you are really in the battlefield. - GOODEngaging An Enemy - Your squad has two modes of engagement. If the Squad is in stealth mod, which means the enemy didn't notice them - They would move quietly and whisper and would not engage the enemyunless you order them to or the enemy has opened fire at them. The other mod is if they are seen and they are during a battle they will open fire at engaging enemies even if you won't order them to. - GOODGrenades - Your squad will throw grenades at an enemy if they are close enough. But the enemy will never throw a grenade at your squad, even tho they are equipped with grenades. - BADRecoil - The recoil of the weapons in the game is as realistic as it gets with most weapons. Just enough to keep the game enjoyable but still making your life hard to get a kill on enemy that is far away from you. - GOODTanks and 88s - Feels like the enemy tanks and 88s are just waiting for you to destroy them. No huge effort is in order to destory them. I didn't like it. - BADSounds - The game has awesome sounds when it comes to the weapons and the area that sorrounds you. - GOODDestroy Em! - Plus, unlike the first two games, in this game you can actually destroy objects. For example you can destroy sorts of covers and get your enemy out in the open and kill them.StorylineUnlike the first two games, this game has taken the cutscenes to the next level. Almost feels like you are watching a movie and you are the lead actor.The game has great writing. The cutscenes are adding alot to the game and to the emotions you feel while playing it. Almost feels like you are there and not Baker.The dialouges during Battles are amusing and it feels real. Unlike in other games where when your teammates die you don't feel anything because they were 'Badass', here you are connected to the chararcters emotionaly, you care for them and you are conecered about them during battles. When a fellow team mate gets killed, it feels like someone has just kicked you in the stomach and it brings up feelings, almost to tears at some points. In addition to what I said, in this game Baker suffers from guilt as a result of the deaths of his friends during the battles in Normandy and you can see its affect on him through out the game. The locations of fights in the game are re-created real battles that took place in the real world, they were worked on by the developers team and historians to make the game more authentic and realistic.  GraphicsThe game has amazing graphics. The areas that sorround you in the game are just beautiful and mind blowing at the same time. The uniforms of the Allied and of the Wermacht are just beautiful to look at, the weapons look way more authentic and more. There are beautiful locations in alot of occassions in the game.My OpinionIn my opinion the Brothers In Arms Series is the best World War 2 series to exist. Its the most authentic world war 2 series and most realstic. It has great gameplay and storyline and bringsalot of features that other games don't. No other game made me care for my team like Brothers In Arms did. I replayed every and each one of the games for so many times, I just can't get enough of it.I am still waiting for Brothers In Arms: Battle Of The Bulge, or what ever the name of the next Brothers In Arms is going to be. The Brothers In Arms Series needs to have a closure.I suggest to you to buy the game, but also consider playing the first 2 games first to get a better idea of whats going on with Baker in this game and understand the game more deeply. Tips for gameplay:  1)Play the game without supression bars or any other kind of miscs on your screen;While playing with a clean screen you can enjoy the game way more than you thought you could.Playing with a clean screen gives you the feeling you are really there in the battlefield, ordering your men.*You will need to remember where you placed each squad and what's the role of each firing team when you order them to move because it won't tell you which firing team you chose on the screen. You might wanna know who are the soldiers of each team before you order them around so in the battlefield you will remember by that which squad is located where and move them around correctly.*You will need to keep an eye on your fire, yeah I know hammering the enemy is fun but when you don't know how much bullets you have left in the magazine or if you have extra bullets if at all you might run into some trouble in a battle - yeah running out of bullets infornt of a german firing squad is not a great idea nor fun.2) Play the game on authentic. Playing the Brothers In Arms series on Authentic gives you the real feeling of the battlefield. It gives you the best out of this game. Every small move, decision or order can be critical in a battle. It also disables all I said above(miscs, etc) on default because of the extact same reasons I pointed out earlier. You need to be super strategic and careful when you move your men and yourself. Stay in the open for to long and you might find yourself dead, injured or losing men. Thanks for reading my review.

												It's a good game - a strong example of a squad-based shooter. You control the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams, edging your way through battlefields to flank enemies and progress through linear levels. It encourages you to leverage your fireteams because your own weapons are unreliable to the extreme - on par with Counter-strike accuracy. Bullets spray for no particular reason, shots that are dead-on don't always register, and enemies take many shots to take down. While that's frustrating, it highlights that you are not a pure badass. Sure you may mow down hundreds of enemies in a playthrough, but ultimately it tries to knock you down to size with it's iffy gun mechanics - you need to use your squad to succeed. And while it is frustrating to not be rewarded for your own skill, i can understand that sloppy controls make you rely on your squad more.It also seems to want to be Band of Brothers, the TV show. The game spends an enormous amount of time showing wooden characters (some of which are obviously derived from Band of Brothers characters, one of which even shares a voice actor) talking to each other about the war and each other. It spins narratives about cursed guns and lost loves which have exactly nothing to do with the game. The first ten minutes (not an exaggeration) is a series of unskippable cutscenes that awkwardly introduce a set of characters which it clearly wants you to be invested in. It keeps introducing new characters who have small quirks and different voice actors, but whom you really don't care about. When it kills off or maims a character, you're clearly expected to care, but there's no *reason* to care; the gameplay (controlling the position and focus of 1-3 fireteams) is identical no matter which characters are involved, and you're aways given replacements who are exactly as capable. Cutscene after cutscene is used, even with ""shaky-cam"" effects and close-ups of expressionless faces. It's all the more frustrating because this came out a year after Bioshock, a game which is almost purely story-driven, uses the same engine, and yet falls into none of the gameplay or storytelling pitfalls that this game does.Ultimately, it's a fun game that executes a squad shooter very well, despite the flaws. I'd recommend it if you're certain you want a squad shooter, and wouldn't recommend it for any other reason.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic squad-based FPS with a pretty stellar story. Your squad mates, for the most part, have really good AI and don't make too many dumb decisions. While backstory and knowledge of the previous games will certainly help, you can skip straight to this one. The mechanics are much more finely tuned over the previous two and is a better experience for it. This is definitely one of the best WWII shooters I've played.

												My take on the game:+ Story is good enough+ graphics average (if not a little minimal)+ Some good maps in story mode+ Athmosphere of all maps in the story mode is good+ tactical elements fit+ Some good sounds and music+ nice gun variety and effects (for instance ejected bullets are 3d and smoke a little, like the barrel after larger volleys)- Multiplayer mode is there but dead- maps offer one or two alternative ways to flank, but are very linear otherwise- enemies spawn uppon aproach and act very player-oriented (in other words: if there's any possible way to do so, they'll prioritize the player over NPC-allies)- No matter what you do or where you stand: you'll die kinda quickly if you don't cover (even standing behind walls...).- Guns don't shoot where you aim at (it's like you sprinkle your shots all over the place and hope that you hit something...)- repetitive map designs ('a corridor with some barricades and an 88 at the end' is used like 6 times in a row...)- Game emphasises close ups in cutscenes but the faces characters make don't always feel apropriate.- ending is anti-climatic- AI sometimes not very clever----------------------------------------------Auf Deutsch:Was ich vom Game halte:+ Story ist gut genug+ Graphik ist normal / gut genug (wenn auch einwenig minimal)+ Einige gute karten im Story modus+ Athmosphäre der Karten im Storymodus ist gut+ Taktische Elemente passen+ Einpaar gute Geräusche und musik+ Gute Waffendiversität und Effekte (Ausgeworfene Patronen sind 3d und rauchen einwenig genauso wie der Lauf nach längeren Salven)- Multiplayermodus ist da aber ""Tot""- Karten haben ein oder zwei alternativrouten für Flankierungen, sind aber ansonsten sehr linear- Gegner spawnen beim näherkommen und verhalten sich sehr Spielerorientiert (in anderen Worten: wenn es auch nur irgendwie möglich ist priorisieren Gegner den Spieler über NPC-Alliierte)- Egal was man macht oder wo man steht: man stirbt relativ schnell wenn man ncith in Deckung geht (sogar wenn man hinter einer Wand ist...).- Waffen schiessen nicht dorthin, wo man hin zielt (es ist wie wenn man um sich schiesst und hofft etwas zu treffen...)- repetitive Karten designs ('Ein Korridor mit einer 88 am anderen Ende' wird etwa 6 mal hintereinander verwendet...)- Game fokussiert auf Nahaufnahmen in Cutscenes aber die Gesichter der Charaktere fühlen sich oft nicht richtig an.- Das Ende ist Anti-Klimatisch- KI manchmal nicht helle			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still holds it's own as an FPS as of December 2016. Controls are a little janky, and it can be a pain reassigning them, but the graphics are still on par with a bunch of modern console games (though actual capability for controlling the graphical quality is very minimal). I'm not a major FPS fan, but this game will always hold a special place in my heart. It's the only BiA game I've ever played, and I still develop attachments to the characters in the story. It really is that good. If you're looking for an insanely fun tactical shooter to tide over your weekend, then, providing you can put up with some pretty abysmal hit detection, this is the game for you.10/10 would miss a very obvious hit again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is way better than the first 2 games IMO.It introduce some machanism that make this game more TACTICAL. For exmaple, third person view (cover system) make player can overwatch the battlfield, the powerful tactical map even provide the whole thing about locations include active emeny, firendly, cover distribution...etc, useful infomation make strategy efficient, finally you don't need to get this by tons of death. The third team(MG team/ bazooka team) make Flank is not the only option, you can blow up emeny MG directly under certain range. Downed teammate recovery, heatlh machanism(not self-recovery but resemble) boost playability.Yes, it may feel less realistic but more tactical, may disappoint players that wants realistic hardcore ton of death stamped by irrational deadly AI or whatever, but if ou like a pure tactical shooter, give this a shot.

												This is the third installment in Brother In Arms series, where you play Matt Baker, leader of his squad. The story is excellent as it shows the mental toll the war can have on a person, as Matt is struggling to keep grips with reality as he leads his squad through tough battles, losing a few good men along the way.Gameplay: The guns have a nice and punchy sound, and watching your bullets rip through the natzi scum is very satisfying,  Grenades will blow off limbs, and a nicely placed headshot will split the enemys head in two.

												The best game in the Brothers In Arms franchise, and also the best WWII game in my opinion. You play as a Sergeant named Mathew Baker and command your squad in big shootouts with many objects to use as your cover. You have a demolition squad which fires rockets at its assigned targets (good for destroying artillery guns and bust german bunkers and cover) and you have an assault squad which fires at their assigned targets (your standard soldiers). I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes military or historical games.Rip Furious Four			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really good game, I have always been a fan of these series.All in all the fps, and 3rd person action is amazing. To the timing when you shoot your enemy when they are running.To having your troops suppress enemy's while you and another squad ambushes. 10/10But if you expect there to be multiplayer dont get your hopes up. There is none, You have to download some kind of program for it. (Its a hasle but worth it)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No idea what was going on in the story, since this was my first and only Brother in Arms game... Besides that, the gameplay was alright. It became stale overtime but for an older game like this, it runs well and the graphics still hold up. The worst part has to be the AI.. they run into oncoming fire to take cover, and die... and they get stuck in walls, caught behind doors, etc..  Love the headshot camera, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""What is it that makes a great soldier? Is it is brain or his heart?""-Matt BakerThis is not a game. This is a TRUE masterpiece. Welcome to Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway. Get ready for a trip to the past, with one of the most immersive, well-created, tactical FPS in the history of video-games. This is one HELL of a game. It follows the men of the 101st Airborne Division in the later stages of World War 2, during Operation Market Garden, in the Netherlands. You'll be playing as Staff-Seargant Matthew Baker, and you'll be the one commanding your teammates. Their lives depends on you, on your judgement and how fast you can create a strategy inside the battlefield. Unfortunately, this is the last installment in the series, at least for now, but we still hope that Ubisoft will give us another Brothers In Arms, with current gen graphics.The graphics are very good for a game from 2008. Obviously last gen graphics, but nothing that will stop you from playing it. The controls are extremely fluid and I've never had a problem with them. The gore is amazing, you'll see body parts flying around, and depending on the weapon you're using, it might dismember the enemies or not. Keep in mind, before you buy, this is NOT a typical run and shoot game. It does involve strategy and thinking, so if you think that running around on the battlefield will solve it, you're better off not playing it, because you'll die within seconds. This game is worth the 9,99€, but if you manage to buy it on a sale, for 4,99€, get ready for a trip to Feeladelphia!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have completed the game and therefore, i think that i have a right of writing this review.Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is the 3rd (and final) installment of the Brother's in Arms franchise.This franchise is the one out of many proofs that Ubisoft is a bad games developer.This game is really good overall, however, to keep up with the story and understand the connection between characters, it is SERIOUSLY RECOMMENDED to buy both prequels, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood and Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30.The Game BreakdownStoryThe story of the game is really good, it is immersive and can suck you into the feels. (well i got affected)You play as Matthew Baker which is the main protagonist that you also play as in Road to Hill 30.While touring the Netherlands, you get attacked by some nazis, well DUH!!.This game is set in World War 2. You get to lead a handful of men, at the least of 3 men and the most of 9 men.You also get to take control of a Sherman Firefly Tank twice in this game.GameplayJust like the previous games, Brothers in Arms is known to be a tactical first person shooter (FPS) you can order your men to take up positions, Flank enemy positions, Surpress enemy fire, take cover behind a huge rock and follow you as you move. There are 3 squads you can control1. Base of Fire Teama non special squad which the soldiers only wield M1A1 Carbines, M1A1 Thompsons and M1 GarandsTip:Use this fire team to throw grenades up close to enemy positions and follow you moving2. Assault TeamBasically the same as number 1 except this one is more awesome..... Why?Because there's a british guy.3. Special Weapons teamthis can be broken down into 2 which are:a. MG teamA squad which carries a Browning M1919A6 (Heavy Machine Gun)Tip:Use this squad to stay at the furthest back of your current position to supress enemy firesb. Bazooka TeamA squad which carries the Rocket Launcher (Bazooka)Tip:Use this squad to supress tanks and annihilate poor little nazis.The drawback of the gameplay of this title is that unlike its previous titles, this game removes the Tactical Awareness View and changed with a simple ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed map. My first reaction was WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥IN HELL IS THIS. I guess its just me that i like to see the faces, names and the weapons of my own men and the enemy. The awareness view in the previous games is really cool which shows your position with the exact cutscene graphics.GraphicsThis game came out of the year 2008 which i think has remarkable graphics from that period.The graphics are a big jump from the previous games as they transferred from Unreal Ungine 2.0 to Unreal Engine 3.0Good grass texturesGreat water texturesNice ShadersCutting-Edge helmet textures ( You can even see the damned particles of Baker's helmet)So you guys might be thinking, ""So what of this game makes Ubisoft a bad guy?""Here i shall tell youWARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!!!:The game ends with a Cliffhanger which is a total nerve-wrecking experience and guess what!Ubisoft cancelled the 4th installment named Furious 4. UGGHHHH...Ubisoft has created a franchise which is for me, a revolution in the world of FPS. In which you get to take control of your own people. The story from the previous games would automatically bond the game characters and the players and to have it end with a cliffhanger, Its like opening a road for 30 miles and suddenly, there's a road block but yet, the road looks to be open and safe to go but a block stands in the way. Anyways.....Overall, I hereby rate this game as9/10Very Recommended(If you are patient and have completed the previous games.)BAAAAAAAKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can't go by the hours listed by Steam. I own this game from when it came out on disc and played it through many times. When people give reviews on games that have almost 10 years on them and try to compare them to newer games. I find it to be annoying. This is not just a game, its a great story and if you take the time and watch the cut scenes it will make the experience so much better. This game has wonderful characters and as I said a great story. This game used some of the best gaming technology that were available at that time. Some people won't even watch some of the best classic films because they are in Black and white. When you were little and someone told you stories, your imagination gave it color. guess what you still have an imagination. My point is , take the time to enjoy the experience of the game. You bought the game, So you deserve that.The graphics hold up well in this game, IMO. The game play is well laid out. You can remap the keys if you want. I have seen some reviews that said you can't remap the keys in this game. You can set the screen to 1920 x 1080 also. I have had no issues running on windows 10 64bit. I highly recommend this game for you collection. They released a collectors edition that came with a highly detailed 6 inch Matt Baker figure and 12 accessories, including the 30 cal m1 carbine and the silver 45 cal colt 1911 model.I found one on Amazon a few years ago. This is just my opinion about the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A masterpiece. Really, there is not a thing I do not like about Hell's Highway. Well, actually, there is one: The story won't continue and that's something I just can't get over. But let's be professional here.This is one hell of a fantastic shooter. You continue in the story of Sgt. Matt Baker a paratrooper of 101st Airborne Division. He and his men have already gone through hell in Normandy and now there is another one ahead of them: Operation Market Garden.Gameplay is fantastic, controls are easy to learn and handle. 3rd person view, utilizing a cover and issuing orders for squads under your command. Game will quickly teach you how to use tactical manouvering and suppresive fire. Forget Call of Duty, you are no supersoldier who can take out whole garrison single-handed. No. You need to rain lead down on your enemy, so they won't dare to stick their heads up. Once they are pinned, you can outflank them and finnish from the side. Especially on higher difficuilties, the game require you to think tactically. That's what I like most.Story is one of best I ever encountered. Characters are unique, while still remain ordinary troops. No stereotypes like e.g. psycho gunner, excellent sharpshooter, and demolition guy. No, no. Brothers in Arms is all about grunts, ordinary soldiers. It's about their feels, their stories. Many of your soldiers have their own backstory (sometimes linked to previeous installments in the series), they have a different level of relationship with Sgt. Baker. Some would go to fire for him, others are questioning his ability to lead them. New guys who want to prove themselves, old friends, loyal to the end. Each with great voice-acting. Warning: there will be emotions. Thanks to excellent animation of facial expressions, you can read thoughts of your men to the point, where you will truly be part of the story. You will mourn the fallen comrade, you will mourn dead civilians. Their blood will be on your hands and altough there are no choices in this game, you will feel responsible for some of your actions nonetheless. Story is something, which make this game a real gem of WWII shooters.And here we are - the thing I don't like. After Market Garden, there was yet another hell awaiting for paratroopers of 101st and 82nd Airborne Division. The snowy, freezing hell of Ardenne forest. Yes, Battle of the Bulge, it was supposed to be a cap stone of the story of Matt Baker and his soldiers. In the end of Hell's Highway, there is a rift, there are emotions and there are questions unanswered. I want to know how will it all end. After all, Matt made it through hell. I wonder how he would handle snow. But game devolopers will never answer my prayers...Anyway, this is a game I recommend to any and all who like historicaly acurate WWII shooters, who like great story and who like to think tactically and feel the war as a soldier, not some god-like spec op superman.

												I am not sure why some people claim that this is the worst of the Brothers in Arms games. I played all three of the games at their release dates, and now have replayed all three of them within the past year or so. I actually think that this game is the best of them overall, and holds up the most.Surely, it has an advantage of also being the newest one of the three, but that doesn't mean that the other games should just get extra points, because they simply weren't as good as this one. The first one, in fact, disappointed me a lot - and that was with nostalgia thinking it was amazing!This game held up. Great graphics, great gameplay, nice story setup and reference to previous events. I enjoyed replaying this game the most out of the three.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A refreshingly relatable and grounded take on war in videos games. Relying more on character and personal moments than big overly produced set pieces. That's not to say the actual action isn't great, it's full of the same nitty gritty combat of any other solidly crafted war shooter. But it's not what makes Hell's Highway stand out, it's the smaller details that do. The tension of combat and planing out your battles, the humanity and development given to your comrades, the atmospheric levels full of booming sounds of the battlefield and eerie silence of empty village streets and farms. Many games capture the sheer power and brutality of war. But only a small handful capture the real warriors themselves. The thoughts and feelings of men forced to fight and die in a cause they may not fully understand nor sometimes even fully care about. Hell's Highway is one of those rare games that does.

												I was looking for a good WWII FPS game and Hell's Highway was the newest one with good reviews, so I tried it. And I was satisfied!But it is much different than Call of Duty, you cannot proceed in ""Rambo style"". You have to use 2 squads and stay in cover. It feels much more realistic and more rewarding than CoD.Pros:- sounds, decent graphics- gameplay- high, but not frustrating difficulty (I played on veteran and HUD off)- checkpoint systemCons:- cover system sometimes doesn't work as I expected- occasional bugs, 3 times happened, that the game didn't count objective completion and I had to restart from checkpoint- only 9-10 hours of gameplay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hell's Highway feels a full generation away from it's predecessors - the graphics are vastly improved and the tech can finally tell the story with all the drama and tension that they've been aiming for since the beginning. It also feels like a new generation in terms of the fact that a lot of the gameplay has been streamlined (grenade throwing has been tightened up, thank god), and, in my opinion, these changes have made the game easier. The new appearance of OP weapons like the bazooka team and the player-controlled tank make it a cakewalk to mop up whole squads of enemies in one shot. Your Thompson is also replaced early on with a barrel-cartridge tommy gun that feels like it never runs out of ammo. You can, with relative ease, stand back and pick off enemies from afar with the new cover system that allows you to peek around corners and focus your fire, and if you do happen to flank the enemy, often they'll stand straight up and into your squadmates' gunfire, dying in seconds. All these additions detract from the immersion, and make the game feel a little more arcadey, even thought the core gamplay mechanics are nearly identical to the previous games. All in all, this game feels much more polished and fancy, but loses some of the pulse-pounding, gritty tension of knowing that even if you're prepared, bum-rushing that dug-in squad could get you killed.The one thing this does best is make you feel. By the last levels of the game, you'll almost want to stop playing, and the push through burning wreckages and sand dunes, being harried by multiple enemy squads, will feel dreadful, but you know that you have to keep pushing through in order to complete the mission, which is exactly how the characters feel. The narrative continues the story of Matt Baker, who is experiencing some deep PTSD/mental illness. It's incredibly bleak all the way through, and centres around a specific and almost rushed-through moment in the original game, which is retroactively filled out to fantastic effect for the player, explaining the actions of some of the characters all the way through the series. There is a subplot about a cursed weapon that it also tries to retrofit, but this doesn't stick quite as well. So that's it - I've played all three games in the series, one after the other, in the space of a couple of weeks. This used to be my preferred game, and it's the one I've played most, but after playing them back to back, Earned in Blood is easily my favourite, and balances a quality narrative, with realistic and rewarding gameplay, a battlefield that sounds truly alive, memorable level design, and just the right level of difficulty that rewards good tactics. The original game falls on the side of being a little too clunky, and this falls on the side of being a little too streamlined, for my tastes. In saying that, because the narrative intertwines throughout the three games, you really must play all three in order to get the full effect. Clever move, Gearbox.I recommend this more than RTH30, but less than EiB.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best WW2 shooter out there, series-wise. Doesn't stack up to the ""thrills"" of Call of Duty's origins, but it will draw you in with incredible drama, detailed characters, and a story that engulfs you emotionally. The squad commands and tactics required to successfully survive a firefight take lots of practice and skill to master.That said, this game has not aged well-- It's from 2008 and you can tell off the bat. It's a bit clunky, the movement and shooting controls are awkward, but it's a cinematic, gritty war drama cast upon a first person shooter. As far as a PC port, this game is a solid 7/10.If Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan was a game, essentially.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hell's Highway is a tactical FPS that allows you to control different squads to provide suppressing fire so you can flank and kill the Nazis. This isn't a run and gun FPS. You will die in seconds if you do that. However, the formula is always the same, setup your squad positions for suppressing fire, flank, kill, repeat. Positioning you and your squads is key in this game. The tank missions are a nice break from regular FPS gameplay. In a way this game plays like a real-time version of Valkyria Chronicles. The story and voice acting is gripping enough to be compelling. If you care about story, then I'd recommend playing Road To Hill 30 and Earned in Blood first. I enjoyed this game more than Crysis.

Not my best review but doesn't mean it isn't one of my favorite timepassers. 8/10 Reccomended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be one of my favorite strategy games. Nothing is more better than to command my teammates to perform certain tasks or move to certain locations while I sit back and watch them do some of the work for me. The story was alright, but I had to skip most of it because it didn't really catch my attention. The gameplay makes up for that(though, I wish the cutscenes could be shorter).If you love telling others what to do, this is the game for you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A worthy sequel to the first two Brothers in Arms games. There's a very emotional story here that makes the events of the previous games come full circle, and one which the game flaunts with well choreographed cinematics. The gameplay feels like a next-gen evolution of Brothers in Arms in all the right ways. Cover, destructible levels, multi-squad command, air recon, the map replacing SA view, sprinting, and the kill-cam all fit right into Brothers in Arms and don't make the game lose its identity at all. The levels are bigger and better than anything seen before, and the enemy AI is as great as it ever was. The graphics, unlike the first two BiA games, actually stand the test of time thanks to vibrant, colorful levels and tasteful use of visual effects and bump mapping, unlike most early 7th gen video games. There are a few bugs, but not enough to ruin the experience. What does ruin the experience for players experiencing the game on Veteran is the fact that the player cannot use iron sights directly out of cover, which makes cover useless when the crosshair is disabled. Another issue is that weapon sway when aiming is not in this game, except for a second immediately after the player aims. Other than that, this game is an improvement over the originals in every way.WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT DISABLE SLI BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS GAME, YOU WILL GET UNPLAYABLE AMOUNTS OF LAG!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a run and gun shoot 'em up game, this is not the place. The brothers in Arms series is more of a drama than an action game. The Game forces you to make life or death decisions on spot. This title provides an accurate depiction of soldiers that may have actually fought in ww2 and does a fairly good job of developing characters. I found it actually stressful and saddening when some of the men you fight with in game die. BIA makes you question your morality and faces you with the horrors of war. the in game mechanics are very well done and i found it enjoyable to command my squads around and defeat the wermacht enemy the game places against you. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Brothers in Arms in particular is a major step up fron the last 2, this game offers more features and a better strategy feel to it. The storyline picks up where you left off in the second brothers in arms. The singplayer is very fun and can be challenging at times if you play on a different difficulty level, that also goes with how well the AI is in this game, at times your own men will save your life at times, and the enemy is more determined to kill you. Sadly however the multiplayer community for this game, like the others is completely dead, so I only reccomend this game for it's singleplayer status.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BiA has been my favorite series since i first got road to hill 30 some 7 or 8 years ago was it? (wow i feel old) Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway is a brilliant game with a great story, as is the rest of the series, the charictor development is a big strong point. i strongly recomend buying the 3 game pack for 20 bucks because it could quite easily become your favorite series, too. the story is so compelling in BiA:HH. you genuinely feel for all the charictors and it just kind of gives you a glimpse of how incredibly brutal and sad Ww2 was. (extremely gorey) although the story is very intense and sad, some of the jokes they crack in the calmer parts will make you laugh pretty hard. now about the gameplay. the AI is... a little on the derp side but none the less, it only takes about one or 2 shots to get you. the tactical aspect of the game is what i love the most. its quick and simple and extremely effective. point, click, move, lay down fire. move other team to flank. stuff like that, it all works really well. the multiplayer is down but dont let that stop you. this whole series is so under-rated. buy this game for the sake of an amazing story experience.

Band of Brothers: the gameThis is a huge improvement from the previous brothers in arms games. The graphics are good, the gameplay amazing and the gore is just brutal. As always, brothers in arms has been about using your men to either suppress or outflank the enemy. You need to do some thinking, but still not as much as the previous games. It seems like gearbox has made the game alot easier. You can take out a whole platoon by yourself if you wanted too. The new cover system is great, aswell as the mix between third and first person view. The gore[/1]As i said, the gore is pretty brutal in this game. You hear crunching and splatter when you driver over a dead soldier. You can blow every limb there is and pretty much shoot their brains out. StoryThe best part of the game has to be the story. This is a huge improvement. The story is similar to Band of Brothers, very similar, thus if you like Band of Brothers you will love this game!Overall, one of mye favourite game series and deserves a try! 10/10, would make mashed potatoes of nazis again ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is quite immersive focusing on the bonding of individuals and the simple realities of war. The enemy AI forces you to use tactics and strategy versus just running and gunning. With a package price of $10 for all three titles, it is a good value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros:-good AI from your squads-decent shooting mechanics-good graphics for a 7 year old game-good weapon graphics and soundsCons:-story.  It's awkward.  -unskippable cutscenes that are sometimes quite long.  -small weapon choice.  Really you are limited to a M1 Garand and an smg, either the one you spawn with or an MP40. they tease you with a sniper a few times but after a small sniper mission you never see it again.-short. game is 7 hours long at mostI would recommend it, but try to buy it on sale.

												A bit of a step down for the series, as it obviously tried to go a bit more mainstream and made the combat more action-based. This ends up making it less thoughtful than the rest of the series, but still no where near as purely entertaining as Call of Duty. So a poor compromise. However, it *is* a good game. Notably, Hell's Highway sheds light on Operation Market Garden, an often overlooked campaign of the war (since it was a massive Allied failure.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game actually, I loved the original BIA.. I think I actually like Hell's Highway a little more. (I tried to play Earned in blood, but the graphics was kind of a turn off for me, I played it way too late)This games graphics were beautifully done, needed a pretty heft rig to max it with a decent framerate, though I think some of that was due to the game optimization. (which wasn't horrible, just could of used extra attention, and you could tell)The game kept me intrigued wanting to find out what happened. The atmosphere of the game was great, you could hear German's coming around the corner, the sound wasn't bad either!Gameplay was fun, seemed a little more streamedlined than previous BIA titles, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. allowed you to get lost in the moment a little easier. The ending was good, I am one person to say there are TOO MANY WWII games, but  this game is great. Hope the next one isn't as bad as the trailers show it being!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Commanding your troops is Fluent and simple and they respond fairly well. This game is definitly worth the full price of $10 (thats how much it is where I am) or what ever price it is for you. If you arent sure but happen to see it on sale, buy it because its cheap and you will most likely love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game has a pretty great storyline and the graphics are still pretty decent. Again... The amount of gore in this... Just... limbs everywhere.... Headshots = half a head when you look at the guy on the ground. Just get it. (Oh yes, and sheep.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hell's Highway is a game with a solid gameplay experience, an interesting narrative, and some glaring faults.As a direct sequel to the first game in the Brothers in Arms series Hell's Highway follows newly-promoted Staff Sergeant Matt Baker and his unit  through the Netherlands during Operation Market Garden. Baker's sanity wanes due to the contention of his men, rumors of a haunted pistol, and the memories of friends lost. The combat in HH holds to the tradition of the earlier titles in the series, while adding additional squads and features. Flanking and diversionary tactics are vital, as running into the open while an enemy fires upon Baker or his squad will result in a quick death.However, Hell's Highway is a game that needs some fixing to enjoy. For anyone like myself who gets headaches or feels sick at a lower field of view, here's different methods of how to counter the horrid default setting.--------------Method 1: A simple binding to toggle the fov. This will change the fov when pressed, but will zoom out cutscenes, break sniper scopes, and disable zooming in when aiming.Go to your ""Documents\My Games\BIA Hells Highway\SumacGame\Config"" folder and open ""SumacInput.ini"" in a text editor. under the""[Engine.PlayerInput]"" section add the following.Bindings=(Name=""KEY"",Command=""fov DESIREDFOV"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)Method 2: Changing the action of the zoom hold command to change the fov. The fov will lower when aiming to zoom in, then zoom out to your desired standard fov on release. This will also zoom out cutscenes and break sniper scopes. I suggest a zoom fov of 60, and a standard fov of 100.Under ""[Engine.InputActionDefinition]"" in SumacInput.ini look for the line that starts with ""Actions=(Id=IA_ZoomHold,Alias..."".Change the line to, ""Actions=(Id=IA_ZoomHold,Alias="".ZOOMHOLD"",Names=(""Zoom""),Command=""ZoomIn | fov DESIREDZOOMFOV | OnRelease ZoomOut | OnRelease DESIRED DEFAULT FOV"")""Other tips:Creating a bind similar to the bind shown in method 1 set to ""fov 63"" will set cutscenes close to what they look like normally.In the ""[SystemSettings]"" section of ""SumacEngine.ini"" you can pump up the graphics. I suggest setting ""EnableHighPolyChars=False"" to ""True"" and fiddling around with the MSAA.-------------Like Far Cry 2, Syndicate, and Rage a good game is held back by stupid issues that can be solved with a few simple tweaks. I enjoy fixing issues in PC ports, so I may be biased, but Hell's Highway is one of my favorite games of the last eight years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have played the previous brothers in arms then this one will be a treat for you. It brings in the other stories from the previous ones and puts them all together in this one. It has gameplay that can get repetitive after awhile until you learn how to flank your enemy. You are in command of a squad the through the game and you have to direct them in a way that wont get them or you killed. You use strategy and timing to kill the enemy. The story was impressive. The graphics were very well done and great to look at. The cut-scenes were long and enjoyable to watch. The Multiplayer is still active but very small. The game is very well done and I really enjoyed it all the way to the end. If your into FPS and enjoyed the previous Brothers in arms then dont pass this one up when you see it on sale. It was awesome for me and I know you'll enjoy it too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never really got into the first 2 BiA games, but somehow this one managed to keep me entertained the whole way through. Maybe it's because of Dutch setting, maybe because of the WWII setting, I really can't tell. It's not just your average first person shooter. You actually control teams that you have to set up strategically in order to advance. I know the first games had the same gameplay mechanics, but, again, I enjoyed it way more in this game than the previous BiA games. The story is ok, nothing special. And the graphics are a bit dated. The sound is good though, as well as the gameplay. I had a great time with this, even though it was a bit short (took me about 7-7,5 hours to complete). Despite that, grab it and give it a try. You might be surprised.[Rating: 82/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was better than I thought.The whole squad control thing didnt interest me at first, but the way you control your 1-3 units is just a two button execution. One to toggle between the teams and one to execute a order which are dynamic depending on what you are looking at. If you aim at cover, they move there, if you aim at enemies they shoot and if they are close enough they will use hand granades as well. Suppress, advance, flank and kill is the most common tactic. Every enemy has a icon over their general location which makes giving orders easy. While the enemy icon is red, they are a threat and can easly shoot you. If the icon are gray, they are supressed and you have a easier time advancing... and so on.The gameplay is great, fun and works fine. The story is trying to be like the HBO series Band of Brothers, but considering the shorter time a game has to tell such a story it becomes very cheesy.I would recommend it if it goes on sale again.

												I am a WWII game buff so this obviously fit my criteria.  This is a worthy successor to the prior BIA installments.  It has a different sort of gameplay (i.e. squad based) than any other FPS WWII games which makes it unique.  Its squad control gameplay has limitations but also has advantages and the change of pace can be refreshing.  I recommend this for WWII FPS buffs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has always been one of my favorite games. I don't really care for FPS's. They're all the same (*cough* COD). But Hell's Highway had me hooked from the start. It feels authentic...well...not that I've been to war. Authentic like playing Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. If you're somewhat of a history buff, this is for you. Leave Call of Duty and Battlefield to the children who only care about mindless violence and explosions. Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway doesn't rely on the same cookie cutter gimmicks. It's a great experience. Don't miss it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was in the mood for a world war 2 shooter, since nowadays those are surprisingly rare. I read reviews on Steam and Metacritic to see what was popular and Hell's Highway came up.After beating the game I am still not entirely sure if the game deserves a recommendation or not.For starters, the game has some glaring errors in historical accuracy, such as German 88's firing at Sherman tanks at point blank range and failing to penetrate or a single such Sherman tank rolling through hundreds of men, tanks and 88's (for some reason there are no other antitank guns in this game, just the 88 anti-air -guns) with ease. The graphics (originally designed for the Xbox 360) are obviously dated, with character models warping and distorting uncomfortably and facial animation all but missing entirely. The voice acting is lackluster to say the least, ambients sounds are often missing, weapons sound muted and dull and even the music seems to be oddly off-key in few points (though this part might just be my lack of knowledge showing through). All in all, the game's audiovisual presentation is pretty terrible. Even the ragdoll physics are glitchy as heck (I shot a german soldier in the head and he jumped 50 meters in the air as he died)!So far, then, this seems like a no-brainer: an ugly game with bad audiovisual design through and through.And then we get to the gameplay, and here I find myself intrigued. You are acting as a squad leader for most of the game, and that means you cannot just charge the enemy Call of Duty -style, but have to order around your fireteams (up to three at a time, ranging from machine gun team to base of fire team to bazooka team to assault team), setting them up in cover, assigning them targets to suppress and maneuvering them to outflank the enemy. The levels offer a sometimes surprising amount of freedom in how much you can maneuver and the system feels surprisingly good most of the time. I especially enjoyed the frantic tension of emerging into a new area only to observe a german squad marching across a field, ordering my men into position and then watching the enemy spread out into cover as the shooting starts. The enemy AI is also surprisingly good, acting surprised where appropriate, falling back and regrouping into better positions as they are overrun our outflanked and generally putting up a good fight.And then the game shoots itself in the foot again. Several times I had the AI completely glitch out, with my machinegun team or bazooka team simply freezing in place and refusing to move, getting stuck in walls or cover and such. The game hands you a sniper rifle on a few occasions, which immediately results in you, single handedly, gunning down literally dozens of germans within a minute or two, utterly breaking any immersion the game might have had so far. The tone of the game is all over the place, and then, in the end credits, comes the final straw. The story ends on a minor cliffhanger with ""To Be Continued"" -emblazoned on the screen. This game came out in 2008. I played it in 2016. There are no sequels, and likely never will be.Game Over.Playtime: 8+ hours (single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 5Audio: 5Story: 7Gameplay: 8Overall: 7			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hell's Highway is a decent game, but its problems really stood out to me:* Campaign is fairly short and underwhelming, and the levels are repetitive.* Enemy AI is dumb and predictable, not much challenge other than they can kill you easily.* Controls and cover system are CLUNKY.* I found myself not using most of the features in the game, such as the strategic map.Overall it's decent if you want a WW2 shooter to kill time with, but feels very dated for a game by a major developer/publisher in 2008, and I'm not sure how it's got such good reviews.

												The whole BIA series is definitely worth a look if you are into first person tactical shooters.  You command a squad of soldiers during WWII in a series of engagements, wrapped in a story thats told welll with excellent voice acting.  It feels more like interactive drama, which for me is a good thing.  If you are into the story aspect of the game, you should consider starting with RTH40, the EIB, then this title.  HH is a big graphical leap forward and a joy to play.  Recommend the whole series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, I'm gonna start with this, It's a good game but it does not have a skirmish mode like Earned in Blood did which is a big negative point for me.Instead of upgrading their games, they downgrade it, like EA Games with their Battlefield games, no more mod support and no more bots.You are supposed to upgrade your game, make it playable for more people (bots, skirmishes, more replay ability) but they're doing the total opposite like almost every modern developers.Too lazy to do sh**.It's a good game, If it would have more content, bots and a skirmish mode I'd be giving it something like 8/10 but because of that reason I am giving it a 6/10The kind of game you'll play once and then probably never touch again, that or maybe that you'll play it once every 2 - 4 years.

The trilogy game of the Brothers in Arms franchise.After playing Earned in Blood, I wasn't really excited to play this game. But holy f*ck was I impressed.The gameplay was finally changed for-the-better. Throwing your squad around and fighting was much easier. The cutscenes, storyline, everything was very simple but also fun/challenging!This game almost feels, like a very outdated Max Payne 3; you're required to take cover most of the time, run around and do trick shots.It even goes all Sniper Elite/Max Payne when you do a critical headshot, with bullet-time, slow motion, gore and everything!If you haven't played the other games, this one starts by giving you a good backstory and where it all ended to start this game, which is very helpful for character interaction.Honestly, I'm very impressed. Highly recommend!9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic little game which essentially rolls into a full ""whack a mole"" corridor quest once you get the hang of it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though, because some times its exactly what the doctor ordered. Skip the cut scenes and go straight to the game, there's cheats you can apply that will unlock all the levels so you don't have to go through the tedium of the story.  I'm a huge fan of shooters and their relative mechanics and this one is a surprisingly satisfying reload given its age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is basically a huge long BS dramatization of war. It's kind of fun for what it is, the squad control and gameplay is more or less OK, but you have to sit through these long, unskippable overly dramatic story sequences between every mission. This is the kind of game you buy when you're 12 years old and still think war is cool, where you almost singlehandedly go around killing hordes of hapless germans soldiers, and that was on the hardest diffuculty.I threw up in my mouth a little when I saw how the M4 sherman was modeled, and the tank missions are hilariously stupid. Also for some reason the enemy tanks and flak 88s can't hurt you. You can just stand there looking at them, in the middle of a field less than 50 meters away with no cover, and they will fire at your repeatedly, missing over and over again.If you have any actual interest in the history or knowledge of world war two, stay away, this game will just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. If you just like killin' nazis by the score then this game is sort of ok. If it's on sale. I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another shiiiitty console port. Just some of the things that happend to me: Your squads randomly stop shooting, miss the covers, etc. They choose a wrong path and run in front of the enemy. Enemy kills you behind solid cover over and over again. Hitscan is one of the worst i've ever seen in a FPS. Same reticle, same pixel, sometimes you hit the enemy, sometimes not. Glitches and bad checkpoints everywhere. Had to restart all over in 2 different chapters because a door didnt opened after finising all the objetives.Dont buy this crap console ports, just play it in console.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not as bad as the previous ones, but pretty much the same.The whole game (series) is based on the same principle: flanking. So the idea is your aim is deliberately extremely poor and you have to give orders for your squad to create cover fire while you go around the buildings or whatever to shoot the enemy in the back.The idea is boring and terribly repetitive and it's a very bad FPS, with all the mistakes a bad FPS could make: you can miss a shot even if the crosshair is on target, bad gameplay feel and viewport, clumsy controls, very bad map hit boxes, small obvious maps without any surprises...I really wanted to play a WW2 FPS, was bitterly disappointed.

												Game isn't well executed. The cover system is quirky, the suppression mechanic looked interesting but just encourage mindless and quickly boring shoot-outs from cover to cover until you can hope to eliminate the enemy.Bullets you shot will sometimes kill the enemy, most often not. Just spray your bullets until the opposition fall silent. Aiming doesn't guarantee you a hit with that suppression mechanic. Just spray bullets. Which is fine when you fire to suppress. Which is less when you are carefully shooting and it matters not.Finally, keybinds kept reverting *during play* to default setting. Or sometimes you start running forward or jump over obstacles. Which is always fun in front of the krauts when you have to restart the whole firefight because you just died.The game is mediocre. It isn't particularly bad but it isn't worth your money unless you get it very cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the two before this... played the first episode of this game and here's the thing:Road to Hill 30Earned in blood- You could set up the controls for these games for your controller easily using a software like joy2key- Now, unless you have the PS4 v2 controller (which I have or some high varient) but not PS3 or, PS4 v1 (latter due to bluetooth only) - you can not set your controller because they've given controls for you that are completely awful and bare no resemblence to more common controls such as Call of Duty - with the DS4 however you can change this but I must have spent atleast 15 minutes pulling me out of the game.- Aiming, most of the time you're going to find yourself wanting to be in cover, unlike the previous within the franchise - you can no longer aiming down a scope behind cover, there's no crouch button so must rely on the 3rd person, you get the unrealistic feel that Band Of Brother's had the franchise of almost giving you a full realism - atleast closer than any other WW2.- Another notable aspect of Band of Brothers - NO HEALTH REVIVE, which really did make the game glorious, it gave you a reason to play as you would in warfare, okay - if you messed up bad, you get the option to gain a full health and ammo restock if you died 3 times at a point which you didn't have to take and they emphasised the principle that ""wars not fair but games shouldn't have to be"" giving you that serious outlook... it's to be respected if you like these kind of games. What they've done in this game of-course is make it easy giving you a revive. :/- Easy, easy, easy - I can't go on authentic mode, so I'm stuck on veteran - but I find myself running into a room with 2 germans shooting me with mp40s... I had my thompson and took care of them when they both got the first shot - FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL GAME, you had to 1 option in the first game - flank, in the second game two options - flank or pray you hit while you peak out of cover for a moment because they made flanking harder (you had to take off maybe 1 guy in a group before trying to flank). This is it's just like meh, (to crew) come along guys... ""zzzzzzzzz"" oh I left you behind ""waits for them to catch up"" because they serve no real use in this game - they're meant to draw fire away from you.- Completely hate how they removed features of the old game and threw in new ones in a clunky way - when I order my team to attack, it's instant for them whereas for me it's proper clunky, I can't use the button to aim while I'm in cover but have to move the analogue up? ""Wrong"".- There seems to be no way to cancel your command either WHICH IS A MASSIVE NO... if you're going to tell you're team to shoot someone and they die - you need to cancel your command or you end up having you angle your camera at them ""while getting shot"" to direct them where they already are... This game doesn't let you see the controls at all on a screen. I still can't believe there are people who make games who don't allow you to set up controls to the way you like - that needs to die. If there is a way to cancel command they're hiding it pretty well.- Enemies can be shot behind cover so easily they shouldn't call this ""Brothers In Arms""... You basically depended on open shots only... vise versa for the enemy except at the later game - you could still hit but you're always at a major risk of getting shot if the enemy lines up on you. YOU HAD TO BE PATIENT AND IT WAS WORTH THE REWARD - YOU BECOME A TOP PLAYER. THIS FRANCHISE TRAINED ME IN MANY OTHER GAMES - completely lost the ability to role through that here and reading the other comments they all say it's about the same the whole way through.What band of brothers should have done:Made the AI smarter and not dumber trying to appeal to the ""easy crowd""... If the AI realises they're being flanked/in a cross fire... they try to pull back to where you'd progress in the game and situate with the next german's - you see this in earned in blood adding a challenge to get the enemy before they seek cover but this only really applied to MG42, 88mm users and Anti-tank gun users. AI could also try to look for better cover. What I see now - ""ohh we caught them by suprise, yeah they're just going to trapes this way knowing that Allies are in the area by the captain obvious plans in the sky dropping troops""... I couldn't take any of that for real.Allow you a slight choice of weapons at the start - obviously you don't want the list or you'd always pick the sniper rifle - but like - do you want ""M1 Garand or M1 Carbine"", do you want ""The thompson or the Bar"", do you want ""The pistol or 1 a law with 2 rounds""? which would make it great if the game was good enough for a second play through (ie; for authentic).The odd enemy grenade drop would be nice.I wasn't a fan of the ""no ammo restockable for US weapons"" in Road to hill 30 nor the ""infinite ammo from team"" in earned in blood... It should have come down to - ammo is scarse in the game but if you found a random/rare dead US soldier - you could take the ammo, or a random drive-by soldier in a jeep handing out ammo along the way... - 1 flare that will mark a supply drop some point in the game where you can refill ""infinitely but the crate will stay there""The lack of a melee button despite you never needed it apart from that 1 very rare time you killed 2 enemies with your thompson and that last one is really injured trying to reload his K-98 it would be quicker to hit him that reload yourself (vise versa).SPOILER FOR ""Earned in blood"" below (then again, I'm guessing people have played it or won't bother playing it if they're here)Baker vs Red - they killed the story when they gave away the twist at the beginning - stopping people from wanting to play and heck - doesn't an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like Red normally die in these stories? The judgemental got at the person who succeeds rather than who promoted them (despite baker seemed to have a much harder time getting the tanks ALONE vs Red who had 6 guys with him on road 30 which was an absolutely terrible decision Hill 30 should have been over-run with 2 people defending the trench) That poor judgement in and of itself is meant to say ""this character is going to die and there will be a heartwarming moment at the end where he realises baker got him wrong"". - That whole idea may seem corny, but it reflects real life which is what the game was trying to aim at to begin with (till this one), whatever your taste, baker easily getting mowed down was far from what Baker really way.So yeah, I honestly wanted to like it, but this is just going to be difficult to finish - if I have the time, when I have other games I can play... so yeah. 5.5/10 since it's not a realistic game (lost it's category) and it barely performs like a mainstream game like it basically sells itself as. (5.5/10 is ""okay you can buy this but plenty of other ways to spend your money"")Please kick out whoever is taking away the Band of Brothers feel Ubisoft from the team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a decent tactical fps game. Pros: Excellent realistic gun sounds, actions and graphics.         Multiple ways to complete each map         Good graphics and gore.          Good story with well developed charactersCons: Short Missions, maps and overall campaign          Foolish enemy and party AI          Overall very easy especially tank missions          Common long cutscenes  In the end its a slick short game with some cool indoor and outdoor set pieces. The graphics are great and the gunplay is the best part. There is a tactical element that can be completely bypassed due to dumb friendly and enemy AI (You can just kill everything yourself). The story was enguaging and had some good characters. I was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that it ended so fast and with such and ez last mission.If only it had twice as much content with twice the scale of enemies this game would be more enjoyable. I wished the maps would extend way further but they just end. So it takes like 6-8 hours to beat compaign and thats with 2 hours of cutscenes (which are well done). So you have roughly 4-5 hours of gameplay and kill about 100 germans with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unrealistic hollywood Wehrmacht AI where they run away like cowards, dont know what panzershrechs are, send infantry at tanks, dont flank and overall do stupid unrealistic♥♥♥♥♥♥ If they where russian, some of the actions like mass infantry rushes in the open would of made sense. Im suprised there wasnt some overtly evil enemy ss officer who killed jews,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥women and tortured people. It would of fit right in line with holywood enemy AI lol.This game is a good example of when gaming shifted to casual audiences for accecibility. Series where completely changed and milked for greed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just do not like this franchise at all. Hell’s highway’s story is competent and in my opinion it is the best story in the franchise but that’s not saying much. I did like the increase in production value, it’s nothing impressive but it gets the job done and the presentation overall is much better than the previous two. The gameplay however is so generic that it’s sad. Even though I didn’t like the gameplay in the first two they removed pretty much everything that made the gameplay somewhat unique. They added a very bland cover system and regenerating health. The shots you take from cover are on point now so you never have to use your squad because you are a one man army, even on the higher difficulties. Peek from cover, kill about 2 enemies with headshots then get back into cover and regen your health, that’s the game in a nutshell. This honestly would have been fine though if the shooting was actually satisfying but it’s just not. In the first two games they made the gameplay so you couldn’t hit anything with your gun so the game forced you to use your squad to help take out the enemies. In this game you see all the enemies with the third person cover and you are practically a sniper when you peek out from cover killing anything In your way so your squad is practically useless. This game is just a very bad experience and it’s a very boring one too. The decent story and budget increase is pretty much the only redeeming qualities of this game. 3/10 (Bad)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												it's not bad, but I would say brothers in arms franchise do not live upto classic call of duty nor medal of honor standard. Let me begin with good aspect of the title. The music is great. The writings aren't bad. The fluency of using both FPS and TPS system is great. You get a flow of  movement in action without any awkward control nor movement unlike many other attempted titles suffer from. The title is more action oriented which I'm very glad to see. and the graphics are pretty nice. Unlike the other two titles, this title aged very well. and that's about it. The recoil and shooting experience actually feel less authentic compared to the previous titles. The weapons are still less accurate, but has less recoil. Not a smart decision. While it is trying very hard to impress and attach emotions to chracters, it feels too short to be attached. and it's been like this throughout whole franchise and this title is trying the most. I feel like I was more attached to chracters in call of duty like Pvt Elder when stealing a car. He died the next mission? dang I liked that guy. Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The mission designs are too linear. I do appreciate how dev developed suppressing fire and morale system have developed, but they should have not used it as a core mechanic. For almost all missions, you order your men to suppress an enemy behind cover, and you get to become a hero by flanking and kill the rest of enemies. Or send other squad to flank them. Because dev wanted to force players to use flanking tactic, you will very less likely to snipe enemies from cover. The game actually prevents you from doing it unless there are only one or two enemies left. Also you are on the offense side most of the time. Enemies on defense will very less likely to move out of cover or even try to reposition. They will wait to be flanked. The movement feels like you are stuck in the ground as if you are dragging a 10lb chain along with you or something. The terrains are pretty much flat. Very little variation in hills. Not much of indoor battles which is very different design from medal of honor and call of duty. Sure it is not like shootem up style, more focused on tactic, but there should have been more tactic other than flanking.oh and what is up with eyes? They are some sparkling stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphics are great but this installment in the series is honestly a step backwards. It feels dumbed down and more ""Call of Duty""-esque compared to the previous titles. The health system is absolutely ridiculous. It seems to calculate an average of volume of fire directed towards you instead of actual hits. This leads to strange situations where you are completely behind cover but can still be killed. Also actual combat is nowhere near as satisfying. One of the great things about the previous titles was that shooting someone was actually a challenge. It felt very realistic. This title scrapped that and went with your typical FPS style combat where you are basically 100% accurate 100% of the time. If you were a fan of the series before you will likely be very disappointed. It definitely feels very arcadey now. 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really disappointing. I simply do not understand what the idea behind this game was. Basically, you spend 75% of the time watching videos... Most of the times, including small video scenes adds good value to a game. However, in this game the time you wait to actually play is completely ridiculous. If I want to watch a movie, then you do that...you don't go searching for a game…Great games don’t need a “small movie” every two steps to create a story-line...On top of that, graphics aren't so good (Compared with other games released during/about the same period), movement is not much better, when you are inside of a building it is difficult to see the enemies or even ascertain whether they are in fact enemies or not, and a big Etc...If you are looking for a ""blast from the past"", do yourself a favor and keep looking… ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly,this game was suppost to be awesome when Gearbox announced back in 2006 with the teaser and the first demonstration.They were only to publish the game and honestly this is big bull crap filled with poor cutscenes and it feels more like you are watching some bad World War Two production with no realism.There are very few new mechanics in the gameplay which are good but turn the game easier and surreal...also the tank battles can no longer let you control your tank and one to two squad units,like used to have on Brothers in Arms : Road to Hill 30.Plus the game runs really bad,the requirements posted everywhere is a big fake statement.This game will run baddly even if you have Core 2 Duo 2.4ghz-2.6ghz or NVdia series 9xxx.Changing the settings to lowest qualities won't make a difference and there are no configuration to change between directX.The game doesn't present neither the option to turn off shadows and Field of View is limited.If you have played the first Brother's in Arms and wanted to see how would continue the story of Matt Baker,is better you keep watching videos instead getting this game tho.I have my retail copy of BIA: Road to Hill 30 and I still think that game is way better.

												If you want to play Brothers in Arms just play this. Unless they rerelease the older ones and fix some mechanical issues with the games and flesh them out more this is pretty much the best BIA game.  Thats not saying much as this game screams bargain bin abysmal. It is lacking serious polish and there are points in the game where Im left asking ""Is something wrong, wheres the rest of the game?"" Especially common with sounds and facial animations. Things will be happening and there are either no sounds for them or the sounds are not correct or are so off.Shooting dousn't feel great and feels pretty vanilla if that makes sense, the voice actors are pretty terrible but atleast they have a real sound crew doing the tech work in this one (unlike the first game where it wasn't unheard of to have VO redline/sound awfull). But they still sound like crap because the actors suck. Story can be pretty confusing and fragmented in weird ways aswell. Its basically a cheap bargain bin WW2 game that. Thats BIA. I feel like for the BIA games they just copied mechanics of other better games and especially when they were popular. When Socom/Freedom Fighters and COD were popular they made the first two games, when Gears of War and shoulder high walls became popular they put that into the game. But honestly the cover mechanics make this game better, one of the issues in earlier games was that you couldn't go third person and get a feel for whats going on very quickly, so you could either look at a wall then pop out or risk being shot and just stand there.The damage system is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I don't think you need to get shot to get hurt, but its so terrible I can't describe it. You regen health though but its not like that makes it better. You have to hit the enemies and work to get shots to hit their mark but they can just spray all over the place and still hit you.AI is terrible, especially friendly AI. They either path in the way of fire or they decide to run around like headless chickens even though you gave the order to stay where they were. Its about on level with Road to Hill 30 give or take.I would say the game as a whole objectively and as a game is better than Road to Hill 30. Its atleast easy to shoot people once you learn the system, and its otherwise given a bit more polish. Unfortunately its still not a polished game and is only a bit better in general than the older ones but its that extra bit that makes it a playable and enjoyable video game. BIA is a bargain bin series, which is unfortunate as there are points that you can see a gleam of something great shine through in production or writing, but then it falls apart when a character is looking at you with a look that makes you think hes holding back maniacal laughter right after a character died.  Its this kind of stuff that makes it impossible to care about anything in this game aside from the base combat. Also your squad can die, but they respawn at the next check point, which also makes you not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about characters since they die over and over and over until they die in the story. They also tried some weird F.E.A.R. like situations where its supposed to be spooky but its just stupid and the enemy AI and gun play show themselves as terrible when compared to FEAR (which is one of the best FPS in terms of gunplay and especially AI). Man,  I don't recommend this game, but if you want to play a BIA game this is the one you ought to. Its still pretty below average though but its not as terrible as the older ones.If they remade the games they could easily make them great though. Add some more polish and make the existing systems make logical sense. It wouldn't take a terribly large amount of work to make Hill 30 into a great game but it would take money. Which is fairly obvious with these games they didn't want to spend money, they wanted to put out something quick that would make a profit off current trends then move on.For what its worth I kinda like it. Not enough games let you command units whilst directly controlling your own character. But its certaintly not a objectively and mechanicly good game. Its okay at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10 minutes of cinematics, 3 minutes of gameplay, 10 minutes of cinematics, 30 seconds of gameplay, 1 minute of cinematics. Did I buy a movie or a game?Bought this game hoping for a Call of Duty 3 level of polish but the animations were very rough. The squad based combat and positioning is an interesting idea, but is more tedious than it needs to be. The iron sights are either made to be realistic or were poorly implemented. There is no sound that is made when you take damage, you just see more and more raspberry jam until you die. Cover is either ineffective or the AI has amazing aim, I once had only a tiny bit of my body poking out and they hit that spot every time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
