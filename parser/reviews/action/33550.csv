												I'm not entirely sure why the other reviews for this game say that this game is bad. While yes the four starting characters are a bit odd they make very little difference as to what you can achieve in this game. If you like being able to do whatever you want whenenver you want as a mage then this game is simply amazing. Want to be an evil Necromancer and go on a rampage in town turning the people you kill into mindless fodder then go right ahead. Want to be an Air mage calling down lightining on your foes then by all means do it. There are Twelve seperate schools of magic each with there own spells and passive's. Or you can go the way of the warrior and bash your foes heads in with a myriad of weapons. Plus the spells that you chose to specialize in change the way that your character looks and provide passive buffs and debuffs of their own.			",151,15,0,31,18,0,16

												Normally I dont think graphics are the most important aspect of a video game. In this case they are so bad they actually detract from the experience. Absolutely atrocious. Games much older look a great deal better, Torchlight and Titan Quest pop to mind immediately. Time of Shadows cant even display correctly. In widescreen everything looks stretched and weird. In fullscreen everything looks squished and weird. Animations are horrible. Textures are chunky. The lighting is worse than Unreal and Quake 3. The gameplay itself is rotten. Abilities are unimpressive and its difficult to fight thanks to poor controls. Too many useless idiots filling up the screen. Plot and storytelling are lousy. Dialog is lame. Audio is poor quality.Stay away. Theres much better in the hack'n'slash genre. If you are super bored, go mow your lawn or take up flower arranging. This is just a waste of time.

												I find this game new and inventive on its methods. I like it and its open world even better. I do recommend using the tutorial to learn how to play it.			",59,47,0,66,4,0,17

												A diablo-esque 3rd person overhead RPG.  The graphics are outdated.  But the game has some really neat features.  You can kill anyone, including townspeople.  Leave area and hostility is gone.  Also your highest level spell in a category transforms a part of your characters body.  This means your character will be a hideously deformed freak.  This explains why they have such classic character choices as ""the bakers wife"" (a fat middle aged woman).  It is worth 20 bucks if you can dedicate the time to justify that price.  I paid 10 bucks.  Well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really don't know what to say about this game. It's like a cheap, broken version of diablo. I honestly don't really mind some of the wierd textures and bad voice acting too much, and honestly, I had fun playing this game. For ten dollars (or free in my case) it's not too bad. If you want the game (unless you're sitting on fat stacks of cash) you should probably wait for a steam sale because though it  is interesting enough to play, it's definatly not something you would absolutly need  in your steam library right away. Also no trading cards...			",101,20,0,14,5,2,12
