												When I say that I'd reccomend this game it's only to a small niche of people. Because I happen to fall in the niche I rather liked Universe Sandbox, though I can see where many people woud not. Universe Sandbox is pretty self explanatory in the title, its a astrophysics sandbox in which you can create and destroy solar systems, galaxys, or even galaxy clusters (if your computer is beefy enough) Many stats and attributes are tracked as you simulate the astral dance of heavenly bodies.         Things like density, spin, velocity, mass, and heat are all tracked and simulated to give you the most realistic expierience possible. Unfortunately, it doesnt get very realistic. My biggest gripe I would suppose is the physics. The game uses Eular math, or if you have a processing power Runge Kata. But eventually stable orbits will do someting completely random, sending a few planets and stars on random vectors straight out if your little ""pitri dish"". This doesnt bother me too much because it mostly only happens when it comes to simulating galaxies. On the solar system level it does quite well and it has enough options to accomodate nearly any computer's processing power. That is, if you can navigate the menus.           Theres lots of options and statistics for every celestial body and you can edit every fascet. the problem is, this creates a very confusing series of menus, with confusing abbreviations and volcabulary if you're not already familiar with scientific notation and units of measurement. If the menus were a bit more friendly I think it would open up this game to alot more people. The actual simulation field can be a bother to wrangle too. I found it sometimes likes to snap focus to nearly every other celestial body but the one I want to focus on. The ""searchbar"" at the top ended up being my best friend.          If youre like me, and you can wrangle the menus and put up with the sometimes sketchy simulation, it truely is a universe at your fingertips. This simulator will only take you as far as your imagination (or processor) will take you. Binary systems, rings around Earth -- have you ever wondered what it would look like if the earth had a ring then the moon crashed through it?  The possiblities are more or less limitless, given your computer can handle the math. If youre into astronomy, physics or just enjoy space to any degree, this game is worth checking out.         Without an actual objectives or things to accomplish, this game falls short of actually being a game. It would be better described as an app. This one probably isnt right for the masses, but just right for the armchair astronomer in me.			",134,11,7,12,23,2,13

												Universe Sandbox is exactly what its name implies: a place for you to play around with astronomical bodies and see how changing various things will effect the macro-universe. I think it is one of the most unique and awesome titles on Steam. It is well put together, the physics in the game accurately demonstrate real-life laws, and the recent update that puts you directly into a tutorial the first time you start the game really helps you figure out the, at first intimidating amount of, options that you can play around with.Whether for work, play, or educational purposes, Universe Sandbox is an excellent title that I don't think any Steam account should lack. If you have *any* interest, even a minute amount, in astronomy, physics, or even if you ever wondered what would happen to Saturn's rings if Neptune flew too close, you need to have this game. It's very relaxing to play with, and the the engine is extremely deep - allowing you to truly let your imagination run wild. The GUI is clean and efficient, and the pre-built simulations and environments are extremely well put together and fun to play with.  Some examples include:*Environments:*Our Solar SystemLocal GalaxiesEarth & MoonSaturn & Moons*Physics Playgrounds:*Small Scale GravityFloating MoonsGalaxy CollisionBuy now, build your own galaxy or satellite system, and watch what happens as time passes and you introduce variables into the equation.*Bonus:* You can smash an asteroid into Earth to see what would happen, awesome for those bad days at the office.

												Universe Sandbox isn't a game per se; there are no bosses, aims or levels, merely an accurate model of astronomical bodies for you to fiddle with. It's really more of a toy – the virtual equivalent of a configurable orrery, except hugely more complex than any mechanical system.That complexity is one of the key attractions that Universe Sandbox possesses. Using the vast range of variables and tools at your disposal you can create some enormously convoluted displays of physics, bending cosmic laws to your will out of nothing more than a desire to see pretty patterns form on your screen.There are a series of example experiments to help ease you into the level of curiosity that Universe Sandbox requires – each one acting as a tutorial – but the real fun lies in creating your own simulations. The camera is a little fiddly at times, but my biggest complaint is that the simulator doesn’t come with any sound or music. While I appreciate that’s realistic, given the lack of orchestras in the vacuum of space, it would have been nice to have some ambient music quietly twinkling away in the background.Still, it’s hard to get too dissatisfied with Universe Sandbox when you factor in both the fact that it’s a one-man labour of love and that it’s available at a bargain price. If nothing else it offers something uniquely interesting and fun, which is quick to inspire imagination and creativity, even if it lacks the educational aspect that you might expect.

												A perfect game made for the space lover. The best place to expirement on things, on a truely colossal scale. For what it is supposed to be, the Universe Sandbox exceeds all expectations. Except for the occasional glitch, it stays by its standards. But as the name suggests, this game isn't ""fun"" for everyone. It depends on how you define the word and where your interests truly lie. If you're just that only-action kind of a gamer, this stuff ain't for you. But if you appreciate the Physics and the Science around you, then there you go, you got yourself a new best friend who is open to sharing knowledge about the story that branched into infinite other stories.

												What I love most about Universe Sandbox is how it let's you separate the wheat from the chaff on your Steam Friends list: 1. People who accuse you of cheating because you appear to be 'playing' Universe Sandbox at the same time as another game (or while away from the keyboard) clearly don't know what Universe Sandbox is.2. People who get the One Hour, One Day, One Month, and One Year achievements on the same day aren't really being all that clever with their hax.Watching planets careen about like balls on a billiards table is pretty fun, too.

												Universe Sandbox is a Simulation/Physics game. They have nailed down velocity,rotation,physics and speed in the game. You will find it confusing at first but I suggest you do their tutorials. There are achievements aswell as badges. You can play around by making,sharing, using and testing galaxy's and planets. They have every star to planet, every asteroid to galaxy. Thereis much to do but I cant explain it all. I hope you get Universe Sandbox, and please rate up my quick review. ",89,9,0,6,10,2,3

												Before my first contact with this game, I had a life, a wife, two kids, a nice house and also a car. Then, I met Universe Sandbox. This game was exactly what I needed to be happy. I am a new guy now. My undies are always brown as I am so addicted that I can't leave my chair. My house has trash and rotten food all over the floor because I can't stop playing this. I am not sure, but looks like my wife went away with my children and my car. I am all by myself now. No time to care about this, tho. This is the most amazing sandbox game ever made. I am still looking for the sand, tho. 2,222 hours in and no sand yet. But I hope it will appear someday. I will keep looking for it.It's the best game ever made. The whole mankind needs to know about this masterpiece. It's a huge universe building tool where you can even make planets crash and bring disaster and death everywhere. This is what I call bloody. If you think that The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 are the best games ever made, go learn a bit more about games and figure out that Universe Sandbox is the ultimate masterpiece. It's better than sex.I still wonder where the sand is. 10/10 Would ruin my whole life again. No Regrets.*It's not serious, in case you are wondering*The game is pretty fun. Worth buying.

												This is one of those meta-sim-sandbox-edu-tutorial-discovery games that are so common these days, but it's still tough to explain what you can actually DO, if not what it actually IS, so let me try to explain with a brief anecdote.   Years ago, my kids wanted a dog.  They begged for some unspecified period of time, until one day we were driving along and saw a 'free puppy' sign at a farm.  We stopped, and wound up taking home what the farmer told us was a 'purebred Welsh Olive Hound'.  Thing is, when we took it to the vet for shots, we found out it was actually a toaster oven.     I guess what I'm trying to say is that Universe Sandbox looks like a game, but it's a lot more like a toaster oven.  Everyone should have one, but it won't be fetching you any sticks.

												If you are into sandbox style simulations, this is the game for you. This game allows you to create different scenarios and even create interesting things in space. The game does seem to be a bit complex in some areas but just because I couldn't get a hang on it, doesnt't mean everyone wont. One of my personal favorite scenarios to play out in it was to simulate the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy that is projected to happen in a few billion years.Graphics: 8 - Simple simulation modelSound: 8 - Interesting soundsGameplay: 9 - Game mechanics are interesting, learning curveStory: 6 - Not much of one, just have fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a wonderful simulator, anyone with an interest in space, astronomy, or just wants to watch mercury whiz around the sun should certainly consider picking this up. The UI is cumbersome at first and it will take some getting used to, they have done well to hide most of the complexity slightly out of sight until you look for it which certainly helps ease you into it. For what it does and what it offers, it's exactly what it claims to be and I can't help but commend the design team for it and recommend others to try it. All negative reviews I've seen either had technical issues with it, or were clearly expecting something different. I also don't get why people keep saying it's not a game, it doesn't even claim to be one... doesn't mean you can't have fun in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is way more fun than it should be for what basically is a detailed space-physics simulator. There's just something really satisfying about causing predictable chaos and watching it unfold the way it is supposed to. If you're still in school you might even be able to convince people that you're studying.I know it's a sandbox, but it would have been nice to have a little guidance to sort of point players in the right direction. Instead of some of the (rather pointless and grindy) achievements, it would have been great if the devs would have added some achievements or in-game goals that guided players towards discovering some of the cool things that happen when you mess around with the universe in specific ways.

												A little late of a review but, it needs said.This 'game' is a nifty concept.  That's the end of the positive.The programming relies on too many crutches and flat out amature hacks which leaves the program barely stable.  A brief search online easily shows the sheer volume of people having problems.  Despite this, there will be NO fixes as the dev and his team are too busy working on an all new version to SELL you again!This leads to the next problem.  The dev and his team.  From late 2011 through 2012, a free copy of the next version was promised to anyone who had purchased this version.  Opening themselves to a class-action, the dev and his team have publicly announced that they will not honor their promises.  In effect they have LIED and made money off of that lie.(Shame on you Steam for allowing this.  Shame on all of you appologists for defending this kind of behavior.)Between the hack job that this game is and the disreputable behavior,  I strongly recommend that you avoid this dev!Unless of course you're the type that likes to pay for a defective product that won't be fixed and being lied to..

												Universe Sandbox as the name already implies it's a Sandbox game. Messing around with the Universe as time goes by, speeding up the circular motion of planet Earth,  heat it up, or set it back to Ice Age. All that is possible in this Game! It is all fun until you dont know what to do in it anymore, if you know your way around the Universe its masses and formulas this game will be for you, were as people with simple interest for the life above, this game might get boring really quickly as mentioned before simply because you run out of ideas on what to do. Furthermore, Universe Sandbox has tons of preset events and tutorials, thus if you dont mind reading quite a bit of text with content on how the game and the universe works you might yet still be able to turn things around in your favour and maybe learn a thing or two!

												This is so cool. Just create and see what happens and then try again until you get the right balance to make your own solar system. Or you can just load up our solar system, set it at a speed you like and just zen out and watch it like a lava lamp. The achievements are amusing too. There is a lot to take in at first but it works really well for this sandbox simulation. Every time you click a button to see what it does you get to see something really interesting happen. 100% recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is super. The physic is great. But don't buy it. Buy the Universe Sandbox² version instead, as it is the same, but updated. And you can't update your version to the new one.EDIT : Last part corrected as there's a little reduction on US1 owners. Universe Sandbox 1 is still not worth buying it however, even if it is a fantastic idea.			",18,1,0,1,4,0,1

												I created a sun and a earth orbiting it. I moved away from it by a bit and put down a tea cup and made some golf balls orbit it. I made a giant moon that the tea cup then orbited but then the moon went insane and ate the tea cup and my golf balls and then headed straight towards my sun and earth. I then quickly made the earth giant but it turned into a sun and ate the rest of my universe. 10/10 would cause the implosion of the universe again.			",181,25,2,20,35,5,8

												Judging Universe Sandbox as a distraction shows up reasonably uncalled for. There are no boss, no buffs or driving forces, no movement up structure, and no target. It's generally a material science sandbox that spotlights on doing one thing right: gravity. The begin is crucial. You place shakes in space, set differing physical properties, for example, speed, mass and thickness, then watch them whizz about while giggling with satisfaction at your control over the universe. On the off chance that you hit the nail on the head, their circle cuts a simple twist around the vacant dimness of space. What's better time is disregarding what's truly critical. Adventitiously making Earth a vague size from the Sun and pinging Mercury and Venus out past Uranus, Neptune and the Kuiper belt into the interstellar medium, for instance. Of course accidently exploding Jupiter and study the waste blueprint into a second space shake belt. The choices you have for destruction are for all intents and purposes as differentiating as the choices for development. You can essentially destroy a planet, however it's extensively all the more intriguing to detonate it into eight abnormalities. Then again 16. Then again 237. On the other hand, best of all, shred the planet and give up it as a dusty space cloud. Subsequent to stacking up a model of our adjacent planetary system, I intentionally turned each and every planet to clean, and animated time so that reliably in this present the fact of the matter was ten days in the reenactment. Mercury was the first to spread out into a ring, trailed by whatever remains of the parts of Venus, Earth and Mars. A couple of hundred years at some point later, the adjacent planetary structure was irrelevant more than a development of concentric rings of clean. Which, looking sensibly, is to some degree pitiful. Universe Sandbox's most essential accomplishment, in any case, lies in laying out how the constrain of gravity effects each and every question in all of closeness. One condition has balls, dice, golfballs and footballs circumnavigating a wide pounding down a couple pins ball. Before long, they cluster together into minimal social events like infant youngster planets. That is the thing that lifts this above most particular material science reenactments: the acclimate kept up between guaranteeing that techniques are totally tended to and in the meantime guaranteeing that the sim is enough open to get and play with. Not every single physical system is famously represented (almost the entire way in light of the way that we don't yet splendidly watch each physical technique), yet it's enough right to answer fundamental demand, for example, ""what's the most gainful approach to manage journey the Earth into the sun?"" The reply, on the off chance that you were thinking about, is to stop it dead in its circle. Moreover as with most redirections of this sort, you ought to be substance to make your own specific extraordinary times. Universe Sandbox won't portray to you a story, and it won't hold your hand past a brief instructional practice that demonstrates the interface. After that, you're in isolation in the universe, however with a heap of fansubmitted reenactments to play around with. It's significantly more fun messing about with those than making your own specific universe sans status. The camera is a little fiddly on occasion, yet my most important grievance is that the test system doesn't run with any solid or music. While I regard that is sensible, given the nonappearance of troupes in the vacuum of space, it would have been awesome to make them envelop music mindfully twinkling without end past anybody's capacity to see. Universe Sandbox isn't going to change your life. It isn't going to make you cry, and it won't sit in the most essential reason for your most-played outline in Steam for a critical long time. Regardless, on the off chance that you like the probability of a keen orrery that you can demolish detached and set back together in the way you like, and you're lively to empower it with a touch of imaginative essentialness, it's inconspicuous a superior approach than spend your cash.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

You can learn and understand the way in which our universe works to an extent you couldn't ever receive in any class, its not arcadey, but based on astronomic facts. The best place to experiment and experience things on a truely colossal scale with limitless potential. You can crash complete milky way systems by messing with the real parameters.

There are no animated surfaces or climates or anything from the second game! This game should only be 1-3 dollars!

Product received for free
												In Universe Sandbox you create universes consisting of planets, stars and galaxies. If you struggle creating a universe you can choose to run various solar system templates that can help you build your own.Starting this game for the first time I was overwhelmed with the complexity and detail the developers at Giant Army put into this simulation game, usually with the genre you see a rushed physics engine and incompletegame but this game there is no sign of that. The best thing about this game is the endless physic properties such as forcing planets to collide to see a detailed explosion. This game is a prime example whysteam has the early access system; to implement a full featured title and update it prior to the full release fixing issues and including new things.I recommend this game for anyone who loves astronomy or for people who enjoy creating things.*Please do note that I have recieved this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			",1781,682,92,194,220,23,258

												I've got to say, Universe Sandbox is unique in a lot of ways. I can't recall a single game that allows you to manipulate gravity and time so easily, though this is wasted on me. Smashing things into other things is fun c: But I digress. Universe Sandbox is a great simulator, but is it a game? You need a good deal of imagination to get any more than a few hours of fun out of this, because there are very few game mechanics involved. Can you increase the mass of the Sun and watch the effect on the solar system? Indeed! Does this do anything? Not really, it just shows you what happens.If you think you'd enjoy exploring some of the finer orbital mechanics that KSP never taught you, then you might like Universe Sandbox. I'm recommending it because it's a pretty damn good simulation, but it isn't for everyone. Aside from the few tutorials demonstrating things you could do, it's mostly... well, a sandbox! That means there's almost no reward from dumping hours into the game other than satisfying curiosity that couldn't be soothed elsewhere.			",82,16,1,21,23,0,35

In Universe Sandbox you learn about the universe through Building, destroying, and manipulating a bodies properties.You can build new universes by merging them together.You can Blow up planets, stars, moons and others.You can turn objects into blackholes. You can Create Solar Systems of your own Design from objects.And there is still so much more to do.And now Universe Sandbox 2 is coming out.So either way original or version 2 you'll have fun.Enjoy the pull of gravity.

It's exactly what it says it is, a sandbox on a universal scale, but to be used for teaching and experimentation purposes far more than simply to entertain (though perhaps some may find enjoyment over manipulating galaxies). It does an excellent job at what it attempts, but is hard to recommend to anyone but the most avid space lover for its dry and overly open ended nature.If you're still unclear what US actually is, you can think of it as playing god with stars and planets in a galaxy of your own design. You're given complete free reign over every aspect of your universe and all that's within it, allowing you to create scenarios that could never occur in reality but nonetheless I'm sure many have wondered what would look like (for example: what if the earth was the size of the sun). It's an intriguing idea with nearly limitless options, but I have to take issue with US for doing a poor job catering to anyone but those who already posses a keen understanding of the cosmos and a fascination with what they hold. Aside from a few tutorial sections that show you a few possible things you can do, you're left to create your own fun, which for some (myself included) doesn't go much farther than shooting a dozen planet size footballs into the sun and seeing what comes of it.I can't recommend Universe Sandbox to many, but it's not because it's bad or too much along the lines of taking an astronomy class. It knows what it is and gives you all the tools you could want to fool around in a galaxy, testing possible outcomes or teaching others about what exists in the vastness of space, but it will only ever appeal to a niche audience of astrophysicists and those that simply have a deep love of space. It's a tool that gives back whatever you put into it, the problem is just knowing how to use it.			",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

												Before I go into the review I must say that this game is not for everyone. If you love astronomy or astro-physics than you will love the heck out of this sim. This is personally more of a teaching tool than a ""game"". But if you have fun with anything doesn't it make it a game? You can play around simulating all wonders for hours and hours just wondering what will happen if...What if Earth had the density of the Sun? What if the Sun was just a Black hole? All this can be answered using Universe Sandbox. The game is a bit buggy because it crashes often if you spam it with certain functions or making something completly illogical or hard to process. But if you love looking at the heavens through a telescope or the naked eye and wonder how everything works there, get this...now...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first stumbled upon this ""game"" I was really happy and exicited to play it due to my fascination with space, little did I know how inaccurate and lacking depth that it was.Apparently when you launch a moon at Earth, a small white dot will appear on Earth and when you launch another Earth at Earth, the original Earth just gets bigger. I'm no physics expert, but If you're not somesort of nomark you will know that is inaccurate. I fail to see the purpose of a ""universe sandbox"" if it's not even going to use any physics to render the results of what happens when we experiment within said sandbox. Also, the sole purpose of some of the achievements are simply just to make the game seem like it has lots of content, when in reality it has little to none. ""Play X amount of days"" may indeed be considered an ""achievement"", but one that will be done legitimately by almost nobody- a truly shameful marketing tactic. Don't waste your time and money.

												This 'game' is not being worked on anymore since the developers moved on to Universe Sandbox².So in consequence there are some bugs and instabilities along with missing features. Additionally the owners of this version will still have to pay for Ubox2 when it's available.Unless you want to support the developers further I recommend waiting for Universe Sandbox², which will have much more features, is right now in closed alpha state and - according to the devs - will be public 'soon'.Update:Universe Sandbox 2 is in open alpha now. :Dhttp://universesandbox.com/2/Update #2:In case you haven't already noticed, Universe Sandbox² can be found on steam.

 Overview  Universe Sandbox is a gravity and space simulator with a heavy focus on player control, interaction and experimentation. The game allows for scale simulations of our galaxy, planets, stars, moons and those of any number of known galaxies as well. There aren't too many limitations with the game, as it has gone through several revisions over many, many years. Universe Sandbox first started out as an educational project back in or around 1993 by a single developer named Dan Dixon. The project then went through two revisions before version 2.1 was released on Steam in May of 2010 for sale.The game itself doesn't have a beginning, middle or end. There is no story to tell, no narration to follow, but that doesn't leave it feeling hollow. Universe Sandbox gives you the tools and abilities to craft your own universe, make your own planets and create something that is really all your own...or collide them together and watch them explode for the sheer reason that you can. The game leaves those decisions up to you.Not everyone will enjoy this game. I feel that it is a very niche title that might cater to those who enjoy simulation experiments, math, space enthusiasts, or those that just have an appreciation of taking something anyway from a game that is more than just fun. I originally picked up Universe Sandbox because I love space related games and I'd love to have a method to simulate what I've learned and continue to read about on my own.The meat of Universe Sandbox is based on what you make of it. When you first start, you'll be greeted by a tutorial that will show you various aspects of the game, where to go and what you can do. The tutorial felt a little minimal and I felt like it lacked depth. There are pre-defined simulations with objectives that you can play to help familiarize yourself with the UI and I felt those helped a lot. However, the overall presentation could use some polish.When it comes to actually building solar systems, crashing planets, exploding suns and or freezing the earth (take that global warming! ^_-) or any of the numerous godlike powers it's enjoyable, but I felt like it was lacking in...something. It's hard to say what that feeling was and I honestly couldn't tell you still, but building creations on a galaxy scale still felt marginal in scope. I remember building my own galaxy with planets, stars, a sun, whatever I felt it needed and when I was done, I was done. I wasn't really sure where I went from there; compare it to a model airplane. Once my model was finished, I had nothing to do. I could do another, but the outcome was the same.I wanted a model airplane I could touch; I wanted something tangible. However, Universe Sandbox is not tangible. I cannot pick it up off the shelf and admire it. That, most of all, was what I felt the game was missing. It lacked purpose. Would I recommended it? Yes, absolutely, but only to those who know what you're getting. As I mentioned earlier in this review, I feel the game caters to a small audience. Some players will hate it, some will love it and some will fall somewhere in the middle like I did.  Pros   Customization - There's an infinite amount of ways to change your simulation. Your limit is your imagination.  Tutorials - There's quite a few to help get you use to the UI and how the game functions, especially for those that don't have a lot of knowledge with space-related terms. You learn. Whether it be about the physical properties of our universe or the math behind the science, you'll come away with something new. Cons    The UI can be rather clunky when setting up experiments or simulations (other than pre-developed ones) Achievements - They are odd and will require a guide to unlock some of them. One is purely ridiculous, which requires you to run the game for an entire year (total, not in one sitting). Good luck! .-. There is no music. Some may prefer that, but I didn't care for the silence. There is no sound in space, but I felt there should have been in the game.Overall, I like Universe Sandbox. It won't tug at your heart strings, nor give you a story to tell your friends. There is no plot, there are no boss fights, no method in which to level up; there's just you, gravity and the infinite possibilities in your mind. If you like the idea of building a world, watching it wiz by the dark void of space and then finally colliding with a neighboring planet because you scaled back the mass, then Universe Sandbox might be for you. If that doesn't interest you, then I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite an interesting way to learn about the universe while expanding or destroying it. So many scenarios to choose from that educate on the consequences and effects of sending the Earth off orbit and into the sun or away from the sun to burn it up or freeze it, or throw asteroids at the Earth to destroy it. The only downside is that it may not be for everyone and may not be too much of an attention-grabber to everyone. It's a very nice experimental simulator for those who are interested in astronomy or just want to kill some time early in the morning. A bonus is that it has trading cards, but the achievements are rather difficult to get and require long dedication.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is it Possibile to Learn while Playing? [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]Ever wondered what could happen if our Sun would be 1000x bigger and we could speed up the time to be able to see thousands of years in just a few minutes?Well, apparently, some meteors will be attracted by the Sun and so all the planets of our Solar System... just to be launched at 0,1 the speed of light in the opposite direction with uneven trajectories.Ever wondered what a massime amount of meteors hitting the Earth would do? Well, apparently nothing bar some white pixels on the surface.Ehmm. No. It's so wrong on so many levels.So I guess this is not a simulation.How does it score as a game? Well, it really isn't a game. You do not have objectives to accomplish, even the achievements are dull (play for 1 year...), so you'll get bored after 30 minutes. I guess calling it a game it's just an excuse to cover its defects on the physics level.It's nice to have all those informations on planets and see them spinning around, but that's all.Best played with MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its ok for an hour of goofing around, but not really fun, or a game or much of a sandbox, doesnt even seem like a terribly deep simulator since objects  will fly off for no reason, specifically when you increase the passage of simulated time, wham bunch of balls suddenly taking off. One of the coolest things about sims is leaving them alone to grow a little and then come back and see (for example) how your Sim Earth of the year 44,000 A.D  is doing. Not gonna get that here unfortunatley. Nor do I get any of that ""wow space is big and awe inspiring"" you might expect from the title or the subject material.Plus finding out everything I did in that hour of goofing around I could have done for free on the website.... well that's just lame.

												What was a good idea at first turned out to be a very mediocre ""solar system sim"" educational game that is better off as a free CD somewhere at the back of 5th Grade Astronomy textbook. The Physics model is extremely flawed, so is the engine optimisation. Even if you have the full solar system model running in the sim, eventually Mercury will slingshot itself towards Andromeda Galaxy because, and I'm assuming here, it's actually an alien spaceship and it was performing an orbital maneuver in order to speed up (hello, Rama). That was sarcasm by the way. Anyway, In a game like this one there should be at least the ability to create your own stars/planets, and not just select pre-existing ones, a bigger variety of space objects would be welcome.You should have the ability to see the internal structure of each celestial body, just like in some of the App Store apps like StarWalk or SolarWalk. This isn't 1996, there should be many many MANY more options, including the ability to see every single man-made satellite or mission, also all of the satellites currently in orbit and proper models for them in addition to real photos/maps of each planet and star, not just links to wikipedia.As always, metacritic gives this an unfairly high score. Make no mistake, this sim is a huge disappointment. The selling point of this game is realism and the gravitational model is broken, making this piece of software as useless as a helicopter in outer space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy crap.  For an application with no goals, no formal ""game"" aspect to it at all, this is amazingly fun.  I've just gotten started and I am already compiling a massive list of ""what would happen if"" scenarios with regards to celestial physics.  I've always been a bit of an amateur astronomy nerd and Universe Sandbox plays to that predeliction, so it may not be for everyone.  As yet it's also pretty buggy.  But part of what I love so much about projects like this are the potentially sea-changing implications for educational processes.  This makes a part of science that takes centuries for humans to actually observe fully interactive over the course of a few minutes.  Gives me chills.  We live in a brave, new world my friends.

												Are you curious about how space works?  The secrets of the universe something that interests you? Or have you wanted to wield the power of a god, destroying planets and galaxies alike? If any of those are true then this is the game/ education tool for you.It’s a simple game; you get to run simulations from the minuscule to the galactic. It is a ton of fun and I learnt a few things from it too. But as you would expect I did it just to destroy planets. That being said I find it easy to recommend for anyone who wants to learn more about the universe.With a huge library of available experiments to choose from and the ability to create your own using the massive amount of custom options the game offers to you for almost everything I had a lot of fun running simulations and just relaxing.Fully priced I would have a hard time recommending this title, especially with the better and more updated sequel already on steam but on sale this is a fun little distraction that will help answer a few of those nagging questions in the back of your mind.Have fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever hated humanity so much that you wanted to burn Earth by having it consumed by a Sun with a temperature of over 90 thousand Kelvins? How about having all of humanity sucked up into a black hole? Or maybe you could make a stable universe, but then add another sun with another orbit to destroy everything. This game is very fun to mess around with, and there are many various options to choose from when editing your universe. There are also a lot of fantastic pre-saved files that are nice to explore. I highly recommend this game.WARNING: Achievement Completionists; this game has an achievement to play for One Year.			",137,13,2,12,25,3,8

												Having studied some areas of astral geology at degree level, i have concluded that the people who developed this game either had no understanding of planetary or stellar science or they significantly had to simplify it to make it work. It is still interesting however, it doesn't work on a worthwhile level. It can be used however to create interesting solar systems that don't work properly at all. This is a bit of an over-simplified pile of trash.			",38,13,1,19,21,1,50

												There is a free version ( http://universesandbox.com/  ) and this is the $10 premium version so for that reason I can't give this a thumbs up.With all due respect to Dan Dixon the creator of Universe Sandbox, its not a game, and it shouldn't be in the games section of Steam, it should be in the software and tagged as educational, you can easily imagine it being put to very good use in schools.Cool to play about with if you have a casual interest in space, but  there are plenty of similar freeware titles out there that can entertain and educate just as well.  I might have completely missed the point, but if I have to choose between playing Universe Sandbox for an hour, or watching Cosmos on the TV, I'll be sat in front of the telly.“The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.” ― Carl Sagan, Cosmos			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now that's something awesome! Sometimes the simulations can be a bit dodgy, such as showing Mercury get ejected from the solar system in 30 years, but that doesn't discredit the huge amounts of fun that you can have.TL;DR Fantastic simulation game, create your own universe! :P			",106,13,3,1,9,0,2

												I've always loved space and anything to with it, so trying out Universe Sandbox was a fun, educational experience.If you like space and the universe, physics simulators, and experimenting with different variables in space, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are great - it's your own solar system/galaxy/universe simulator, complete with stars, suns, etc. You can zoom in and out a great deal, and slow or speed up the real-time by a few minutes, days, years, etc. One of the coolest things to play around with is the different rings - you can add planetary rings to everything, and experiment with mass/velocity to watch how these variables influence the ring patterns. You can also toggle different colors to represent things in the universe like acceleration/velocity, mass, etc (the planetary bodies will trail different colors depending on what you select). Reflecting the realities of space, there is no sound or music, however, I didn't really mind (playing my own is perfectly fine).The controls are simple, you just click on the variety of options available; however, understanding what each option can do may take some time to fully appreciate. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the numerous options may itimidate people who do not understand basic physics (since this is a physics simulator in space), but the video tutorials are very helpful in getting you familiarized with each functions. There is also a list of fun things to do in the sidebar, which will offer you a step-by-step blueprint of how to achieve things like adding planetary rings to the Earth's moon and seeing how gravity effects it (very nice visuals if you try this out).Of course, one of the first things I did while trying this out was to increase Earth's velocity and force it out of orbit - hurtling through space and turning black from freezing over. You can add moons or asteroids, turn things into black holes, and manipulate factors like velocity, mass, etc. I tried dropping moons into Earth, however, it appears to make the planet larger (as if it absorbs them). I do not know how to crash them into each other yet (or if that's even possible). With the large amount of variables you can manipulate, there is good number of things you can do and experiment with in the vastness of space.Overall, if you have the least bit of interest in physics and/or space, then you should definitely give this game a try. Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

The forces of logic and reason exist not, but only within space...An unknown force controls all that exists within the universe and has the ability to implode it all just to reset it seconds before extinction on a universal scale, just to do it again. The earth lives in fear of the celestial force destroying it, be it via sending it into Jupiter or by just shooting the sun at it... Nobody knows why these terrible events happen and will likely never know...			",176,15,0,16,20,0,30

												Being a goddess is a pretty normal thing for me, but controlling the planets is new. You pretty quickly discover that anything in orbit is in an unstable state of affairs, and almost any change you make, even moving Venus ever so slightly further from Mars,  results in death and destruction on a Biblical scale. Luckily death is often so fast your six billion minions on earth barely get time to see the bright flash or tidal wave before they are knocking at the pearly gates, but after you have learnt that one fact a dozen different ways; that death comes easy and quick, and the population of earth are getting a little sick of being resurrected only to face certain annihilation, then I think the simulation really does fall a bit flat. It needs more. What, I am not sure. Maybe some goddessly music, I dunno, but as it stands it’s a five minute wonder. Recommended? No, I am afraid not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, as a matter of fact it look amateur. But the essence does not change. For me one of the best sandbox. And if we talk about sandboxes in space, they are generally few. In this game, you can spend a lot of time and it does not bother, because variations in changes in the location of your galaxy are endless, you can arbitrarily adjust the planets, comets.Yes what there to speak, even the stars at the center of galaxies. Perhaps some will not like it, but as they say ""The taste and color of comrades there,"" so you need to consider before choosing this game cham. Suddenly you will delay for a long time =)			",58,8,2,1,7,0,0

												The game is ok if you like physics games, and it's quite fun making a solar sistem out of bowling balls and flinging earth into the sun, witnessing the apocalipse, however I just have to say this game has the most ridiculous achievements I have ever seen. Very easy to outsmart the game and get them, but I don't know what the developer had in mind when he wanted you to run the game for a complete year, and start it up for 10000 times! That's insane. Other than that, a good sandbox to waste your time with.			",165,42,3,13,27,0,16

												7.7/10 - Intracate Universe Sanbox SimulatorI didn't know what to expect from this one; I was pleasently suprised. I just set out to accomplish some achievements and ended up really enjoying altering our galaxy as I saw fit.I shrank the sun and watched the planets fly away, I made the earth equal to that of the moon, created black holes and more. You can change almost every aspect of this game from somethings mass, tregectory and speed. These elements can cause for some amazing things to happen in your universe.Tons of preloaded universes to check out including some pretty detailed maps. I would buy this big time if it could somehow be an active screen saver instead of a game. Worth $10 if you are into Universe Simulators with no real objectives other than explore and create.

												*** My play-time on this game is from IDLING for the 1 year play-time achievement! ***Well, I am not a ''Space'' fan. I don't like playing around with planets and such, if you are, this game is probably for you. The only reason i'm not recommending this game is simple, I love getting all achievements in every game and this game only takes 8 hours of active playing to get them ( opening the game 10,000 times, what a brilliant achievement. ) It also takes 1 year of idling in this game to get the achievement for playing 1 complete year, which is completely stupid.I know the Dev already said he's sorry for making those 2 bad achievements, but I didin't know that prior to getting this game and I do hope they will not be removed.I got this game in a bundle so I didin't mind spending around a dollar for it...Pretty much, if you're looking for a good Space Simulator, read the other reviews and watch videos about this game. Other than that, I can't see this game being worth your time. I felt the need to make a review so I don't get 1000 messages about having 8760 hours on it ( eventually. )			",1398,507,40,151,122,22,188

												As a physicist this game provides endless entertainment as you figure out ways to truly cause chaos in our solar system, or head out to visit one of our closer star siblings. The creation of a new solar system is entertaining, but most assuredly could be helped by a slightly better UI where you can do more configuration to get your star system started (i.e. binary stars, setting orbits, and the like) but for the price, this is both an educational tool that even those familiar with the science could find revealing and a plaything for those that just want to drop a red dwarf star on top of pluto to see what happens.

												Universe Sandbox is a sandbox simulation of celestial bodies and should be taken as it is. You may not get the usual youtube-fodder-laughter-inducing effects from this as with other ""simulation"" games (although you may if you enjoy destroying universe while laughing evilly). I certainly can't comment the physics as I don't have the competency to do so, but I have some expectancy of visual detail not fulfilled by the engine. Visual effects are pretty bland. UI is pretty cluttery and need some time to familiarize with. It does have high level of complexity, it keep tracks of many parameters, such as velocity, mass, density, and temperature, and did a great job simulating it.In conclusion, Universe Sandbox falls more on an educational tool than a game, it even has in-game wikipedia browser. It is enjoyable for space nerds like me, and a good education tool, though I suggest to wait for its more awesome sequel.			",253,103,2,26,18,4,33

Also has a great built-in 3D mode with different options to choose from. The only downside is the ""video mode"" screenshot maker. Not only will the constant screenshots bog your computer down to a near non-existant framerate, but it saves so many screenshots for such a short length of video, that it will take days of work to put together a gif from them if you have anything longer than a few seconds worth.

You can chuck Jupiter sized bowling balls at the earth, or see what'd happen if the sun exploded.  You can watch galaxies eat each other, or you can see what'd happen to the solar system if the sun was more dense than it should be.  All in all, very fun and amusing.  Although I keep finding that gravity in the game never works in the way I think it should.  I don't know if that's because it's a 10 dollar casual simulator or if it's because I don't understand gravity.			",37,7,0,4,12,0,10

												This is a simulation for nerds. At $2.50, the gravitational pull was too strong. I mean, people buy keys for in-game items that mean nothing. This game is based on real physics and real nerdy maths and stuff. With this game, I can travel into the future or the past. I believe, if I go back far enough I could have my first big bang. This game is going to change the next 5 minutes of my life at least!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty interesting to goof around and waste time for a while, but it's very proccessor demanding and can easily crash if you try to load too much at once. Also has a great built-in 3D mode with different options to choose from. The only downside is the ""video mode"" screenshot maker. Not only will the constant screenshots bog your computer down to a near non-existant framerate, but it saves so many screenshots for such a short length of video, that it will take days of work to put together a gif from them if you have anything longer than a few seconds worth.

												Universe Sandbox is a sandbox simulation of celestial bodies and should be taken as it is. You may not get the usual youtube-fodder-laughter-inducing effects from this as with other ""simulation"" games (although you may if you enjoy destroying universe while laughing evilly). I certainly can't comment the physics as I don't have the competency to do so, but I have some expectancy of visual detail not fulfilled by the engine. Visual effects are pretty bland. UI is pretty cluttery and need some time to familiarize with. It does have high level of complexity, it keep tracks of many parameters, such as velocity, mass, density, and temperature, and did a great job simulating it.In conclusion, Universe Sandbox falls more on an educational tool than a game, it even has in-game wikipedia browser. It is enjoyable for space nerds like me, and a good education tool, though I suggest to wait for its more awesome sequel.			",253,103,2,26,18,4,33

												Do you like being chaotically destructive? Do you hate our planet? Have a grudge against the sun? Want to eliminate the Curiousity Rover? Then this game is for you!Simulate creation of galaxies and solar systems. Or just blow them up. The latter is more fun. ",348,109,21,48,89,6,43

												I love the concept. Infinite destructive power in the palm of my hands, commanding the universe in ways I see fit. This is all fine and good, but the game is horribly malnourished. If there was more content here, I'd be happy, but you can easily explore most of the game's features in 20 minutes, making Portal seem like an epic novel.

												Its hard to reccomend this game because although this is an excelent little physics ""game"" its not a ""game"". There arent goals beyond the tutorials (unless you count the achievements). Its a game similar to garrys mod where you have to make your own fun. It does have an active steam comunity constantly putting out new universes for you to explore and its great at accidentaly teaching you about the way the great big nothing works. I would whole heartedly recomend this game to anyone who has an interest in space but its not for everyone. After that its well worth the price tag no matter the price. Just dont go into it expecting goals or missions. Im enjoying this alot and If you like math and space then you will too. 9/10.			",50,30,0,3,17,0,6

												I have spend a couple hours in this game and already I feel as if I've done all that I can do.  I've created the apocolypse a douzen different ways, I've shot hundreds of oversized teapots at the sun, and created black holes which eat up the galaxy.  But unfortunately, though this sounds like a blast, this game fails to deliver on many fronts.  I'd like to just say right now that this isn't a bad... game?  I use the term 'game' lightly because it really is more of a simulation sandbox, just as the title suggests.  My main problem with Universe Sandbox was the target audience.  The game's controls are made to be straightforward enough so that anyone can get the hang of them pretty quickly, but some of the details require some moderate scientific knowledge.  I feel as if this program has the potential to be a either a fun game or an amusing scientific program, but the developers seem to have created something in between the two.  The gameplay itself is smooth and enjoyable in moderation, but there isn't enough content or mechanics to keep the average player interested for more than maybe 45 minutes to an hour.

												It's a decent space physics simulator, if that's what you're looking for, but there's no reason to buy it anymore.The developer made a pretty major update to this simulator, but decided to release it as a sequel. From what I have seen the sequel is much better, so you should consider buying that one instead (although it is rather pricey, so I suppose there is one reason why would you want to buy inferior version.)

												It's pretty fun to see different parts of space and see either how they work without messing with them, but the best part is seeing how you can change things and overtime how that would change the universe. There are some built in interesting scenarios, like the solar system, the collision of Andromeda and the Milky Way, and I think there are a few others I can't remember. You can change the size or density of certain objects, introduce new objects, and just generally play god with the universe. There aren't a million things to do, unless you want to do the same things in every area you see, but it is definitely fun to just see it and learn how it all works. It's like physics and astronomy class put into practice.One thing that came to mind was that when I was interested in achievements, this game has completely unobtainable and irrelevant achievements. There all time played based and it's things like play for a day, play for a week, play for a month, etc. I think there are some other ones, and you can get some ideas of things to do from that. Of course steam achievements are useless and there's no way to track them, so it doesn't matter unless you really absolutely need to get 100% achievements in all the games you play.

												I have a degree in astrophysics and I must say this is a fun tool to play with. In a normal work of astrophysicist you'd have to program all this stuff by yourself - here you have everything what you need - models, integrator and visualisation tool.But honestly this is not for everyone. Of course it is fun to throw asteroid into earth, change the Sun into a black hole or compare sizes of nearby stars. I'd say it's about 20 minutes of fun. After that this tool would be thrown away and never run again.I'd say this tool is dedicated for people really interested in math and astrophysics. You really need an idea what you want to simulate and spend some time to work on the initial conditions. For me a real fun was to see what happens to predefined rings of Saturns, when you insert Earth-mass moon on an elongated orbit. Amazing how the rings transform - I even saw some kind of density waves there. I feel that some very complicated differential equations must make the physics there.Some people complain that when you speed up you get unrealiable results. Of course. Unfortunately implemented integrator is not very sophisticated and loses accuracy quickly. This is why you have accuracy measure available. When you get into yellow or red domain you are no longer watching physics but numerical artifacts. This can be entertaining too. But if you want realiable results you will have to wait a long time depending on the complexity of the problem. Patience is a must in any computer modelling.To sumarize - you really need to know what you are doing to have fun from this program.			",57,12,1,7,20,0,14

												I simply cannot recommend this ""game"" because I feel as if it was meant for teaching. I do not have much time into it because I cannot keep myself entertained. Sure, if you know absolutely everything about space physics, units and so on then I'm sure you can get a few hours out of this. However, upon entering the game, I was bombarded with loads of sub-menus, most of which I had no idea what to do. And yes, I did some of the tutorials, but a game is simply not enjoyable to me when you have to do several tutorials or know a lot about certain subjects.It fails to deliver an entertaining experience, as it was simply built to please space enthusiasts. It feels like a cheap program that could be used in a classroom, nothing more.There is also the fact that the game has already crashed/errored out for me a few times, simply by just experimenting with different physics, which is what the game is meant to do...Did I mention that the game also has no sound? That makes it even more dull.For this I would say just save your money unless it goes on sale for a dollar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you feel yourself interested in universe,space and you are the person who is ready to create, this game is just for you.A great variety things you can do.Wanna collide galaxies?Done.Maybe create your own solar system?Why not.And how about place a big red star to our solar system and watch out how our homeworld ''burning to hell''?Actually the game is not so new and fresh but still it have a plenty large amount of information and tools...The information about our universe is so reliable that when I played this game at first I was shocked...9/10(Out of sandbox games)			",259,60,10,36,18,2,27

I pulled up Universe Sandbox, loaded the Andromeda collision preset and demonstrated the concept in real time.If you can self amuse by messing with complex systems, this quite a bit of fun.

												I got this for far cheaper than it's base price, so perhaps thats why I tolerate its roughness. It's barely a game, it is more of a simulator than many such games claim to be. It is essentially a teaching tool for Astronomy, and it can be fun to satisfy curious questions like wanting to watch planets collide. It delivers precisely what it says it does, and the videos and screenshots are accurate. Grab it on sale if you feel 10 dollars is a bit steep, but it's hard to knock something that delivers on its promises.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												I got this for far cheaper than it's base price, so perhaps thats why I tolerate its roughness. It's barely a game, it is more of a simulator than many such games claim to be. It is essentially a teaching tool for Astronomy, and it can be fun to satisfy curious questions like wanting to watch planets collide. It delivers precisely what it says it does, and the videos and screenshots are accurate. Grab it on sale if you feel 10 dollars is a bit steep, but it's hard to knock something that delivers on its promises.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												an unfinished work and then they extended their work on universe sanbox 2 which is the continuation of their project so what was the point of getting this 1 if you switched to the same game but more polished universe sandbox 2.

												This sandbox is pretty neat. You can either choose to take existing systems in the universe and play around with them or create your own from scratch. It's not strictly speaking a game. but if you've read the info about it, you shouldn't really have that impression. It's nice to play around with and see what you can do by adding in bizarre elements to all sorts of galactic scenarios (a giant teapot appears, hurtling through space towards the Solar System! It is 30 times the size of the sun! Oh dear...). It provides some amusing little elements such as this, as well as the opportunity to build your own working systems (a real challenge!).If this sandbox really appeals to you, buy it! If you just have a mild interest in space and think it might be fun to try out, perhaps wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not sure what I was expecting... a sandbox universe... sounds fun. But after the tutorial, and a few of the built-in scenarios I think I've pretty much seen it all. Its basically not much more than a gravity simulator where you can vary the size, speed position of some objects and watch how they collide... Maybe my lack of creativity is to blame, but the unintuitive controls of this ""game"" are not exactly helpful either...I bet there are tons flash browser apps out there that can show you the same thing with slightly less fancy graphics.

												I love solar system builder games, but this one lacks features that you would expect. A good solar system builder would give you a little more freedom and creative options. I bought this game thinking it would allow you to edit planets atmosphere colors and material makeup and interesting things like that, instead it gives you predesigned planets, like Earth and Mars. The physics work quite well and its pretty cool to watch stars eat each other but It gets boring in minutes. One major issue is that the game lacks a soundtrack. There is no noise in the game that I know of. I got so bothered by the lack of sound that I had to play some Operation Ivy afterwards to get my head straight. Currently, I am waiting for my refund and  will drop my money on a game like Deus Ex or some other classic game like that. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.-Edit. If it's on sale, for a very low price, go for it. I feel like this game would be better off as a 99 cents game on mobile devices.			",99,3,2,1,7,0,1

												This game is the worst game I have ever played in my life. Before I baught it I was like ""I can't wait to shoot the moon at earth and see it burn into a million bits"" but that didn't happen, insted the moon just disapeared and there was a big white area on the earth that never went away and the earth was fine. Please don't buy this game buy Universe Sanbox 2 it's way better of a space simulator and when you actually shoot the moon at earth, earth swallows up the moon and earth starts to change color and burn up until it's a big ball of fire and everyone is dead. If you want to get an acurate space simulator get Universe Sandbox 2.			",13,2,0,1,16,0,1

												This is one of those times that I wish Steam offered a ""mediocre"" choice for ranking games that was somewhere in between ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"".  Because that's this game -- it is what it is: a space sandbox sim.  So why not a ""thumbs up"" then, you ask?  Well, you COULD pay $10 for this game...or you COULD instead download NASA/JPL's Eyes On The Solar System app for FREE (and which is very similar to, and just as good as, Universe Sandbox).  While Universe Sandbox might offer more functions/options, Eyes On The Solar System seems to win in the scientific accuracy department and also has better visuals.  So, to sum up, it's not that Universe Sandbox is terrible; It's just that it's not that great for $10, when comparable programs are available for no charge.  I couldn't honestly recommend that someone spend money on this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ce programme est un simulateur d'espace temps. Il n'est pas simplement adapté qu'aux astrophysiciens en herbes, mais aussi conçu, je l'imagine pour ceux qui oseraient tenter l'expérience d'une anticipation cataclysmique de notre tendre et chère planète, voire de l'univers, pourquoi pas. Et si le soleil devenait une géante rouge en dix minutes par exemple ? Une supernova ? Une nébuleuse ?la question que tout le monde se pose, dont le résultat serait vérifiable dans 5 milliards d'années, environ.Vérifiable par qui d'ailleurs ?Je n'ai pas encore testé l'expérience, mais c'est certainement la première chose que je vais tenter de simuler. Enfin, si le programme le permet !A première vue, ce simulateur offre de nombreuses possibilités. Dont beaucoup peuvent être assez désastreuses.Alors profitez en, tout n'est que virtuel.Pour le moment :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here I write in code what a blind man once told me about my life and subsequent death.Birds are congregating over the open sea, they begin to dive, a man on a boat catches a glimpse of the flock intent on suicide. As they crash into the sea, the man is flung over board. He is trying to swim to the surface, but the water has taken a substance like jelly, as the ocean begins to turn blood red and consciousness begins to fade from the man, he hears a voice, I love you father, don't fight anymore, it's all over.

												I was dissapointed in this simulation because it was not what I was looking for. Mere minutes after installing I could see how simple it was and not what I needed.  What I mean by 'simple' is that when I zoomed in one of Saturn's moons, not only was it the same texture used as every other moon, but what really bugged me was that it did not rotate properly. The exact same face would be always in shadow, when I know that though tidally locked, one face always points to Saturn, the entire surface should be lighted by the sun as it rotates around its primary planet. Also, it refused to load my own textures on the various worlds, even though there was a place for the files ... it would not load. I wish I could get a refund for this.I don't normally write reviews but I was directed to this program by a recommendation online and I was underwhelmed.  Maybe U^2 will be better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not stable. If you speed up the game it breaks. However if you load another file with a thousand objects flying at much higher speeds no problem. Apparently the game has different modes that enable for heavier simulations, but I'm not sure you can use that more stable mode yourself.I've also had it crash making me lose my progress. First crash was within 20 seconds on a very stable pc.The game only takes very little resources of your pc. So I was sitting here with a nice i7, 8GB ram and a GTX-750 looking at non-fullscreen low-fps simulations of the universe. Sigh.UI isn't great, background is very low-res or out of focus. No ambient music. Game is unstable...It's still fun I guess, but I expected much more.			",121,16,6,6,10,0,5

												What you want to do? Create a bizzarre universe? Destroy our solar system? Expand your world? No problem. This is Universe Sandbox.Story: NONE - Since this game is a sandbox, there isn't no story.Controls: 10/10 - You can use both the mouse and keyboard to orchestra your universe.Graphics: 10/10 - The textures of the planets are looking good, aswell you can also change textures to make bizzarre planets.Music: NONE - There's actually no music nor sounds.Gameplay: 10/10 - In this game you can mash up everything about the solar system and also the UNIVERSE. There's also a way you can destroy it, use the power of asteroids and then done, earth is perfectly damaged!!Total: 5/5I would like to congratulate to Laser for getting this last game i had in my wishlist.

First off, emmersive graphical capabiliteies over took my small pesentry mind as i watch the sun arc over the horizon of saturns rings. This puts movies such as Gravity, Space Oddisy: 2001, and star wars to shame.

No ambient music. Game is unstable...It's still fun I guess, but I expected much more.			",121,16,6,6,10,0,5

												For those who are interested in space, astrology and science as a whole this game is a massively enjoyable piece of software! For those who want to be shooting or flying about in a spaceship, this really isn't what you're looking for.For the few pounds that I paid for it in the sale it is well worth the spend, and can provide hours of gameplay, despite becomming a little dull at times. The game is simply what you make of it; a more creative player will certainly find this more enjoyable since the content is generated from the unlimited number of scenarios that you can create. For those who aren't so imagniative, the game provides a good sample of ready-made scenarios and oddities to explore.As for the playability of the game, some of the menus can be confusing, and so I would reccomend taking the tutorial! The 'camera' controls are easy to use and have the adequate range of movement and precision necessary to be intuitive.TLDR:Good for sciencey people, has excellent controls and a wide range of things to do! It's a game but also useful for learning!Bad for those who want an action packed game with explosions etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This thing is pretty damn sweet haha. It's basically a version of Garry's Mod for space and♥♥♥♥♥♥lol.Seriously though, this game/tool is quite complex in the way it details the interactions of the planets, and how you can manipulate their properties. You could very well make your own artistic/viable vision of a galaxy(s) using this, and you may very well learn quite a bit from playing with this awesome tool.Of course you can always just destroy and obliterate planets into a black void if that's your thing too haha. Check this out if you like sandbow tools and space, and you'll have everything you've wanted for a good bit!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As others have noted, this simulator cannot even simulate correctly.  The devs are sloppy coders who don't know how to do proper bounds checking, as evidenced by objects randomly flying off into space if the simulation is sped up.   You would think that they would have detected this and fixed it by now, but none such is the case.  Careless and sloppy.I wouldn't even recommend this as a tutorial for grade school kids, either, because of the inaccurate and unpredictable results when tweaking parameters (which is supposed to be 99% of the usefulness of this program in the first place). What's more, the devs have decided to add an ""atmospheric warming due to CO2 level""  parameter to their new version.  In order for this to be credible, the mathematical model employed would need to be disclosed (which I seriously doubt will  happen).  But, regardless of whether they do, they have decided to go against 50,000+ scientists who are on record as stating that human-produced CO2 is NOT the cause of global warming. It is a hoax promulgated by NWO globalists and their sock puppets like Al Gore.   There is overwhelming evidence to the contrary now -- which is that climate cycles are simply linked to solar cycles. So, I am disappointed that Dan Dixon and his ragtag team of devs have chosen to subscribe to the non-scientific, mainstream media propaganda, which is funded by the globalists, with the intention of hoodwinking the world into thinking that a global carbon tax is necessary to ""save"" the planet.   They are doing a terrible disservice to young people by reinforcing the brainwashing in this regard.  And it is for this reason that I will permanently boycott all future products from this company.(Note: Acquired via a bundle)			",493,179,13,28,51,6,51

												I never created anything with this program, the most i've done was change some values to mess things up. Seeing our solar system active is pretty neat. The galaxies are cool, they arn't super detailed however. Overall its great eductional program, if you see it onsale you must get it!			",221,44,2,45,23,3,48

												It's a fun idea but the simulator has a lot less freedom than you might think in designing your own universe setups.There are (very) limited palettes of preset bodies to choose from. Given, you can change the individual properties of the presets if you really want to, but that quickly becomes an exercise in numbers and is far from as much fun as it is advertised as.Another strong negative point of the sim is its accuracy/speed. The simulation is neither accurate nor speedy, and you will very quickly end up with horrendous frame rates and/or woefully inaccurate trajectories that would make any 1st year physics student cringe. Yes, I have a fast processor, no it doesn't help.Definitely not recommended, you'd better spend your money on something that is either more useful or more fun.			",84,18,1,17,20,0,12

												The game is supposed to be a physics simulator, but if I use it as anything but a screen saver it crashes.  Even just running the Earth and Moon scenario where you have literally TWO BODIES to deal with, the program slows and dies.  It's already crashed several times and I haven't even had the game for an hour.  As others mention, the controls and layout aren't very smooth, and if time is sped up the objects just go flying off.  It is nothing like the trailer.  Once the game starts to crash, there is no recovery, the controls become inverted if they respond at all.  The zoom feature seems broken as well which makes the program even more difficult to operate.  Trying to change angles or move throughout is supposed to be what the whole game is about to get a visual and it can't even do this smoothly.This game isn't finished, it needs some serious bug fixes.  It's an interesting idea that is being poorly executed.			",47,28,0,32,19,1,13

												I got this at a massive discount and I still feel cheated. The amount of content is at a minimum and the simulation engine cannot handle too much before it starts cracking. You can't really play with the sliders too much and it feels like watch-but-don't-touch for most but the simplest simulation scenarios. I can't believe this is priced at 10$ when there are so many epic games outthere that you can get for that or less.			",125,38,6,22,27,1,34

												Universe Sandbox is a game I wouldn't really recommend to anyone. It's definitely a simulator in that it's not very fun - unless you get a kick out of exploding planets and turning the sun in to a black hole. Not a lot to do with it, but it's neat to mess with. I wouldn't say it's worth the $1.99 I spent on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I was hyped, but later I got bored so fast. This game offers you a lot though, you can see physics in macro form, i.e. check what would happen to our planetary system  if Sun's mass was different. This game is not bad and has huge potential, but I'd recommend it to enthusiast of astrophysisc rather to gamers who are not into that kind of scientific things.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not really a game, it's space object/matter physics simulator. You can create moons, rings, planets, suns, blackholes, explode objects, change mass, velocity and a edit some more relevant statistics and watch chaos unfold, but I actually found it behaving oddly sometimes and my experience didn't go much farther than experimenting odd scenarios before getting bored.Also beware Achievement hunters/completists, there's at least 2 achievments that are absurdly hard to get, one is execute the game 10 000 times and another one that is run the game for 1 year, that's roughly 8760 hours! Not being able to get the achivement and be able to enjoy other games in less than 1 year is really bothering me.In short, this isn't much of a game, there's no objectives or goals, just experimentation, this isn't for everyone and I'm sure there may be a target audience for this but while interesting for the novelty, my feelings are, if given the chance to go back in time, I wouldn't pay for it again, and as such, I don't recommend this ""game"".

												Honestly a little dissapointing. They skipped over a lot. For example, none of the panets have rings or moons in the solar system option, and you can only get them if you select that specific planet to view. Or that the planets seem to be on a set orbit and don't affect each other. As far as I can tell they are only affected by the sun. Turning things into black holes is apparently only a cosmetic problem. Many issues with it crashing/freezing/lagging/etc. Hoping the next one will be better, it looks promising			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At risk of sounding like a complete jack a55 here is my opinion. This game/simulator is load of bs from the ground up. It glitches out CONSTANTLY. Boots me out and shuts itself down. LAGS HORRIBLY. I know what your thinking. ""Get a new computer."" Then why pray tell can I run Skyrim on high LAGLESS, and many other BIGGER games LAGLESS but this utter heap can not go lagless beyond placing 2 objects. The whole simulator is a big stinking heap. Buyer beware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a unique idea, but it just got downright boring after an hour or two, which is how I much I have played this game. There just wasn't enough content to keep me interested, and all I was basically doing was changing the size of some planet or crashing two suns into each other (and I was not impressed with the collision mechanics). It wasn't too bad, but I would only purchase this for $5 or $10 at the most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mildly entertaining for a few minutes, but that's really about it. Felt too technical for some casual fun and then again too casual for some technical fun. A better example of a ""game"" in a similar vein is The Mountain. Definitely not worth the asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big nerd and an astrophysics freak. This ""simulation"", is disappointing to me in alot of ways. Horrible interface, buggy and unstable as hell, and poorly executed on the whole. Don't read into bragging that it does... it is no where near as ground breaking or interesting as it claims to be. The whole draw of being able to collide galaxies and planets loses it's appeal when you actually do it and realise that the planets break apart into smaller planets, and that pretty much every barren world in our solarsystem has the same skin as our moon.If you want a good sandbox game in the universe, then ""Space Engine"" is your best options. Sure you can't play pool with crappy looking, unrealistic planets, but it looks fantastic, you can explore many things and it's free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've wanted to play more of this, but, from what ive seen so far i kind dont want to - eventually ill get round to it... maybe - but for now all im going to say is that it is a bit compicated and so it scared me a way at first, and the controls seemed a bit spazzy. However dont take it from me if you want this game im sure you can gat the hang of the controls but if you dont want to learn anything (like me... :) ) then this isnt the game for you			",324,48,2,52,35,3,55

												3/10I absolutely do not understand why this game has an 83 rating on Metacritic!Other reviewers have said it before but you spend a few minutes messing around with gravity, a few more shooting meteors at planets and then there is very little to do. One gripe I have is also with the achievements. I don't want to have to turn the game on 1000 times to get a bloody achievement, and as a sad completionist it makes me mad. I like casual games but this feels like a hardcore casual game which is a little odd to say the least.I gave it an extra point for being super cheap when I bought it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eh, it was interesting and had tons of textures for the planets, moons, ect ~ However there was not enough options to play with the visual affects.  Having tracers on everything and the need to hold shift to hide only some of them made it look lame.  I wanted to increase the speed that things spin, cause planet affects like super volcanos, and just make things explode to see what would happen if Jupitar just exploaded.  However I didn't find those options, this is more of a gravity, planet, sun, orbit type of sandbox.  Not bad, but not as cool as it could have been.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sandbox universe is exactly as you see on the provided screenshots. If they were .gifs, it'd be easier to prevent people from buying. The game itself it quite limited and prone to crash. Since it doesn't seem possible to create an infinite universe, the very second you explode a planet by mistake, you'll know that those pieces are going to keep going until it reaches a high enough number which will crash the game. Provided tutorial show what you're able to do in the game, but other than those you'll be figuring out most stuff and eventually becoming bored of being God.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dull.Dull. Dull. Dull.To be fair, I wanted this so that I could see what making minute changes to the solar system would do over time, and the fast-forward functionality of the sandbox completely fails (fast forwarding makes the calculations far less accurate, leading to planets simply flying off into space instead of following a realistic trajectory).Obviously this is targeted at people with far more time and patience on their hands than me, who just wants to see what would happen to Earth if the moon slowly slid out of orbit but doesn't want to LITERALLY SIT HERE FOR 10,000 YEARS to see if happen in real time.

												I played this game for not too long, I picked it up in a humble bundle and when I played it I was expecting something similar to Solar 2 which is a game that I really enjoyed because of its odd rpg planet elements. This game isn't like that, it is a simulator game where you are given our solar system and you are able to change the attributes of the planets like planet mass and orbit. The other thing that put me off about the game was the achievements, as someone who enjoys collecting achievements the idea of starting up this game 10,000 times was off putting. This is a game that is good at what it does, but I don't like what it does, but if you are a astronomy buff who wants to see what would happen if Pluto gained enough mass to be more than a dwarf then this is the game for you.

												When you run a simulation of earth and the moon, and change the time perspective to 1 year per second, the moon is gone before you can blink. Seeing how the moon will still be here in a year, there is clearly something wrong with the physics calculations in this program. And if that's the case, why bother?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cool, someone got a degree in physics and copied a physics program into computer code and added tool tips. Physics geeks won't need a simulation to tell them what happens when you increase an object's mass.Astronomy geeks don't need a simulated space map to look at Andromeda. That leaves geeks who don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥from shinola but like to pretend they're interested in science (they totally read a Carl Sagan book, don't you know) and ♥♥♥♥ing Love Science on facebook as the core audience for this program.

												I guess this game offers a quite realistic simulation of space; I can't really tell, I'm not some space physician.But since it's hard to get started, to understand everything - mostly on the interface side - and since it has, on my side, some quite buggy parts, I don't recommend it. Plus, it's a troll of achievement hunters since it has some impossible achievements to get, so it just destroys your achievement score, in the end.Also, except making planets crash on other planets, I hardly had any fun on it honestly. c.c2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Create and destroy on a scale you’ve never imagined with the ultimate space simulator. Harness the power to create black holes, collide galaxies, and manipulate gravity with just a few clicks. Inspired by the software astronomers use to unlock the mysteries of our universe, never before has astronomy been so interactive or so much fun. Spawn a massive moon to tear apart Saturn’s rings or launch a rogue star to rip the planets from their orbits around our sun. After unleashing catastrophic destruction, create your own solar system and share it with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why when I ram a ♥♥♥♥ing sun into the earth there it just ""absorbs"" it?? No explosions? No particles at all?

												Achievements you are basically unable to get (e.g. have a total playtime of 8760 hours), troubles when starting and closing the ""game"" and absolutely nothing interesting to do. It is a simulation but even as a simulation you can't really use anything in there. Place some planets/stars here and there and watch them collapse into each other. That is basically 90% of the ""game"". If you see people playing this they probably afk farm cards and collect playtime hours. The achievements are the worst i've ever seen and will fk up your global achievement stats, badges don't look good either. If you are looking for a space simulation have a look at ""Space Engine"" on Google. It's free and way better than this crap. ",90,34,5,7,12,2,8

												This game is a great piece of edutainment. The dev previously made a promise however that if you buy this game, you'll get an upgrade to it at a later date, and the dev recently went back on that. I might add that it was for a good reason however, he provided it free of charge to any school district that wants it. I wouldn't mind buying the next update (really a ground up rewrite for more accuracy as well as more tools.) The ""game"" which is hardly a game, and really software, simulates how various things work in our solar system. It also gives you the tools to make another from scratch. It's seriously neat to play with, though there are some accuracy bugs when you move past a certain speed. All in all, if you happen to like space, or ask yourself ""what would happen if I altered the orbit of the moon ever so slightly"" then this is the software for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The title says it all. Universe sandbox. Its a pretty great game, you can mess with certain gravity levels of the planets and stars, and introduce new planets, or galaxies. Once you understand the core mechanics, it gets pretty fun. You can cause all sorts of cosmic chaos. The entertainment factor leaves a lot to be desired, however. I can play this game for about 15 minutes before it gets boring. Its still a great game nonetheless. After going on some hiatuses, it quickly regains its playability factor, and is a blast to play.Universe Sandbox: Compelling sandbox, gets boring pretty quickly 7/10			",71,7,1,4,18,0,8

												This is possibly the coolest tool you could give someone interested in space.  There is only one problem with it, and that deals with the math dealing with the acceleration of objects occuring when you up the time scale.  For instance; you will launch Earth's Moon beyong Jupiter if you want to see the Earth and Moon in thier positions a few years in the future.  Unless you wait (a really long time) the increased ""speed"" of time becomes the speed of the objects being modified in the simulation.  Otherwise?Otherwise, the game is an awesome simulator for physics in a zero gravity vacuum.  Several objects are available for you to play with: Dice, bowling balls, planets, singularities, the speed the earth rotates. . . . This list could be really ridiculous.  If you have had a bad day, you could launch the Earth into the sun. (Achievement alert)Now, If you will excuse me, I am going to resume my simulation of the Death Star orbiting Endor.

												I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants a truly entertaining game. This sandbox is slow moving and dull, as it is entirely based out of watching celestial bodies orbit each other, float around in space, and non-climactically crash into each other. The most entertaining thing I have found to do in it is make dice meteor showers in a star system made out of bowling balls, base balls, and teapots.			",115,11,1,16,14,0,12

You can create your own universe and control numerous variables, or do the same with premade simulations such as our solar system.

												I really loved Universe Sandbox. This simulation was crazy! I loved just looking at the stars and their distances and the vastness that they cover. Just contemplating how far and how big the universe is is scary. But, at the same time it's inspiring and gave me awe. Awe at the complexity of our solar system, of the stars, of the planets. Even though the feeling of loneliness encommpassed me during this simulation, I still felt meaning in my life. I felt like I was lucky.

												I remember growing up using my parent's 300mhz Compaq pc to browse Encarta Encyclopedia 1997 on CD-Rom.  One of the features of Encarta was that it offered a mini solar system simulator where I could experience changing gravity for planets.Last year I picked up Universe Sandbox in a Steam sale and it reminds me a lot of the fun times I had as a kid with Encarta.  Except the scope is much larger, it is infinitely more customizable, and a lot more fun.If you like space and want to experience crashing planets into one another, or manipulating Earth's gravity to 1000x larger than the sun, or turning all the planets in our solar system into black holes - this is the simulator for you.

												Do you space?  If you buy this game you can space until you space and then space inside of space until space is space and you are spacing in space.  On a more serious note if you have ever been curious about gravitational pull and how finely-tuned the solar system is, this is a wonderful program to mess with it and see just how boned we are if the sun ever decides to just straight-up disappear.    If you hate werewolves you can blow up the moon.  Boom.  No more werewolves; that's half of the twilight problem solved.You can decide to say ""Screw you Jupiter, get out of here I hate you!"" because Jupiter's gotten too fat and is doing nothing but loafing around outside the asteroid belt.  However afterwards you might realise you kind of miss Jupiter because suddenly everything's gone a little too wonky and you just want to go back to the good old days of orbiting carelessly around the sun until the sun gets tired of your♥♥♥♥♥♥or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ celestial-body decides to barge on in and ruin everything.  Thanks for nothing, comets.			",91,44,7,15,24,4,15

												Crashes way too often. Not properly multithreaded. It runs such low FPS even though not using even 50% of CPU nor GPU. A bit lacking on camera controls and game mechanics etc. The concept is fantastic and while you don't do anything and just watch, the game is quite breathtaking. Once you try to get involved, however, you constantly feel like something's missing; whether it be the ability to undo actions or rewind the game so you can watch a different collision. Simple things like trying to pause the simulation can become frustrating if you're editing game values such as the speed of the game because instead of pausing, pressing spacebar is locked to typing so you literally can't pause untill you press escape a bunch of times. It's all little things but there's so many little things that are annoying and plain disabling from the experience. I find this game enjoyable to watch (assuming it doesn't crash every 15 minutes), but difficult to 'play'.Win7 Ultimate 64-biti5 4670k @ 3.8Ghz16GB RAMGTX 770 ",24,0,3,2,7,0,1

												I don't recommend this game, because it's boring. There are some mission/tutorials which you can complete in 30min and after that there's nothing to do. There's no music in the background or any other sounds. The planets don't move correctly anymore when you scale up the time. If you like to collect achievements don't buy this game, it has the dumbest achievements I've ever seen, like 'Start this game 10000 times' or 'play this game for a year'.			",198,45,8,29,13,5,38

Or you can start from scratch. Place a star, then add a few planets, some asteroids, and even a couple dice if you want. Yep. Dice. You can take an object and turn it into a black hole. Heck, you can send a meteor into Earth, or drive Earth into Betelgeuse (its a star), or...well you get the picture. The possibilities are endless.

Change the mass of a planet, alter the speed, send a giant tea cup hurtling toward Jupiter, maybe place a black monolith on Europa...witness the collision of two galaxies, of find out what happens if the sun becomes a black hole.

												Not only fun, but practical as well.  After watching the simulated coelessing of the Milky Way and Andromida galaxies, which in on schedule to occur in about 110 million years (well before our Sun goes nova), I realized the pace of my cryo-genisis was absurd.  I'm now ready to have my head attached to 3rd gen android body instead of assuming there will ever even be a 7th gen.  Shame to lose that 10-25 million years of investment growth though.But seriously, if you like the game ""Life"" (computer, not board) this will surely be a treat.  Likewise, any 'God' wanna-bes/critics now have a chance to prove themselves.  For the price, it's a very cost-effective way to simulate most things you can imagine in the scale of ""Universe"" (with no math)It was in my library withing days of being a Steam offering.  At first there were some issues (likely related to memory or video code), but they were patched quickly enough.  For sure you get more than what you've paid for.  Look forward to v2/DLC.

												It's exactly what it lookes like. It's a solar gravity simulator.If the idea of demonstrating stable lagrange points tickles your fancy, then you have probably skipped the reviews and already bought it.If you have no idea what a lagrange point is, and you think the show ""Nova"" is terribly boring, then move along, nothing for you here.

It is a simple handled simulator, with a high level of detail. Sure, you can do much mischief with it. However, it has always felt that I would act in the interests of science.Maybe not even bad for students, with a deficit of physical knowledge (like me!).6 out of 10 *			",2111,839,77,233,285,24,347

												The best gravity simulator I know of under such a modest budget. Combines imagination with physics and manipulation of the universe - I find it most fascinating! Although, the main con is graphics but in my situation, this poses as a pro due to my poor graphics card, allowing great spead and real-time activity. It also comes with a 3D feature which I can't wait to utilise. I recommend this simulation for those who enjoy thinking outside of the square, beyond the world and universe itself. I, personally, have used this as a tool for relaxation, escapism and inspiration.			",80,15,3,2,16,0,4

												Astronomy is something everyone is atleast a little interested in at some point.Universe Sandbox is just that; a sandbox. Create amazing backdrops of galaxies from your imagination, solar systems you've seen on TV, make many planets circle each other in a beautiful symbiotic orbi- SMASH EVERYTHING.USandbox gives an amazing amount of freedom to bring the universe and all it's physics to it's pitiful little knees. Warp those galaxies, create super-massive black holes to suck every little asteroid into it's singularity-future. The graphical and mathmatical demands on your computer can be taxing at times (>250 galaxies into one cataclysmic result) but oh what a beautiful sight it is to behold. Not a game as such, the achievements are more jokes than anything - but the time-based ones are very possible once you realize how fun it is being -god-.(Also, the 3D options and customization are out of this world - literally..)

Maybe I'll run it a couple of times, throw a planet here or there and watch them slingshot to the outer space when speeding up the game with only a couple of months / real sec. So, I'm giving it a no-go. I'm glad I received this as a gift, because otherwise I would be sorry to have paid even half the sum.			",43,1,1,10,4,0,3

												Universe Sandbox is exactly what its namesake implies. You have the ability to play around with heavenly bodies and change parameters that make them move in strange or unique ways. A word of warning, though: Even the beefiest of gaming rigs can become taxed if the simulation is complex, because this game is making many physical calculations simultaneously.My only complaint about the game is that it only follows classical Newtonian mechanics. It doesn't account for relativistic effects. For example, I have been able to eject a planet from a solar system at 10c, or ten times the speed of light, but in real life that's physically impossible.			",57,8,1,4,3,2,5

												I bought this game a long time ago, when it was first offered on Steam and have to admit, I thought it too difficult at the time. It required more thinking than I wanted to do, my ""day job"" taking way too much out of me to come home and have to think instead of play. BUT - I recently crashed my system and after getting Steam back online I opened the game to discover it had a LOT of new options, (3D Nvidia support for one), and I decided to try it again. Since I no longer have a job, (disabled), this title is exactly what I need to ensure my brain doesn't atrophy! I also love astronomy, use my awesome telescope, weather permitting, and tried to create a solar system with mixed results. Graphics: Round planets are still faceted, but only when seen close up. Colors are vivid or muted, depending on the reality and settings, and the realism setting brings one away from our solar system to observe the paths and orbits of moons I, personally, didn't know were out there. Difficulty: Yep, it is still a complex game, but guess what? Playing God will give one a greater appreciation of His occupational stress levels...solar systems are amazingly complicated and the physics behind a simple retune of the moon's orbit about the Earth requires more than I can manage on paper-thank the makers of Intel and Nvidia for doing it for me. FunFactor: I would give this a ""10"" overall, and the fun factor is even more! I intend to be up all night creating my personal solar system and once done I will post it wherever it is you do that. No, I cannot explain much, read the manual, check the website, do the research and have FUN, the rewards far outstrip the labor and even the labor is fun if you have an interest in all things space related. (If not, why would you even consider this game?) Well worth the price of admission and time spent to use it as the sandbox universe construction toolbox it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This program is simply not a game, or at least I can't call it that, because, much like the name suggests, its more like a realistic and scientific simulator than a game.If that description bothers people, here's another one: A level editor without a game.Most people understand me now, right?Okay, this isn't fair, this IS actually quite interesting.It allows anyone to create an entire galaxy using your own textures for planets, moons, asteroid fields and all that or just play a game of biljards with planets.Its a very realistic physics simulator that allows you to play with orbits and trajectories and all that. Nice tool for the hobbyist and fun play time for the VERY casual gamer.I actually use it for testing and developing some of my own work, since it will give you all sorts of readouts while simulating, and can reverse / replay said simulation.

												Its pretty interesting and pretty to watch ;)But for me, it would be nice if all the known objects in space were listed in our solar system, and there is only like physics on mass creating gravity, would be awesome if there were electric currents and solar flares and all... but whats really missing is planetary information.its a fun sandbox to stuff around with, but if your seeking information on the solarsystem or our galaxy... its not too informative.

Well this ""sandbox"" simulation of the universe can teach alot about space and how weird everything works out there and you can still have alot of fun at the same time. You can make pure devistation on a massive scale anywere in the universe or you can just watch earth and how the moon orbits around it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me preface my review with this statement: Universe Sandbox is NOT a game, or at least not in any real, traditional sense. Now that I got that out of the way, I think that Universe Sandbox is indeed fun yet educational & should be in everyone's Steam library, especially if you have at least a mild interest in space, physics, and/or from time to time asked yourself miscellaneous ""what if..."" questions. Ever wonder what things would be like if you crushed our sun into a black hole? Ever wanted to see multiple black holes orbit each other? Want to recreate Tantooine with it's twin suns? Well, you can find out (or do) all that and more with Universe Sandbox. All in all it's just plain ol' fun to just screw around with, and seeing as there's real science & physics behind it, you just may learn something while doing so.			",754,165,36,79,51,14,83

Like I said not worth more than 3$ but I would recommend it if you can get it at a good discount. I enjoyed it.			",84,18,3,18,10,0,10

												""Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.""-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994			",620,134,12,48,57,4,59

												This game is a great way to relax to. Sometimes it's fun to set up a star system and just let the simulation run for a few days  while you do some other stuff with your life. If the game doesn't crash it can be fun to see what happens after a theoretical 1000 years.			",144,18,1,15,26,4,31

												This is an abstract way of wrapping your head around space, astronomy & physics in a very visual way. Probably awesome for kids as they're just beginning to grasp science, and a neat tool for what-if scenarios and demonstrating ideas to others. Definitely a neat ""sandbox"" of tools and ideas.

												Do you space?  If you buy this game you can space until you space and then space inside of space until space is space and you are spacing in space.  On a more serious note if you have ever been curious about gravitational pull and how finely-tuned the solar system is, this is a wonderful program to mess with it and see just how boned we are if the sun ever decides to just straight-up disappear.    If you hate werewolves you can blow up the moon.  Boom.  No more werewolves; that's half of the twilight problem solved.You can decide to say ""Screw you Jupiter, get out of here I hate you!"" because Jupiter's gotten too fat and is doing nothing but loafing around outside the asteroid belt.  However afterwards you might realise you kind of miss Jupiter because suddenly everything's gone a little too wonky and you just want to go back to the good old days of orbiting carelessly around the sun until the sun gets tired of your♥♥♥♥♥♥or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ celestial-body decides to barge on in and ruin everything.

												Not to bad of a game but not much to it what you see is really what you get and the achievement don't even get me started on this one. Biggest reason I would not recommend this game is mostly because of the simple fact that it tends to crash or bug out more than it plays. You can make small changes but some stuff will just cause errors and force you to restart the whole universe in short a new game.			",397,105,22,75,96,4,99

												I finally learned, while playing this game, that I do not like sandbox games.It's really cool for people who don't mind tinkering around. You get to be a god for a bit, but you also have to really understand the interface and the numbers you're tossing around in order to really make the magic happen. The tutorials are a great help... but it is my personal opinion that tossing planets around is far more enjoyable in an RPG.That being said, true-blue sandboxers will totally dig it. The only limitation this game has is the patience of the player.			",38,12,3,9,4,0,0

												Astronomy is something everyone is atleast a little interested in at some point.Universe Sandbox is just that; a sandbox. Create amazing backdrops of galaxies from your imagination, solar systems you've seen on TV, make many planets circle each other in a beautiful symbiotic orbi- SMASH EVERYTHING.USandbox gives an amazing amount of freedom to bring the universe and all it's physics to it's pitiful little knees. Warp those galaxies, create super-massive black holes to suck every little asteroid into it's singularity-future. The graphical and mathmatical demands on your computer can be taxing at times (>250 galaxies into one cataclysmic result) but oh what a beautiful sight it is to behold. Not a game as such, the achievements are more jokes than anything - but the time-based ones are very possible once you realize how fun it is being -god-.(Also, the 3D options and customization are out of this world - literally..)

												I recommend staying away from this game.I bought it for $1.5 and I regret my choice.The mechanism is bad and you will get a diffrent result by doing the same thing over and over again.I turned up the speed of the game to move 1 year in 1 second, and it turns out that Mercury would leave our solar system in 2016. I tryed the same thing again (I didn't change anything but the speed) and Earth just flew away at the year of 2011.The game have potential, but since it came out a few years ago and since then none of those bugs were fixed I don't believe they'll ever be fixed.

												This is not really a game, more like simulation tool. Maybe this should be labelled as software instead of game.The good:+ Great visualisation of many calestial phenomenon.+ Fun way to study astronomy and astrophysics.The bad:- Use of Euler algorithm and RK4. Euler algorithm have way too large error accumulation while RK4 is too slow. I would rather use Numerov algorithm. It is very much faster.- Crash on random basis.- No idea if it is just me, there is no sound or music and it is pretty boring.This review will be updated as I use them more.

												Okay, for the record I did enjoy this program ( I hesitate to use the word ""game"" as it really isn't one). It's fun messing around with star systems and galaxies, but even that runs a bit stale after a while. The physics interactions are alright, but they all seem a bit bland, and they never actually *show* any difference on the planet, instead you're just left to assume something changed based on a few numbers going up or down. It seem they're making an improvement on this in the new version however. Honestly I'd say this simulation is a no go. It's fun, but it won't last long for gamers, and for someone who enjoys physics, you'll soon learn it's physics interactions are really rather superficial. I'd suggest getting the new version coming out sometime in the near future, as it seem to be fixing many of these issues I have with it. As this stands now however... you'd have to be one diehard astronomy enthusiast to play this for more than 2-3 hours.			",58,11,0,17,13,0,20

Don't think you can call it a game, but's it's a real nice accessible universe simulator.			",645,229,21,89,86,5,93

												I love this game. It is somewhat educational and fun if you enjoy just messing around. It's exactly how it is advertised, just a neat way to mess around with astrological objects at whatever depth you prefer. You can really get into it and create a detailed universe or you can simply try to get two planetary bodies to collide. It's all up to you! The controls and views can be a little tricky at first, though you get the hang of it.			",114,38,1,20,9,1,9

												I've tried out many Space Simulators ever since I messed around with Celestia in High School roughly a decade ago. Universe Sandbox's gimmick is that each object uses physics. Smash planets together or throw an extra sun into the Solar System's playground to watch every orbital object get thrown out of wack. If you're a veteran of Space Simulators like me, it's likely you'll only find the gimmick entertaining for  oh so long until you eventually grow bored of it. Recommend buying the game only if its under $5.			",261,40,2,38,20,2,36

Otherwise, it's nowhere even close to an actual game to recommend.			",71,5,0,18,5,2,16

												If you have any interest in astonomy and physics this a ""game"" for you. While it's not actually a game it teaches you a thing or two about astrophysics and how things in the universe work. i really like playing with the simultor and setting up my own simulations. Watching the pre-created ones are a novelty for awhile just to see what does what and what changes affect what. Buy this ONLY if you have more then a passing interest in astrophysics and astronomy. Oh, it likes to crash one startup. ALOT. But if you hit start normally then it should work fine till they patch it.			",281,89,1,57,31,2,30

												This is, though not an original ""game"", quite a good one. It's a universe simulator, quite obviously, where you take a pre-existing area in space and change whatever variables you want. Watch the subtle effects on the rest of the solar system as you place another earth in orbit, or anything like that.Yet, if I had to describe this game in one word, it would be; Hilarious.Increase the Gravitational Constant to several million billion times its current value, then watch all the planets freak out and run away from each other.Best of all is the collision. One of the settings makes it so that when two objects collide, the bigger absorbs the smaller, gaining its mass.This is the only game in which I have, or could concievably dream of, encountering the following scenario.I threw Earths at my enlarged Mega-Earth to make it bigger, but I threw too many Earths that they formed their own Mega-Earth, absorbing the first one. And I was okay with it, because wut.			",218,44,1,34,29,2,50

You can treat it like a game (which I often do,) but it's not. It's sort a fun thing to play around with. It can be really glitchy at times (often to the point where the simulation just stops.) But if you can get it to work then it's a brilliant simulation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have time to burn and like to watch galaxies collide, then this is the game simulator for you. Its fun if you are not any particular time to play a serious game or dedicate an hour or two invest. You start off with the pre-made Sol solar system that runs you through a tutorial. You can then have fun either enjoying pre-made scenarios, or have open nothingness to place a glaxay or five to watch gravity work. You have the option to speed up time, slow it down, or pause it to get a full effect of what you are doing. There is no objective, it is completely a sandbox do anything you want within the game. The only down side I have for this game, which might be in part because of my pc, I have found myself in situations where I have too many particles flying around all at once that it causes the programe to failsafe when it crashes. No big deal, I just tend to do it a lot.			",46,2,1,11,26,0,11

												Comparing this to SpaceEngine is unfair, but I'll do it anyway. Universe Sandbox excels at:-Editing / Creating new Celestial Bodies-Creating ""funny"" objects and modifying the characteristics of planetoids and other bodies.-Viewing a skybox of the universe that never changes.-Crashing and lagging out 24/7.SpaceEngine excels at:-Viewing the viewable universe and local group.-A much more advanced movement palette.-Beautifully rendered nebulae and planetary atmospheres.-Native post-processing support.-It's free.-Crashing and lagging out 24/7.So basically, get Universe Sandbox if you want to crash galaxies into one another or create the star system of your favorite RPG.Forget this and get SpaceEngine if you just want to explore the universe.

												Was a pretty fun game until I discovered the 3D mode.  Absolutely epic with that feature turned on.  It's a very useful tool to visualize some of the realistic attributes of space like extreme distances and just how long it takes for cause and effect to take place.  However I find that the physics engine itself is a bit broken; if you load a simulation and just leave it to its own devices, suddenly out of nowhere a planet will go flying out of the system.  Also, it's neat to see galaxies collide and fly apart... but we know for a fact their gravity will eventually create one system instead of a mess that never reconstitutes.  Needs updating.

												Excellent sandbox for playing around with planets, galaxies, etc.  You're able to change the dynamics of the global bodies with regards to rotation, gravity, orbit, etc.  You can create your own universe, and experiment to see how your universe reacts to changes.  You can also use models already in the game (like our Solar system for instance), and change the dynamics to see what effects you'd have (Ie: increasing mars gravity so that it's twice, three times, 10 times that of the sun).  Just a fun game.I wish I had more time to play around with it.  When I do have the time to play, I'm enjoying the game for hours.  The game's worth playing... once you bought it on sale.

												I really loved Universe Sandbox. This simulation was crazy! I loved just looking at the stars and their distances and the vastness that they cover. Just contemplating how far and how big the universe is is scary. But, at the same time it's inspiring and gave me awe. Awe at the complexity of our solar system, of the stars, of the planets. Even though the feeling of loneliness encommpassed me during this simulation, I still felt meaning in my life. I felt like I was lucky. Lucky to even look at the universe we live in and know about it. ""We are a way for the universe to know itself"". - Carl Sagan			",13,1,0,9,3,0,1

												Let me preface my review with this statement: Universe Sandbox is NOT a game, or at least not in any real, traditional sense. Now that I got that out of the way, I think that Universe Sandbox is indeed fun yet educational & should be in everyone's Steam library, especially if you have at least a mild interest in space, physics, and/or from time to time asked yourself miscellaneous ""what if..."" questions. Ever wonder what things would be like if you crushed our sun into a black hole? Ever wanted to see multiple black holes orbit each other? Want to recreate Tantooine with it's twin suns? Well, you can find out (or do) all that and more with Universe Sandbox. All in all it's just plain ol' fun to just screw around with, and seeing as there's real science & physics behind it, you just may learn something while doing so.			",754,165,36,79,51,14,83
