												I fell in love with Zeus, Master of Olympus as a child and had a problem finding a copy of the game. Then someone told me about Children of the Nile on a message board when I was talking about how much I loved Zeus. This is a worthy successor, a very well done game. Simply amazing! I have wasted countless hours playing this game. I've had it for a while and the game is very well made. It is a city-building game, and one of the few that are great. Children of the Nile and Tilted Mill had definatly rose the bar on quality city-building games, so much that I get disappointed by others and come crawling back.This game is well worth it. Very well worth it.			",11,2,0,7,8,0,3

												Though this game is a bit old, it is still a gem of a city builder!  SOme of the visuals are stunning, the colors and the way the light changes the pyramids from pink to blue, however don't zoom on any faces, cause everyone in Tilted Mills Egypt got hit with the ugly frying pan.  But watching the sun break over your Palace while the glistening glass ribbon that is the nile rises up every flood season  is a beautiful sighGameplaywise this was the city builder that broke the mold and allowed free plaecment of buildings, by which I mean that there are no market walkers, no building ranges, the only limit to the layout of your city is the distance between things so feel free to build for beauty rather than utility and its is rather difficult to badly screw upI highly reccomend this game for those who like a calm and beautiful city builder10/10			",43,9,0,27,37,0,8

												This is a great ancient city builder that has a lot of depth. There is a unique focus on the citizens. With every little Egyptian in the town modelled and accounted for, you can track their daily rounds as they shop, work or relax. Through them, you gain a level of connection to the buildings and settlement that is missing in other city builders and you want to provide for them and not just plop down buildings and infrastructure. Just like in Ancient Egypt, the seasons with day/night cycles are important and integral to the game and the monuments are big commitments but fascinating. Great little game that deserves more.

												This is a game you are meant to spend as much time as possible with, souly on one map, to achieve anything.  You need to have several spare tombs for your pharoh as well as he can die suddenyl without warning (I had one pharoh die two years after his father died and didn't have a tomb ready because of it).  You need to establish the school, then healthcare, funeral and temple buildings quickly (I do it in this order as the school is basically the first thing you need to get more graduates to power all other buildings that require them).  You need a large low class population established by the time you reach a point where no more villagers are on the map to milk people from.  I tend to build all 4 types of buildings farms, labourers, soliders and servents for this reason even if I don't need them.  If you don't have more then half your population as low class, you may find slowly over time your Low class population disappears, and as their population works the entire city... You can easily end up with an econimic crisis on your hand as there won't be enough Low guys to fuel the class descent systme from low to high society.  So you have to make sure tyour middle class populance never goes above more then half the size of the lower.  Likewise, at no point should your high class guys take over more then 1/4 or 1/5 of the population of middle. Also despite the games advice that you must locate buildings close to the source of raw materials they use, you can really put them anywhere on the map.  Only a few will greatly be impacted by this when they can get to a template or healthcare building in time.  Some buildings like shops can use the exchange, saving the need to worry where in the city they are placed.  For others like perfume makers who gather their sources, honestly, they get their resources from 4 possible sources so they may spent days walking all over the map making careful placement almost impossible.  Other then this... Building as many small tombs as possible keeps the nobles happy as they need tombs as well as pharoh an there are no consquences if a royal family member dies (not pharoh) so you can forget about supply them with tombs (unless they are pharoh).  Brick layers and brick makers can more or less be placed anywhere on the map. They are essential tot he city, but by the time you have two dozen of them, most projects are then catered for forever.  You don't tend to need more then that because monuments tend to end up require large stones such as stele by the point you have a dozen or so brick makers working. Collecting taxes are almost not worth the cost of having an overseer... Especially in large cities where they will almost never be able to see every estate.  And tariffs are even worst as you can sometimes not get more then chicken feed. So I tend to ignore these.  If you have more then ample farms, pulling back some of the nobles food for the sake of the poor is not a worry and honestly?  The nobles numbers support the city via farms, loosing them means the city collaspses (it happened to me once).  It best they are allowed to keep as much food as possible even if the citixens of the city suffer becase of it. The current version of the game, however, is buggy.  Back in the day I never had any troubles with the game, thus, I can almost 100% put this down to modern OS.  The most it lasts for me is 2 hours.  As I said, this is an issue as you are meant to spend a day per mapat times... I recommend it, but bare the bugginess in mind.  Its truly unique as games.			",111,36,4,62,48,1,41

												This was a one-hit wonder from Tilted Mill. I played this game even before steam.  It's simple and not really much of a mico-manager sim like some city builders.The graphics are dated, but it still looks good, and the best part, is that it runs smooth. No money is needed, this allows for infinite ways to create an ancient egyptian city.Well worth it.			",40,6,1,23,26,0,26

												A great game for fans of city builders. A pyramid truly feels like an epic accomplishment after it takes 5 hours to build. It would be amazing if tilted mill released another expansion after all these years as the combat and population growth could use some reworking.If it goes on sale and you enjoy games like Sim city then you can't go wrong with this title.

												I started playing Children of the Nile in 2015 and ever since then it was pretty much fun it was hard at first but I really enjoyed the trying to build a pretty city in Egypt but if someone can help me show me how to build a better City all over the place I would have been so happy to get a high score I will be able to see if I can make a video if I'm able to with steam if I can find out how much it cost I love ancient Egypt so much I just wish I Was living  there .

												Cannot recommend this sorry old knock-off. As a kid I loved the Caesar/Pharoah/Zeus historical city building/management games, and I was hoping I could find a good substitute with Children of the Nile. Children of the Nile could have been fun if I weren't constantly being handicapped by goofy mechanics. Other issues aside, the prestige metric alone is ridiculous and game-breaking. It may look like Pharoah, but it has none of its polish. Save your money, you have been warned!			",5,3,0,4,5,0,0
