												My sim was very sad when his friend Carl passed away, so I ""resurrected"" Carl as a ghost so we could still chill together like old times. But then the dude wouldn't leave. I mean, I know he needed a place to crash, and I was happy to let him sleep on my couch, but he was the worst ****ing houseguest ever. He ate all my food (I still haven't figured out how ghosts eat), left dirty dishes all over, broke my shower and hogged my computer.And if that weren't enough, when I invited my girlfriend over for some quality woohoo time, Carl started flirting with her!! My sim went to bed alone, frustrated and ****ed off.Thanks for nothing, Carl, you ****ing ****blocking dirtbag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 is really fun and addictive! Still, it is important that buyers be aware of what they're actually getting prior to investing in this game. If you do not do a little research ahead of time, you may end up feeling disappointed once you begin to play. The Sims has always been a franchise built around DLC. If you are trying out Sims for the first time and you decide to only purchase the base game (to experiment and save some money), keep in mind that you will not be able to do many of the things you probably have seen in player videos and previews. That being said - I would suggest reading through the descriptions of the available DLC prior to making your purchase. Choose what might be worth investing in based upon what you hoped to get out of this game. For instance - are you simply looking to play around with one character - walk him/her through their daily life, get a job, climb the career ladder, etc? If so, the base game may work out just fine for you. If you're looking for more, you may want to choose a bundle, or purchase the game with some DLC, right away. Still, think carefully before spending your money. DLC for The Sims is relatively costly. If you know you would enjoy playing with cats, dogs, and horses, and engaging in outdoor seasonal activities - the main bundle (with generations, pets, and seasons) may be worth the expense. But, if you're more interested in traveling the world, creating vampires and witches, or living the college life, you're probably better off skipping the bundle and just buying The Sims 3 plus one additional DLC that meets your needs. In short - The Sims 3 is a great game - but you may be disappointed, or end up spending more than you'd like for content you do not need or care about, if you do not do some research before making your purchase.

												I love the Sims 3, I find it extremely fun and addictive. Now you're probably wondering why the big red thumbs down? Well... First of all, the game costs $400 for all the DLC and there are Micro-transactions! Micro-transactions should not be in games I pay for or in single player games! This is a complete waste of money, where I could buy about 30 games with $400 rather than getting a bunch of DLC that are a complete waste of money. I don't mind buying/paying for DLC, but when I have to pay for extra content to get the full experience, and it will cost me $400 when I have already bought the game and if I want to have couches, fridges, clothes, expansion packs, etc, it will cost real money, this just makes me question how stupid does EA think we are? I would recommend buying the game, but the DLC will make the game actually a lot better, so its recommended to buy the game on sale and pick it up for about $100. I sure as hell thought the game was fun and had a lot of things to do, but paying huge amounts of money into a game is way too much for me and I'm pretty sure for anyone else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Especially when considering that the next generation of the game has already been released. I understand offering additional content for a little extra, but The Sims 3 takes this way too far. Either make the expansions cheaper or offer more in each one, because they aren't worth $20 as they are now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started off with a tiny, one-room bungalow in a new neighbourhood. I had no job. I had no friends. All I had was my sole aspiration: to become a Forensics Specialist - Dynamic DNA Profiler. I spent every evening alone, playing chess into the early hours of the morning. I would paint random images throughout the day on my easel, stopping only to sate my appetite, or occasionally wash my bodily odour away. I didn't talk to anyone. I didn't need anyone. I just needed this job. I was going to be the best. And then that day came. I had reached the pinnacle of my profession. Finally I could stop worrying about my career and enjoy the finer things in life. But being at the top is perhaps the loneliness place you can be. I still had no friends. No lover. No relations of my own. I tried going out to community lots but by this time I was old and the youngsters found me creepy and odd. I once again found myself spending the days alone in my home, trying to be the best at everything. I'll show them! I don't need anybody! I've come this far on my own! But, whereas time had once been my greatest ally, it had now become my sole enemy. Yes, I was the best at all things. But I had no one to share it with. I sat alone in the place I had once called home, surrounded by all of my beautiful creations, and I felt even more miserable than at the start of it all.Now I'm going to try out this game.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EA has never updated this game to include a 64 bit executable, which means the game is restricted to 2GB of ram. Even after using a community patcher, the performance makes this game unplayable on a machine that should be well over the specs.I've tried the 64 bit community patcherDisabling the in-game storeTurn down the graphicsNothing helps.

												I have a couple hundred hours on disk version, back when this game was first releasedI can't believe what a microtransaction wasteland this game has become, I spend £6 on this game to be told ""LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF YOU DON'T HAVE"" and have it dangled in front of me whenever I'm creating a family, buying items for my home and building stuff.I do think the price is a pretty good deal for the amount of time you'll get out of it, but the base game is genuinely just showing you all this stuff you should buy, and it honestly gets extremely annoying. It's not really what I remember when I first started playing it, sure, it's the same game, but it's so full of ""LOOK AT THIS ITEM FOR 200 CREDITS""Also if you want all the expansions you'll have to part with a LOT of money, Sims is definitely one of my favourite franchises of all time, but the old ones didn't throw DLC in your face, sure, there was a metric f*ckton of expansions that you CAN buy, but it wasn't plastered all over the game.

												If you need to burn a few hours and have fun doing it, then this game is perfect for you. While the base game only has the basic game content, you can still spend hours building houses, making your Sims successful in life or hey, even killing them if that's what you're into. Each expansion adds hours of awesome stuff to lose yourself in, whether it be tons of new jobs with Ambitions or new types of characters with Supernatural, each one adds it's own little something.While the game is incredibly addicting, it also has lots of bugs. Some bugs have been around since the start, like the game crashing (happens mostly when you haven't saved for several hours and you just finished building your dream home), others only turn up when you start installing expansions or custom content, like the strechy babies and the hand-bowl (not actually sure where this comes from).So, yes, I recommend the game, but just be prepared for glitches, crashes and a slight addiction to new content.

 Should I buy The Sims 3? Even if you have mixed feelings about the simulation genre of games, I think every gamer should try out The Sims 3. It's normally 20 USD, but when it's on sale it's cheaper and worth buying. But all of these DLCs! How can I ever afford all of this for one game!? Try the main game first. If you hate it, don't buy any expansion sets. If you like it, maybe look into buying the ones that look good (Research them first!). If you love it and want more of it then I would still be careful as some expansion sets (Mostly the Stuff Packs) are NOT worth 20 dollars. Maxis is a good game studio (RIP), but EA are a bunch of greedy scumbags that would sell their mothers into slavery if it meant they could make a few extra bucks. Is it fun? Is there a point to the game? Much like Minecraft, the goal of the game isn't really set in stone. You do what you want to do in it. There are no rules or ways that you have to play it. If you want to create a family that goes through life with success, you can do it. If you want to make sims just to find ways to kill them, then you can do that too. There is quite a bit of customization and building in this game so go nuts.Some people will like it. Some people will hate it. Some won't get it. Some will see it as a glorified doll house (It is). I can't really explain exactly why I like it, but I guess it's because I like making people and doing things that I can't do in the real world such as making a fat unattractive socially awkward nerd get all of the ladies (It's not me, I swear ^_-) Also I like making people I know and even some famous people. Yesterday I made a somewhat famous youtuber (MrRepzion) and he's currently moved in across the street with his gay black lover (He's not really gay irl, but it's fun to think he is). He is now currently becoming a blogger on the internet with his lover Uhuru.  OMFG SUMMER SALE! 5 dollar an xpac! What should I do? Well if you were on the fence about buying an xpac, buy it now, because this is about the price this stuff is actually worth. The EA store items (Which you can see via the game launcher) are not worth paying for even when on a sale. The stuff packs are also pretty lame. Get the expansion packs as they add in the most to the game (There are 11). That's around 60 dollars (Showtime is not on sale! HOWEVER if you buy it with the main game it's only 7 bucks)  This or The Sims 4 In my opinion The Sims 4 is a good game, but a bad Sims game. It takes several steps back even if you compare the base games with no expansions. The graphics are better, the sims are more detailed, and the social aspect (of the sims) is better.  Everything else is 15 steps backwards. No open world, No in depth color or patterns designs. Fewer community lots. Fewer sim traits to pick from. Mods are not supported well for The Sims 4. Worst of all they are asking 40 dollars for the expansion sets. (20 dollars for the extra item sets). If 20 dollars wasn't worth it for The Sims 3 expansion sets, what makes EA think that 40 is more fair?  Oh yeah that's right, EA doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They just want your money.  They even are willing to sacrifice their development companies to get that money.  So uh... The Sims 3?...Oh yes! It's a fun game. EA doesn't deserve your hard earned money, but this is a good game nonetheless. Take advantage of the 75% markdown.Also there is a large collection of mods you can use.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I find it extremelly hard to recommend this game to anyone. I got it for my girlfriend; rather, I got an 1/8th of this game for my girlfriend. The full game, DLC and all, is roughly $420, microtransactions included. I can't imagine that production costs were so incredibly high that EA needed to charge me an entire paycheck to play a decent, addictive (but far from extraordinary) life simulator. I didn't know that I could hate EA anymore than I already did, but I do.The fact that there is a Sims 4 with a similar business model means that taking advantage of its customers seems to be a viable way for EA to make money. I urge everyone to spend as little on this game as possible. Hell, just torrent the game. It's single player, after all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In The Sims 3 you create and control simulated people and watch them live their lives. It's a good life simulator. Perhaps a little too good, because just like with real life, it will destroy your hopes and dreams.When The Sims 3 works it can be a fun game, but unfortunately that isn't very often. The game is notorious for lagging, stuttering, freezing, crashing, and having all sorts of other game-breaking bugs. If you don't believe me, just Google it. I've spent more time trying to fix the game than actually playing it.The Sims 3 becomes frustrating even before you start a game. Depending on your system, and which DLC you have installed, it can take several minutes to several hours just to get into the actual game. But this is mostly the fault of the game itself, as even high-end systems experience the same problems running The Sims 3. In fact, the loading times are so long that the developers added a barely functioning mini-game to play while you wait for the game to load. The Sims 3 has THE WORST loading times I've ever experienced in a game, and that's saying a lot.Speaking of worst, The Sims 3 also has THE WORST camera controls I've ever experienced in a game. The camera controls aren't just clunky and clumsy. They slide around even after you let go of the button, causing the camera to overshoot the intended target. Other times it feels like the game is actively fighting back at every key press, pushing the camera in a different direction from the one you're moving it in.To make matters even worse, you CANNOT customize the controls in The Sims 3. Not at all. This isn't even a console port. This game was designed for the PC, yet you cannot customize the controls. There is no option to do so in the options menu. There isn't even an option to look at the keyboard controls so you know which button does what. And the Q key quits the game, so be careful.To add insult to injury, EA has made The Sims 3 one of it's biggest cash cows. Not only are there numerous over-priced expansion packs, and even more garbage that EA wants you to buy from their online store, but they constantly remind you of these products via in-game pop-up advertisements. That's right... Pop-up advertisements in an offline single-player game. It's utterly disgusting. And when the DLC does go on sale, it's usually cheaper to buy directly from EA's online store rather than from Steam.I just can't understand how any professional game designer or publisher thought it was acceptable to release a game in this broken state. The Sims 3 has been out since 2009 and these issues have never been fixed. And now The Sims 4 is coming out, so I doubt The Sims 3 will be getting better anytime soon.EA and the developers of The Sims 3 should feel nothing but shame over this poorly-coded excuse for a game. It's no wonder that EA keeps winning the award for the worst company in America. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay actual money to play The Sims 3. I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you are a masochist.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm 21 years old and it's time to make a fresh start. I leave my home town in search of a new life following my dream of becoming a world class culinary artist. I have near enough no money to my name, but with the help of some sort of demi-God I'm suddenly drowning in cash. I buy a beautiful new home and join the local bistro to kick start my career. After just my first week I have plenty of acquaintances and decide to throw a party to deepen my relationships and make some life long friends. The party is going smoothly, and I even get close to a girl and give her the old one-two in my way too big for just me bed. She stays the night and the next day I propose. There's no going slow in this town. Bad news; turns out she's my boss, I gained a step daughter, and she's also pregnant. She soon hits the elderly stages and I end up having to sleep with what looks like a dried up ballsack. I'm still young and have a granny for a wife and a baby who definitely isn't short of being ""special"". Not to mention my step daughter hates me. Is my life cliché? I wouldn't let it end like this. I throw party after party, befriend a highschool girl, and once she hits the ripe age of 18 I snag my first kiss with her; all under the watchful eyes of my wife. Needless to say, we're divorced now, and for some reason the little♥♥♥♥♥♥who caused it is no longer interested. That's okay. Time goes by and I bed a tubby tess in my ex-wifes bed, before throwing rejection in her face. My new target is the maid. She has too much to drink and I take her to bed in, you guessed it, my ex-wifes bed. My ex-step daughter walks in on us so I teach her a few choice words on her way out. I decide to marry the maid and have another child with her. A week later I have a little black baby girl, and my first daughter is a teenager now. Although I sleep with my wife and ex-wife in the same room, things are going good. Or so I thought. My new maid wife turns elderly and I've only just hit 30. My life takes a weird turn next, as the ex-step daughter who once hated me is now coming onto me hard. I say ♥♥♥♥ it, and bed her. My maid wife catches me and we get divorced, so naturally I marry the step daughter while she's in her prime, and of course we need another baby. My first wife is now my mother-in-law, and my daughter is also my sister-in-law. Not that she cares. No matter how many wives I go through, my two daughters are still my best friends. Because they're the only two people in this world I can't ♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I'd like to recommend this, it probably isn't worth your money. Buying everything for the game as it stands will run you about $280, and it'll only be a few months time before EA shovels out another asinine expansion and charges another $40 for it.In a few years time when The Sims 4 is being promoted really heavily and this drops down to a remotely reasonable price level, then go ahead and pick this game up, preferably on some sale in some discounted bundle.

												I made a guy, met a girl, got married, had kids, got some mods, and well it ended with me, my wife, and my next door neighbor  eating my kids........................................... So if you're into that kind of stuff get this game.  Also if you have no life of your own you can make one on this game.  Though eventually you will ruin that life and end up eating your kids.................................  Another thing you can create a rich, successful, and happy family.......................  But like I said you will always end up eating your kids, okay maybe that's just me, but still in this game I found some of the most fun I ever had.  Mostly bloody, gory, depraved, child-eating fun but still fun nonetheless. If I were to give this game a rating I would have to stop eating my kids for a minute so I won't.  Enjoy and by enjoy I mean enjoy eating your kids because we all do it sometime or another.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One day he wanted a break so he decided to send all of the children out of the house to the community pool across town. Later that night all of the kids had come back except one. I went to look for him to find him still at the community pool at 10 PM. He was one of two people at the pool, the second was an old man in a lawn chair watching the child from the other side of the pool. So instead of coming right home the kid ran into the forest to chase a parrot that he then made into a pet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 will offend long-time gamers with its DLC-overload marketing strategy, inefficient coding that makes the game slog evenly on laptops and powerful machines (especially if you make the mistake of attempting to mod this game). Even when its exploitation and laziness isn't shoving itself in your face, the gameplay contradicts the primary appeal of the game (it's a sandbox game that takes you away from its sandbox to clean your toilet, cook a meal, go to work, and do other ""watch a bar fill up"" menial chores far too often). If you're a creative type, you'll likely still have fun with this game, as the sandbox elements, while contradicted by the gameplay style, are quite extensive, and impressive if you're willing to put your time and money into them. But I've already sunk too large a portion of my life into this game with inadequate return on the investment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My sim was a broke♥♥♥♥♥scrub, and so instead of getting a job themselves, Winston the pet cat got employed to help keep food on the table. At some point, my sim DID get a job. But the cat was still making more money.My neighbors were rude, and swam in my pool without even being invited, so I walled them off around my pool and watched as they die the way they lived. Swimming in someone else's pool.I made friends with the burglar that broke into my house. While they were in the process of robbing me. And then eventually I went and invited the burglar to my wedding.Later on my sim burned to death because she was too concerned with eating a bowl of cereal and didn't even care the kitchen she was standing in was consumed by flames.This game is like real life. Only 100 times more dysfunctional. It's hilarious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 without any expansion packs... Is buggy, frustrating, slow and really really wants to sell you additional content with real money with every minute you play it.When something glitches up and renders your game broken, frequently the only way to fix it is to delete your saves and start all over again, completely undoing the work and time you invested in your sims and your town.And yet, still, I have not come across another game that offers what The Sims franchise offers in terms of an engaging, engrossing and detailed life simulator.In short, The Sims is like an unfaithful lover who does what no other lover you know does, but always breaks your heart. Really all I can recommend is not getting hooked in the first place.			",110,36,3,9,11,2,18

												The Sims 3:Positives:+ Purchase a house for your family or build and design your own with hundreds of customisation options. Buy pools, decorative garden plants, televisions, computers, exercise machines, kitchen appliances, cars, toys for toddlers, sculptures, pet animals (DLC)....the list is huge! + Work as a master criminal, a journalist, celebrity or even a detective + more! Attend University to further your studies and become a video game designer, sports agent or arts appraiser (DLC). Go travelling to Egypt, France and China (DLC). This game is packed with plenty to do.+ Many different skills for your sims to level up, science, cooking, athleticism, logic, charisma etc, so you can have a very diverse gameplay experience.+ Optional quests or objectives will become available from schooling, work and elsewhere, allowing you to participate in one-off opportunities with rewards.+ Several neighbourhoods to play in, each with a unique layout.+ There's a large amount of playtime in the Sims 3 for players of all sorts. I managed to get over 100 hours out of it.Negatives:- Micromanagement is very unresponsive, Sims refuse to complete workplace objectives over and over and decide what they want to do themselves, instead of what you've told them. High free will means Sims react to basic needs problems like feeding a baby or bathing themselves, but it also results in ignoring your human commands repeatedly, which gets infuriating after a few hours.- While I acknowledge graphics aren't a major focus of Sims gameplay, it could definitely be improved. Aesthetically, this game is disappointing.- The game is quite expensive, even though it's now 8 years old (as of 20/02/2017). DLC is also pricey, so make sure you absolutely want this game before paying in full, or wait for a sale.- Bad pathing by Sims, they don't interact with the environment well and get stuck in certain spots. Could be much smoother.  - Despite the vastness of Sims 3, it can become boring after awhile. Once you build a mansion filled with the most luxurious objects money can buy and had a family, there's really not much else to do. This game has a cycle of repetition, whereby you continue to do the same tasks over and over, just in different ways and styles. Sure, the kids in your family grow up and you're able to control their lives, but it's like starting from scratch again, where's the sense of accomplishment in that? It's the balance between fun and repetitive content which the Sims 3 suffers from. There's a real conflict here, with the many facets of variability trying to shine, but then a monotonous feeling sometimes overshadowing it. Overall Score: 7.5/10 The Sims 3 is a nice, relaxing game with many interesting features. For fans of the series, it's really worth checking it out. For those that are new to the game, I recommend grabbing this too, just get it cheap and be aware of the flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a stupid amount of DLC in this game. DLC that could have been free or in the game to begin with. It comes off as really greedy. There are even fixes for the base game in other DLC. They're even denying you fixes for the base game in their DLC.The base game is just decent. I'd say it's not worth the purchase nowadays unless you invest in the rest of the dlc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy moly, I never thought the sims could get better, but when i got the base game i was absolutely blown away. i didnt last more than a few days without wanting to get all of the other packs to date (and i did just that) . pricey compiled, but so worth it if you are a simmer. not going to get the sims 4 just yet, i want to finish playing the sims 3 completely, with more than 700 hours put into it, the packs i have, and those that i have yet to get, im sure i will probably spend well over another 2 years playing happily on sims 3, besides, there will be time for sims 4, its not a bad idea to wait out all the bugs n stuff... if you like things like design and fashion, this is like playing house, on steroids! LOL! (dont do drugs :3) ... but seriously, i absolutely recommend this game for simmers as well as anyone who likes taking the time, anyone who likes to ""level things up"" and putting in the effort in learning how to play a new game, its alot to learn, but once you do, you will be able to play any sims game. if you do decide to get it add me, thanks.

The only annoying thing is all of the expansions, but as The Sims 4 just came out, maybe the prices will drop on some of those.

												After Watching Youtubers play Sim games I wanted to play even more each episode that came out. Finaly I got it and had so much fun. I was having a family, trying new things, and it was all going great. So far this looks like it should be a recomended, but there is one thing that just annoyed me so much. So as I played I wanted to make a shop and sell robots, how ever I couldn't. Turns out I needed a DLC. So I then decide I want to make a bar. Can't do it, need a DLC. I want to be a rockstar. Can't do need DLC. Pet owner, need DLC, Adventurer, need DLC and so on and so on. The game may be great but it is just as great as an unfinished game without all the DLC. I really don't want to spend $400 (or if it's on sale about $180) or so just so I can be what I want in the game. I mean for F*** sakes, some DLC it's more expensive to buy than the actual game! so if your not prepared to spend lots of money on one game then your gonna have to keep looking for another game.

I've tried all the tweaks and settings suggested on forums and dark corner's of the internet to no avail.

												If Sims 4 didn't exist, I might be giving this a negative review. As it stands, I've played The Sims 4, it sucks, I hate it, it's a step backwards, so here I am reviewing The Sims 3 again.PROS:-Graphics are decent, the default hairstyles and clothes aren't horrific like they are in The Sims 2-Still fun without expansion packs-Obviously tons of customization-Lots of playability-Open-world, unlike other Sims games-Can chat with the grim reaperCONS:-The expansion packs!!!-Oh my god the expansion packs!!!! Why do they cost so much!!!!-I like the face/body sculpting idea from TS4, wish that had been a thing-As others have mentioned, the game sort of destabilizes over time. The game lags and the visuals ""catch"" while the sound keeps going. You have to wait a sec until it fixes itself. Happens more the longer you play in a particular neighborhood-Not all the DLC is good. I've tried all of them and some of them are a waste of time and money. I find the item packs pointless as I can just get items from modding, some of them are super unstable or just plain boring. Island Paradise (??) is pretty unstable - I still play it because I can deal with it. I recommend University Life, Supernatural, and Pets if you're going to buy some. WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE ON SALE THOUGH!!I still recommend the game!! I've dumped so many hours into TS3. By far my favorite sims gameEDIT: I played it a ton before I bought it on steam :) Disregard the amount of hours I have on here and don't be rude, thanks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Five years, eight expansion packs, and eight ""stuff"" packs after The Sims 2. Considering all the development and content released for The Sims 2, it seems strange that The Sims 3 could be anything more than a retelling of the same story. However, with the addition of some new features and improvements on older ones, The Sims 3 may just be the best game in the series. Despite its upgraded graphics and features, The Sims 3 very much remains true to fans of the series. Veterans will have absolutely no problem diving in and getting to it. The user interface has remained mostly unchanged, which is a good thing considering how well it manages to take the complexities of the game and making them manageable.The game is also easy to learn for the newcomers. A brief tutorial helps introduce the user interface and features to the player, and it does an efficient job of it too. Once completed, ""lessons"" are available to the player in case they ever need a refresher. But, to The Sims 3's credit, these helpful tutorials don't even seem necessary considering how sleek and intuitive the game's controls are.Once again, the developers chose not to deviate from the familiar when it came to how players control the action in the game. Managing your sims is mostly down to using the mouse and following through dialogue bubbles and text trees. Keyboard shortcuts provide a quicker alternative to those who care to memorize them. The sims are governed by six needs in this third edition, as opposed to eight in earlier versions. The removal of ""Environment"" and ""Comfort,"" coupled with a minor tweaks to how the needs fluctuate, results in players being able to enjoy the many intricacies and events in the game much more than in previous titles.The visuals and music are a step up from previous Sims games. Not only are the music tracks varied and interesting, but the player can choose which tracks get played and when. If you'd prefer to hear the indie tracks while in general ""living mode,"" then make it so; if you'd rather hear rock tracks while your sim is at work, you can. The Sims 3 doesn't boast the greatest visuals out there, but its host of new features and gameplay options certainly pick up the slack - what little there is.Of all the new features and improvement that can be found in The Sims 3, perhaps the most talked and enthused about is the persistent towns in which your sims will live. Over are the days in which loading screens interrupted your sims' trips to work or movies. Now, players have the option of zooming out and in to any place in town, allowing them to see what is taking place. You'll be able to see other sims jogging on the sidewalks, sitting on benches in the park, or hanging out at the beach. Traveling is no longer a matter of leaving one area and suddenly appearing in another. Your sim can drive, call a cab, or even jog to the location if you choose. One minor drawback to the persistent town is how taxing it can be on the player's computer. Rendering an entire town at once is no small feat, but avoiding it altogether because of that would have been a mistake.There were also improvements made to the ""create-a-sim"" tools. Players can now customize their sims' initial physical characteristics, clothing styles, and personality traits to a level of detail greater than before. Varied hairstyles, clothing options for different occasions, and customizable patterns and color options are just a few examples of the ways in which players can create unique-looking sims. Once finished with the appearance aspect, however, The Sims 3 has added personality traits, which allow players to determine how their sim behaves and reacts with other sims. Picking certain traits unlock different options for communicating with other sims and can even impact what types of careers the sim will excel at. And, for every positive trait there is a negative trait, so it is entirely possible to create some truly diabolical or demented sims.The rewards system in The Sims 3 is also a nice change. When creating sims, players will have to select a long-term goal, which the sim will strive to meet. Moreover, during the game players will be able to choose up to four short-term goals for their sim to complete. Some goals are as simple as taking out the trash or reading a book, while others may be a little more complex, such as discovering another sim's personality traits. When completed, each short-term goal adds life-time happiness points to the sim's happiness meter. Once enough happiness points are accumulated, the player can spend them on lifetime rewards that can benefit the sim. For example, accumulating 10,000 points allows the player to unlock the ""Steel Bladder"" reward, which means their sim won't have to go to the bathroom as often. There is no penalty incurred for not completing a short-term goal, and even if a goal has been set, it can be dropped and replaced by another one at any time, allowing players to change their minds and still dictate what happens.Despite all of the added features and persistent world, The Sims 3 oddly leaves out the intimate view of your career. When players send their sim off to work, they can watch as far as the door to the building, at which point the sim enters and the player is given an aerial view of the building until the sim's shift ends. Behavior options are available while the sim is at work, which affects the productivity and chances of promotion. For example, as a police officer, the player can set their sim to ""Chat with Partner,"" which improves their relationship with their partner, but doesn't increase their chances of promotion as quickly as say setting their behavior to ""Work hard."" This system does give the player some control over their sims' career on a day-to-day basis, but seems strange in comparison to the amount of depth found in other areas.Another interesting and mildly irritating limitation is how a sim can only have one career at a time, despite whether work shifts overlap or not. If one shift ends at 2 p.m. and the other begins at 3 p.m., why should you not be able to work two careers at once if you want? Sure, working two jobs in real life isn't fun at all, and maybe this was the thinking behind limiting a sim to one career, but if you want to make your sim a work-a-holic with two jobs and no social life, then the option should be there.While The Sims 3 continues the tradition of a solely offline and single-player experience, the continuation of social networking features remains as strong as ever. The Sims 3 launcher allows players to do a variety of things such as upload their own content, including individual sims, objects, houses, public buildings, and entire towns. Players have the option of creating their own player page, which includes a blog and an area to display all their created content for sharing.The Sims 3 was a huge undertaking and it shows. The core gameplay remains largely unchanged, with minor tweaks and improvements that unquestionably add to the fun. Enhanced visuals and an expectedly good soundtrack excel at creating truly immersive moments, especially when moving around the largely persistent world. Even though there are areas that lack the level of detail and depth of the game as a whole, they still provide options to the player that keep the game from running into issues, which makes them identifiable as areas for improvement rather than a complete overhaul.If you're a fan of the series, then The Sims 3 will deliver all that you've come to expect and throw in a ton of new ideas, even if the amount of extra toppings doesn't seem as vast. Newcomers to the series take note: if you've ever thought about playing The Sims, but were overwhelmed by the many expansion and ""stuff"" packs on the shelves, fear not; The Sims 3 is your window of opportunity.

												♥ You can do anything.Want to have a polygamist family? Want to roll around in money? Want to travel to Egypt, steal treasure from tombs, and have an affair? With Sims 3, you can. If you only have the base game and none of the DLC's, you can easily get mods for the game that will add an endless amount of things: instant money, incest, custom jobs, etc. With Sims you can have the character live the life you imagine for them. ♥ Relationships.This is by far why I've played Sims 3 for as many hours as I've had. In Sims 3 you can find a boyfriend, marry him, cheat with his brother, and divorce - all in the same day. Sims 3 doesn't have morals and doesn't want you to have them either. For that reason, you can cheat as much as you want, have as many kids as you want, or embrace the single, celebrity rockstar life. If you want to have an arch nemesis and revel in kicking their trash can, you can. Or you can be the seemly modest grandmother who writes erotic tales at night and takes care of her grandchildren, plays chess with her husband at the park, and bask in your retirement during the day. ♥ Everything is up to you.From the design of the house to the look of your Sim to their likes and dislikes, you control anything and everything. You aren't limited in any area for even their needs you can control. If you use a cheat code, you can easily make their needs (hunger, sleep, etc) to 100% meaqning you'll have more time to focus on the fun aspects of their life. With Sims, the character is entirely in your hands. ✘ This game lags.A lot. It's known for crashing without warning, freezing at any vital moment, and can be quite fussy to run. I've learned that when you first launch the game - DON'T DO ANYTHING. Just let it play through the cutscene and go to the main menu. Don't try to skip it, don't try to rush it.The same goes for when it freezes and lags. Otherwise it's going to sulk and quit on you just when your Sim becomes famous or is about to have their baby. ✘ The base designs are...bleh.I used to think they were amazing - the blocky hair, the ill fitting clothes, the ugly looking earrings. However once I discovered the world of mods, I learned how awful the base items are. Unfortunately installing too many mods can severely lag your game - so you'll have to be strict about which ones are worth keeping and which aren't. ✘ There are bugs.A lot of them. University can cause errors with assigning you to ""study"" when you aren't enrolled in school, a Sim that is aging up can end up with their bones disjointed and their head all stretched, your Sim can decide they can't walk forwards because dust is in their way, etc. Overall the Sims 3 is by far the most beloved of all the games I've ever played, aside from Harvest Moon, and is a MUST play. Absolutely amazing as a simulator/choice game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: February 4, 2016
												This is a complete review for ts3 that will explain everything from buying the game to playing the game. Pease read:)      - Important quick info about my relationship with ts3 : I have all the dlcs, and most of the worlds from ts3 store, which I have bought on origin, before I was aware of steam. I have played over 4500 hours offline (due to limited internet). I own all the dlcs, and most of the store stuff.      - Should I get ts4 or ts3? : I currently own ts4 with 1 dlc. Below are the pros and cons for ts3 and ts4.         - Ts4 pros   1. Your sim can multitask   2. Their mood effects them more in their everday lives than in ts3.   3. CAS (create a sim) has better graphics, but your sims are less customizable than in ts3.   4. Creating your house is quicker when it comes to building walls, foundations, etc.         - Ts4 cons     1. The world is realitively small, and their is only a few small lots you can build on.    2. Their are no cars, and as of now they have still neglected to add toddlers to the game.     3. Their are more loading screens than on ts3 for xbox 360.    4. You can not see where your sim works, and traits are limited.        - Ts3 pros    1. Open world, you can edit every lot .    2. CAS comes with a lot of stuff to make your Sim family and simself.     3. The only loading screens in the game only pop up when you go to another town.     4.  Their is over 60 traits with just the basgame, so you can truly play with life.    5. Houses and community lots are fully customizable, and their is no limit other than your budget when building.     -  Ts3 cons      1. The game is addicting, and the possibilities are endless.     2. You can't walk on water.     - When buying the game should I buy on steam or origin? :    It is best to buy ts3 game series on steam, so that you can keep your favorite games at your favorite place. When you buy on steam some of the major benefits, are the sales and that when you buy ts3 on steam you can register the same game on origin, which virtually gives you 2 for the price of 1. When you decide you want to get the game I would recommend you save your money for the steam summer, or winter sale, so that of you don't like it, you don't have as big of a loss.   Now this is what I have to say about the game itself :      -  What does it mean when the game says Stuff pack vs. Expansion pack?       - There are 2 types of dlcs they sell for ts3 and ts4, stuff packs and expansion packs.        - Stuff packs - which normally come with more furniture and clothes.(occasionly some traits)      - Expansion packs - which comes with loads of new game content for your sims, and almost always comes with a new world for your Sims. Plus it adds a lot more stuff to CAS and build and buy mode. - Why are their so many negative reviews on the dlcs? :  Most of the reviews for the dlcs are of people who never truly looked into the game about whether or not they wanted to buy it, and the rest are mostly compliants about their pc not working. (Which is not because of ts3) This game runs great with all the dlcs for me, and all the dlcs enhance the gameplay with different chracteristics that I cant live without. What of game play is this game? :  It is not just building houses, and creating sims, its meant for you to show your creativity, and play with life. I would recommend you just buy the basegame or the game bundle to start with, and see if you enjoy the game! If you are also on the short side of cash, check out the tsr website for loads of free cas and house stuff.Must read!!  ➡ Do not think this game is innapropiate, because of inappropoate mods. Their is no nudity in this game, so please dont mess up this game with bad mods! The humor is great, the playing is great, and the friends are great,           - On the funny side : This is what happens when I play ts3 :  First 5 hours, I spend making my sims,  2 hours on my house, 1 hour in-game, and already my wife ended up starting an affair with the neighbor. I ended up getting divorced within an hour, and eventually died when trying to fix the dishwasher.      11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My fiancee and I are unable to have our own children yet. So I create us in this virutal reality world where we can get a college degree in two weeks, have a perfect gpa despite not showing up to class and just reading a book, making it into level 10 of the music career within four days, and setting the kitchen on fire just making a salad. First time we try for a baby I ended up having triplets. So far most of the town bears our family last name and pretty soon it will be just an Alabma simuation game. 10/10 would make the city inbred again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As always. The Sims 3 is a fantastic simulation game where you can create your sim, get married, become the president who raises a son who ghost busts on the weekend. Lock the president in a basement to die during a TV repair and then live out your daughter's life as a professional chef.The Sims has always been a great series and one of EA's staples. But I give it a thumbs down, just like I'll give any Sims game a thumbs down because you are basically paying for 1/20 of the game. The other 19 parts arriving in DLC downloads that cost the same amount as the base game EACH. At the time of this review, the game is $19.99. Round that to 20 and multiply by 20 and if you want the full game... you'll be paying a whopping $400.I love the Sims. I truly do, but I do not recommend giving money to this company. Not when they expect their consumers to dish out 400 dollars for a single game. It's base is playable, of course... but it's not worth it when all of these $20 DLC's are taunting you along the way.

												The sims 3 is a wonderful game... incomplete, but good. i love playing this game and the PREVIOUS games. This game is incomplete without SOME of the dlcs that actually increase what can be done in the sims. The sims has basically become a cash grab but that was to be expected.... what i didnt expect is how far they would actually take it. the dlcs that only actually adds some more things (that could have been included in the game originally) are all the same price as THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. you might think ""Oh this is 20 dollars, obviously it must have added so much its like a different game! i better buy that♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and you would be wrong! the dlc adds things that improve the game but are no longer worth the same price. drop the price of some to 10 dollars (the really essential, late night, seasons... etc) the ones that make the game much better and the little ones that are practically worthless to 5 dollars... why should I, or anyone have to pay 20 dollars for some MINOR changes to the game.

												Sims 3 is a competent life simulation. it's somewhat heavy on the cleaning, homework, bad smells and bad moods for my taste, but that can be modified through programmed in cheat codes, along with money, housing, etc.  the reason I do NOT recommend the game is because the game constantly pushes the player to buy stuff inside the game for MORE MONEY.  CONSTANTLY.  Any time you add a couch or flower pot to your little sims' house, five much nicer options are presented that you have to pay real money for.  This is very irritating and completely unnecessary. Also, the player must purchase DLC for BASIC simulation areas like weather, beach visits, careers, etc.  The whole thing is a pretty annoying money grab.It's completely annoying that the player spends anywhere from $20 to $60 on a game and the game constantly pesters the player for more money.  I own many games and DLC that never pester the player for more money.  Sims 3 is VERY unusual in this regard. If you buy this game, do NOT spend more money for clothes, furniture, houses, etc.  there are plenty of sites that offer free downloads of stuff that is much better than what is sold inside the game.  Also there are many mods that improve this game for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played as a wizard. For a generation, I mostly set people on fir and turned them into toads.Well my sim's biological clock was ticking, so I had him marry another wizard. He also adopted a child in case things went bad.Couple days later he has a full blown wizard son with an adopted normal kid. When Wizard-Son grew up to be a teen, I set the reigns on him and made him my most important one, even giving him the most expensive wand  as a handmedownAnyways, I set my neighbor's house on fire with my wiz-son, and he hen went on to try and ♥♥♥♥ the remainign neighbor. Failing, he cast a love spel on a fat chick and dated her. The enxt day he set his own lawn on fire without damaging anything, then when the neighbor came over to freak out about it, he set her on fire too.turns out Insurance pays for grass damage.After about 5 fires I gained 300,000 simoleons.I am a rich wizard son now.

												Years ago, when the Sims 3 first came out, I hated it. It was much more complex than the Sims 2, and it was overwhelming. I became accustomed to all of the options and possibilities, however, and now it is my favorite version of the Sims! Although I like the new Create-a-Sim Mode on Sims 4 that uses click-and-drag to determine Sims' looks, I miss all of the options for hair and eye color in Sims 3. The Sims 3 also had the Create-a-Style option which allowed the player to personalize virtually anything in the game by selecting patterns and colors for it. I once made an entire house with everything inside it entirely in plaid, just because I could! And it was fun! Another reason I love the Sims 3 the most is how the map is continuous and you can watch your sim travel from destination to destination in their car, instead of having a load scene while switching lots. The Sims 3 also has the most career options, which I appreciate. Sims 4 really lacks variety in this area. It doesn't even have a medical career track, which was even in the first version of the Sims! The stuff packs and expansions of Sims 3 are also really fun if you have enough money and space to accommodate them. A con of the Sims 3 is that it takes more power and storage space to run it than the other versions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Regardless of how I may enjoy the game in the near future when I finally get it to work, EA is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥for making the Sims a so expensive title after a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of years. The only reason I bought it is that I don't bother with downloading pirated copies anymore and the game was on 'sale'. Anyway apart from the absurd pricing (not even AAA titles released around 2009 still cost this much) the DLC grab is the worst I've ever seen (compared to it Payday 2 and Rome Total War II shine for their decency) and the game is so incomplete without any of them that you will have to purchase at least one, or get a cracked copy of it.Finally the only reason I'm wasting my time writing this, really, is that as I mentioned above the game doesn't work properly. Compatibility problems with W7 and 8 are massive and the troubleshooting required is at times just too much. I've been able to play some 4 hours and after relaunching the game everything turned wrong. First the costant crashing every 10 minutes, then every 5 and finally the freezing (every 2 or so). I tried to update again my gpu drivers only to find out the game does not recognise it and pick the built in intel card (playing on a laptop). Not saying the game will never work, but like Bethesda did with FO3 a label stating there are issues with newer systems and graphic cards should be added to the store page.After so many years few will still buy this game but for the ones considering that option, just stay way. This game is begging to be downloaded ('illegally').			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-The Sims 3 is a life-simulation-sandbox developed by a division of EA known as The Sims Studio, the Sims 3 was released 2009.The general idea is to progress your character/family through the game by building/buying a house, purchasing items to supply your Sims basic needs; Hunger, Social, Bladder, Hygiene, Energy, and Fun.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: I personally admire Sandbox games because of the flexibility you have with story, and game elements. Each person will have their own personal story playing through the Sims. (If you don't care to hear the story of my first Sims game: Skip to Gameplay)I created a Sim that looked like me, and proceeded to move into a house and begin to work on building my life. After getting my first job, the car for work showed up earlier then I expected, and I sadly didn't have time to eat my Waffles, so I left them on the street and went to work.After putting in a hard eight hour work day, I returned to my waffles on the street. (I had watched them the whole time from my above view. I watched them... mocking me.) Now, any sane person would know not to eat waffles left on the street for eight hours, but I'm not sane, I ate those suckers after getting home. Then proceeded to vomit in the toilet for the next few hours.


YouTube™ Video: LGR - The Best (and Worst) Sims 3 Packs 

			Views: 968,514		

			An overview of every single expansion and stuff pack for The Sims 3, from the Lazy Game Reviewer's perspective! Looking for new packs to buy, or which ones to avoid? Use this as a starting point!		

Eventually I became familiar with the weird 3D controls, married a lady who turned into a grandma the day after we were married ( *Condescending tone* Being the noble man that I am, I reloaded my save file. In my defense, she didn't tell me she was three times my age when we dated!)After getting married, becoming the leader of the free world, and having a kid... I died of old age. This is when I realized my terrible mistake; I shouldn't have made an avatar that looked like me. Eventually My son brought me back as a ghost, but I felt wrong after seeing myself die in a video game like that.Gameplay: It's hard to articulate how weird the controls are for The Sims 3, you can zoom in and out, rotate the camera, switch between Sims, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) isn't the weird part about the controls... It's when you're trying to learn the key-bindings, “which mouse button does what”, clicking and holding the scroll wheel, among a host of other keyboard shortcuts.It took several hours of play time to get familiar with the controls, I suspect I might have been helped or hindered with my experience working in 3D modeling programs such as 3Ds Max, Source SDK, and Blender.There is a lot that can be said about The Sims 3 gameplay, but the best way to sum it up is that this is “a Sims game”. This was the first Sims game I played since trying it at a friend's house when I was younger.


Take that! you gnome you! 
A Screenshot of The Sims(TM) 3
By: Atratzu




Achievements: There are no Steam Achievements on the Sims 3, however if you're objective or goal oriented, there are in-game accomplishments that you can work on earning. These accomplishments are shown on your Sims 3 community profile page.Price: This is where The Sims 3 gets sticky, and I start to get cynical... The Core game is priced at $19.99, that's an extremely fair asking price for the core game. But wait, there's more!If you look in your furniture section within the game, there are advertisements for more furniture that you need to spend real money to unlock! (Really EA? We didn't spend enough?)But wait, there's more! Each DLC pack (19 packs in total) costs $19.99! This is where many people start mumbling about EA having a money grubbing exploitative business model(Or maybe just me). If you do want to get the DLC for the Sims 3, it's recommended you look for bundle deals that are on sale to get the most out of your purchase.


All the DLC's 
Community Created Artwork for The Sims(TM) 3
By: Atratzu

			I wallpapered the box art of the various Expansions for the Sims3. I intend to use this in my review that I'll be posting in a couple of days.		


Conclusion: to recap, Story: flexible and unique. Gameplay: takes some time to get used to the controls if you're new to the series. Achievements: None on steam, but accomplishments in game. Price: Fair for the core game, however the marketing design is to shake you down for more money.I recommend this game to people who enjoy simulation games, play casual games, and like building houses.Do you like the way EA sells DLC for The Sims 3? Or do you think they should include more in the core game? Feel free to let me know in the comments, thanks for reading my review.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 1, 2015:Punctuation correction made by Angfucious, thank you :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: After going back and re-reading my review I noticed that it was more of a DLC rant than review of the Sims 3. I will now attempt to rectify that. For more on the game, go to the paragraph that starts with ""Gameplay:"".Let's establish the difference between ""Expansion Packs"" and ""DLC""Expansion Packs are like mini sequals to games. They add new features and expand upon the old ones. An example of a Sims 3 Expansion Pack would be World Adventures or Island Paradice. These two added signifigant ammounts of content to the game, as well as add new features like treasure hunting, and exploring, as well as adding new areas and features to base game items, such as the training dummy, and board splitter.DLC is usually much smaller than an expansion pack in that the ammount of content added is neglegable to the overall experience of the game. This can be seen in things like texture packs, or more specifically to the Sims 3, ""Stuff Packs"". Or the cutting of features such as the ability to make your own towns, and replacing that with the ability to buy more (non customizable) Pre-made towns.*Just making the quick note that while you can still create custom towns for the Sims 3, it has been made a far more tiedious process, requireing you to download a seperate program with a less user friendly interface, as opposed to the town creation system used by the Simes 2.In short, Expansion Packs are reasonably priced additions that improve the overall quality of the game, while DLC is a form of nickel and dimeing justified by the additions of insignifigant content, and should never be the same price as an expansion pack, or full game.Gameplay: The Sims 3 does not make any great bounds in inovation from the Sims 2 (The sims are a bit smarter, they won't drown if you take the ladder out of a pool now). It's still the same Point & Click style ""God Simulator"" where you can create your own sims (less customization options for vanilla, more added with each expansion pack), create your own house or customize a pre-made one. (While there is decent variety in furnishings etc. the developers still push the microtransactions with an in-game ""Sim Points"" store, and DLC page).You can still do (more or less) all the same things you could do with your sims from previous games, go to school, take several different carear/job paths (more interesting options with DLC), go to university (DLC), get married and start a family (streamlined without DLC), or even more outlandish things like go to the future (DLC), go live on an island with mermaids (DLC) Become a fantasy creature, things from fairies, werewolves, etc (DLC). Become a preformer (Limited options without DLC). You can also controll the longevity of your sims. Change the lifespan of a sim from 30 days to 1000, your choice.The game is owned by EA. EA has it's own gaming platform (Origin), since EA has it's own platform, it doesn't bother to optimize or patch any of it's steam variants (See Sims Medieval). So if you wan't to play this you're going to have to use Origin (same with any game made by EA really.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun way to kill off some free time and is very openended. I would easily say the sims 3 is a great buy for just about anyone with some level of creative and fun brain power. It not the hardest game to run and I have only ever ran into a few errors in my time of play. Plus, who doesn't love to be able to play god once and a while?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												But it's The Sims! Yes, but it doesn't feel at all like it. There are some game mechanics that seem to be there just to make the game exhaustive, longer than it should. Buying the Supernatural expasion really added an upgrade, but sometimes I'm just fast bored with the amount of time it takes to make friends since you have to visit them when they are home, and you have no idea of their schedule because they might have just gone fishing, just for example.I much preferred the original and The Sims 2, and yes, I'm one of those who really liked 2. From what I see, The Sims 4 will be way better than this one; and I'm counting on that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 is a fantastic game, with something for most gamers, and non-gamers alike. If you're an action geek, you probably won't enjoy the title, but most players who don't mind a casual experience will enjoy the game. Players who've played previous titles will find this incarnation the most fully featured yet. The experience has been great, and I have to recommend it highly to gamers and non-gamers alike, If your PC can run it, and you'd like to give playing games a revolution, this is the right title for you. If you're a gamer and you like games with a lot of depth, and open-ended gameplay, you'll probably enjoy the Sims 3 i've enjoyed my time with the Sims 3 for several days, so I have to give it very high marks for replayability. THE PART THAT I DISLIKE IS THAT THE LAUNCHER WONT START. BUT OF COURSE KEEP IN MIND THAT SIMS 3 NEEDS TO HAVE A HIGHER GRAPHIC CARD , BECAUSE I OFTEN HAVE THIS PROBLEM EITHER ITS ""NOT LOADING, GAME LAUNCHER WONT START OR BLACK SCREEN INFRONT OF THE GAME OR CRASHING, i fixed it by reinstalling and restarting, i also recommend for fixing the ""not loading launcher is by ""DEPATCHING THE LATEST UPDATE"" http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/patches/sims3/patch.html (this might only work for a few people out there) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love all The Sims games, but Sims 3 always stands out to me as my personal favorite. I've spent countless hours in this game before I even had it on Steam to keep track of play time (I can't really begin to fathom the hours spent in it outside of Steam.) I never cared for the plain boring sims EA gives in the base game. I got my fun from creating all my favorite characters from video games, anime, movies, tv shows, etc, and watching them all live in the same town like some sorta huge messed up fanfiction. If things ever got stale, I would just change up my current household, make new sims, or even change neighborhoods for a new start. With all DLC (not gonna talk about the prices) it adds a lot of new features to explore in your Sims game from seasons to pets and supernaturals and even time travel! Also this game being open-world compared to TS2 and TS4 really make it unique to the other Sims games. Though being open-world created a lot of routing issues and lag, the trade-off is worth it in my opinion. It really made the whole world feel alive when the sims in your game are always constantly doing something.Only con I can say about the game is to be wary if playing it on a stronger PC without using an FPS limiter because the game will burn up your GPU (and possibly destroy it altogether) due to outdated optimization for newer GPUs.

												RECOMMENDED DLC (review below):University Life: Adds a fun new area which allows you to be rewarded with a diploma to boost you in careersAmbitions: Adds more careers and hobbies, makes filling in the time more enjoyableSeasons: This is honestly the best in terms of visual enhancement, it makes the towns feel so much more aliveGenerations: Raising a family was always a nice thing to do in the Sims 3, this made the painful baby/toddler stage feel so much more enjoyable to meLate Night: The big city life is so fantastic, the ambience is incredibly, this has my favorite town.I'm going to start this off on the premise that Sims 3 on it's own is an enjoyable game. There is a lot to do in the base game without any DLC, the problem is the repetive nature of most of it. The DLC makes this a lot more enjoyable and adds things to do in between activities. As someone who owns most DLC (Diesel and the 70s, 80s and 90s don't appeal to me whatsoever). I can honestly say some of the DLC are things you won't even really touch, or it's a ""one and done"" scenario. The towns in the DLC are probably my favorite part about the DLCs in all honesty, a change of scenery makes the game feel somewhat fresh and new, the new experiences and wild antics you can get into in the new towns are enjoyable. The base game itself I give a 6/10, while with all the DLC I bump that up to an 8/10. While that added 2 isn't an extreme jump, it's what stops The Sims 3 from being a fun enjoyable game and turns it into a great enjoyable game with fun adventures in between. tldr; fun game, dlc makes it a great game			",174,54,1,41,21,2,26

												Forget about The Sims 4, stick with The Sims 3. It has everything you could think of and then some. My roommate died so I took her tombstone to the science facility and resurrected her. I botched it, and now her ghost haunts me. You can garden, swim in your pool or the ocean, fish to your hearts content, build all kinds of custom homes, there is something for everyone here.My only complaint is that the add-ons (DLCs) are way over priced. Most of them are twenty bucks, and they are not worth that. Seasons is good, Amitions is good, Pets is OK, Supernatural is lame, but NONE of them are worth twenty bucks. Wait until they are on sale, and then load up on DLCs.And for you Linux fans, The Sims 3 works well with Wine.			",118,15,5,24,19,2,11

												Sims 3, for all it's faults and troubles is probably the best Sims game to date.The open world provides a sense of immersion not achieved by earlier games.  This is a feature that was missing in previous games.There are a wide variety of expansion packs to provide additional functionality for just about anyone.You can pretty much play the game however you want, you can make your sim an upstanding citizen, a socialite, an excentric recluse, a crook or anything inbetween.  You can have your sims befriend everyone and be known for being nice, use them to express your darkest desires to ruin all your neighbor's lives, or even ruin their own lives if you so chose. That is not to say the game doesn't have it's problems.   It is probably the buggiest game ever released by EA, and that includes Sim Copter and Streats of Sim City.   It is using an archaic branch of Mono which makes the Mono releases chosen by Unity3D look new, and has a severely garbage collector that leaves unnecessary cruft everywhere and instead vacates other objects from memory as soon as you leave the lot they are on.   It seems either the core programmers didn't know how to mark something as a cached asset, or just didn't bother.   Despite the size of the game, there is no attempt to use either a disk heap, or a secondary virtual memory segment to store cached assets, and until recently it didn't even support over 2GB of game memory space.Tech support is nearly non-existant, but fortunately the game has finally stopped being update to support expansion packs, which would commonly break the game completely for older expansion packs, so there are fewer issues.To put it simply, the game itself I give a wonderfully positive rating as a near perfect game for it's category.  It is everything a Sims game should be.  However, the backend is flawed at best, and often downright broken, while tech support is downright non-existant.   Frankly, I think EA could care less about technical support or keeping their older games functioning on newer technology, and I think recent reports of having the worst customer support in the video game industry are not only accurate, but an understatement.Still, if you can put up with these faults, The Sims 3 is certainly worth your time and frustrations.

												This game is better than The Sims 4 my opinion, besides this has an open world its also this game looks like won't limit us, this game wants us to rule and explore anything and everywhere you like, i love the sims 3 becuase:- vibrant neighborhood- custom tool- story progression, open world- terrain tool- city hall, school, hospital, police department, science center, looks like town in the sims 3 more real and complex than town in the sims 4, - newspaper and mailbox- we can send a gift each other between players- and base TS3 game is better than base TS4, the only reason i played the sims 4 is because it has a smarter sim, and the capable of its multitasking is awesome, i can talk with other sim while i grab the food in the fridge, i can handle 2 cups of coffee, thats awesomeBut if we talk from every aspect, i would rather choose The sims 3, but as long as u go with all of its DLC, the game will get more laggy, more heavier, idk why, i hope in the future they will fix it, and make it more smooth like the sims 4, because the sims 3 is such a ""work of art"", this game is legit, it has everything and more interesting than the sims 4.

												I had played the Sims, The Sims 2, The Sims 3, and The Sims 4.Of course, I've been playing the Sims 4 since it came out, and despite all the content, it's lacking more content, you get me? Then I see the Sims 3 on sale here on steam and I thought, hey, why not buy a bunch?So far, worth it.It's pretty nostalgic and exciting to play the Sims 3 again. There's just so much content on this one than the Sims 4 (they really need to catch up a lot). The one thing that I missed about this was the colorpicker. Creativy is much more flexible here and the imagination is endless. Then there was the open world aspect of just this huge town and city, no loading screens whatsoever. It's just.... Ahhhh, relieving.On the other hand, the Sims 4 was a little more entertaining with all the hype graphics and awesome changes, especially the sex and gender where a sim's sex would be male but identified himself as female, or vice versa. Gameplay is less laggy for me than the sims 3, probably because it wasn't open world.Either way, it's hard to compare and contrast both worlds, since ""one was born from the last."" They're both so good if you can really play it right.Overall, I like them both. So worth to play The Sims 3 again. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I love this game, I cannot find it in me to recommend it.I find this game to be very chill, flexible and therefore fun, which is why I spent countless hours on it (between the Steam version and the Origin version)... however some of those hours were spent on a loading screen...You will find that your old save files will take longer to load the more you play them, and the more DLCs you use for said save files. Hell, last time I played this game, my main save file took like two and a half hours to load.The Wish System in this game is supposed to encourage you to do different things with your Sims, but I find that it doesn't quite work as intended, ergo, the game can feel pretty monotonous at times.If you want this game, I recommend that you buy it (as well as two or three Expansion packs) only during discounts.

												The Sims is the best life-simulation game around, hands down. I personally enjoy the Sims 3, due to the open world nature(opposed to the Sims 2, just in your house, or Sims 4, with locations, but not just one big world), and the enormous amount of add-ons that can go in to customize your game. Want retro 70s clothes? They have it. Seasons? Check on that. Pets? Hell yeah. Vampires, witches, and things that go 'bump'? You bet! With dozens of worlds, thousands of outfits(and what can only be billions of combination outfits), and hundreds of building materials/household items you can buy, this game is already incredible. But the best part is in life simulation. Every sim, no matter how much you try, will look different, act different, and have different wishes. Even minor things like having a hotdog will propel your sims into a whole new world of wishes and hopes, from cooking, to a new job, to opportunities that accompany this. A brief pass with someone at the supermarket can bloom into a relationship, a family, and any number of other possibilities. Every single playthrough is different, and that allows you to experiment as many times as you wish. Even with a single game is varies greatly day-by-day. One day, you could have an aspiring author, the next, they want to join Sunset Valley's Finest, or their worst. How they react, is up to you.11/10 for me, endless fun, and a wide open world.

												Firstly, this game is an easily controlled game, you can create characters, pets and houses. You can get jobs and earn Simoleons (money). (You can choose the job you want.) You can also buy DLC (which I have done and got Pet Plus) which is really good.This is good if you want to design a new house or look at some new house ideas! I find it really fun when you get your Sims to go out on dates, when they Woo Hoo and most importantly when they get married! Secondly, NO! THIS ISN'T A MULTIPLAYER GAME! All of my friends have been saying these exact words to me:""Oh, Golden Soldier, I'm free today, wanna join up on Sims?"" NO I DON'T! CAUSE I CAN'T!!!!!! Lot's of people think It's multiplayer when it's not, they think you're on their world but your not, It's the computer! Well, that's the long answer, short answer no, It's not multiplayer.Finally, I find this game fun to play once you've just finished a test, having friend issues or just plain bored. I also like playing this instead of doing my Math homework! I would rate this 4	½ /5    (4 and a half out of 5.)You actually read this whole thing? GOOD ON YOU! Thanks.Golden Soldier.

												After I've played about 50 hours of sims 3 I honestly got really bored with the game, same things happening over and over again. But then I bought the expansion pack ""ambitions"" and new jobs, new town, new objects and new clothing/hair were added to the game so I enjoyed playing it a bit more. If you have the money to pay for an expansion pack I would recommend University Life. In my opinion it is the best expansion pack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun and involving, as always recommmended don't cheat... It honestly kills the experience and a majority of the game's rewarding feeling of working hard in it. That aside, the game is enjoyable if you're looking for a role-playing game in which you immerse yourself into the character and what they do day to day. Between taking care of your needs, keeping up with your job, and maintaining relationships, the game still continues to deliver a great experience for the player.I myself am one who searches for the most enjoyable RPG games, and ones which can offer many things. So, I personally recommend if you're looking for a ""Live your Life RPG"" get this game with the following DLC:- Seasons -> Creates worlds with 4 Seasons [ More RP Events, Things to do..] + OBJECTS- Pets -> Duh. Pets. [Dogs, Cats, Horses, Birds, Rats, Hamsters, Fish, etc.] + OBJECTS- Generations -> In depth family options + OBJECTS - Late Night -> Celebrity Status + Bars + OBJECTS- Ambitions -> Further Career options + OBJECTS- Town Life Stuff -> To do stuff around Town + OBJECTSAll of these DLCs together will create a very in-depth gameplay experience of your Sim(s) life(s).All in all , Great Game.XAYAH ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buyer beware, videos and photos for the preview of what you're buying contain a lot of the expansions that cost money which is a little shady. I have no issues paying for expansions or DLC but you I don't think you should be able to put photos up that make your customers think they're getting more than what they actually are without declaring *some of these photos and videos show expansions* somewhere up-front. I recomended the game to a friend since we were both long time sims fans only to be asked ""where is the college"" and ""how do I get to the island stuff."" He thought he would be getting these with the game and so did a lot of other people apparently based on the preview pictures. If you put a decient amount of time into the game there's really not that many options for things to do unless you buy the expantions or dare to look at the free community made sections (not through steam but through the official EA sims site) some items of which are game breaking. If you would pay for all those said expantions you're looking at over 600$ and some of the expansions are less than a gig of new content. It's a great game, I purchased expantions for the earlier games, but the new content is a lot of money for little content at the pricepoint it's being sold at. I sort of regret recomending the game at all now.			",174,42,2,15,36,2,14

												I thought this game would be fun, but then I leanred about how money hungry EA is. I never played much of their games so I thought to give this one a try, I even went as far to get DLC for it too! It was fun at first, but then I realized that I could not access items in the DLC I just bought. This is how it works: You buy DLC to have extra stuff, then EA makes items within that very DLC you just bought unusable saying you have to pay more to get it.This game seems like it may be fun, but that whole money hungry thing turns me waaay off of it. I spent around two hours in character creation and 30 minutes in game arguing with buttons and frustrated why I didn't have access to items/characters I bought. Buyer beware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The bad things you hear are mostly all true: gameplay can get extremely laggy, EA is not the best company when it comes to customer satisfaction, and so on and so forth. The only reason that I still recommend this game is largely because there are no equal alternatives to it: despite lag and bug issues, the content (with expansions) is massive, the possibilities are almost endless. Also, there are many mods that are not only easy to install but fix alot of the problems that EA has neglected to fix (they rather spend their time pushing out more mini expansions and developing their cash shop).

												Okay, I don't think the game is bad. It can be fun to screw around with fake people without too many consequences or whatever. But, it's best to buy it with some expansion packs because the base game can get boring on it's own. The problem with that is, the expansion packs are pretty expensive. Nearly all of them are the same price as the base game, without a bundle or deal. Considering most of the expansions don't double the content of the base game, that's kinda a rip-off. That being said, some of them are pretty fun to have, such as the Seasons, Pets, and Supernatural that can add new types of sims and make interacting with other sims more entertaining. But some of the expansions, like the ones that just add furniture or clothing, which still cost the same as the base game, are completely not worth it. Not to mention there is what is called ""SimPoints"", which is a type of currency you purchase with actual money, that you can use to buy certain in-game items or different maps. The price for SimPoints is also pretty inflated. It kind of feels like EA is trying to constantly tempt you into spending money with this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a person who have played the sims way waaaaaaay back in the old days. I've played sims, sims1, sims 2(pets,cast away, etc), i have also played the sims in mobile as well as the one in facebook, as well as the sims 4.Honestly, i've played so much sims in my life. But sims 3 is second to the best for me, cuz sims 2 is still my number one favorite. This is my real review.Sims 3 is a really good game for me despite the lag and crashes it gives me when i get DLC's. The sims 3 opened a whole new kind of experience with so many choices of DLC to choose from. and that's the thing with Sims 3, they have DLC unlike older versions of sims. I'm not sure if i would treat that as a good thing or what, because in my opinion, sure the DLC we buy gives more features and more things to do but it's not enough for the price we have to pay.This is why i prefer sims 2. When i bought my Sims 3 Pets, i expected so much, and this only cost me disappointments. I was expecting to get a PET PARK/PET SHOPS/PET ETC. but all i got are pet furniture, and well...pets with the addition of horses you can ride. The addition of horses is okay for me, but i didn't bought Sims 3 HORSE SIMULATOR, i bought pets, so why is it that only horses get a special building. Cuz in sims 2 pets, you are literally experiencing everything about having a pet. Dogs can use trees as toilets, pets have their own park, pets have pet salons, pets have everything. That's what i feel lacking in sims 3. Their DLC's for me doesn't have ENOUGH features as much as the sims 2 has. but still, i would recommend it cuz i still find it a good game, i just voiced out what i felt was lacking. :) happy gaming to you all~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. A lot of people say they spend a ton of time making the 'perfect household' and the 'perfect house' and only play the GAME for a tiny amount of time. I'll admit, after a little while it DID get kind of boring. But you can always just make a new household and make a new house. If you somehow get bored of that, download a DLC. I havent had any problems with boredom, but maybe you will. Create a challenge. Set goals. It's fun if there are imperfections or an insentive. I think this game is great- I'm probably going to play a lot longer (I have over 120 hours).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 has vastly changed - and improved - since I've last played The Sims 2. I purchased the game as a bundle that included three expansion packs: Seasons, Generations, and Pets. In the game you can now travel throughout the town or city without the loading screens. This alone is a great feature to the game as now you can jog, bike, drive, or ride to a location of your choice in a matter of seconds without waiting for the game to bring up a new load screen. The Sims Pets have brought in horses as well! You can choose from a number of breeds and then cusotomise your horse's coat, bridle, sadle, and reins. The horses have different outfits for shows too! Each of the packs included have downloaded fast and run smoothly. The game is a little slow but overall that's not unexpected on my little laptop. I plan to continue to collect the expansion packs around the holiday sales. (Otherwise, they can be a little pricey for the overall payoff.)			",18,10,0,7,4,0,0

												I really enjoy the sims games, I have owned multiple expansions for the sims 3 on disk and decided to purchase the sims 3 via steam during the sale to try out some new expansions but I have noticed that there are many bugs when playing the sims through steam. The game randomly has lag spikes that the player has to wait through, usually 3 days time for the lag to go away, but will also come back, and I have had several occasions of this game crashing, or it just stops responding and I have to end it via task manager. The sims 3 is a great game but if you want to play this game, purchase it in disk form, not through steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The floor, the porch, next to my trashcan, everywhere. Then I made out with my boss in my living room while a friend was sitting on the couch eating spaghetti watching us make out. He went outside once we started embracing. Then everyone left and I went to bed cause it was a thursday so I had work in the morning. 10/10 Would Spaghetti Again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ive enjoyed the sims series including sims 3, but a game thats going on for 5 years now the addons shouldnt be more expensive then the base game. It should be the other way around. The support line from EA when I have had an issue with this game is horrid to say the least. And along with any addons through origin cannot be moved over to the steam version which just wants you to get a cracked version of this game. This game is in a grey area for me to give any sort of review sadly so Im stuck with just giving bland answers :/			",161,69,2,20,13,3,26

												This game is so buggy that it is unplayable, I've completely given up on it. On top of the fact that loading screens take forever, and creating an account was a nightmare, the game would randomly have certain sims become invisible forever, making it impossible for me to interact with them. I enjoyed the two hours I was able to play without this invisible sim isssue, but the issue has persisted despite the fact that I've deleted and restarted multiple games. As you can image, this is very, very frustrating. For a game that's six years old now, it is absolutely pathetic that these issues still exist. This bug should have been patched and ironed out years ago. Don't waste your money on this like I did.			",34,4,1,10,8,0,4

												First and foremost, Sims 3 is a nice game. I don't like how much dlc it has but the base game itself is fun. Since it's on sale, I went ahead and got the bundle. I suggest you do the same before it's too late. The price for everything kept me from getting this game for the longest time and now's the time to grab everything. Personally though, I'd just grab the base game and maybe the bundle. One other complaints I have by the way is that the game tends to crash from time to time. In about 3 or so hours I've had two crashes. It doesn't break the game for me but it that bit definitely isn't fun.On to the game itself, it's precisely what you'd think it is. A Simulation. A simulation of the day to day lives of people. I like to think of it as a doll maker that let's you take it a step further by letting you watch your characters come to life and follow their dreams, aspirations, and then die a hilariously human death. The game can feel a little off putting upon first starting it up. After my first hour, I felt rather unsure of what to do next. I had created two characters based on a favorite book of mine, ""Good Omens,"" and then had them move into this house out near the country. I contemplated whether or not this game was for me but when I was a child my sister had Sims 2. I remember enjoying it so much that it got me to stop playing World of Warcraft for a few days. That was truly quite the feat back then! After spending some more time with Sims 3, I now know why it temporarily broke my addiction back then. Because the Sims too is a fun and addictive just like my all time favorite game WoW! Now then, Sim 2 isn't Sims 3 per-say but it's just as I remember it. You got a few characters, have them go to work and do basic upkeep, form relationships, etc... Every little virtual day they grow more and more. Heck, after a few hours with this game I feel hyped up to go clean my house, continue working on my skills, and follow my career. Let's play the Sims first though heh...All in all, I recommend Sims 3. It's a classic game franchise that's both fun and relaxing in nature. Perhaps one of the nicest things about this game is that it's a game anyone can enjoy. There's no tremendous learning curve, no brutal challenges, and no end in sight! Unless you count crashes but still... Play as you wish and there's no rush. If you've been looking for something to relax with, maybe get a little creative, or perhaps take a break from constantly dying in other games, then Sims 3 is for you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So the Core game is pretty great, if your into simulators that is, but the DLCs for it are a bit high in the price range so there's that. IF you plan to buy any of the expansions I would go with Ambitions, Seasons, Generations and pets. University life is alright. Of course if you really wanted to you could go outside and make real friends, but whose got time for that?			",31,9,0,8,3,0,4

												You people don't understand what EA goes through, the expansion packs are a bargain, sure they could put it all in one game, but with the amount of stuff they put into each expansion, the game would probably have come out in 2012, one review says ""20 dollers for a pet is to expensive"" it doesn't just add ""a"" pet. This expansion adds new traits new loifetime wishes tons of objects and interactions four types of pets with endless pure breeds and mutts, it also add a new freaking world. EA has said that making animations is one of the hardest parts of making the sims, they had to make animations for 4 types of pets. Heck EA has tons of trouble with AI if you had played a game made by them but the pet AI is better than the sims AI.Now, the stuff packs is a whole different story... They should be cheaper I can agree, they just items, nothing to much and someof the stuff packs are ridiculous, a katy perry one? Really?All in all the sims is an amazing game and well put together. The expansion packs I consider a bargain but you might want to stray form the stuff packs.Also electrocute Taylor Swift 9/10 IGN to much pool water			",67,7,1,14,18,1,5

												I've really never written a review for a game before, so I will do my best to make this brief.  Sims 3 expands on a lot of the features from the previous installments, including adding some new features and then Electronic Arts to my surprise removed some features in this edition.  One of the features they removed that was in the Sims 2, was the ability to create new lots.  In the Sims 3 you are basically stuck with the pre-installed lots and then of course like the previous installments you have to buy all the expansions. Buying the expansions is not what bothers me. What bothers me is not being able to make my own neighborhoods and customize them to my personal tastes like I could in the second game.  I still wish I had it.  I only have the original content version so that is what my review is based on and not any of the expansions.  So I am not aware if they have changed that rule about you being able to create your own personal neighborhoods in now since later expansions have come out.  As I may or may not have read somewhere, The neighborhood creation feature is really the only thing that bugged me, other than that everything else right down to the increased character personalization options was incredible, not to mention I was rather impressed with the realism in the way the characters looked and acted.

												Ea Games, I hope you all die in a fire. The sims 3 was a great game, except for the fact that it always screws up your progress before you get to save, your fans buy all this DLC for the sims 3. and your create the sims for.now, that wouldn't be bad at all, except it's a horrible game compared to the sioms 3. and not only that, you  have the AUDACITY to force your fans to REBUY ALL of the mods they already bought for the sims 3!Not only is this absolutely, morally corrupt, but it shows how absolutely truly money hungry your company is, you use your fans and give them nothing better in return, you tell those who play your own games they might as well go screw themselves, and you suck the money out of all your fans pockets, not caring in the slightest that you're deceptive nature creates anger throughout your fanbase. you are a money hungry, selfish, corrupt, and close to evil company, and you should be ashamed of yourselves, but you never will be because all you care about is making a profit. the sims 3 is only really fun if you buy the DLC which each one costs about as much as a full game each, I highly recommend not getting the sims, ever in your life because it's a large waist of money for a temporary thing that will later become uiseless as EA does not care to help with their older games, or even patch them.

												Buy this instead of The Sims 4. On sale, all EP costs around US $60. Stuff Packs does not really worth it except when they are $1 each.When you have multimonitor or doing alt-tab quite often, Borderless Gaming is very recommended as this game does not natively support borderless.This game definitely got performance issue which sometimes major. So just be wary. You have been warned. You could find some tips and tricks in order to enhance the performance of the game, such as using RAMDisk, although some of it is debateable wether it is really improving or only intermitent.Download recommended mods such as AwesomeMod or NRaas. AwesomeMod is said to not supported in Steam version of TS3, but actually it is just because of different versioning. It should run smoothly despite warning messages on not using supported version.After all, The Sims 3 is the best installment after The Sims 2. Both games have their own ups and downs though. But still it is way better than The Sims 4 which is actually The Sims 1.5.			",0,0,1,0,14,0,1

												This is awesome, i think everyone should play it. You get to create a sim (your character) and buy your very own house. You can buy the unfurnished or the furnished house. If you get an expantion pack you can get diffrent kind of mods. I recomend the supernatral expansion pack but beware the zombies! You can control a sims life from when its a baby to an elderly but sadly your sim could die before old age, these are all the deaths I know of...you could die of old age, drowning, burn to death, electrified, in a bad fight, cow plant, starvation, thirst (vampires only), poisond apple (from whiches only) and much more! You can choose your sim's jobs and hobbies. You can make your sim like you , someone else or just anything.I hope you are interested in the Sims 3 and hope you get to play it.If you are worried its unsuitible for you or children its fine. but you can make your sim woohoo (have sex) but thats all!Thank you for reading this review and hope you buy this too!

												As someone who played a lot of Sims 2 back in the day, this game is nothing but another disappointment from EA and a prime example of how they tend to ruin franchises. Too much DLC, which in almost every case is more expensive than the base game itself. And speaking of the base game, it very much feels like it has less content in it than the base game of the Sims 2! And don't even get me started on the microtransactions, that's just disgusting and not even worth the effort of raging over.The Sims 3 is a great game with lots of content....if you spend the $400 or so on the expansions which do nothing but add content to the game that should have either been released at launch or patched in for free later on. Sims 3 truly sets the bar for how awful microtransactions and DLC can be in a game that could have been great. At this point just wait for the Sims 4 and pray EA has learned from their mistakes....not that that's ever happened before!			",100,24,5,9,29,3,4

												This game is the ultimate ad-simulator. Literally the first minute of the game there was a lot of ads for Sims 3 content. I wanted to find out how to get Sim Points so that I wouldnt have to pay $35 for each neighborhood, so it opened up a version of Chrome flooded with ads. After closing it I went into the game. The loading screens were ads to buy all the DLC. After a long ad-tastic loading period I jumped into the game. The first thing it does? Ask me to check out the Sims Store. At this point I used ALT+TAB, but figured out I couldnt just right-click and close it. I opened up my task manager and shut it down after Windows began searching for errors. Just to make sure, I uninstalled the malware from my PC. Most realistic ad-simulator I've ever played.11/10 Would view ads again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oooh Sims 3 on sale for a somewhat reasonable price, so I can finally test it out!I bought the Island Paradise, Pets, Generations, Ambitions and Seasons as those either added content I was interested in or expand the game in interesting ways. First impressions were really well, everything is highly customizable and I spend an hour making a loner fisherman/scuba diver and his trusty dog and finally move into my housboat. The troubles soon became apparent though as the game freezes very frequently for 5-20 seconds. Now I read elsewhere that it's especially bad with Isla Paradiso as there are tons of pathing issues that cause these lags. EA just never bothered fixing their 35$ expansion pack....I downloaded a modded version of the worldmap but have to start a new playthrough and I also read that there are mods that watch for these pathing errors and resolve them more quickly than the game's own routines but this is a sorry state of affairs.Sims 3 seems to otherwise really be the high point of the series and I wish there would be a ""Remaster"" with most of the expansion packs but mostly bug free and on a better technical base that can actually handle all the assets. That would be way better than the trimmed down Sims 4 or whatever they have planned with 5.<edit>I have since bought the Late Night expansion and started a new playthrough in Bridgeport to see if that has unplayable lag too. No Lag! Oh joy!I played all day, getting a lone teen (created a mother then deleted her) with her two cats through school and into adulthood where she started a career as a mixologist and I was looking forward to opening my own Bar at some point. Saved and quit to eat dinner, loaded again and I can't interact with half the objects anymore. What the heck is this?? Quite a few people seem to have the same or similar issues, some other players may give well meant advice but nothing worked for me. Not buying a new toilet or deleting my cache files.I should know better than to give EA any of my money but it's been ages since I played the Sims 1 and I really wanted to again. When the game actually works it was a real joy and I'm amazed by the breadth and depth of the gameplay but if all my games end sooner rather than later in a technical game-over then I'm not motivated to start again.Of course it's too late for a refund now but shame on you EA and Maxis for having a game wonkier than Fallout or Skyrim. This is a Gothic 3 level of f'ed up.			",155,53,4,41,21,2,39

												I really loved playing The Sims 3 (and have most of the DLC's) right up until I paid a fortune for Island Paradise.  I have a decent rig that doesn't have problems running games but basically I have come to the conclusion that Island Paradise is unplayable.  I can play Sims 3 so long as I don't play the Island paradise map. The fact that EA customer service sucks♥♥♥♥♥and have not even bothered trying to fix the routing/path issues in this game made me sure to not buy any more content for this game.  EA won't even admit that they are at fault when I've mailed them about this issue and I have tried every fix going.  I won't be buying Sims 4 and I won't be paying for my kids to have it either.  Nor will we be buying any more content for Sims 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sims 3 includes all the classic fun of The Sims and The Sims 2, plus a lot of swank new tools (like the Basement Tool and the Fountain Tool) that let you build even better houses than ever before.  Individual Sims are still as fun, weird, and entertaining as they've always been, and the ""open neighborhoods"" introduced with Sims 3 just lets that fun spread.  My main criticisms of this game are first: it's a resource hog, so it can be very difficult to run on an older computer or one that's been weighed down with a lot of other active applicatoins.  Two: it has a lot, lot, lot of outstanding bugs.  Many of those can be dealt with through the use of third-party mods and scrupulous computer maintenance, but really, I do wish the game developers took bug fixes more seriously.  Despite all that, I come back to Sims 3 time and time again and I have a lot of fun every time I do.With such an open world, the possibilities are endless, and I don't think I'll ever -- no matter how much I play -- manage to see 100% of this game.

												   Having spent more money on this game than any other - indeed somewhere in excess of fourteen times as most of my purchases I'm - disappointed.  Firstly it has either not crashed at all or only crashed once on a Windows 10 machine with virtually every extra installed (I went for it in last Steam sale).  But...    1)  The towns now feel completely depopulated.  Particularly difficult in the nightlife city where every second NPC is a celeb and your interactions are limited with them.  Neighbours just don't run or pass by as much, colleagues from work don't come home, and the time clock moves so quickly that you can rarely interact with anyone long enough to have an impact.    2)  The moving to real time now messes badly with character development.  In Sims 2 when you left your house time effectively froze so when you came back it was the same time you left, no matter how long you were away.  This enabled you to have 30 - 40 hours in a day - and far easier to get stuff done.  Here it is real time throughout - but punitively slow.    Showering, going to the toilet, and cooking and eating some waffles now takes two hours.  There simply aren't enough hours in the day - even with shortened work hours.    3)  Building anything is a complete pain in the butt.  In the Sims 2 you'd simply select a lot and then place the pre made building there.  Having a task for my Sim to go to a bar and there not being a bar in my Sim's world (and they can no longer transfer - major downer) I tried to build one. And tried.  And tried.  Even after searching the internet I was no wiser.    4) Everything is very expensive.  You have to rise high in your career before you can do much more than cover your taxes.    5)  Loading is even more ponderous than Sims 2 although the spot an object game (flawed) helps the time pass.    6)  After spending a LARGE amount of money on the game it was disappointing to see so many items still shut off behind a Pay Wall.    This is not a bad game.  More hours in I might appreciate it more.  But it is A game, no matter how thinly E.A. slice it.  At 75% off in the sale I spent more on Sims 3 than a brand new AAA game.  And it's not as good as Skyrim which I bought for £5.00.  Few games are but still - E.A. charge VERY HEAVILY INDEED for this game.  For the money they are taking this should be an unalloyed joy... and it isn't.    E.A. seem far more focussed on gouging ever more cash from their customers than giving them great gaming experiences.  After this I wouldn't buy Sims 4 at 90% off.S.x.			",153,17,3,25,15,3,28

All of the indicators in game have a visual component, such as the need meters, and events in game are visible things.Subtitles/TextBecause nothing requires subtitles, this section isn't necessary.Chatting/CommunicatingWhen playing with others, you can communicate by typing, so there are no problems here.

												Both Sims 2 and Sims 3 are the best games in the series, although Sims 3 has a lot of bugs. Most of them are easy to fix though. I will write a list of bugs and how to fix them, and then the major game breaking bug I'm still trying to fix.These are glitches I ran into in my 58 hours of playtime with all expansion packs installed:1. Sims getting stuck in a frozen position.  How to fix: use cheat ""resetsim first and last name"" 2. University seems to be stuck in loading screen. How to fix: Edit town right before going to University, although you can also wait it out, but it loads for like 30 minutes.3. Can't adopt stray cat or dog even though you are BFF with it. Fix not confirmed, but might work: ask stray to leave, and when it returns the adopt option will appear.4. Sim stuck in sneak mode after getting grounded. How to fix: Either send your sim to boarding school, or go to edit town, evict your family with their house, bulldoze the empty house, place the family and house back where it was.5. Can't use bed. How to fix: The same fix as glitch number 4. Not the boarding school fix, the eviction fix.6. Can't get mail. How to fix: use the buydebug on cheat and testingcheatsenabled true, shift click the mail box, click object, click delete it, go to debug buy menu and buy a new mailbox.7. Grim Reaper not taking away dead sims. How to fix: This glitch means the grim reaper is stuck, just do resetsim Grim Reaper in the cheat menu to fix it. Reset the dead sim where the reaper got stuck too if you can find the stuck reaper.8. Bowl of food or any object getting stuck in your sim's hand. how to fix: resetsim first name and last name.9. Certain sound effects stopped working. How to fix: save your game and load it again or relaunch the game.10.  The worst most game breaking glitch of all, and the one I only know a one time fix for... Sims stop aging when your new generation sims have a baby, even though aging is on. I tried a few stuff that the devs said would work, but it didn't work. I fixed the issue once with the help of a youtube video, but that fix only works once. If your aging stops again, it won't work. That trick is to go to main menu and copy your saved town by clicking copy town next to the delete button, and then play the copied town. Aging will be back in working order until your 3rd generation's baby grew up into a toddler. That's where I'm stuck at the moment, and I searched for a solution for quite some time. People say either use mods or start a new game and delete the old save. I refuse to delete my save though, I played 58 hours with my family. Also, I don't want to download any mods, because the mods changes some things I don't want to change, plus I don't know how to mod games in general. I hope you found my fixes helpful though, and I hope one of you guys can give me a permanent fix that always works once the sims stop aging, because I really want to continue playing with my family. Why do I still recommend this game? Because it's excellent and the world feels alive and completely dynamic and open world.  It not only feels that way, it is that way. Literally. For example, while you are living your life, other sims will live theirs, and you can see them do it. They move, get married, have kids, adopt pets, age, die, go to visit others, visit the park and other places, etc, plus you can affect their lives by interacting with them, like you can break up a couple by kissing someone in front of his or her lover, etc. I bought all the expansions in the sale for about $74. Great game, lots of content, and if it's 75% off, affordable if you want to buy all dlc.  As I said, the only bad thing about the game is the bugs. The aging bug in particular. I heard some people had success moving them out and back in, but I haven't tried it yet. Anyways, if you got the money and you like sims or the genre in general, you will love this game. Just use my glitch fix list if you want a smooth experience.			",413,95,35,35,65,4,32

												It's The Sims 3. I'm pretty sure most people know if they like it or not. The game is fantastic, but having to sell my soul, my first born child and all of my worldy possessions to get the DLC is taking things a bit too far. Especially since they contain many features that should really be included in the base game.There are also in-game achievements but no Steam achievements which is kinda lazy.

General:Personal rating: 6/10Not a ""The Sims Bustin' Out"" but definitely better than Sims 4 and more advanced than Sims 2. Play this if you want a good and recent Sims for computer, forget about the other versions. Watch out, not all DLCs / Expansions are good. Island Paradise is mentioned to be extremely laggy. Best to play the original version without any expansions for the most fluent gameplay! (This applies to the players with average computer systems)Below some extra notes for those who want to read more, or seek the enlightment for this game.Stability:The Sims as a whole has always had some stability issues, if you accidentally find the trigger. The game itself has a stability issue over time. If you play in one neighborhood and let it grow, i.e let Sims reproduce, have new families added to the town, etc. you may eventually encounter so called ""lag spikes"". It's something comparable to your screen freezing, but only for 1-3 seconds, while the sound continues to work, the world will freeze shortly. These lag spikes are going to occur at a certain point, once your neighborhood is ""full"". There is no limit in theory, yes, but once there are too many entities in an actively progressing neighborhood, you will see that the game starts to have issues with that. Trust me, this is not a problem about your hardware being outdated, it is the poor coding and entity clearing/resetting of the game. I suggest keeping the amount of neighborhood sims and families to a lower level. Remember, you can always force them to die, either on a natural way, or through the debug console!Pro tip: Can't fix your neighborhood, but at least want to keep your family with their house? Copy the entire household with building, then delete your neighborhood in the main menu and create a new one. You can then add the copy of your original family + house to any new neighborhood, regardless which map you picked and the game will run fluently again!Expansions:Not all are really good in content, value and stability, as I've figured through research and opinions from friends. I suggest the following for the best content and most fluent gameplay in combination with other expansions: Seasons, Supernatural, Pets and Generations. You won't need any other, in my opinion. Island Paradise should be completely ignored, it's known to be one of the most problematic ones. IMPORTANT: The more expansions you buy and the more DLC you add to the main game, the more unstable it will become! This is no joke, even if your computer is ""overkill"" for this game, the game will still♥♥♥♥♥♥itself. Blame the developers...Downloadable Content (DLC):I suggest to research the web with Google to find free downloadable content such as maps, hair styles, clothes and items, since Origin is one greedy crowd of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Takes you less than 5 minutes. Check out the blogs of Sims gamers, since any other kind of site will most likely add a virus to your file - that includes downloads from Youtube video descriptions too!Hardware & SettingsPersonally I play on a high-end machine, which is why I do not encounter the casualties of hardware compatibility problems. In case you have some, focus on having a good processor and video card (graphics card). 4k RAM is enough if you don't run anything else and 4k RAM is the least people own nowadays - the very least. If yours is above the ""minimum"" suggested by the developer, but your game feels sloppy and performs badly, you may make changes in the games settings for improvements. Alternative you may have to upgrade your hardware or buy a new PC if you can't do that by yourself. However, it's Sims we are talking about and a good processor should do the job.Remember: You can lower the graphics settings tremendously in this game, which will help you a lot if playing on an older PC. Additionally you may turn off the active neighborhood progression setting in the game options. Then your neighborhood is not going to ""play"" in the background and will only change if you are in range of these Sims.Community:The modding / content creator community of Sims 3 is overall better and bigger as far as I've figured. Maybe it is because the game created a bigger boom when it came out unlike Sims 4.Personal Sims Experience:I've always been a fan of this simulation series, and have played the following Sims games (in the same order): The Sims Bustin' Out, UrbZ Sims in the City, The Sims (1), The Sims 2, The Sims 3. I've never played Sims 4 due to obviously bad reviews, and I suggest you shouldn't either. All of the Sims games that I've played over the years, through my childhood up to being an adult myself, they were all great in their own way, but unfortunately none was perfect.I hope that one day the developers will decide to actually create a quality Sims, that covers all of the most wanted features for the fans, without ruining the performance.- I have made several edits in this review over my time playing the game - ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 If you ever like building cities, partying, or buying/creating pets, then I would recommend you guys to play this game because it's very fun to play with friends, and family, you also get to create your own house and buy houses and do all sorts of fun things on sims, it can be confusing at times if you don't know how to play this. Also if you ever wanted to know how I found out about this game, I use to play this game at my cousins house all the time when she had a WII at her house, but now she doesn't have a wii anymore... so R.I.P. but anyways if you ever like to build cities, party, or buy/creating pets, then I would recommend you guys to get this game, because it's Hella Fun!!!

												Did you love Sims 1, Sims 2? You'll love Sims 3. ...If you want to pay this much for very little... What made the previous Sims so fun? The excessive options in clothing, furniture, etc. With Sims 3, its a little different. You'll pay 40 for the standard, and being a Sims fan you'll spend another additional 20-40 bucks for an expansion. What you think you get? A world full of options, diversity and the start of loads of fun. What you actually get? A hollowed out game. Lacking content compared to the earlier games. The diversity of clothing, furniture, house options, etc, its been minimized. But, EA, being as lovable as they are will give you a chance to add some of that content back.You want to use this piece of furniture? Yes? Pay extra money. Oh you want to make use of the different towns in your options menu? Well, better pay some more money. This particular shirt is featured today, if you want it.. you better pay more money. Sims 3 will use any and all means neccesary to make you pay more money for stuff that should've been in the game in the first place. You buy the 'locked' stuff with points. These points can only be purchased with real money and there is no way to earn them. You pay for a pedigree dog, and you get an emaciated mutt.I love Sims 3, but dont bother buying it unless its on one hell of a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is ridiculously huge to begin with, but for some strange reason it doesn't seem to have enough of the essential content to create a good story with the sims. I mean, in some ways it's a lot like Sims 2 (which I have loved for so many years), but in other ways, its frustratingly different. For example, in Sims 2, I felt satisfied with the game that I bought -- even though I hadn't bought any expansion packs yet. The game was able to stand on its own and impress me without having any extra content. With Sims 3, I feel this horrible dissatisfaction with the content, dispite the superior graphics and the exciting new *live* neighborhood. Oftentimes I can ignore the feeling, but some times it is dishearteningly glaring. There is always this subconsious push to run back to steam and grab up more DLC so that the game can achieve some kind of tolerable level of ""rightness"" -- almost as though EA was trying to do this on purpose. It seems awful, but I am starting to believe that they just broke the game up into pieces, called it DLC, and tried to sell it to people piecemeal!An additional problem, and a rather gamebreaking one for me, is the sheer size of this game. Once you build it up to a reasonable level with ""Pets"" ""Ambitions"" and ""Nightlife"", things start to go seriously wrong. Bugs and glitches that once were just annoyances become major problems, lag that was pretty tolerable before is now making you mad, and loading times that were originally only a lengthy 5 minutes are now running into the range of 20 minutes -- and this is on the lowest settings possible! I have also begun to experience issues with the game essentially *growing* the more I play it. It automatically starts to get fatter and more sluggish every time. Not to mention the crazy amount of inconvienient game crashes!All in all, I suppose coming so late to the game, I should have heeded the bad reviews and steered clear of it, but as you all know, sometimes, in pursuit of a dream, a gamer is tempted to try something that they know probably sucks.  I would only recommend this game to someone with a ton of patience and a 5 star computer system :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sims 3 Is an insult not just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameThere are two main points to why Sims 3 is a terrible game. Despite the graphical advancements and optimization that make Sims 3 a much smoother game than previous titles, Sims 3 fails to deliver an actually game experience that is rewarding. This and atrocious advertising by EA/Maxis make the game a flop. Here are the reasons broken down. 1) In game advertising. This was such a new low in all my time of playing video games. At every turn, the game is selling you something more. IN THE GAME!!! And if its not useless then its obviously removed from the final product. Selling 20 DLC is one thing (that I object to FYI) but selling you furniture in the game building menu, loading screens that were for DLC, and then asking you to post your screen shots on Facebook... wow that is just putrid. Your playing of the Sims 3 is not a game, but an extended infomercial. 2) I simply found Sims 3 to be a series of mini-games rolled into one. Career advancement, needs, lifetime aspirations, friendships, it was all just so boring to check off one task after another to satisfy each 'aspect' of the game. None of these things made a difference with each other. Dont go to the bathroom and ♥♥♥♥ yourself? no worries, this has no affect with the sim you're talking to. Cheat on your sim significant other? who cares, you'll still get a promotion at work. Achieve the lifetime aspiration? not a bid deal, since you'll get one more pointless talk bubble with another sim that wont mean anything. Its just frustrating to see that the game has so many aspects that play like mini-games since they have no bearing on anything else. You'd think a close sim dying would remove options for your playing sim since a traumatic death would scare/encourage certain developments. NopeAlso failure in the game means nothing. Got rejected from WooHoo? Got fired? Got a sim cheating on you? this will not hinder or alter the game for your sim’s life. How can this be a game mechanic for success?If you are of the perspective that in game sales aren’t a big deal, well then this failure of gameplay can’t be ignored. What a sad story this franchise has had, going from on eof the most popular games out there (16 million units sold for Sims 1) to a laughing stock example of DLC cash cows.I'm sure this review is irrelevant now, seeing the Sims 4 being pushed heavily, yes you called it, in the Sims 3 game right now. I waited for Sims 3 to hit rock bottom retail price since I only really wanted the housing design aspect. But having enjoyed Sims 1 and Sims 2 for the game itself, I am disheartenly justified in waiting so long to get this game at 80% off. ",21,4,0,8,33,0,25

												Definately would recommend if you're into simulation/real life kind of games.Its got a nice range of customisation for your own personal needs - ie: Real Life vs Fantasy  (That chick/guy who friendzoned you - No more with this game. You can make her/him fall in love with you. You can drown her/him or even set her/him on fire! [DO NOT do this in real life])   OR Build your own mansion master piece, town etc. You dont have muscles? This game will give you muscles! Dont have big coconuts? No worries - slide the bust meter all the way up! This is a game that you can play until you get over it but then be able to come back and pick up where you left off or start over from scratch.I bought Sims 3 + Multiple DLC packs for $80 (RRP was roughly $200) a few years ago and I dont regret it. Even though it sits there for a while collecting virtual dust due to it becoming repetitive and stale - I am currently back into it. I grab the DLCs while on sale and the additions keep it fresh, interesting and a good variety! PS: You can complain about the price of the DLC all you want or you could actually be patient and wait til it goes on sale and buy it then... Duh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In The Sims 3, you basically create families (or play pre-made families) and live their lives as you would your own. The Sims franchise has improved throughout the years and I'm pretty satisfied with this version. If you have never played before, you can do almost everything you would in real life. Own a house, go to work, go to stores, go to friends houses, host parties, learn to cook, play chess, watch TV, and have relationships. It's a really fun game. The Create-A-Sim is also fantastic because you can customize basically every part of your Sim, including your build, clothes, and personality. It also has a memory book where it saves important parts of your Sim's life, such as you got a promotion or had a baby. It's also customizable. There are websites you can go to where you can download extra clothes and items. There are a few cons, though. The Sims 3 is integrated with EA's wannabe Facebook, so it prompts you to login in a lot. It also has a few glitches and problems, but what else do you expect with an EA game? I recommend backing up your Sims and houses in case of a problem in the future. Even with the cons, this is a game you will most likely enjoy and spend a lot of time playing.			",50,19,1,19,13,0,13

												I don't normally review, but I wanted to counter the baseless negative ones that I've seen popping up. I've loved my time with this since I brought it a couple of days ago and haven't put it down. Incredibly fun and diverse gameplay that doesn't stop being entertaining with or without DLC. The community is vast and amazing, so even if you get bored with what you can come up with there are always challenges and mods to download galore. On the topic of DLC, listen up folks - you're not supposed to buy it all, and you don't have to. The stuff packs are just decoration and not worth buying. The EPs - University Life, Late Night, Supernatural - add /different/ worlds and specific themed content ouside of the base game. The only ones that are integral really are Generations, Ambitions, Seasons and Pets. Which all come in a cheap bundle together during this sale season. Buy what looks good to YOU instead of wanting all the DLC for no reason.			",59,54,0,31,17,0,3

												Sims 3 is a very good game, from its financial teachings of life to its teaching on the stages of life, and eventually death. It also teaches about the Career Ladder, of which many workplaces may have, depending on your skills (which is also implied on the game) and if you have a healthy relationship with colleagues. On top of the fact that this game is educational, its very enjoyable and has its cool and humourus moments, which the game can automatically allow you to save and remember them. There are many aspects on which I find halarious, from the reaction to a fire, and the most saddest parts, like an old sim passing on.Despite an all round brilliant game in its graphics, which comes to my concern, it requires a very fast processor, one that most of the cheaper computers won't be able to handle, like mine. So therefore the last time I played it, it completely disheartened my gameplay experience as my computer was unable to cope and crashed many times. But, well done anyway EA, well done!

												EA is slowly managing to kill this established franshise. The people that purchase this game are usually people chasing that nostalgic white rabbit from when they were kids. It urks me when I see in this game, that you could have this feature/item if you insert your Credit Card. Even in the description of this game right above the Release date is states: ""New content for The Sims 3 Available"".. Wait Im interested in buying the base game and your pushing the dlc on me already?! :/ Im not the first one with this opinion and I wont be the last. It is insane that EA wants you to purchase up to 19, count them 19 dlc addons. Even at HALF PRICE its OVER 200 dollars for them all. The sims 3 offers little more than its predecessors. Picture your self making a sandwich.. Only one slice of bread.. No worries cut it in half then again and again and eventually that 1 atom thin piece of bread equals what this base game is. IF you do support this game and clearly I have, make EA know that this is not acceptable behavior. Game 6/10Developer -666/10			",413,126,14,44,39,6,82

												The game by its own is good, but the dlcs are so expensive. Like who seriously dishes out £400 with such ease. I thought I was going blind when I saw the prices. The producers probably split the game, and advertised the parts as ""dlcs"". I wouldn't have minded paying even £30 but 400 is like so unreasonable. Sims 4 is out and still the price is unchanged...... Pros:You really get that feeling like you're actually playing in somebodies body. Without consequences.The amount of stuff you get to do. Making tons of babies and starving them all was fun. The jobs actually make sense. You go to work at the specific time and stay there for the duration. there are consequences when you miss the jobs.Cons:The prices are smoking some good weed.The game is £20 and all you do is play with 5 pieces of furniture. Like what type of life simulator do you get where you can only decorate with FIVE pieces of furniture.The house pieces are so irregular. SERIOUSLY how is someone going to have a sphere as a roof and act like that's normal.If they sorted them prices, this game would be amazing. 5/10			",72,12,1,13,13,0,7

I heard that they actually closed down the studio after 4... lol.  From all the complaining about it gee.. wonder why :-P			",191,30,2,21,12,0,47

												The Sims 3 is inferior to The Sims 2 which is inferior to The Sims all in my opinion.  If you want to play a Sims game try getting your hands on the first one.  The Sims 3 isn't a relaxing experience in my opinion:  You're constantly on your toes trying to get everything done.  Avoid.			",147,42,3,39,33,4,73

												Horrible.I bought Sims 3 and the Pets expansion quite recently, and tried to play it, but the Create a Household thing doesn't load at all.I tried a multitude of things, including trying to just uninstall the DLC, but when I try to launch the game after uninstalling the DLC, it says ""An error occured. Please check the Logs."". I'm quite angered by this, and I don't think I'll be playing this for a long while.			",67,10,1,4,19,0,8

												Pros: There's lots of customization available to you as you create your sims, both in looks and personality, so you can easily and creepily recreate your old uncle Frank and live out his life if you really wanted to... Their AI isn't horrible, and they will self-perserve as best as possible without your input (although they're still horrible at it). There are also a lot more interactions with the world and other sims that help flesh out your little community.Cons: You need the DLCs. Maybe not all of them, but you need at least one of the larger expansions and a few content packs. The base game is okay, but it's obvious that a lot of things that should have been in the base game, such as modifications and extra options for various careers, were not in specifically so EA could sell it to you later. And as always, the more add-ons you have, the worse the game performs, so there's always this balancing act. Pro?Con?: You will wonder where the last 8 hours of your day went... frequently.Verdict: I can only recommend this game earnestly if you are okay with buying some of the DLC. If not, then you're in for maybe 15 hours or so of enjoyment before you get bored of having the same items, doing the same careeers, and generally following the same path over and over again.

												If you buy this game you really need to get all of the expansions. The base game alone will not cut it. EA's out of the box version is not the best either. You will wanna get a few mods to improve the engine thus prolonging your town's life. It sucks so bad when a town save gets so bugged it becomes nearly impossible to play.Other then the cost involved Sims 3 is one of my all time fav games. I LOVE this one!Overwhelming 5/5 !!!

												It's fun for 1-2 hours, then you realise that it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥(Atleast I did..).Be aware that if you do buy this game, you are only buying 20% of it. The rest lies in the DLCs, and some of the DLCs cost more than the game itself. So, if you think that this game is worth 29,99€ (2. Mar. 2014 price), you are wrong. There's very little to do in this game without the DLCs, so if you wanna create some crazy cat lady, you must buy the Sims Pets DLC.However, your character can be blue, and that's awesome.Graphics: 8/10.Blue skincolour: 11/10.Gameplay: Cheesetits/10.DLCs: They are probably fun/10.

												Theres always something to do, I enjoy getting my skill lvls maxed out. its probably one of the first few things i do when starting a new sim. Currently only have one expansion pack (Pets). i've not abused it yet and mad an animal hoarder (cat lady in the making). But there are plenty of mods for the game. Oh and also CTRL + SHIFT + C = Motherlode, 'testingcheatsenabled true' Edit: After purchasing almost all of the expansions i wanted, i can say im broke. lol, EA why must you be so expensive. Even if it was half the cost you'd still be making bank. I've always loved the sims and i'll continue to...minus the prices of course.Ps. Dont bother with island paradise, its full of Lag and Glitches. But the content still works for it :S			",91,106,2,6,37,2,12

												I used to own this game from a disk, but I lost it several years ago so I decided to buy it on steam when I saw it was 75% off. I love this game but it is blocked by the requirement of a Sims account, which in itself requires and EA account, so as I'm typing this I am requesting a refund from steam because I am tired of EA's rediculous practices.In conclusion: It's a great game that succumbed to the awfulness of EA.

The only problem with the game, is that the expansion packs are like 20.00! the same price as the base game! so please EA and Maxis, I know you only work on The sims 4, please make the expansion packs like 4.99.

												I loved Sims the first, and i hadnt played the franchise since, so i thought i would buy EAs Sims 3 and get some nostalgic vibes in me................ WHAT !!! £25, lol your joking right ? wrong !at its core all sims games are good, but this is not worth £25 so long after its general release.........moving on, i paid it anyway like a bored sucker !!!!............i had noticed prior to my purchase that EA have been ripping alot of thier customers off in recent years, so i have EA in the back of my mind as a personal money draining enemy who knows every trick in the book to appeal to my deepest needs to make me get my wallet out .....anyway, im soon playing away on sims three and one of the first things i notice is that there is some sort of alternate currency wich seems like you can only purchase with real money , to make this worse , this currency was bound to certain items only, items that cannot otherwise be purchased in the game, leaving the player undoubtedly wanting more through lack of what is there already,  whats worse is EA rubbing it in our noses by actually having all the items on display as if you can touch, pay and place right away,............so ive seen sims go from a plentiful game to a game thats lacking just enough to give enough insentive for people to buy this currency or even worse pay the death penalty for thier expansion packs. its terrible, EAs coorperate jacket is getting greedier,         stop feeding them.............................

												If you'd like to sire a legion of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and take over a town, play this game.  If you ever wanted to become a president or CEO just by showing up to work, play this game.  If you ever wanted to become best friends with the Grim Reaper, play this game.  If you enjoy in-depth and potentially catastrophic character creation, play this game.  If you want to construct a family more dysfunctional than your real-life one just to watch the drama unfold, play this game.  If you ever wanted to pollute the gene pool of a town with your own genetic code to the point where reproduction between current residents is no longer a viable option, play this game.  If you've never seen someone literally die of embarrassment, play this game.  There are a thousand other reasons to play this game, but if you don't want to deal with the consequences of not micromanaging (or mismanaging) the actions and interactions of your characters, you will probably end up with a lot of dead Sims (which is not necessarily a bad thing).  It's a funny, tongue-in-cheek game with loads of opportunity and replay value; I'd say stay away from the overpriced DLC (and Sims 4, too) until/unless you are totally, irredeemably bored with this one, because the base game alone provides plenty of traits, jobs, skills, etc. to keep you busy for a while.  The base town with the same cast of NPCs does start to get dull after a while, but you probably only need one or two DLC towns at most and if you don't wanna pay, then you can create your own town with your own people.  If you have a decent/recent PC, it should run fine -- a little laggy, but nothing that destroys the experience.  One of my personal all-time favorites; it's not a perfect game, but if you enjoy dicking around with other people's lives and relationships, you will not be disappointed.  10/10 would forget to go to my own wedding/first childbirth again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In some ways, this game isn't realistic enough.  I have an Irish wolfhound, and a burglar broke into my house and stole my things, all without a peep out of the dog!  Seriously?!  The dog had already been told to guard the house several times - which let's face it, you wouldn't have to do with a real dog, especially a breed like this, we're not talking chihauha here!  The dog should be programmed to automatically guard, and the burglar should be afraid of it.  Also, your dog runs away if you only feed it for a couple of days or so, and don't hug it, or play with it, or walk it, treat it, brush it ....In other ways, the game is eerily realistic.  By the time my Sim gets up, showers, brushes her teeth, makes some breakfast, feeds the dog, plays with the dog, hugs/treats/or brushes the dog, takes out the trash, and recycles the newspaper, it's time to go to work.  And my sim only has a part-time job!!  Then she has to come home, make dinner, do the whole dog thing again, maybe find a bit of time to read a skill book, and go to bed.   Way, way, way too much like real life.  Except that I have a full-time job in real life.  Why on earth would I want to play a game that was as filled with mundane tasks and routine as my own life?  People play games to escape from that!  I know, you can change the time speed.  But shouldn't the devs have already set it up as a default that the routine things don't take so long to do, so you don't have to constantly play with the time settings?  and shouldn't they have set it up so your sim knows what to do after you've done the same routine at roughly the same time on the same days, and your sim just goes and does it superfast, leaving you more time to go off and do other things in the game?  am I supposed to set this up, making routine lists and feeding them to my sim?   If I leave my sim alone to do things, she does stupid, pointless things like reading and re-reading Where's Bella, over and over again.  Maybe I just don't know how to play this game, I know it's a popular game, and maybe there's a way around these problems that my 20  hours or so of playing hasn't been enough for me to find.   I get bored quick, though, so if a game can't me interested within that 20 hours, forget it.    Sims3 gets a big thumbs down from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a wonderful game!   It's really fun to play and it's like no other game made ever.   You could easily waste away hours on such a entertaining game.Why do I not recommend it then you ask?   Easy.   Nothing ever works right.   The developers are more worried about getting the next DLC released so they can get more cash.   They really don't care if all the features in the game or the DLC don't work.  Oh?   You sent our sim to university and then it just vanished making the game unplayable?   Who cares because we already have your money!  Fun stuff.It's really a shame that we, as consumers, put up with garbage like this.   If a game isn't complete it should not be released as a complete game. Then telling people the new DLC (which cost more money) will fix the problems. Then that DLC causes problems that you have to buy the next DLC to fix.   See what I am getting at?  This game is fun but the people who made it are more worried about coming up with ways to squeeze more money out of you than they are making an enjoyable gaming experience.When you look at the number of players in the community and the number of DLCs for this game it doesn't take Adam Smith to figure out this title is raking in the cash.  You would think with that kind of money flowing the developers could at least spend a real effort getting rid of the bugs.   After two or three years games should not have bugs that make it totally unplayable.Ask yourself.   Do I really want to experience the frustration of spending money on something that infuriates me before I get through the registration process?  Am I going to spend money on a game and time creating a sim just to have them vanish when I try to use the extra content?I wish somebody would file a class action law suite against these guys.  If they had a real threat to their money perhaps then they would start making software that functions as advertised.			",21,9,1,19,31,1,36

												My review of this game is easily mixed, the game is very fun to play and enjoyable, but much more so with the downloadable content, or only a fraction of it.  Most of it is about half as expensive as the game itself where other content is even more expensive than that, there's plenty of useless add ons that only add a few cosmetic changes and nothing else.  More or less it's devided into two seprate groups.  Actual content and ""Stuff"" packs, the actual content is viable if it weren't more expensive, where as the ""Stuff"" packs only add a couple new stuff, ussually stuff that won't affect gameplay in the slightest outside of just being able to buy a couple extra stuff for twenty dollars.  Essentially the only reason I got this game due to the price was because of a 75% sale that was going on, doing research on every little pack just in case I missed something, I've narrowed down some essentials to get if you purchase this game, but I'd only do so when it's on a 75% sale due to the fact all the DLC is over 250 US$ not including the game itself.Needs:Seasons: Adds a couple new traits, a lot of new winter coats plus normal everyday clothes ussually themed with seasons, as well as adds dynamic weather and a threat of dying from weather or getting miserable sun burn.Pets: Adds a bunch of pets to the game, from cats, dogs, and horses which you can control to birds turtles and other non-controlable characters.  You'll spend a little less time speeding through your day when your sim is taken up at work or asleep this way.Generations: Adds quite a few new traits and a new theme, scrapbook, which stores your memories, the pictures are taken a bit wonky half the time but it also lets you pick your wish no matter what which is always a plus.The rest is based on oppinion such as a couple I haven't gotten, supernatual comes to mind on this one.You should avoid at all costs unless you feel 100% sure it'll add a lot to your experiance is all the stuff packs.  Mostly servering souly for role play aspects (Which the modding community glady contributes as well for free) your packs come with generally a couple new things for males and a handful for females (very lopsided men are less important than females in this game it seems) these packs server only to take your money, in fact my suspicion is that the reasoning behind using your codes on the sims 3 website you get with your games is souly because EA Games is so terrified people will find out it's a bad deal and just hack the stuff into the game, which wouldn't surprise me given their more or less monopolistic aproach.Verdict is the game is a avoid at all costs as you'll want to get a bunch of map packs, it's saving grace is that the stuff I found contributed to a great game is spending 60 US$ durring a 75% sale going on, but that's about 240 US$ out of a sale just to have a good game and that's only buying less than half the downloadable content.  Don't waste your money, wait for a sale or have been born very rich to not care, but this game so isn't worth the expense out of sale and DO NOT get this game if you don't have high end hardwear, this game will give issues to some better designed computers in its own.

Not only was the game an endless bombardment of sales pitches, but it would not work on Win 8. Tried all of the forum and support suggested fixes, but it would always crash shortly into the tutorial. Few games have made me more angry about Steam's lack of a refund policy. Don't by this. In fact, don't buy anything from EA.			",198,44,4,54,32,3,59

												Sims 3 is a simulation of................ LIFE!!!!!The game is complex and well designed enough to let the gamers enjoy the possibilities of ""life"" as we know it.It is vast enough for the gamers to see every corners of life first hand but it isn't detailed enough to showevery little miniscule details.Depending on how creative ""you"" are, the game can get extremely fun or extremely deadbeat-boring if you arn't.The game offers some intense customisationHouses, sims, jobs, family, are some aspects that are fully customizable down to every individual faces.It is a must try and a worthwhile buy(base game) quality wise.They have their own version of a contents sharing communitites, the gamers are able to download various player made people, buildings, objects from the internet.Similar to EA's spore, this is one of their trademark franchise that has not failed them, (for a damn good reason.)The pros are explained above, the cons are:-The game greeds money, it really WANTS you to make purchases for ingame items, DLCs etc.-DLCs make the game more fun, THEY ARE INDEED FUN but imagine how much money you'll have to pay for various DLCsyou want.(if the prices have dropped to primal dollar values then reconsider the statement above)-The game can get addictive, it can seriously chew up some valueable time.-After you play the game for a long bit, it can start to lag horribley due to cummulated cache and such, so consider ventilating a bit.- Sims4(or versions above?) would be out. It would be more versatile than the previous sims3 and possibly more fun.-It is reccomended you use Origin :(If you ""love"" and ""somewhat respect"" their game, consider buying it... If you wish to be frugal and do not want to spend every penny for their DLCs then please torrent safely :)     ",97,21,4,6,8,2,12

The launcher is a bit of a pain and there seem to be a few clipping errors in the game along with the AI being questionable at times.However, these are easily fixable and minor inconveniences at worst, save for the clipping issue, but that's where the command prompt comes in.

												This game has its pros and cons. You can design your own house, create your own sim and all that. But the bad thing is that the gameplay is kind of repetitive and dull, you always do the same stuff when you start a new playthrough, build a house, create your own sim, find a job, make money and perhaps some woo hoo.Second, the DLCs. They are overpriced and not worth it. You can waste 100 bucks on DLCs and you might regret it.I'll just click on the no button on the ""Do you recommend this game?"" for its dull and repetitive gameplay. But not entirely. You don't have to agree with the review. Go ahead and buy the game and all of the DLCs if you want to.			",106,12,4,3,22,0,23

												Its a decent comical game, Unfortunatly it was designed and published by EA games...This is the first time i have seen it on sale on steam... oh wait  nope The pets is still 19.99  tsk tsk how old is this game now? I know it aint new enough to be worth 19.99 for a tiny little expansion as of addind A dog and a cat. and I bet my pay check its still has the same ol bugs becuase since it is published by EA games, If they made a patch to fix the bugs they would have to relabel it as the simms 4 and charge $60 for it... Oh wait they already done this? then I know for sure that any bugs that was there after the simms 4 came out is STILL there. Thanx for the hard work EA gamesWholly crap batman... the simm3 pets is on sale for 7.49... Miracles never cease to amaze me, even when they are 4 years too late... will i buy it? naw, do i recommend you to buy it? sure if you like building things... I definatly recomend it  oh to be fair- this game is better for home design then 78% of the home design programs out there SO YEAH if your into construction this is your game!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why live life when you can play life? Where else can I work hard at becoming a world-renown politician, quit that and join the medical career, quit that after you realize you had a better job before and then go and be a criminal, then say scew working for a living I have cheats, then procede to design a ""elegantly"" designed manor and be as weirdly gay as I want to be? Wait what......ignore that last part.....One problem with this game though.....THE DLC!!! They're fun as heck, but come on EA! Do you really think we're willing to pay so much for stuff that should have been in the game in the first place, you could at least lower it...and the micro-transactions, don't get me started on them....greedy, greedy, greedy! Otherwise it's a fantastic game. Just make sure you get it when it's on sale. Don't be suckered into the full price!			",58,15,0,14,21,1,13

												The Sims 3 is a great experiment in the simulated genre, and it's apparent that it'll stand up against its successors (e.g. Sims 4) it still reeks of the cash-grabbing tactics of EA, with over 20 expansions that just make it a point of overkill unless they're heavily discounted.If you're a hardcore Sims fan, then you're already going to buy everything, but the fact remains that the create-a-texture option solves a lot of issues that EA would rather you pay money to solve in the form of completely new items.Sims 3 gets a positive review, but just barely. It's enjoyment is hindered by how bogged down it is with expensive downloadable content that tries to sell itself as essential to an enjoyable experience one moment, and an experiment in caveat empor the next.

												It's a shame that The Sims 2 isn't available on Steam (and that I seem to recall it having big issues running on later versions of Windows), because that's the best entry in the series. I gave this entry a fair shake, but ultimately didn't like it. My biggest criticism might be that building and designing your house is a thousand times more complicated than the last game, which some people might actually consider a plus. I consider myself to have an obsessive attention to detail, but this game overwhelmed me. Do you want to position your furniture at an angle? What about BETWEEN grid spaces? Do you want to decide the precise shade of every single object in your house? Again, some people might love these new features, but I missed the days when everything snapped to a simple grid and color options were limited. A few constraints allow creativity to blossom, you know? My biggest problem with building and designing, however, is not the overwhelming amount of options but the fact that it just felt less intuitive. In The Sims 2, I knew what all the building tools did and if I had a piece of furniture in mind, I had a pretty good idea where to find it. Not the case with this game. Wait for Sims 4, or go retro.			",13,4,0,7,1,0,5

My issue is with the damn crashing, I have a high-end laptop running Windows 10 and the game crashes every 5-10 minutes..The combined with the fact that there is no god damn autosave, becomes insanely frustrating.. The other issue is with the extreme amounts of cut-content-""DLC"" which addup to 1000%x the initial price of the game despite it being 7 years old..EA I demand you fix this damn game, and then I may buy some DLC... Considering steam won't allow refunds for this game even though I have a valid f*ing reason..			",36,0,0,8,12,0,15

												I absolutely love all even previous Sims games such as Sims 1,2 and the newest 3, primarily because you can create your own house and family according to your imagination. Then you can cloth and add your desired attributes which takes a lot of times, therefore you can play the game endlessly much by adding more stuff or even killing your Sims. You can even buy and add new expansions to add a lot of new cool features to the game such as supernatural Sims and lots of other things. The already big in-game content can be even supplemented with lots of custom content from the internet which is much sexier than the standard content. It is a hugely time consuming game which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing simulation games. However, if you're not a fan of such games you might find it boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You may see the ""2.8 hrs on record"" and think ""Okay, surely you have a funny story to tell from your game.""But in fact, all that time was just spent in Create a Sim, perfecting four sims.10/10UPDATE: I had to add a young adult, since everyone else was a teen. I randomized her traits, trapped her in a box outside of the house and thought nothing of it. She burst into flames from the heat and died.But I didn't pay attention to what traits she had. The grim reaper resurrected her because of her 'Unlucky' trait. I was so mad.I had to use cheats to age her up to the point of death, something I swore I wouldn't do.10/10, my verdict still stands.

												The sims is basically life:the game, the only difference is that you can be whatever you want in the sims, (you can kinda do that in real life as well, but hey-ho). The sims is a very fun game where you can create your dream life, and do whatever you like in it! Everybody's story is unique (most of the time). The only downfall to this wonderfull game is the cost, it costs about £425 to get the game and all the Dlc's, Which is ridicuous, so buy the game, and only buy the Dlc's when discounted. A lot. So overall, the sims 3 is a good game so I recommend getting it! (but not the full price of the Dlc's).			",10,2,0,0,5,0,3

												I've been playing The Sims 3 ever since it first came out, but I'm going to be reviewing this as someone who also plays The Sims 4 most of the time. I decided to revisit The Sims 3 after missing expansion packs like University and Seasons. I have a pretty good laptop that runs Sims 3 very well, but it's a game that I think no matter what kind of system you play on will be filled with lag and some glitches. It makes sense considering in the Sims 3, compared to every other game in the series, takes place in an open world. That's what makes the Sims 3 so great, being able to go to the library without a loading screen, or having my sim take a dog for a walk. Character customization compared to the other games, is way better. You have such extensive customization you can get lost in create a sim for a good hour. It's a good thing imo. The negatives, and the biggest reasons I play The Sims 3 not as much as I  use to is I find the character models blah compared to the Sims 4 (and even The Sims 2 tbh), in order to have a good variety of items you need to purchase a lot of expensive stuff packs and whatnot, which sucks (I think for the most part all the main game expansion packs are fun and worth the price for the most part). Along with the online store, just having to pay more money for things I think should be included in the expansion packs. I'm glad The Sims 4 went away with that. Even though you don't need all the expansion packs (I would say having Generations, Seasons, University and Pets are the only ones really worth having), they are nice to expand gameplay. Overall I think The Sims 3 is worth playing, it's open world, great character customization and fun main game expansion packs will make for a good time.			",28,13,0,7,14,0,11

												I've been playing The Sims 3 ever since it first came out, but I'm going to be reviewing this as someone who also plays The Sims 4 most of the time. I decided to revisit The Sims 3 after missing expansion packs like University and Seasons. I have a pretty good laptop that runs Sims 3 very well, but it's a game that I think no matter what kind of system you play on will be filled with lag and some glitches. It makes sense considering in the Sims 3, compared to every other game in the series, takes place in an open world. That's what makes the Sims 3 so great, being able to go to the library without a loading screen, or having my sim take a dog for a walk. Character customization compared to the other games, is way better. You have such extensive customization you can get lost in create a sim for a good hour. It's a good thing imo.

												Sims 3 is a pretty alright game, i mean. its good for pretty much anyone with no life and no friends. I've enjoyed most of my time on sims... other times it can be incredibly fustrating when you want to build a house and the floor plans screw up. Or when the relationships dont quite make the cut you want them too, eg. i made my wife walk in on me screwing a guy, she apeared unfazed. But other than the occasional hair pulling moment, its a reasonably good game.			",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I really love this game. First of all the only negative comments about this game are that you have to pay extra for more clothes, maps and furniture. Secondly the dlc is over priced! I mean it is about the price of new games! After all these issues you get a brilliant simulator. In this game you can create any Evil or good character your heart requires. You can litteraly do anything in this game (with the help of some mods of course.) This game and the dlc are huge. I mean you can go over to france and steal some statues come back and sell them. You could also set up a dating profile. Then you also have the option of playing as a murder. Kiddnaping victims then drowing them or roasting them alive. You can also simulate your life by geting your job and making new friends and romance your romantic interests. Whatever you want to be you can be it in this game. This gets a positive rating from me!			",172,20,2,13,19,0,6

												The Sims 3 is the best Sims game you can get. Either playing it normally or dicking around, it's a lot of fun. What more could you ask for? You can be a total creep and make your high school crush so you can bang her and have seven children, or you can be the sadistic ♥♥♥♥ you are and lock a sim in a room filled with ovens and fireplaces and burn them to the ground.The DLCs are very pricey ($20 each) but you can always wait until a big sale goes on and you can get them for $5 each. And trust me, the DLCs add a lot of really fun content and immensely improve the game.If for some reason you haven't at least tried a Sims game, get this one. The Sims 4 is absolute garbage, get 3. Yes, this game came out a long time ago, but I'm really bored right now so I decided to write a review on it.			",86,11,1,16,5,0,1

												I can say that this game is way better than The Sims 4, this game is the one that changes how The Sims work (most of it). Personality is the biggest changes made, in The Sims and The Sims 2 you can only change Neat, Outgoing, Active, etc. but in The Sims 3 this is where personality becomes more specific, from Absent-Minded to Charismatic sims, the base game is already fun but purchasing the DLCs (I'd recommend expansions pack instead of stuff pack) makes the game more complete.The game is open world, so the loading screen may be longer compared to other The Sims.Before purchasing the DLCs make sure to go online to see what features it offers, also ONLY buy the DLC (at least try to) when on sale. because they are overpriced. Want to know why to buy the DLCs on sale? Check the total price of The SIms 3 plus DLCs, it's just mental.-------------------------------------------The downside of this game is.... SHOP mode.... It's just outrageous, I'd rather have community made object than this.... Also performance issue, other Sims games are way less demanding than this, including The Sims 4.			",87,10,7,7,11,1,5

												Ok this game is good, like its addicting the first few days and then it starts getting a little boring BUT THERES SO MUCH DLC that you could never be bored, so much to do, so much to explore, if you have the money. It's a bit overpriced, but usually worth it. The reason it's better than Sims 4 is because S4 has only been out for a few months and its got a lot ahead for it. I lke them equal, but without DLC for both, so far Sims 3 is better cause of cars and the whole open world thing, i LOVE THAT!

												It's convenient how I don't need to get out the old disc for Sims 3 when I want to play nowadays. That's probably the biggest benefit of buying it on Steam.  I played this game all the time when it first came out and it's just as fun as it was back then such as lighting people on fire, drowning them in pools, trapping them in a 1x1 room and watching the sims pee themselves, or creating a facility full of slaves/prisoners. Basically finding the best way possible to make every Sim as miserable as possible. If you want to be different, then I guess you could play normally but there's no fun in that.The only thing I noticed however, is that this version seems to have consistent bugs as well as corrupted files or saves so if you end up buying the game, make sure you have some good save files or else you might have to start over depending on how much patience you have.

												The sims 3 is a very enjoyable game... WIth the DLC... I mean the core game is fun for the first couple of hours or even the first couple of days but it dries out quickly.There isn't enough to do in the core game and if you want all the DLC you are going to need to pay approximately $400, I recommend getting the game right now during the flash sale or just when the game is on special so you can enjoy the game a little more.Game elements like playing the Piano and going to university should realy be in the core game but no, you are going to have to pay for the ""Late Night"" DLC if you want a piano, or the ""University Life"" DLC if you want your sim to go streaking. With the DLC the game is exceptional but it costs far too much money to play the game without getting bored.If you bought all the DLC for $400... You could have bought 50 if not more games for that value, cheap-ish ones of course but there are many impressive indie games out there, especially now that the summer sales are going round so you can get over 100 games and still have some change.But as we all know EA are notorious for DLC so asking for less DLC that is cheaper would be asking too much so only buy this game if you have seen gameplay of the core game and seem interested enough or if you want to play for DLC.

												If someone wants to play a good sims game. I recommend sim 2 over this garbage. There may have been some nice added features since the sims 2, but there is barely any furniture that you don't have to buy. It significantly takes away the enjoyment I had playing the past games.  I'm so glad that I got this game on sale because it is definetly not worth the original price.you dun ♥♥♥♥ed it up again EA			",79,26,0,35,9,2,6

												A game with infinite possibilites but none of them are realized.  So much promise down the drain with this one.Sims 3 feels like a massive step back from Sims 2: you get less content from the Sims 3 basegame than the Sims 2 basegame...and what Sims 2 was able to do in a handful of DLCs, Sims 3 does with a boatload with each DLC cost at $19-$39.  Ridiculous!But let's never mind that...the game is seriously broken.  Slow load times, game crashes, frequently corrupted saves, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches, glitches...etc!!!!Hey, EA, how about FIXING your damn game before releasing the next DLC?  It's frustrating to see glitches from 2012 still breaking the game while a million DLCs are being added since that time.  Get off your fat stacks of cash and make the game playable as it's meant to be played, you can't rely on the modding community to fix everything--it's YOUR problem NOT ours.			",165,35,0,16,7,2,23

												It actually, actively bothers me that I like this game. Seriously. The Sims is a franchise that has with each new iteration stripped features that used to be free and turned them into expansion packs you have to pay money for, all the while reducing modding capability in favor of trying to nickel-and-dime more stuff out of you to the point that you cannot actually get into the game without getting through a storefront that tries to sell you more things. From a business-practices perspective it's really, really icky and uncomfortable and it makes me feel bad that I still play it....but I still play it. God dammit. EA, why are you the only company that makes good life sims. I'm marking this as a no-recommendation not because you shouldn't play it but rather because it's the only way I can rescue any of my dignity.			",1060,382,26,186,112,12,150

												I played this game only to find out that it was so unfinished that they had to add over $400 of DLC, doing so says one of two things: That this is an unfinished game and that the patches are hidden in DLC, or that EA are greedy b*stards.Hey at least the all the DLC is cheaper than the DLC for Train simulator.

												THE MONEY:The game as it stands, with all its DLCs, is $420. With that, you could buy 8 brand new 60 dollar games, and this base game.The game should come with a few DLCs, like generations and university life. If you ask me, University life is the only one worth 30 bucks, but it should come with the Sims 3 anyway.  Also, some DLCs are way too expensive, like the ""Stuff DlCs"" that come with a few furnitures and clothes for 20 bucks. Pets adds cats, dogs, and horses I believe. They do nothing but cost you extra money and aren't cute or worth it because you can't pet, ride, or walk them like you would in real life, just clicking buttons. But I suppose thats the whole game. 5/10GAMEPLAY:*sigh*It's fun, however. The base game has lots of content, but it begans getting repetative. It's abunch of time wasting really, click this to do this. Woo-hoo. Oh, and the game is about sex basicly too, and repopulation. I  moved in to my crappy house and a a neighbor and I just started talking. 5 minutes later we were ""woo-hooing"" or having sex basicly. 8.5/10 for gameplay.PERFORMANCE:Another problem with DLCs, is that they cause the game to crash and become slower with each one. The base game it self, is a buggy crashy mess. It seems every other time you start the game, it slaps you across the face and holds up a big red STOP sign. Then, you have to reinstall it, with 3/10 times that won't work, and you have to dive into the bowels of the steams community archives to find a fix for this SH*T because it's a different problem every hoover dam TIME!!!!  1/10But hey, I still play the mess and keep repeating the reinstall Don't I? *sigh* I have no life.

												There's a lot I want to praise this game for. There's tons of sim customization options here, some very powerful building tools, and some pretty funny situations you can get your sims in. Even the pets have a ton of customization options available to them. In truth, when the mood hits me just right The Sims can feel like an incredibly satisfying game. Why can't I recommend this game then? I have probably over 500 hours clocked into this game on Origin. I have almost all the expansions, and a lot of fun memories with this game. In a lot of ways The Sims is like a seperate hobby branching off of your gaming hobby. The problem is that it's a stupidly expensive hobby for a game and, ultimately, feels like a huge waste of time. No matter what houses or community lots I create or fun families I put together, actually playing the game is often a huge head ache thanks to some pretty miserable pathing choices and unrealistic Sim interactions (why can't they just socialize with the people in the room with them while they are all doing different activities?). I often finding most of my time going into creating new lots for the game, but I have yet to ever make it through an entire generation without the game feeling simply too repetative, unimmersive, or just plain buggy as hell. There are some fantastic mods that can fix a couple of the issues I've pointed out above, but if you're new to the series bewarned that it is, without a doubt, a huge time sink and a very expensive one at that. Ultimately I think the promises of The Sims 4 has potential to fix many of my peevs with the game, but once again, what an expensive game to get into...You have been warned.			",276,32,0,64,26,1,45

												The Sims 3 is great in joy able game. This an all-round game including building, adventure, simulation (of life) and an awesome RPG. In this game you start of by creating your own character who then lives in common house of your chose. After you find a job you like your character experiences rising through the ranks, learning skills (such as writing, athletics, etc.…) and finding that special someone. I personally have this game and have spent 125 hours, so far, manipulating different Sims (all boy and all young adults) lives and see what were to happen if I were to say, quit my job and become a hippy with a guitar trying to get money for some bread. Below are 3 Pros and Cons for particular game:Pros for This Game-The game never runs out of thing/activity you can ever do such as once you have completely mastered a skill by either reading a book or learn by yourself by doing that skill. You can take it one step further by doing that selected skills side mission-You can date anyone you want nothing is off the table in relationship in Sims3 such as dating every woman on the game or dating and marring the same sex as you. You break someone marriage apart or crush a girls heart over and over again-In this game there are packs you can get such as The Sims 3 Plus Pets or The Sims 3 Plus University Life and so on. These Plus pack make the game just a little better.Cons for this Game- Your Sim can literally die any were such as on the toilet or while you are making waffles-There are many glitches such as people having purple skin or having a 2 jobs such as an astronaut and a policeman-The Sims themselves have no common sense such as if a door is locked they just rage at the door and don’t try and unlock it			",114,6,0,11,8,0,1

												So I have played from Sims all the way to Sims 4, and I would have to say Sims 4 is sadly pretty bad simply due to the fact they took away the ability to just Explore a MAP, now we are stuck with a blocks worth of map and we have to go through loading screens just to visit someone on the other side of the street. But Sims 3 is the topic, So Sims 3 when it first come out I was still very attatched to Sims 2 and due to there being no expansion packs for sims three it seemed a lot less fun, not to say that even to this day there are thing I do miss about But Sims 3 has so much going for it and is an absolute blast. I would highly suggest getting all DLC, I run the game with all epansions installed with no lag, so not sure what some people are whining about honestly. Get the game and the DLC and you will be amazed with how much you can do!P.S. I would suggest buying an expansion here and there due to the price, just buy them over time till you have them all :).

												I highly recommend this game, because I love to create new people and to model out their life. You can do crazy things and make different scenarios, and I think it's an all around pretty good game. I became addicted to it after the first hours or so. EA, of course, will be dangling the expansion/stuff packs in your face, but I had a fun time with the base game. It was cool to create new generations and progress the family tree, and it's not like the Sims 3 is an unfinished game.  The expansion are extremely overpriced, however. The constant nagging to ""buy this hairstyle!"" and to ""buy this awesome expansion pack!"" gets annoying quickly, especially if you don't want to fork over your cash for some new furniture. However, now with the summer sale, I think it's definitely a grab. $20 wasn't too bad for the base game, but $5 dollars is really good. If you are only just now buying the game, try to look up some expansion pack reviews too. I'm not trying to promote anything, but if you play the game for a little while and want to buy one, it'll be a lot harder to give $20  than it is to give $5. Final thoughts: I'd give this game a go, even if you are kind of inbetween, mainly because of the summer sale. However, if the sale's over, I'd still think about getting it, but hold off for the expansion packs.			",18,0,0,5,3,0,1

												Create, build, and explore this fun filled adventure were you control the action. You get to create your very own Sim and build a house or a future for yourself. The options to the creativity in this game are endless. There are so many options to what you can do it can be overwhelming at times. You put attributes into your Sim and you can ether dictate every little action your Sim does or let the Sim make its own decisions. The world is massive and you can interact with pretty much everything. You can be what you want to be and do what you want to do. But with every action there is a equal and opposite reaction so remember that when playing this game. Its such an awesome adventure and a very addictive hard game to put down. Just the details that you can put into your home is mind boggling.  I have totally loved playing and creating in this game. If you like a big world were you control a Sim and control the outcomes to an extent then this is a definite do not miss game! I love it!			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477

												I've owned The Sims 3 since release on disc version, but never had any DLC. For the 2016 summer sale, I saw all the DLC was dirt cheap and decided to buy it again on steam with most of the DLC (hence the lack of hours played at the moment). But anyway, the review... I bet most of you at least know what the Sims is all about. It's essentially a goofy life simulator which will eventually turn into your actual life bacause of how addictive it is! You can do pretty much anything you can do in real life... Get a job, get a car, get married, grow old, wet yourself in public and then die...But seriously, being able to have kids and watch them grow up and have kids of their own and build an entire family tree is so amazing. It's my favourite thing about this game and there are so many things to love! I'd strongly recommend Sims 3 over the Sims 4 anyday. It was just designed so much better. I've played every single Sims game and I'd without a doubt say 3 is the superior one. And that's just the base game! The DLC adds so many elements that vastly improve the experience. Seasons, Late night & Generations are must haves for immersion. But feel free to youtube them all and decide which you like best. I'd suggest waiting for a sale to get the DLC though (Like I did) as they are fairly overpriced usually. But to summarise... Yes! I'd recommend this game 100% (even if it was produced by the evil EA company). So stop reading reviews and click buy if you haven't already!			",57,10,0,18,10,0,9

												The Sims 3 has introduced a touch more realism to the game via updated graphics, for me the graphics are a little 'too' realistic. The cartoony element of the game is what made me fall in love with it's predecessor The Sims 2.There is extreme creative control with regards to customisation and open-world gameplay.This is not to say that build-mode is simple, however. Certain aspects are likely to cause irritation.Gameplay style has ironed out many old flaws from S2, but as usual there are plenty of new bugs!Despite The Sims 2 being my continued favourite for the series due to the incorporated storylines, The Sims 3 leaves most to the imagination. If played with all expansion packs it only enhances entertainment.Overall, I really enjoy this game. I would recommend to any Sims fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 has introduced a touch more realism to the game via updated graphics, for me the graphics are a little 'too' realistic. The cartoony element of the game is what made me fall in love with it's predecessor The Sims 2.There is extreme creative control with regards to customisation and open-world gameplay.This is not to say that build-mode is simple, however. Certain aspects are likely to cause irritation.Gameplay style has ironed out many old flaws from S2, but as usual there are plenty of new bugs!Despite The Sims 2 being my continued favourite for the series due to the incorporated storylines, The Sims 3 leaves most to the imagination. If played with all expansion packs it only enhances entertainment.Overall, I really enjoy this game. I would recommend to any Sims fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've owned The Sims 3 since release on disc version, but never had any DLC. For the 2016 summer sale, I saw all the DLC was dirt cheap and decided to buy it again on steam with most of the DLC (hence the lack of hours played at the moment). But anyway, the review... I bet most of you at least know what the Sims is all about. It's essentially a goofy life simulator which will eventually turn into your actual life bacause of how addictive it is! You can do pretty much anything you can do in real life... Get a job, get a car, get married, grow old, wet yourself in public and then die...But seriously, being able to have kids and watch them grow up and have kids of their own and build an entire family tree is so amazing. It's my favourite thing about this game and there are so many things to love! I'd strongly recommend Sims 3 over the Sims 4 anyday. It was just designed so much better. I've played every single Sims game and I'd without a doubt say 3 is the superior one. And that's just the base game! The DLC adds so many elements that vastly improve the experience. Seasons, Late night & Generations are must haves for immersion. But feel free to youtube them all and decide which you like best. I'd suggest waiting for a sale to get the DLC though (Like I did) as they are fairly overpriced usually. But to summarise... Yes! I'd recommend this game 100% (even if it was produced by the evil EA company). So stop reading reviews and click buy if you haven't already!			",57,10,0,18,10,0,9

												This is a game, in which the publisher (EA) dosn't give enough ♥♥♥♥♥ to fix their game. The computer could be powerful but that won't be enough, it will never be enough. for this game was poorly written thus it will lag, sputter, and die. This however isn't the only problem that plauges the game oh no. If you are the type of person who wants to spend 300$ for a dlc to help pimp that base game out then have fun. If you don't want to do such a wasteful thing then stay away (also ♥♥♥♥ micro transaction shops in full priced games).  ",93,6,1,27,21,0,23

												I've been a Sims fan since the original.  Put hundreds of hours into Sims.  Sims2.  And now...  After hours and hours spent in this game, and hundreds of dollars spent on every expansion...  I can honestly say I will not be buying Sims 4, or any other Sims Game until the bugs that make this current franchise unplayable, are fixed.Lag issues are the main problem here. I mean, you invest time into this game... And then they release an expansion that will apparently ""enhance"" your experience, but what it actually does destroy everything you've put any effort into, and bring the game to such a horrible state it can no longer be played for even 5 minutes at a time.I mean, who tests this stuff?   Nobody thought to load up all the expansions onto one computer, play it for a couple hours and go...  ""Huh...  This is buggy.""I've put so much money into this game.But you won't get me again.  I am thoroughly disappointed.			",89,12,1,20,25,0,14

												Extremely addictive, and for a good reason. The sims 3 gets more and more interesting every expansion you buy and although expensive, pretty worth it. And even if you don't want to spend all your money on expansions there are plenty of mods and custom content you can download for free that are quite possibly just as good. And you don't have to wear pants. Definitely reccomend this game 9/10			",35,15,0,6,9,0,3

Would I buy Sims 4? Only if it came in a bundle sale on steam and had smaller game save files. Do I have fun with it? Sure, but then I can have fun with a lot of simpler games. It's cheap to get if you grab the bundle on holidays and hours of play if you like Storytelling. Yes, its basically playing with a digital dollhouse or ""action figures.""

The Sims 3 And all previous versions have gave me so many hours of fun and also lost me so many hours as once i start playing, I lose track of time it can become very addictive. You can always try to play the game the same way but it never ends the same way!. And the Expansions just add even more hours and ways of fun! However they are not needed to play the game at all. I find the game full of plenty even without the Expansions. Well worth it : )			",88,31,6,11,15,0,15

												As sims player since the first game's release in the beginning of 2000, I loved the first one, a promising game that was overall fun, but it felt like aside from babies growing up, the child OR adult never aged, though the soundtrack is the best out of all the main series of Sims, gotta love that jazzy music~. When the Sims 2 out in 2004, a massive improvement to the first one. I loved it to death and spent hours of playing it (Still playing it with the Ultimate Collection!), from abducting sims for the cute aliens, growing my family tree, helping my sims succeed throughout their life with a Summa Cuum Laude in the University Expansion, to raising their skills before their death, and so much more! When The Sims 3 came out, that was a different story, I didn't like it at first, no matter how much I tried to like it with all the expansions I bought, I couldn't. Right before the failure of a sequel known as The Sims 4 came out, I decided to give The Sims 3 one more chance, and finally, I got hooked!Sims 3, like the Sims 2, is a massive improvement to the previous 2, regardless of the ridiculous microtransaction. The game is meant to simulate... Well, life! They even added a open-world aspect to the game! Oh, skills now varies from what you learn, it's not just a general thing like Creativity for arts and music, it's now skills like Guitar, Drums, Piano, Painting, so much more! Even exploring the neighborhood collecting items and finding interesting things for your skills. In some expansions, there is a new Life State I taken a liking to, such as Imaginary friends, a great way to build my family tree since you could make a Imaginary friend of the opposite gender of the owner. Even Aliens make a return in Seasons, and oh~ my~, they're even cuter than Sims 2 with that synthesize voice!Overall, like Sims 2, a massive improvement to the previous Sims. Get it and save your money for the expansions!			",254,22,3,24,30,1,33

												Always been a huge fan of The SimsSims 2 was basically my childhood and I always enjoyed screwing around on it or simply putting all my energy into one family that I enjoyed the most. Ofcourse Sims 2 would've been delightful with horses, but I suppose that's why they brought out Sims 3 pets.My review is going to be short, but enjoy it anyway, however useless it may seem.I adore Sims 3 and it's a very fun game to play, very addictive once you get the hang of what family you want to make the best.Now I love some of the DLC and I've always adored adding extra things to my game, I use the store a lot for the game, but in my opinion, a lot of the DLC seems rather overpriced for what you're actually getting in it, now things like the extra add ons for clothes / furniture etc don't give you very much and they cost more than the actual game itself, it's pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I give this game an 11/10.

Unplayable!There is no auto-save option and manual saving takes almost a minute. Add that the load times of 5 minutes, the forced unskippable logo movies every startup and it's a recipe for extreme annoyance. Do not buy this. Despite being out for years and EA producing and selling hundreds of Euros worth of DLC, the game itself is so unstable you will not be able to play it.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Created a sim with the name of Slocknog the glorious slug from Faster Than Light. After Slocknog crash-landed on the planet the sims inhabit, he joined their millitary in order to become an astronaut and fly back to the federation. However once 4 sims greeted him with a house warming gift Slocknog became enraged. He tried to hit it off with one of the females but she rejected him. All four of the sims were found dead trapped behind walls. Slocknog later met a wonderful sim by the name of Erin. After marrying Erin, Slocknog killed her whole family, leaving them to themselves.

												Well being a sims 2 user i have to say i didnt like sims 3 at all so never spent time on it, BUT i recently gave it another go with a couple of expansions and stuff packs and finally shrugged off the sims 2 syndrome and was happy that i did. I was amazed that i had been missing out on a very good sims game because of my stubboness. Graphics are great best out of sims series and gameplay is more fun and the ability to move around map without loading screens is a welcomed addition, cant wait to get all expansions and stuff packs when i can but for now i can clearly say that if you like sims then get this.

												Super happy that the expansions of the Sims 3 is on sale, so I decided to get every expansion. No regrets. I played Sims way back in the 90's, and have been a Sims fan, there's no real goal in Sims 3, its your goal. You can do whatever you want in it. Create a house of your dreams, romance, or socialize your way through the game, even if romancing isnt your thing, there's being in the work force, get the job you want. You can also mod the game to hell and back if you want too as well. Everything about this game is awesome. Cheating in this game is also fun, there's no repercussions doing that. I think cheating is commended actually, you can play it vanilla. It's entirely up to you.			",214,4,2,31,11,0,27

												Recommended because its a lot better than the Sims 4, has more features, better graphics and is overall a lot more feature complete.  However keep in mind that expansion packs for this game are very expensive for what they provide, but if you disliked The Sims 4, then the base Sims 3 is where you should be going.Like all over sims games its fun and charming at the same time, AI is fairly good, and is a really good life Simulator. The game will run on even lower end PC's so its open to a wider audience, however I noticed in the Paradise Falls DLC that town has severe stuttering issues regardless of your specs.

												Oh, the SIMS. The love we dare not speak its name. I remember playing the original and thinking that it was a lot like a game I had played way, way back in DOS land. Then Sims 2 came out and competely blew my mind, giving a whole new spin on the idea of the virtual dollhouse. It was a game you could walk away from, come back to, watch passively or interfere with. So imagine my surprise when Sims 3 said that the entire town was going to run simultaneously. I was shocked, outraged, and said I wouldn't play it.I take everything back. The Sims 3 is a solid upgrade to the Sims 2 (though it crashes just as much, it seems) and the up-and-coming Sims 4 still appear to have everything that made the franchise great amounts of money for EA... and people are still waiting in the wings to give them more. Yes, EA, you've taken my money again and I gave it with a smile, a prayer, and a pony.Rating: 9/10			",107,57,4,30,26,3,35

												First spend an eternity downloading mods to make your sims look absolutely fabulous and after days (or weeks) finally start actually playing the game. Game runs smoothly, only had one occasion of a crash without any error codes. All DLCs are not necessary. What you ''need'' depends on what you'd like to have as an additional experience to your gameplay. I bought three (Amibitions/Generations/Late Night) and that's it for me. The non-sale prices are ridiculous, so I did snatch mine during a sale.			",59,18,0,8,11,1,15

												This version has still kept its proper sense of simulation, also being more advanced with added varies emotions, but the loading times are not what I expected. With 4GB RAM and 2GHz, I find that it takes about 8-10 minutes total to launch the game and enter my neighborhood. Sure it's a more complex version, but I load today's modern games more efficiently.I recommend the game, just make sure to have something to occupy yourself when launching.			",18,0,0,5,4,0,1

												The best game in the Sims franchise. It has an organized and intuitive play system, well bodied and fun expansions, and not to mention the widest variety of occult sims and towns/locations. The downsides are long screen wait times, repetitive music, and poor use of ""create a sim"" (CAS) customization sliders. Overall it is a great game and worth the buy.			",6,5,0,4,2,0,0

My thoughts on The Sims 3The PortThe port is a very interesting one. The options menu is very buggy with the settings sometimes resetting to default as well as sound options taking a bit to actually change or just straight up not changing at all. The video options are varied and nice as well as descriptive but not very informative in terms of certain options, such as edge smoothing, as well as there being no settings for keybinds or mouse sensitivity, besides mouse inverting. Overall the port isn't bad besides some awkward Windows 10 support and performance related issues.The Graphics/PerformanceThe graphics for the game are not the greatest with low res foliage, decent at best textures, awkward lighting and some rather bad modeling. That being said this game was from 2010, was completely open world and obviously needed to compensate for what it was offering. The performance on the other hand is very not good. Actually running the game is absolutly not problem it's very easy to max out the game on even some low end systems but the game is an absolute stuttery mess, even on lower settings. Many people have reported lots of stuttering on high end and low end systems alike. It's a big problem with the game that I can't let slip. It's not very stable at all with its performanceThe Story/Atmosphere/CharactersNon-existant story but the atmosphere of being in a lively environment is very much there but that's all I have to say. I can't really comment on the characters all that much.The ControlsDirect mouse control with keybinds for camera movement and some menu controls. Besides a feeling of mouse acceleration nothing to really say about this.The GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. This is an amazing life simulation game that really feels like you're taking part in, and leading, someone and really being that person. The animation system is absolutely fantastic, besides some bad animation transition, the character interaction is complex and unique and the game as a whole is extremely well done. The AI is a bit stupid and not very good but I can excuse that for how good the rest of this game is. The characted customization is the best I've ever seen, besides maybe Black Dessert Online, with in depth characted facial construction and amazing clothing customization, with the option of creating your own clothing. The only fault is the lack of hair-styles, facial hair, hats and the really crappy body hair and tattoo options but those can be excused.The ConclusionThis game is a fantastic game with many flaws but I would no doubt recommend this to anyone looking for a good simulation game to throw on to waste some time. Not to mention it's one of the good EA games that are on Steam so there's a major plus.The VerdictPort - 7.5/10Graphics - 6/10Performance - 3.5/10Story - *no rating*/10Atmosphere - 9.5/10Characters - *no rating*/10Controls - 8/10Gameplay - 10/10AI - 6.5/10Average Rating - 7/10Actual Rating - 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love The Sims games, but I don't believe it's worth it to pay CAD $19.99 per DLC, after you've already paid CAD $19.99 for the game itself. The Sims 2 on PS2 was my favorite out of all the games, because you could control the sim instead of just telling them to do this or do that. However, my second favorite game in the francise is The Sims 3 for PC. Now, I've played more than just The Sims 3, so I can honestly I like it better than The Sims Castaway, The Sims, and The Sims 2: Pets. Note: The Sims 3 is the only one I have played on the PC, the rest were for PS2. There's just more customization, better graphics, more actions you can do, more speech choices, and more ages. I would love to get the DLC's, especially Pets and Supernatural, but as I said in the beginning of this review, it just doesn't seem worth it to me. I know the developers and everyone else involved in making the game deserve to get paid for what they worked so hard creating, but the prices aren't realistic. Most average gamers don't have the money to pay for all of these DLC's that, really, don't add near enough to the game to be worth the same amount as the actual game itself. This is why I give the game about a 8/10. If the prices of the DLC's were the same as what I paid for the game (CAD $4.99 during the 2016 Summer Sale) and they had included the option to have control over your sims like in The Sims 2, then I would give this a 10/10.Summary? Great good, bad DLC prices, 8/10 rating.			",13,4,1,0,3,0,2

												I've been enjoying the Sims ever since I was little kid.  The Sims 3 pretty much completes the franchise for me.  Keep in mind that EA is going to try to swindle you for every penny that you have but 95% of additional purchases outside of the expansions aren't worth it.  Also, at this current point in time, you might want to weigh your options.  Sims 3 is pretty much ""completed"", however unless there is a sale going on either on Steam or Origin, you're probably going to be spending way too much money on this game.  Sims 4 will be coming out soon but other than little gimmicks it doesn't seem to be too different from 3.  So you should probably choose one or the other.  Sims 3 itself is very enjoyable once you get past all of EA's tricks.  This is a casual game.  Keep that in mind.  There's a ton of stuff to do and I find it very relaxing to create Sims and pack my towns with custom made families and stories.  There's all sorts of mods by talented creators as well.  Sims 3, alone, is not all that great.  Sims 3 with all of the ep's is fantastic.  However, with all of the money you'll spend on the Sims 3 (probably) you may not ever want to buy another Sims game for a long time.			",279,65,5,66,30,2,30

												SIMS... why to describe this game. It is game-simulation of life. One of the best which was ever made.Why I've bought it?To build a city full of sexy plump / chubby gorgeous ladies.To build a house where is a mad scientist, ghosts and several superstars.To build a house where is Indiana Jones and Lara Croft. They have a kid. Drake.To build a mansion where is everyone from Stark family from Game of Thrones.To build a hut, where is my own thief guild... and a boss is a mayor of the city... : )But you can do much much more!

												I love this game so much! I can play for hours and hours. My favorite DLC is Island Paradise. You own resorts and become mega rich.  I love decoating the homes and the resorts. Evicting other sims out of the house you want is fun too. You can also merge families together. The Pets DLCis really fun too. This is really an awesome game. 10/10  ENJOY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok my play time doesn't actually show how many hours I've sank into this game just how many I'v accumlated to buy extra content from steam on the cheap. First off your sims 3 codes you buy off Steam now works with EA origins. This is important if you previously own sims packs. Steam makes you buy another copy of the Sims 3 to buy the extra content. Not cool steam its livable. On the good note; during the steam mega sales you can pick up more content for about 4.99 - 9.99. I have all expansions all store content and am missing only one world and a handful of stuff packs. In general I love this game. I've owned it since it came out. Purchased most of my content pre-steam and amazed how cheep you can get stuff for now.  I've scored most of the store content by watching adds on EA and about all my content was purchased for free.  Now that steam has its new controller I am slowly migrating my content onto steam. This is the only sandbox you will ever play that lets you actually make your own video game in whatever style you want. You download the world creator tool and you have hours of interesting things you can do with your game. Program in story lines and challanges for your sims and you have a whole new game. You have the ability to generate maps and new worlds. You get mod content and the sky is the limit.  Lets face facts the sims 3 is just wierd and its not for everyone. How many games do you know that allow you to have ninjas who work as a perfessional jockeys riding unicorns and only eat tofu cheesesteaks?  Now for some of the negative reviews I'm reading. I'm running a top of the line graphics card I play the game on highest levels. I do not have the new nvidia pascals. Only a 970. I have no issues at all. Most of the people who are griping do not realize that there internet cache actually plays a roll on how well the game runs when its in online mode. You donot have to use online mode unless your working on showtime achievements or your planning on buying something in game.  All players need to regularly clean out internet explorer even if you don't use internet explorer to maintain a healthy game.  Because it is how the game originally connect to EA. Most of the lagging etc comes from IE beeing the worst of all the browsers and no ability to change this in your code.  Another issue is too many expansion and stuff packs on at one time. While I run all expansions and all my content most pcs are not capable of doing this. EA suggest limiting how many packs if you want quicker load times.  I don't bother because I use a special mod called Overwatch that peserves the integrity of my game by optimizing the game in other ways that EA didn't think of. Mostly by removing lost sims stray horses and animals and cars that your sims careless forget to drive back home to there houses.  This makes the who game run much smoother and keeps the game from becomming currupt do to user neglect/error.  Mods make this game you can find nearly any type of mod you can imagine. I highly recommend anyone who has ever played minecraft or similar games to give this one a try.			",14,1,0,11,2,1,0

												I only have 15 hours.... but BOY IS THIS HYPE. I have a level 9 journalism carrer, a wife, soon to be children. An AMAZING house I spent an hour renovating completly and the list goes on and on so I'm gonna talk about one of my favourite features....When you start the sims, everybody has the same town of people, but it changes. If you didn't know already, in this game sims age and even DIE. What happens if you're sim dies? you play as your son or daughter growing up. Then play as their sons or daughters and it goes on and on. The npc's also have children, die and live their lives.If this helped influence your decision about getting this game, please give it a thumbs up!  i DEFINITELY recomend this game  ",35,5,0,3,8,0,1

												Oh yes, The Sims.Now, most people would argue that the series has gotten stale and repetetive. I would agree. The peak of the Sim franchise was reached with The Sims 2, what with all the expansions, add ons, and other stuff they released for it.That being said, The SIms 3 is still a fun game (if you're a fan of the series) . Take the same old Sims 1 & 2 formula, and just make it prettier.I still reccomend it to gamers, though be ready to shell out money for the expansions...			",743,217,24,86,101,12,90

												This version has still kept its proper sense of simulation, also being more advanced with added varies emotions, but the loading times are not what I expected. With 4GB RAM and 2GHz, I find that it takes about 8-10 minutes total to launch the game and enter my neighborhood. Sure it's a more complex version, but I load today's modern games more efficiently.I recommend the game, just make sure to have something to occupy yourself when launching.			",18,0,0,5,4,0,1

												The best game in the Sims franchise. It has an organized and intuitive play system, well bodied and fun expansions, and not to mention the widest variety of occult sims and towns/locations. The downsides are long screen wait times, repetitive music, and poor use of ""create a sim"" (CAS) customization sliders. Overall it is a great game and worth the buy.			",6,5,0,4,2,0,0

												First spend an eternity downloading mods to make your sims look absolutely fabulous and after days (or weeks) finally start actually playing the game. Game runs smoothly, only had one occasion of a crash without any error codes. All DLCs are not necessary. What you ''need'' depends on what you'd like to have as an additional experience to your gameplay. I bought three (Amibitions/Generations/Late Night) and that's it for me. The non-sale prices are ridiculous, so I did snatch mine during a sale.			",59,18,0,8,11,1,15

												I love The Sims games, but I don't believe it's worth it to pay CAD $19.99 per DLC, after you've already paid CAD $19.99 for the game itself. The Sims 2 on PS2 was my favorite out of all the games, because you could control the sim instead of just telling them to do this or do that. However, my second favorite game in the francise is The Sims 3 for PC. Now, I've played more than just The Sims 3, so I can honestly I like it better than The Sims Castaway, The Sims, and The Sims 2: Pets. Note: The Sims 3 is the only one I have played on the PC, the rest were for PS2. There's just more customization, better graphics, more actions you can do, more speech choices, and more ages. I would love to get the DLC's, especially Pets and Supernatural, but as I said in the beginning of this review, it just doesn't seem worth it to me. I know the developers and everyone else involved in making the game deserve to get paid for what they worked so hard creating, but the prices aren't realistic. Most average gamers don't have the money to pay for all of these DLC's that, really, don't add near enough to the game to be worth the same amount as the actual game itself. This is why I give the game about a 8/10. If the prices of the DLC's were the same as what I paid for the game (CAD $4.99 during the 2016 Summer Sale) and they had included the option to have control over your sims like in The Sims 2, then I would give this a 10/10.Summary? Great good, bad DLC prices, 8/10 rating.			",13,4,1,0,3,0,2

												After trying to get this game working on my PC again for months, and eventually realizing it was an issue with the OS and having to reinstall Windows (a big annoyance that the game couldn't fix the components itself through a reinstall), I can say this is a fun game. There's a lot of things to do, see, and customize in the base game alone, as well as plenty of free mods if you're into that. I wasn't around to experience issues at launch or compare it to old Sims games, but for me the gameplay is very good, with only a few small issues (Sims are always getting stuck and saying they can't reach a certain spot, for one). It performs well and has lots of options, both graphically and gameplay-wise. I haven't played the Sims 4, but I hear that game doesn't have some basic features of this game. I think I'll stick with this one for now.Overall, I'd recommend this, especially when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1. This is just a base game, though there are still many things to do before you get bored and decided to buy some DLCs. 2. Unless you get certain DLCs, some features like Vampires, Genie, DJing, Celebrity, Mermaids, Werewolves, Plumbots, Butler, fighting a Shark, Unicorns pet etc. will not be available.  3. The DLCs are expensive and some DLCs are not worth the money. Better get it during sale.4. There is no Steam Achievements, though you can retrieved achievement badges by login in to Sims3 Exchange before you play. Those badges and it's mission will get you preoccupied for some time.5. Crashing, bugs and lagging. There are some fixes and mods (i.e. Overwatch, Traffic, Error Trap) that help regulate these but of course, nothing is 100% sure-proof. Your best buddy will be the save button since there's no autosave.6. You can also customize your Sims with Custom Content (CC) from various websites which are offered by the community of CC creators. However, this can take a toll on the game performances (just limit the CC you wanted to use).7. You have to be diligent in finding out if there is any new Sims 3 updates. 8. The community for The Sims are great so far, they do try their best to help with any issues and create great custom contents so you can enjoy playing the game.

												9/10 Better than 4, comparable to 2 in fun levels but has several things that it does better than 2 (and a few things they should have kept from 2), but overall great. Traits replacing the simple '25 point personality' you had to assign in 1 and 2 is probably one of the best changes. The open world aspect is great, but I imagine it could be a limiting factor for some with older/cheaper PCs. Also, try to buy expansions when on sale as many aren't worth $20 any more, though a few are. Supernatural, Pets, and Seasons I would pay 20 for, the others I wouldn't. Stuff Packs only if you're obsessive about DLC or really want something it contains.			",52,23,0,9,7,0,9

It performs well and has lots of options, both graphically and gameplay-wise. I haven't played the Sims 4, but I hear that game doesn't have some basic features of this game. I think I'll stick with this one for now.Overall, I'd recommend this, especially when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been a fan of the series since Sims 1 on the PC came out, I've since then bought every single expansion of each game. It took me a while to move from Sims 2 onto 3 and i'm glad i finally made that choice. It's by far the best for running things, the amount of mods and different things you can get for this game too is ALOT.Sims 3 is great to kill time either to build houses, make families or just have fun by creating your own stories.

												I have been playing The Sims games since the original series of games started in the early 2000's. I love this version the best out of all of them. Not just for the game mechanics or graphics, but because It truly defines the world around the sims in way I have not seen before . In many ways allows more modding than The Sims 2 franchise. They also made it so I wanted to buy the expansions (not necessarily a good thing financially), but that really speaks to me of the quality of this game series in particular because this is something I didn't do with the older versions of the this game series. I feel so comfortable with The Sims 3 I actually have no intention of right a way switching to The Sims 4. I might get it if it on sale next year in Holiday Steam Sale.... but I'm okay with sticking with The Sims 3 for a few more years.			",9,11,0,6,11,0,9

												All of the bugs I've encountered so far have been hilarious. I don't remember the base game being this broken but I appreciate it greatly. I did eventually get tired of my sim going to work completely naked though!I find myself being hit often with just how real the sims gets. My sim is living in a trash hovel in the least convenient part of town. She's trying very hard to make money to move to a nice house (as my goal) but I did some math and unless the final promotion of her job lands her making four times what she makes now she's going to die before thenSo the sims is basically life real life, down to the fact that just being able to look at college as an option costs some real money.

My thoughts on The Sims 3The PortThe port is a very interesting one. The options menu is very buggy with the settings sometimes resetting to default as well as sound options taking a bit to actually change or just straight up not changing at all. The video options are varied and nice as well as descriptive but not very informative in terms of certain options, such as edge smoothing, as well as there being no settings for keybinds or mouse sensitivity, besides mouse inverting. Overall the port isn't bad besides some awkward Windows 10 support and performance related issues.The Graphics/PerformanceThe graphics for the game are not the greatest with low res foliage, decent at best textures, awkward lighting and some rather bad modeling. That being said this game was from 2010, was completely open world and obviously needed to compensate for what it was offering. The performance on the other hand is very not good. Actually running the game is absolutly not problem it's very easy to max out the game on even some low end systems but the game is an absolute stuttery mess, even on lower settings. Many people have reported lots of stuttering on high end and low end systems alike. It's a big problem with the game that I can't let slip. It's not very stable at all with its performanceThe Story/Atmosphere/CharactersNon-existant story but the atmosphere of being in a lively environment is very much there but that's all I have to say. I can't really comment on the characters all that much.The ControlsDirect mouse control with keybinds for camera movement and some menu controls. Besides a feeling of mouse acceleration nothing to really say about this.The GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. This is an amazing life simulation game that really feels like you're taking part in, and leading, someone and really being that person. The animation system is absolutely fantastic, besides some bad animation transition, the character interaction is complex and unique and the game as a whole is extremely well done. The AI is a bit stupid and not very good but I can excuse that for how good the rest of this game is. The characted customization is the best I've ever seen, besides maybe Black Dessert Online, with in depth characted facial construction and amazing clothing customization, with the option of creating your own clothing. The only fault is the lack of hair-styles, facial hair, hats and the really crappy body hair and tattoo options but those can be excused.The ConclusionThis game is a fantastic game with many flaws but I would no doubt recommend this to anyone looking for a good simulation game to throw on to waste some time. Not to mention it's one of the good EA games that are on Steam so there's a major plus.The VerdictPort - 7.5/10Graphics - 6/10Performance - 3.5/10Story - *no rating*/10Atmosphere - 9.5/10Characters - *no rating*/10Controls - 8/10Gameplay - 10/10AI - 6.5/10Average Rating - 7/10Actual Rating - 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, EA has taken DLC and thus 'milking' their product to the next level. Max Profit, as less effort as possible. This is kind of sad cause EA casts a shadow over Maxis. Also not all Expension packs are worth it. But Pets and University Life are defenatly worth the while!			",84,13,1,13,33,0,9

 simulation at it's finest This game is fun for the whole family. If you have played any of the other sims games then you know what to expect, make a sim (person) give them a job, find them a girlfriend/boyfriend and start a family. The sims 3 really changed alot with the other sims for example the city is now an open world city so not more one lot houses now the city is your lot. There is so many new things involved with the sims 3 that you cant describe it, you need to just jump in the game and find it. just stunning You may also notice that the graphics got a smooth upgrade. Sims now look more like real people than worn out dolls. Also your needs such as hunger got an update as well so you dont have to eat and use the bathroom every 5 minuets which gives you more time to explore the city or maybe call up a friend and hang out. There are way more sims in the city than there was in the sims 2 cities which leads to a more realistic tone in the game. rewards everywhere As the game is fun you will find that the longer you play the more rewards you can get for example you pay have spent all night at a night club and found some girl to talk to and then later got married to her just to find out she is very famous. Even looking into a telescope at night can be rewarding as you can find new planets and stars and name them and get paid for find them. The game can get a little boring for a while doing the same thing over and over again but anyone who is a die hard fan will love the sims 3. verdict The sims 3 is a game where you can do anything and i have not seen anything like it. Even though the game can get borning after awhile its still fun, enjoyable and a great way to pass the time in the real world. I give the sims 3 4/5 stars.			",43,1,0,5,6,0,2

												Honestly, Sims 3 is one of the best sims games.I have gotten addicted to this, raising a virtual family and seeing how their life plays out in front of me. Sims is one of the best, if not the greatest life simulator game ever. The good thing is if you want extra things added into the game, it is one of the easiest things to do. One downside I have had is when downloading an expansion pack at the same time as the game it seems to take a little longer yet suprisingly fast for a game this large. The game has many possibilities. I myself only have the pets expansion but I feel I got my moneys worth out of the game. At first glance it is expensive (I got it on sale a year ago for Chinese New year.) but once you play you realize just how much it adds into the game. Overall, this game is amazing and was definetly worth the money, and I am looking forward to getting other expansion packs.I hope this review helped, and have a great day or night.			",1,2,0,0,8,0,0

												I couldn't find anyone to marry so I stalked a teenage girl until she was an adult then forced her to break up with her boyfriend, Invited her to my house, cooked her Spaghetti and got married in the kitchen. Now all she does is burn down the house with her foul cooking everyday. If I wasn't a special agent this would be a bigger problem as it's already a pain buying new ovens all the time. I keep thinking of ways I can kill her to free me and my daughter from the fiery death that she will curse upon us all...I'll show her....I'll show them all...Also Sims 3 is alright.9.222222222222222222222222222222222222322223...../10			",36,5,0,9,3,0,0

												I liked the first Sims when it came out so I'm not surprised that I like this one, too! Great fun and a hell of a lot more sophisticated than the first game; careers are much more comprehensive, the town is an interactive map not just limited to your current household, there are a lot more options for house and character customisation with the option of purchasing additional DLC to add more to your library of things (if you're into that).

												I've owned 1,2 and now 3.  This is easily the best of the 3 versions of this game I have played.  I was a little disappointed at first because start up was a little clunky and confusing.  I'm 45, so take that with a grain of salt.  I also expected a lot more content.  Build mode seems to have more stuff, but I'd have thought there'd be a slew more items in Buy mode, especially since I sprang for Pets, Ambitions and one other pack I can't think of off the top of my head.  The game play is what sold me.  It's so much smoother as far as getting from place to place both within your home and within the town.  It may be partly because of the Ambitions pack, but you can make a lot of meaningful money other than just getting up and going to work ad nauseum.  I also like that life gets easier to manage as a reward for putting in the work.			",0,2,0,1,2,0,2

												Every Sims title to date that I've played manages to make me feel the same way. I just end up being enthralled by it. And while I always felt that The Sims 3 didn't have a lot when it came to base content, it does offer a lot of worthwhile stuff in the expansions – things that I don't really remember being in any of the Sims titles before it.For one, I think even though the learning curve is steeper when it comes to building houses, there are more advanced options and it just feels more complete than it did in The Sims 2 for instance.And I also feel somewhat the same about towns. There's somewhat less freedom when it comes to creating towns from scratch, but you are just given a lot more customisation over that town and it feels more alive. In fact I think customisation is the key word when it comes to The Sims 3 and it applies to more than just the town or colour of the walls. You can customise pretty much anything, from furniture to the clothes your sims wear. And if that's not enough, you can download things from the community that other people have made themselves, or buy other stuff made available on the store.Some might cringe at this sort of thing, but I think in the end its one of the reasons why this game is still played to this day, and I think it has had the longest lifecycle of any Sims title, and why this one in particular is on Steam. Because there was certainly a demand for it. I mean, the fact that I would rather buy this and most of the expansions here than play Sims 2 which Origin offered for free at one stage is a testament to just how good it really is.True, it is buggy, not very stable, and it still leaves something to be desired in terms of graphics, but if you're willing to put up with all of that, I think you'll find it more than a little rewarding, and it will take you ages to get through all of what it has to offer.

												I bought the Sims 3 Plus University Life bundle. I've since gone on to buy Late Night, Generations and Ambitions while they were on sale. Overall, the DLC packs added to the experience. And the experience has been very good. After playing for 60+ hours, I've very much enjoyed the game. I recommend getting DLC packs while they're on sale though. Paying $20 for each of them is NOT WORTH IT.  If you do get a DLC pack, I recommend the ones I mentioned above, along with Showtime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WHAT CAN I SAY? YOU ARE A PERSON in a PC, PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVE WHO CAN PLAY WITH PEOPLES LIVES in pc TOO.And you can have ghost babies, and kill your sims in different modes. You can be the villain, the nerd, the vampire, the witch, you can travel through to the future, or to another cities. Choose a job and make career, have pets, do anything. You can build your house the way you want, and put all the peronality on it. Because you can.You can make your own contents or download other player's content, and personalize it.I can spend hours in this game, just in the ''create a sim'' mode. Because imagination flows away. You start thinking about the character, his expressions, his clothes, his personality, and then you go to the part of construction, to build the character's house, and again the time goes by and when you see, you are playing like for 5-7 hours and it's already dawning. And you didn't ''started playing'' yet. Like I said, you can be everything, and do anything. This game is not made for those who seeks action and adventure. Its a simulation game. It's not made of levels for you to beat on. It's endless, and that's one beauty on this game. If it's not your ""game type"", please don't underestimate the game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's the sims we all know and love. The only DLC I bought was pets and I like it. It's the same EA, the amount of in game shizzle they try and sell you threw microtransactions is ridiculous, I have never seen it in a game I didn't get for free in the app store. Sure you can turn it off but who wants to buy a game and be shown all of the extras you have to pay more for to unlock. It's insane.The game is super smooth and doesn't lag at all but it is sooo slow. Making a meal takes you a while, it was much faster in Sims 2, walking up stairs will cause your sims to stop for a bit and consider if they want to walk up the stairs and sleeping is ridiculously slow! Even at 'super fast' speed. It seems a common issue and I am sure someone will mention that it's my computers fault but I am not the only one having an issue with speed in game.			",84,51,1,17,6,1,6

												WHAT CAN I SAY? YOU ARE A PERSON in a PC, PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVE WHO CAN PLAY WITH PEOPLES LIVES in pc TOO.And you can have ghost babies, and kill your sims in different modes. You can be the villain, the nerd, the vampire, the witch, you can travel through to the future, or to another cities. Choose a job and make career, have pets, do anything. You can build your house the way you want, and put all the peronality on it. Because you can.You can make your own contents or download other player's content, and personalize it.I can spend hours in this game, just in the ''create a sim'' mode. Because imagination flows away. You start thinking about the character, his expressions, his clothes, his personality, and then you go to the part of construction, to build the character's house, and again the time goes by and when you see, you are playing like for 5-7 hours and it's already dawning. And you didn't ''started playing'' yet. Like I said, you can be everything, and do anything. This game is not made for those who seeks action and adventure. Its a simulation game. It's not made of levels for you to beat on. It's endless, and that's one beauty on this game. If it's not your ""game type"", please don't underestimate the game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked the first Sims when it came out so I'm not surprised that I like this one, too! Great fun and a hell of a lot more sophisticated than the first game; careers are much more comprehensive, the town is an interactive map not just limited to your current household, there are a lot more options for house and character customisation with the option of purchasing additional DLC to add more to your library of things (if you're into that). Glad I got it on sale, well worth it. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												Ah, this game brings back so many memories. I used to have Sims 3 and the Pets expansion on discs a long time ago, but since it was a sale I bought Sims 3, Pets, Seasons and Generations (it was easier than the discs, they were getting all scratched up). I won't lie, the game has a crap-ton of glitches. However, it's still a very entertaining game, and can certainly be a challenge if you're new to the game/have lots of sims/ect.If you need a challenge, start out with two or three sims, buy the biggest empty lot you can find, and make them live homeless until the two of them get enough money to build a house. To add to the challenge, don't let anyone die, and make them do well in their jobs. Good luck! I'm doing the challenge right now tbh cxNOTE: DO NOT BUY THIS AT FULL PRICE. Ain't worth it honestly. Buy it when it's on sale. Then it's so worth it it's basically free.			",5,4,0,1,3,0,0

												The Sims is one of my most favourite franchises ever. So naturally, owning the Sims 3, along with most of its Expansion Packs (EP) is a dream. The Base Game on its own is alright, but it can get boring after awhile though. When you add on the EPs, they add a little more spice to the game. Being a part of the Sims 3 community is nice if you have some friends who also play Sims. It also entitles you to some free gifts and allows you to buy things from the Sims Store which unfortunately costs Sim Points. Don't forget, the internet is the place to find Custom Content or Mods to really personalise your game. It's great if you wanna give a go at being God, if you're a Machinima maker or a budding architect. Everyone should try Sims at least once in their life, especially if you fit the above criteria.

												Game Play 8/10Graphics 8/10-A Bunch of DLC-Time ConsumingAfter playing the sims 3 for around 300 hours I can surely say that the game is fun and provides a enjoyable experience. In Sims you basically make yourself a character or family and go on through the game while seeing your characters grow up. Your family will slowly grow as your starting character begins to grow old and ends up sadly dying as death himself comes through your front door to take your orginal character's soul away. The gameplay is a little bit repetive as you basically give your family characters orders such as cook/eat food or go to work/school everyday until their is a holiday or weekened for them to take off and instead chill at home. You will have to pile up money to expand your house and add new additions to it, which may be a grind, but you may easily use cheats or gain a well paying job to quickly create a fair amount of money. Graphics are nothing to praise or spit on, but it is thankfully easy on the eyes as you will be playing for sometime to see progress take place in your world. One down side is the DLC really which is a valid reason for some negative reviews about this game, yet I wish to note that the game is still fun without any of the DLC. You will still have fun with the base game and if you ever wish to try something new then simply start a new family or pick up one of the DLC packs when they are on sale. I reccomend Sims 3 to those looking for a different game that requires you to have a little bit of devotion to have progress take place. I give Sims 3 9/10 Broken Sinks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There seems to be a glitch with this game. I've played less than 10 hours. Yet it says over 86 hours. It says ""running"" constantly in my library ever since I booted the game the first time. The game is closed. I've restarted my computer. Yet still racking up those hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It can be pretty buggy at times but I never encountered anything that made it unplayable, there's quite a few glitches but not many seriously game breaking ones, though I did encounter one in the default map 'sunset valley' in which if your sim worked the science career they would sometimes get stuck in the bushes outside their workplace and I never found a way to get them out, the just stand there and eventually starve. Gameplay is pretty good, though I must admit I don't play many simulation games, this one certainly seems a bit more silly, it has a lot silly options like having your sim imply that another sim's mother is a llama. The expansion packs are expensive and for what they are $20 feels like a lot, they are fun though and add a fair amount to the game, I reccomend buying them during a sale unless money is no concern to you. But I reccomend it more for if you're looking for some cheap laughs. Like I made a John Cena sim and had him skinny dip in his neighbor's pool without asking permission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sometimes I like to watch ants move around and whisper to them all my secrets, but once they know my secrets, there is no going back, so I step on every single ant and kill it within a 14 ft radius, because know body can no my secrets, not even small insect sentient beings of earth. I will let my secrets and anger build up inside, then, I will tell a stranger all my secrets, when he is walking all, alone, at midnight. Then, once I'm finished, I will stick him with a exacto knife right into his torso, separating the diafraghm from the spholo cavity, then one last fatal stick to the insular cortex, immobilizing him, let him bleed out right in front of me, feel the blood trickle down my hand, setting my teeth on edge. Then, I will continue stabbing the corpse, separating the octuplectic nerve, from the Vegas cavity in the spine as his spinal fluids dribble out like rain in the winter, just beginning to freeze. Then Whisper my last secret into the mutilated corpses ear, ""know body will live to tell the secret"" I say. I pat the corpses slashed, separated spine as if ""good luck"" then continue my journey. If you catch me whispering to you? Don't try running I will probably already have a blade penetrating your flesh before you even notice I'm there. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally did not expect Sims to travel down the road of Microtransactions, but it's a fantastic game that'll keep you busy for hours, especially if you've played and enjoyed previous Sims games.Pros:- Hours of fun, ""replayability"" is high- Clever programming, Sim interaction is interesting to watch- The price of the base game is a lot cheaper than it used to be- Plenty of building tools to keep you creating awesome things- Extensive character customizationCons:- Microtransactions, Simpoints are terribly overpriced- Game crashes sometimes, mostly due to a memory error- Sim interaction can sometimes be glitchy and everything will come to a standstill in-game- Forced to pay real world money for some necessary items- Expensive DLC packs that make your wallet cryTL;DR: If you like Simulation games, you'll like this. The base game is great on its own, but if you want to explore what else this game has to offer, prepare to pay an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥on of money, and expect some lag. Overall, would recommend.

												A wonderful timesuck. I've loved playing with blueprints and making model houses since I was a kid and the Sims is a great extension of that, but minus the storage issues and glue gun burns. Using the freerealestate cheat in edit town mode, I can sink hours into building new houses and public buildings. The only minus is that since I bought my copy on Steam I can't get origins world editor tool to work, but apparently it's a paint in the♥♥♥♥♥to use so I'm not crushed about it.Also, buy on sale. It's reasonable when it's on sale price, but otherwise this is waaayy too expensive for a seven year old game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the base game isn't much, the true power comes from the expansions. All expansions are made to work in synergy with the other and create more content exponentially linked to the number of expansions you have.So the base game + supernatural + ambitions means the ambitions system now works for supernatural careers like alchemist and unlocks ""synergy content."" Without ambitions, the system wont be there for supernatural.As your game grows, the synergy content grows as well. When you own all the major expansions (not the stuff packs), you get an absolutely massive amount of synergy content.So far here are the expansions:Ambitions - adds interactive jobs, new jobs centering around craft skills. Adds scrap metal robots that become obsolete when you get into the future. Adds scrap yard, fire station, and other job based commecial lots.pets - adds pets. Nothing special. Not much synergy content. Requires NRAAS mods or the wild life bogs down your game. Adds pet park commercial lots.into the future - this is VERY unbalanced and practically cheating. You can create overpowered sim-bots that can max every skill, then teach your kids those skills or craft an infinite amount of high end items. They can even hold max level jobs meaning a single sim bot turns the sims into easy mode permenantly since sim bots dont age. Adds futuristic commercial lots like a future lounge, a fancy bar run by robots.University - this adds social groups, ""drugs"", alcohol, multiple commercial lots like coffee shops, comic book stores, and bowling alleys. Adds plant sims. Adds science skill, and science objects like the science station. In here, you can clone practically anything and everyone. You also The science objects here are overpowered. You can even buy a brain enhancer to respec your entire personality whenever you want, even random strangers. This expansion also adds social networking, where you run a website and gain followers based on what you do. For instance, talking to a ghost and blogging about it is good content. This applies for other expansions as well, where you can boast about a good performance in show time or a cleared dungeon in world adventures. A good blogger can also get famous in late night.Seasons - This adds seasons that tie into other expansions. Island Paradise resorts are effected by what season it is. No one will want to go to a resort in the snowy winter. Adds aliens, and alien technology like the weather controller and UFO car that you can use to terrorize the city.Supernatural - adds supernatural creatures,  huge addition to  crafting ingredients, lunar cycle, and magic. The lunar cycle means that 1 night means there is a full moon, which means all sorts of supernatural creatures come out like zombies. This sounds cool, but it turns into an annoyance. The zombies become loud, annoying hobos on your porch after a while. Adds supernural lots like the vampire lounge (fancy bar), and the werewolf bar.late night - adds fame, which ties into all other expansions. Adds even more powers to vampires. Adds nightlife commercial lots that tie into the commercial lots of all the other expansions.Island paradise - adds all sorts of water activities, boats, house boats, and the ability to run a resort or hotel. Adds mermaid sims. NOTICE: YOU NEED NRAAS BUG FIXES TO USE THE ISLAND PARADISE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT ISSUE.Generations - adds a whole bunch of rewards based on what you do in your sim's life. Adds a bunch of inspiration rewards for living a good life, often in overpowered items. Adds another science object, the chemistry set that is  just as overpowered as the other items from university.world adventures - you travel the world, complete dungeons, and if you have late night you can get famous doing it. Adds objects from Egypt, France, and China. It adds TONS of rare and expensive collectibles including rebuilt sarcophigi, statues, and dive wells. A good haul of artifacts can make you a very rich, or the museum very profitable if you own it. Adds mummy sims.show time - ties into late night. adds performance careers. Adds genies. adds a whole bunch of items that should have been in late night like the DJ booth.It all depends on what you want from your sims.CONS:HUGE LOAD TIMES WHEN YOU LOAD ANY NEIGHBORHOOD.VERY CPU INTENSIVE GAME, WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS AN INTEL I5 2500 HAS PROBLEMS KEEPING UP DUE TO THE GAME LOADING EVERYTHING AT ONCE LIKE IN THE CAS MENU.NEEDS NRAAS BUG FIXES TO WORK MOST OF THE TIME.

But with their DLCs it is a polished golden turd. I actually enjoyed the hell  outta myself with Sims 3 DLC buying simulator. It went from growing plant people in my garden to getting into a fight with a  random aliens visiting my home. So overall buy EA's Sims 3 DLC if you wanna actually enjoy it otherwise don't play this game without DLC. I will only recommend this lil turd ONLY IF YOU BUY ITS OVERPRICED DLCs.Better than shietstain 4.			",21,7,0,6,1,0,1

												I have always been a fan of The Sims ever since the first Sims PC game was created back in the early 2000s. I loved the Sims 2 so I decided to buy TS3. I like how you are able to do a lot more things in TS3. The developers really listened to the fans by adding in new features and touches such as;                +Able to move camera freely around the environment and town                +Can watch your sim visit the park or travel down town                +Gives more options and tools to design home                +Can create basements                +Can design countertops with many items instead of just one item Downside for me;;                -It'll be nice if other sims you created would progress as you play other created sim families. Its not like in TS2 where you can create different families and watch them grow old while playing other families. Despite the downside, I still like TS3. You can always download mods and many other things to make your gaming experience realistic and fun-which is why I love Sim games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a Sims game, but don't want.. as many loading times, this is the one you want.The Sims 3 was around a long time. Building on the Wishes mechanic of the second game, this one has Lifetime Rewards, where you can gain points for keeping moodlets high and fufilling their various desires.These points can be cashed in at any point.Personally, I recommend getting the Supernatural and Late Night expansion packs if you like cities, and like an easier way to be immortal but still allow aging. Being a vampire is pretty fun.Late Night adds a small city to play in, which admittedly feels a bit... empty. You'll want to play custom towns off the Sims3modding website.Beyond that... Sims 3 is a mostly open world, non-instanced Sims game. It has problems, sure, it's buggy, it can do a lot of things at once meaning when you save your game it takes forever, you will find horses hanging around a single empty lot if you have pets.Also, don't get seasons: much of the weather effects are really resource intensive and may kill your game.

												Excellent guilty pleasure game and man, what a time sink this game can be. The game has an excellent modding community as well. I recommend waiting for steam sales before you buy any of the DLC though, and stay away from the ""stuff packs"" they are generally not worth getting, especially for the price.One important thing to note is that the loading times in this game, as well as the time it takes to save are unforgiveably bad, I recommend putting the game into windowed mode and then forcing it into windowed borderless with the windowed borderless gaming software so you can tab out and do something else while it loads / saves. Thankfully the game only has to load once since it is open world (unless you are traveling to a new neighbourhood, then it needs to load the new neighbourhood as well)Before you start playing The Sims 3 I strongly recommend you get some important mods, nraas overwatch as well as nraas debugger. Overwatch will do a check and cleanup of your game neighbourhood once ever 24 hours to fix the awful performance that plagues this otherwise great game and fix sims getting stuck etc. Debugger will allow you to wiggle around other bugs and issues you run into, it will basically allow you to do anything for debugging purposes.Enjoy the game!

												It's a good way to act out the fantasies in your head or to live vicariously through your own creations, whether it be as a merciful, cruel, or absent god. Societal rules that dictate us are nonexistent and it's fun to sit back and watch your families live their lives. DLCs add more unique content and I definitely recommend them but the base game in itself is fine for those of you who don't want any of the extra content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sims 2 is still my favorite Sims game because, with DLC, you can make some very realistic looking characters and surroundings and animations,  therefore, more immersive gameplay.

All that said, Sims 4 is horrible and I actually only bought the base game and quickly refunded it which was super disappointing because I have been an avid fan having spent over a thousand bucks on the franchise since the advent of Sims 1.

												While the base game isn't much, the true power comes from the expansions. All expansions are made to work in synergy with the other and create more content exponentially linked to the number of expansions you have.So the base game + supernatural + ambitions means the ambitions system now works for supernatural careers like alchemist and unlocks ""synergy content."" Without ambitions, the system wont be there for supernatural.As your game grows, the synergy content grows as well. When you own all the major expansions (not the stuff packs), you get an absolutely massive amount of synergy content.So far here are the expansions:Ambitions - adds interactive jobs, new jobs centering around craft skills. Adds scrap metal robots that become obsolete when you get into the future. Adds scrap yard, fire station, and other job based commecial lots.pets - adds pets. Nothing special. Not much synergy content. Requires NRAAS mods or the wild life bogs down your game. Adds pet park commercial lots.into the future - this is VERY unbalanced and practically cheating. You can create overpowered sim-bots that can max every skill, then teach your kids those skills or craft an infinite amount of high end items. They can even hold max level jobs meaning a single sim bot turns the sims into easy mode permenantly since sim bots dont age. Adds futuristic commercial lots like a future lounge, a fancy bar run by robots.University - this adds social groups, ""drugs"", alcohol, multiple commercial lots like coffee shops, comic book stores, and bowling alleys. Adds plant sims. Adds science skill, and science objects like the science station. In here, you can clone practically anything and everyone. You also The science objects here are overpowered. You can even buy a brain enhancer to respec your entire personality whenever you want, even random strangers. This expansion also adds social networking, where you run a website and gain followers based on what you do. For instance, talking to a ghost and blogging about it is good content. This applies for other expansions as well, where you can boast about a good performance in show time or a cleared dungeon in world adventures. A good blogger can also get famous in late night.Seasons - This adds seasons that tie into other expansions. Island Paradise resorts are effected by what season it is. No one will want to go to a resort in the snowy winter. Adds aliens, and alien technology like the weather controller and UFO car that you can use to terrorize the city.Supernatural - adds supernatural creatures,  huge addition to  crafting ingredients, lunar cycle, and magic. The lunar cycle means that 1 night means there is a full moon, which means all sorts of supernatural creatures come out like zombies. This sounds cool, but it turns into an annoyance. The zombies become loud, annoying hobos on your porch after a while. Adds supernural lots like the vampire lounge (fancy bar), and the werewolf bar.late night - adds fame, which ties into all other expansions. Adds even more powers to vampires. Adds nightlife commercial lots that tie into the commercial lots of all the other expansions.Island paradise - adds all sorts of water activities, boats, house boats, and the ability to run a resort or hotel. Adds mermaid sims. NOTICE: YOU NEED NRAAS BUG FIXES TO USE THE ISLAND PARADISE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT ISSUE.Generations - adds a whole bunch of rewards based on what you do in your sim's life. Adds a bunch of inspiration rewards for living a good life, often in overpowered items. Adds another science object, the chemistry set that is  just as overpowered as the other items from university.world adventures - you travel the world, complete dungeons, and if you have late night you can get famous doing it. Adds objects from Egypt, France, and China. It adds TONS of rare and expensive collectibles including rebuilt sarcophigi, statues, and dive wells. A good haul of artifacts can make you a very rich, or the museum very profitable if you own it. Adds mummy sims.show time - ties into late night. adds performance careers. Adds genies. adds a whole bunch of items that should have been in late night like the DJ booth.It all depends on what you want from your sims.CONS:HUGE LOAD TIMES WHEN YOU LOAD ANY NEIGHBORHOOD.VERY CPU INTENSIVE GAME, WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS AN INTEL I5 2500 HAS PROBLEMS KEEPING UP DUE TO THE GAME LOADING EVERYTHING AT ONCE LIKE IN THE CAS MENU.NEEDS NRAAS BUG FIXES TO WORK MOST OF THE TIME.

												The Sims is a ""people simulator"", which puts you in control of a neighborhood, dictating the personal lives of the residents one household at a time.  It is, I believe, the best-selling game series of all time, despite being a niche market.  It is an awkward game to explain from a gaming standpoint, as design Will Wright found when he pitched the series in the 90's.  The Sims 3 makes a number of changes that in hindsight seem so obvious and address issues in the previous versions.  Some examples:*Aging is now optional and adjustable.  You have the option of turning sim aging off (like The Sims 1), or having it on (like The SIms 2), and you can change the length of each age.  *Story progression, also optional.  Now the neighbors who are not actively being played will carry on their lives without your input.  They will age, marry, have children, get jobs, and other things on their own.  *Moodlets replace the previous method of tying emotional state directly to needs.  Now situations dictate emotions (and needs are just one trigger of moodlets).  This has a lot of great advantages, because it takes the emphasis off gaming the needs stats and onto the character's interactions.*Personalities expand on the previous aspiration system, with each sim gaining a number of personality traits that determine moodlets, learning, abilities, and many other aspects of their lives.  *Interactions between all of these systems make interesting results.  You can watch a lifelong feud between a Good personality-sim and an Evil personality-sim unfold, where their mood drops just be being around each other.  One strange decision, however, is locking the focus on a single household.  Previously, you could freely switch families during a session, but while this is still possible, the game makes it a little awkward.  Sims 3 is designed for you to focus on a single house for most of the game.  The worst thing about this game is DLC and microtransation creep.  The Sims 2 had a lot of expansions, and experimented with an online store eventually, but The Sims 3 truly went all out.  There are endless expansions, stuff packs, and an online story for buying clothes and objects.  I am not even sure it is possible to own the complete content of The Sims 3.  On the other hand, the variety of extra content allows you to customize the game to your liking.  You don't have to play Supernatural or get Katy Perry stuff if you would rather have Pets and 80's nostalgia.  Personally, with the addition of some mods (like Overwatch and Story Progression), I consider this the most interesting version of The Sims, especially if you are interested in the neighborhood story.  Just remember DLC creep is optional...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How to become rich on Sims:Make your character traits extremely appealing to women, and make sure one of them is flirty. Once you start, don't get a job. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is for dumb people. Go to a house that is huge, so that you know the people who live in it are rich. Go inside, meet a girl. It doesn't matter how old, as long as they are out of high school. Flirt with them until you guys become romantic interests. Don't forget to do a lot of romance/flirt interactions with them to make this happen quicker. It usually takes about 5 minutes to get them from stranger to romantic interest. Then, invite them over to your house. Relax on the bed, and invite her over to cuddle. Go to interactions, hit more, and hit try for baby. MAKE THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ PREGNANT. Don't worry, it won't cost you any money. At the moment I have 9 kids with 7 different woman, and I haven't met any of them. Make sure you try for the baby at least 5 times, so that'll guarantee that she gets pregnant. The upside of that is so when she gives birth, your mood goes way up. Next, go to romance and hit ""propose going steady"". She'll say yes, because you're a ♥♥♥♥ing MAC DADDY, then go to the same place and hit propose marriage. She won't give a ♥♥♥♥ that you just became boyfriend/girlfriend, you're a ♥♥♥♥ing mac daddy and she says yes. She'll move in with you, and you get all of her money and her car if she has one. She usually has around 10k that you get and a car that sells for 5-16k. This whole process will take you about 10 minutes. After you get married, make sure to try for a baby a couple times again, just to be sure.Last, interact with her, go to mean and hit break up. After about a minute, you realize all these ♥♥♥♥♥es aren't worth your time. You'll break up, and your mood will go down a bit, but not for long because she was a colossal♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ All you need to do now is hit her face on the side to take control of her sim, that go to her cellphone, call the realtor, and hit move. Once you are on the move screen, check the box that says kick out, and rename her new house. It will be your last name by default, but that ♥♥♥♥♥ DOES NOT deserve the honor of having your last name. I named my first ex-wife's new house Cun!t, then the rest I just named Ex-Wife #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, and much much more. Now just repeat this multiple times and soon enough you'll be living in a mansion with the most expensive stuff. If only it worked like this in real life.10/10			",117,18,3,5,9,2,6

												Story of Craig Adams:Craig was a simple man. He had no life, no job, no girl and no family. He didn't realise his loneliness but one day, he became controlled by a mysterious person called ""The Player"". Craig was scared, the player started changing his personality and clothing. The player said ""I'm gonna make you a success"". Craig was excited and he soon found a job after playing CoD. After his first day he met a girl who he got on pretty well with until he found out she was married and Craig beat her up (because of the player). Craig met another girl and they became good friends. Eventually Craig invited her over and that's when things went to the extreme. Craig lost his virginity and became a father. After that, his girlfriend had a baby girl and Craig had his birthday. Craig and the player knew that he needed to get married so Craig asked his girlfriend on a date and proposed. The wedding was only two minutes and Craig had a family. As one last goodbye, Craig thanked the player and lived his life. Craig is now dead. The end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, the only thing I wish this game did was give the player the ability to build homes without having to first create a household. Design and architecture are things that really interest me, and I love creating and designing houses, but it's tedious to have to first build Sims. Sure, I could speed through that process by choosing Randomize, but I would still have to wait through at least two long loading screens. I wish this wasn't necessary. Sometimes, I just want to build a house.Other than that, I like Sims 3 better than Sims 4. Sims 3 is pretty straight-forward for a new player to get into and there is a good deal of DLC that sometimes is very inexpensive (note: always wait for the sales; $20 for a single DLC for a game that's nearly ten years old is kind of ridiculous) that add a lot to the game.

												If you want the Expansion Packs at a lower price, get them during the Winter Holiday Sale with a Steam gift card on hand. I got all the Expansion Packs (minus the ""Stuffs"" Packs) doing this and do not regret it. The base game is pretty great, too. You can have your Sims write books on a laptop and name the book yourself. You can have them paint something and name it. You can use cheats by holding Control, Shift, and C then type ""help"" for the cheat code list. You can make anyone a Sim. You can have them do a lot of things. The only thing that's not in this game is traffic laws. That, and courthouses.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty fun sequel. They did a nice job of getting your sims out of the house and into town. The vanilla version though I think is pretty low on content in some areas, too few hair, clothing and accessories to choose from. But the customization options for almost everything in-game is very very well done. You can take a wallpaper and change it to look like metal, or take a car and make it look like a wooden toy. I always loved building my own house in Sims, and in Sims 3 I got more room for creativity than ever. The ""face-generator"" could use some work though, as many sims look very much alike. Shamefully many DLC though, at shamefully high prices. Not cool.  But I have my hopes for the future of the series. Maybe nr 4 will allow me to truly build a palace, and make the game harder in some way, I found it way too easy to build a fortune and make friends in this game.Anyways, a good SIMS game.

												Been meaning to write a little review for a couple of years now and finally i can. Having played the Sims from day one i have watched the Sims evolve over the years and each game is more and more fun to play. You can play the game properly and try and achieve your Sims needs or if your feeling chaotic like myself at times you can create families and just cause havoc and watch them fall apart in messy households running riot. Its also a game my girlfriend and myself can play at the same time, i make the money and do all the hard part and she spends it on customizing parts of the house and garden or buys the next sized house for us to do up haha. There are many many DLC packs for the Sims 3, some that are fun and others that wouldnt interest me but thats ultimately down to personal choice. Sims 3 and Sims pets is all we need to have a laugh for a few hours here and there! Looking forward to the Sims4. I hope this helps some of you that may be considering buying this, any more questions feel free to message me! Peace			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What tickles my pickles about this game, is that there is litterally $400+ worth of DLC. No one wants to pay $19.99 for a pets addon. Even worse is the game gets boring after you've played for a bit, pretty much forcing you to buy dlc. If you have no DLC your game will get boring even faster. But you'll end up coming back to it after a week, Then get bored. Summed up, this game is pretty much a rip off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I thought this was just a side effect of the cracked version I tried years ago and like a dummy bought a legitimate version here on Steam hoping such problems wouldn't exist. I've since tried the numerous ""fixes"" on the internet to absolutely no avail. Have requested a refund.

AUDIOPoorVISUALPeppyDIFFICULTYN/AVIBEEscapistCRAVINGCustomizationON SALEInfrequentlyPROS:  Unlike Sims 4, 2 and 3 was a big leap in features, graphics and content. There is so much that can happen, and the city continues to move even if you're just watching the events of one household. Building homes has been drastically improved, very gorgeous results can be obtained.CONS: Cash shop features have snuck into the series, a nauseating and unfortunately effective addition. Third party is invasive even after the splash screen?? Why? The biggest thing for me is the music; The Sims 1 had one of the best soundtracks, a series of hilariously peppy muzak renditions that filled the game with a  so the soulless feel of the newer ones is worth mourning. WORTH: Pricing for expansions is absolutely asinine, and they don't go on sale often. $379.00USD for all DLC of a game released in 2009? Insanity. Still, when they DO go on sale, they go up to 75% off! Your patience will be rewarded.OVERALL: If you like to build a world, this is the ultimate sandbox to play in. If you can step around all the microtransactions, you will find underneath, a spectacular game worth hours of your time.SCORE: 7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still amazing.I watched a lot of let's plays and wanted to play for myself. I got on Steam, looked it up, bought it. I was praying that my little computer could handle it, and a little bit of lag didn't ruin my first impression.The DLCs add quite a lot to the game, like pets, seasons, university... GET THIS GAME! I highly recommend this game. It's fun, and EA did amazing things...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sure the DLCs are pricey, but you get what you pay for. I worked 60 hours per week for 6 months and finally I was able to purchase the game with all DLCs. They may have glitches, non-sense, or even crashes your computer, but they are WAY more stylish.Sometimes my daughter complains, though. She usually says things like ""Are we going to eat tonight?"" and ""I'm tired of sleeping in the floor with bugs."" but then I show her my awesome game packed with all DLCs and she shuts her little b**** mouth.Great game and great DLCs. I highly recommend all of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well as a The Sims fan since The Sims 1, I have no doubt this the best Sims game I have ever played. But only recommend for those who take a risk to pay all those DLC.However they're too much DLC that not worth your money because there is too little content in every DLC. I not recommend to buy the stuff pack and choose only the expansion pack that only you interested. I'll wait for the sale to buy this. And also this game had too much bug.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's so much to say about The Sims 3. Most of which is positive! You can spend hours and hours into this game without getting bored. Creating a Sim and eventually gaining skills in that person is a great satisfaction.With cities to explore, skills to be learned, friendships to be made and many more.The sims also has some great Downloadable contents who give you great new features. Not all of them though so take a good pick and don't wast unnecessary money on the game ( it can become very expensive)overall: Great game with lots of stuff 9.1/10			",182,21,2,20,30,3,33

												One word: motherlodeSeriously though apart from the guilt factor of spending so much time on creating your Sim and house when you should be, you know, reading a book or going outside, this is a great game. Of course it's laggy and you don't get steam achievements but it's Sims what do you expect? Just be thankful you have it on PC and not the unspeakable disgrace on consoles. Because, occasional lag aside, this is the best game EA has to offer in my eyes and you can't help but laugh at the glitches, faces, ""memories"" and letters. Then cry when the one decent Sim in your town befrriends you but then gets a boyfriend. Then rejoice with the ability to add to existing family thanks to testingcheatsenabled true. Rejected in real life? Sims is for you!Bored of real life? Sims is for you!Hate the Sims? SIMS IS FOR YOU! Want to waste countless hours on letting your sims live the dream (or watching them suffer)? Sims is for you!My faviourite way to play the game is creating a dream life for myself with some comedic relief in the background. I'm glad no one has asked why a white young adult is living with a fat black man in a hotdog suit.See I'm nice I don't steal AI's wives and make them my own. I find a decent girl, give her a makeover if need be then become married the slow, right and proper way.....ctrl+shift+c testingcheatsenabled true edit: relationship status.Signed,An illegitimate legitimate Sims player who only started buying Sims once Sims 3 Gold gave me viruses. Ergh I mean what? I've always supprted this franchise with every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love this game and everytime I get into the mode for playing it, I get addicted for at least three months. However, for some reason I can't buy sim points to get all the cool stuff from the store. I was origninally just watching adds to get 5 simpoints at a time for free, but that is really tedious. Now that I am actually considering buying points, none of the stuff shows up and there is no way to contact EA/Origin without making a stupid Origin account and doing a livechat thing. The game it self is fun. I have played some of the sims 4 and was not a fan of the setup and cartoon-styled sims. Sims 3 is a good game, but now I feel like I wasted money on it and the DLC's when I probably could have pirated it and got everything at once. Last time I'll ever be a good citizen and pay for stuff. (ﾉ´･ω･)ﾉ ﾐ ┸━┸..... I hate it here. >:(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing The Sims since game one, since they came out, and have loved following its progression over the years. It's an incredible game full of choices and you can do pretty much anything you want all the time. It's amazing, endless hours of fun packed into this game.HOWEVER.EA is **** evil. Not only are you getting robbed completely blind if you actually want all of the expasions, but the game itself is SO. FREAKING. GLITCHY. In between invisible Sims, some expansion packs literally just not working at all, corrupted save files, the game literally crashing for no reason whatsoever every two hours or so...I've spent more time creating new save files, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, or searching forums for solutions to various glitches. I can't play without cheats on because I'm constantly using the 'resetSim firstnamelastname' cheat because I glitch into a wall/ceiling/floor/building/fellow Sim/turn invisible/etc. EA gives zero craps about their consumers. They do not care about anyone but themselves and lining their pockets. I wish to God that a different producer, who actually thought about the players...EVER...had made this game, because I love it to death, but EA will just throw out endless unfinished and completely broken games and expansions, and will do absolutely nothing to fix it. Buy nothing from EA unless you want to get royally screwed.EDIT: Did the math. I have about $220 worth of their product, from expansions. Was it worth? Well, I'll give that the same answer to this question...does it actually function? NO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to be a huge fan of this series, and I kind of have a love-hate relationship with it. I can even remember watching my mother playing Sims 1 when I was like, three. When I played Sims 2, I owned every EP. I once was able to call this my absolute favorite series, until I came to the realization that the game plus all the expansion packs cost around $400, and as amazing as the game is, I don’t think $400 is worth it. It’s extremely difficult to play this game and not drool over the expansion packs, so I just kind of stopped playing it. I recommend this game if you have amazing self-control, or have $400 to waste. Don’t get me wrong, hours of fun are to be had with this excellent game, but the fact is that the developers and publishers are evil when it comes to the EPs. Even though playing as a vampire fireman who aspires to be a stunt double, living with robots, racists, and poodles, then watching them all try to kill each other is amazing, $400 for the full experience? ♥♥♥♥ you EA.

												what can i say about sims 3, if you like it then you like it, and if you don't like it the who would have guessed it, that means you don't like sims 3. but i have to say that if you don't like this game you better have a good reason or at least a shroud of ignorance. personally i love this game and sims 2 was a gate way into RPGs for me (it may sound a bit odd but it makes sense if you think about it), i know that this game opens its self up to filthy casuals more then pros but it doesn't realy matter to much because casuals ignorantly fuel game companys with easy money so that they can make great games like mirrors edge. unfortunately ive actually uninstantiated this from steam because I got it again for orign purely for the add ons. i must say though that i have started playing this game during the afternoon before and looked out the window to see the sun rising again. with sims 4 on its way i can't realy say much about sims as a franchise until ive played it so ill end this review with a ???

												I must say that I do love the Sims as a franchise. And yes, I will admit that having to pay for multiple little cool things in a game is a horrible idea. But the base game alone is worth adding to your collection of games. It is a unique simulation and can provide some expirimental, time-wasting fun. And it also provides a great base for the modding communtiy to get their creativity on. But without the mods or certain expansion packs, I must admit that it is a very lack-luster and thinly spread game. Comparing the base game to either a modded game or a game with all of the expansions and ""stuff packs"", it is an overly-simply good idea than anything else. Creativity is at play, yet the microtransactions are strong in this one. I'd make sure to download many mods and to turn off the in-game payment system in the Options to get a very true and personal experience with this fun simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Twilight begins with an unnamed narrator (whom we later find out is Bella) giving a brief account about how she is about to die at the hands of a hunter. She is dying in the place of someone she loves, and the narrator does not regret any of the choices that brought her to this point. The past few months have been extraordinary, and she can’t complain.Zip! Now we’re following the life of Isabella “Bella” Swan, our seventeen-year-old narrator. Bella is moving to Forks, Washington, to live with her dad. We later learn that she volunteered to do this so that she wouldn’t hold her mother back from spending more time with her mother’s new husband. Forks is isolated, cold, dreary, and wet, and Bella’s relationship with her dad is distant, since she was raised by her mother in Phoenix. Bella's new life is dull until she gets a glimpse of the Cullen family – five gorgeous, mesmerizing siblings who attend her high school. She learns they do not socialize with anyone but each other. One of the boys in particular, Edward, pays her close attention and seems to regard her with alarming hostility when she's forced to sit next to him in Biology class. The next day, he is absent from school.Bella continues to adapt to her new life in Forks. She gets a lot more attention from boys than she was used to in Phoenix. She makes several friends quickly. A few days later, Edward finally is back in school. Now he’s friendly to Bella. His mere presence excites her. That afternoon in the school parking lot, a boy’s truck almost hits Bella after skidding on some black ice, but Edward uses his body as a shield in order to save her. Wait, how’d he do that?! Bella is totally baffled by this, but Edward refuses to explain his inhuman strength. She begins to have dreams about Edward, but at school, he gives her the cold shoulder. His behavior is very confusing, indeed.Bella gets asked to the upcoming school dance by not one, but three boys, all of whom she rejects. The next day, Edward gets Bella to talk to him during lunch – for the first time he’s spending lunch apart from his siblings. Knowing that she's trying to make sense of his strength and how he saved her, Edward asks for her “theories” on him. Next, it’s let’s-figure-out-your-blood-type day in Biology class, and Edward’s skipping class. Bella becomes faint at the mere thought of blood, and gets taken to the nurse’s office (Edward appears outside and intercepts her from Mike, one of the guys who has a crush on Bella). Edward insists that he take her home.That weekend, during a trip to a beach at La Push Indian reservation, Bella meets Jacob Black, who tells her about “the cold ones” (vampires). Word around the reservation is that the Cullens are vampires. When Bella gets home, she does some internet research and things start falling into place. Bella decides that she’s too in love with Edward to resist him, even if he is a vampire.Soon after, Bella takes a trip to Port Angeles with a few friends, where she gets lost looking for a bookstore. Some thugs almost attack her in a dark alley, but Edward appears in his shiny Volvo and saves her. They have dinner together, and he drives her home. He reveals that yes, he is a vampire. Edward doesn’t want to be a monster, though, and actually only drinks the blood of animals. Bella knows now that he does thirst for her blood, yet she still is in love with him. Edward repeatedly warns Bella that she should be afraid of him and stay away, if she’s smart.Edward and Bella take a mini-field trip together and spend the afternoon in a nearby secluded meadow, where Edward shows Bella that his skin sparkles in the sun (which is why vampires only come out at night or on cloudy days, which are common in Forks). They are completely in love. They kiss for the first time. Bella learns more about Edward’s family and their past. Edward struggles with abiding his morals (not tempting himself by getting close to a human) versus what he desires – to be near Bella. Edward spends the night in Bella's bedroom, watching over her as she sleeps (without her dad knowing, of course). Bella visits Edward’s house, meets his family, and learns more about their “kind” – vampires who don’t feast on humans. They go back to her house where Jacob and his father Billy Black show up to see her dad (Billy and Charlie are friends). Being a Quileute elder from the La Push reservation, Billy knows about the Cullens' secret and is worried for Bella's safety. He warns her to stay away from the Cullens. After the Blacks leave, Edward returns in his brother's jeep to pick up Bella. They’re going to play baseball. It's a Cullen family bonding ritual, evidently.While the Cullens are playing their crazy version of baseball (they're all incredibly strong and fast), three other vampires show up. One named James takes a liking to Bella (in the “I want to eat you” kind of way). Edward and his family get Bella away from James long enough to make a plan. They know that James is trying to track Bella, so Alice and Jasper (Edward's adoptive siblings) whisk her away to a hiding place in Phoenix, but James lures Bella to him by telling her that he has captured her mom. He’s about to kill Bella when the Cullen clan shows up. The only problem is that James has already bitten Bella. If Edward doesn't suck the venom-infected blood out of her, she'll become a vampire. Though it's difficult for Edward to control his urge to suck all of Bella's blood, he manages to cure Bella without killing her. The Cullens kill James and get Bella to a hospital, where she starts to recover from her many injuries. Overall Bella’s OK, though banged up. She and Edward are more in love than ever. However, they argue because Bella wants him to bite her and make her into a vampire so that they can live together forever; Edward refuses. Regardless of their different species, they are devoted to one another completely.In the Epilogue, Edward surprises Bella by taking her to the prom – she's horrified because she's uncoordinated and worried about dancing in public. Jacob shows up at the dance and delivers a message – Billy wants Bella to dump Edward. He also wants her to know that they “will be watching” (Epilogue.118). Anyway, Edward and Bella go outside to have some time alone – it’s twilight outside. Again, Bella asks Edward to make her into a vampire, and he refuses. Edward says to Bella, “I will stay with you – isn’t that enough?” and she replies, “Enough for now” (Epilogue.204). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without Custom content, and Expansions, there really isn't much to go with, as far as choices go with customization, if you don't want to pay for all of the microtransactions in the game for extra content, and customization. I'm kind of torn between the thumbs up, or down. Big sims fan, not so big a fan on the costs. Most of the expansions and stuff packs cost more than the base game, which, in my opinion is kind of a flop, and I often end up just going back to Sims 2, and the millions of expansions I had for it. It costs a pretty penny, and I guess it's worth it for the Residential/Community building aspects,  (The diagonal walls with the flooring sticking out is fixed! FINALLY!!) I'm sure it would be even better if I had the hundreds of dollars for all the expansions and stuff packs. Overall, out of ten, I give a score of 7/10Meh, Could have been better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the The Sims franchise, so it comes as no surprise that I enjoy this game. However, maybe this review is useful to someone already familiar with the series.There are several aspects about this iteration of the series that I dislike and which make me continue to view The Sims 2 as my favorite. I absolutely abhor having to see paid content in-game without having any interest whatsoever in ever buying it. I already spent more than $100 dollars on the base game and DLC. Why would I be charged for more and what justifies charging for it? Server maintenance, updates, and the cost of a Community Team (does The Sims even have one?) should be more than covered by that. So, besides the major issues of microtransactions being forced down one's throat, it also appears that getting free community content is much more of a hassle.  For starters, there is no Body Shop that allows you to easily create Sims and package them. There is no denying that the new Create a Sim tools are much more evolved and allow for much more customization, especially the ability to modify a Sim's body type, and the addition of true personality traits and combinations are great. However, there doesn't appear to be an easy way to share and obtain community content outside of EA's platform. I could list various other things that bother me about the game (e.g. Why are younger Sims so ugly? Why add rabbit holes?), but I think the attempts at money-making and sharing limitations are the main downsides to me.On the bright side, the graphics are beautiful and the exploration options endless, especially with the DLC (which, I am sorry to say, one still has to get for a more complete game experience).

One of my favourite memorys for this game is making all of my friends and making them act like my IRL friends would act like, we would eat deep fried food and make jokes all day, not to mention jobless as well.Overall, I find this game better than my IRL life.

When they are sleeping just speed time up, and watch them sleep. So when you are awake you can go to the gym, Meet people, get into fights, get a girl/boy friend. Most of the game is click and click.

												Sims 3 is a fun, enjoyable game that I have spent countless hours playing. I would like to be able to 100% recommend the game, as it is a virtual world with unlimited options and customization, however, there are also reasons why I wouldn’t recommend it. I’m choosing to not recommend it, and this is not because the game itself isn’t good, it is because of the numerous glitches and issues that come along with the game. I have been a fan of sims for years, and have Sims 2 Pets for Game Cube, Sims 3 for Wii and Sims 3 for PC. Out of these three, Sims 2 was the only one that didn’t have a lot of glitches. There were some small ones, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. However, in both the Wii version and PC version of Sims 3, while the game starts out being relatively glitch free, as you progress through the storyline, the glitches gradually become more frequent and begin to affect the fun of the gameplay itself. As of three or four years ago, I had to stop playing the Sims 3 for Wii, because every time I would try to load the game, within two or three minutes in live mode, it would freeze completely. I purchased Sims 3 last year during the summer sale, along with the Pets expansion. There was a special offer that meant I was able to buy both for way less than the normal price. That was the only reason I even considered buying the game.I love Sims, don’t get me wrong, but given that I know how many glitches were in Sims 3 for the Wii, I wasn’t willing to spend full price on a game that may or may not be playable at some point in the future. To give you an idea of the types of glitches I have encountered, I will first of all list all the expansions that I have currently.I have:Sims 3 PetsSims 3 GenerationsSims 3 SupernaturalSims 3 University LifeSims 3 SeasonsSims 3 AmbitionsI got the other expansion packs at the beginning of this year, again on sale. The game, while it often lagged a lot, worked relatively well until the beginning of February, when a strange and very frustrating glitch occurred. I was trying to get my sim to walk to the fridge to get some food, but every time I tried to issue the command, the bubble indicating that they can’t go there came up. My fridge was in the same exact spot as it had been since I started playing that save file. I couldn’t figure out why my sim couldn’t get to the fridge, given that there wasn’t anything visibly in front of the fridge door. So, after trying to remove the invisible object, I decided to move my fridge one spot to the left. I issued the command to my sim again, and they simply walked over and completed the task. However, the fact that there was some kind of invisible object blocking access to half my kitchen still remained, for which I couldn’t find a permanent solution. There were other annoying glitches as well, but for the PC version, this was the one that really made me frustrated, because while I could just move houses, I had everything in my current house the way I wanted it and I didn’t want to have to buy a new house because of some invisible object. This, in addition to the numerous issues I have encountered with the Wii version as well as the PC version is what caused me to get so frustrated. Sims 3 would be an extremely fun game, but the enjoyment of playing it is greatly diminished by the glitches that interfere with the gameplay. In conclusion, I do not recommend the Sims 3 game, unless you are willing to deal with the problems that will more than likely occur the more you play the game. I wish the developers of the game would have taken more time and effort to smooth out the issues instead of trying to get it done quickly in order to be able to sell it to the public. Quality is always more important than quantity. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So SOOOOOOOO buggy.  You have to play with cheats enabled.  You need cheats to repair your sims regularly as per official EA policy.  The longer your game lasts the worse it gets.  The game like to crash, and there is no auto-save meaning you can lose hours of game-play.  The game makes very poor use of your RAM. Every time you edit your sims home the game has to stop and reload textures for each item you modify, even for identical items.  The game also fails to clear your RAM properly so you need to restart your computer every 3 hours to maintain smooth animation.The game regularly suffers from broken AI, disappearing objects and Sims falling through floors.  Those are the least annoying bugs.  A game for sadists and masochists alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So SOOOOOOOO buggy.  You have to play with cheats enabled.  You need cheats to repair your sims regularly as per official EA policy.  The longer your game lasts the worse it gets.  The game like to crash, and there is no auto-save meaning you can lose hours of game-play.  The game makes very poor use of your RAM. Every time you edit your sims home the game has to stop and reload textures for each item you modify, even for identical items.  The game also fails to clear your RAM properly so you need to restart your computer every 3 hours to maintain smooth animation.The game regularly suffers from broken AI, disappearing objects and Sims falling through floors.  Those are the least annoying bugs.  A game for sadists and masochists alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They still need to fix how they do the military career, army would make way more sense then the airforce (larger, more popular and generic), and the astronaught would make more sense in a different line of the science career path. But yeah, this game is 10/10 for me. This game is a good real life simulator (don't judge by my time played, I've logged hundreds of hours on the Sims 2 and have played this game elsewhere), the only real problems are the ones in the other Sims games, but isn't much of a problem. If you want more detail on why it's great, look for Hess's review (or whatever his name is when you read this), he tells you on why it's such a good game in more detail. But in the end, if you like to simulate life, play God, or just torture your Sims (we've all done that at least once, don't lie), then this game is for you. However, if you DON'T like simulator games, like fast paced stuff, or are just new to the franchise, it may be hard to get into. Admittedly, I have trouble playing sometimes becuase there isn't enough action like in other games. Still, though, when their is a Steam Sale, I suggest trying it out at least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If price is something you can handle, it's well worth the expansion packs.  There's a lot in this game that I haven't personally done.  Spent most of my time building up a character with a huge range of relationships with people.  Lost that one to a bug, but kept on keeping on.  Now I'm back to where I was again and still am enjoying playing the game.  Also, locked everyone but myself out of a fraternity, took everything and sold them for some delicious simoleons.  All this was followed by seeing every single person at the fraternity dropping dead outside the dorm.  BEST CULT SUICIDE EVER.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Am I the only one who likes to make a bunch of Sims, name them after people I know, give them the same main personality characteristics as my irl friends, then watch what derpy things they do in game and see how they do when left to their own devices?  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT. (And sometimes, when the pixel SIM starts to become too much like the IRL friend...a little scary). This game brings back so many good memories of playing the early SIMs games, but the graphics are tons better than they used to be and the personalities are much more amusing (and the SIMs have more refined palates than before--making carbonara, mac and cheese, salads, and even cooking for pets.)  I like that you can play the game without really needing to avail yourself of the RMT store, too, and the SIMs will be plenty happy.  You can also control how quickly they age...and they will age...the addition of inevitable (as opposed to self-inflected by derping into a ladderless pool bwahhaha) mortality in the series makes the god complex you get playing the game all the better.  10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a lot of fun but i wish the mods where posted on Steam so i can simply click the add button on a mod from steam and manage my mods on steam rather then having to search the web for mods. Please add a workshop for The Sims 3 so that modders can add the mods into steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10 pretty much ate my whole life. I have many saves with many towns just trying to get the full experince. The one problem I have with this game is the prices for the DLCs. I could go get a full game for those prices! you could lower those prices by at leat 50-90% and then maybe I'll think about buying one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredibly addictive. Be warned: the expansions will devour your wallet.Also be warned that The Sims 3 has some annoying performance issues which seem to gradually get worse the more you play, especially if you have many add-ons installed.The Sims 4 is much more user-friendly, but isn't available on Steam, and lacks the customisation options available in this earlier title.

												The Sims is one of my top ten favorite series of all time and The Sims 3 is my #2 game from it. While I can't honestly say that I like it more than The Sims 2 it does have enough improvments that it's still absolutley worth the dozens (hundereds?) of hours I put into it as a teen. I'd give The Sims 3 an 8/10.

												The game itself is amazing. But the performance is just awful. I only recommend it because the game is a good game when it works well. But normally there are stuttering issues even with a high end computer. My specs are i7-6700K, GTX 970 and 16 GB DDR4. Only buy the game if you can deal with a good game that runs like crap.

												After Purchasing the likes of Sims and Sims 2 I was expecting much of the same and another similar style to the previous ones. Despite the fact that in many ways i was not suprised, in others I was. Although it kept a similar style to the previous ones, I was pleased to see such an effort to make the game develop, given that its producer is one of the biggest money-♥♥♥♥♥s I have ever come across in the Video-Game buisness, EA. Overall, although this game was similar to previous produces I would reccomend this game to all simulation players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sims 1: Has OK Graphics (Although crappy when you look at it now), gives you a decent start to a life simulatorSims 2: Awesome game, Awesome graphics, had more actions and scenes in which made it really better than the first one (And did I mention better graphics?)Sims 3: More customization to sims (traits favorites, etc), GREAT build mode, online store to buy stuff with Simpoints, has aspects from both Sims 1 and 2 on it (Except for scenes which made Sims 2 really awesome), you can control how long sims live and interact in the city and not have to wait through a loading screen every. freaking. time.Sims 4: Basically everything up above, but focuses more on your sims body customization and feelings. (You can move body parts around to suit your liking) (Haven't plsyed it to an extent because i only got a free trial on origin)My rating for this game? Asides from the Sims 2, DEFINITELY A SOLID 10/10 this is basically the best thing that ever happened in pc/console gaming since the sequel.WARNING: Once you start playing the sims, there is no coming out, you will be lifeless (HAHAHA, you get the joke? eh? eh?), so be cautious on how you play this game.  IT WILL TAKE OVER YOUR MIND.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Made a werewolf guy (supernatural DLC) who's hot-headed, fearless, and cocky, and a vampire woman who is composed, proper, and a neat-freak live in a house together. Naturally, they clash at first: she can't stand how he leaves his dishes everywhere and runs around on all fours sometimes, while he finds her stuck up and pretentious. But over time, they start chatting more and realizing how much they have in common.Their friendship hits a rough patch at the full moon, when he transforms and ruins a bunch of furniture, and she goes a little nuts and attacks him (apparently there's an action called a ""lunatic slap"" during the full moon that she did on her own). But they bond over fighting a robber together and playing lots of hopscotch, and soon their bond is stronger than ever. It pretty quickly moves to ""Romantic Interest,"" and all of a sudden they are flirting and kissing all the time.After a few in-game days of this, it's time for them to ""woohoo"" for the first time. He gives her a big dip kiss, and they go to the bed with swelling music and falling rose petals. Right as I'm wondering how birth control works in this game, since I'm not ready to raise a hybrid werewolf-vampire baby, she falls out of the bed and dies. The grim reaper shows up and takes her ghost away as I stare at my computer in shock. Apparently she died of thirst, unwilling to feed from him and not wanting to interrupt the romance to go drink.Now he's walking around the house grieving, surrounded by walls covered in all the paintings she made. He tries desperately to resurrects her while her ghost is still haunting the place, but can't find the necessary ingredients to make the potion he needs in time. He finally moves on when he finds a puppy at the animal shelter that needs a home, and starts forming a warm friendship with the zombie next door.8/10 would play out a young adult paranormal romance novel again if it weren't so incredibly slow and if each DLC wasn't ridiculously expensive.

												If price is something you can handle, it's well worth the expansion packs.  There's a lot in this game that I haven't personally done.  Spent most of my time building up a character with a huge range of relationships with people.  Lost that one to a bug, but kept on keeping on.  Now I'm back to where I was again and still am enjoying playing the game.  Also, locked everyone but myself out of a fraternity, took everything and sold them for some delicious simoleons.  All this was followed by seeing every single person at the fraternity dropping dead outside the dorm.  BEST CULT SUICIDE EVER.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played Sims for so long now and I've played it on xbox, PSP, xbox 360, mobile and now on PC. It's one of my favorite games for several reasons. I will list the pros and cons of my overall gameplay experience below.PROS:-The requirements to play The Sims 3 are very low-You basically have full control of the Sims, which ofc is limited to the features of the game-There are optional expansion packs available to, well, expand your features-The Exchange provides additional (and free) downloadable content that are made from other players-Funny stuff happens while playing-Basically an endless amount of fun! (aka it has good replay value)-Get creative with it, no gameplay can be exactly the same because different scenarios happenCONS:-The expansion packs are pricey and sometimes don't even add too much to the game-My Sims has glitched out a few times when trying to socialize with a huge group of Sims (it might just happen to me though)Here's the first episode of my gameplay series for The Sims 3:Attack on Sims Series by Fuhn Tyme MChttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l5EReZraTwOverall Rating: 10/10Btw, this is my first review ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That said, it needs the expansion packs to be fully appreciated, and that's a bit unfair to one's budget. There is also a few annoying mechanics that can only be fixed with a patch, so that's also not fair.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sims 3 is a lifestlye of a game, I have played with multiple families, some reaching better lives then my own haha. Its very time consuming and great for those who love multitasking. Characters can be silly to look a like to your real life self. Its nice to have a game where you can live out a dream life, with just a click.Pros:-The vast ideas of what a character could look like.-The DLCs, add more to the game when applied.-Building a home from scratch is fantanstic with the tools they provide for you.-You can download other player made sims, to give yourself the friends that also play.-You can make a story by creating and being whatever you like.-Finally got to have a loving family.Cons:-You have to buy DLCs in order to get the real good stuff.-Paranoid with teaching my children to swim, (I TOLD HER NOT TO GO IN THE POOL)-The big one, is there is no multiplayer...(I know it wouldn't happen, but it would be cool to be able to buy a sim server and host people from around the world to go into your world and live there too. But guess thats reaching for the moon)-If you own a DLC then purchase a new one, it tends to bug the previous DLCs, had to redownload a few times, so the pets would stop being invisible, really annoying when you have a pet and its yelling at you that its sad or lonely and you can't see it to help. ; -;Overall:I honestly love this game, I wish I had the time to put into it like I used too, but I will play again once I own each and every DLC so I can start over and take full advantage of them all.

												I think the Sims 3 was okay but compared to the Sims 2 it falls short in MANY ways, Originally the sims 1 was supposed to be all open neighborhoods with no loadscreen between houses,etc and all familys going simultaniously, but computers of the time just couldn't and weren't able to do that sort of processing just yet. The Sims 2 on the other hand allowed players to finally go INSIDE the Sim's places of work and to build it and even run it (to a degree) and you could even visit it with your other sims, etc -> this is one MAJOR thing I feel was left out of the Sims 3. I also don't care for how cartoonish the Sims series has become, The Sims 1 was sophisticated and articulate but the sims 2 got more childish and the sims 3 is just a complete mess, The makers of the game need to appease to all age-groups, I couldn't imagine this game making me feel any younger way into the future one far off day when I am in my 80s vs. some maxis classics like Simcity 2000. I -am- aware that will wright didn't make the Sims 3 and that that may be a HUGE part of it but still, The cartoonish-ness levels need to be brought down heavily. With that being said if I could give this a nutral rating a would, I will do a thumbs up but only because the game itself can still be a lot of fun, but only in limited amounts,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 is a really awesome game. This is nearly an accepted fact, of course, because everyone loves The Sims. I'm sure that there are plent of other reviews that will tell you all about that, though. This review here is a cautionary tale, though most of you likely won't need it.There are those of you, however, who won't consider ahead of time what a money-suck this game will end up being. Do not be ashamed to admit this, I myself have this problem.You see, I'm a broke college student. Living off about $200 a month for food, I have a very bad habit of just not eating for days on end so that I can buy video games instead. The Sims 3 was the first game I bought on Steam. Prior to that, I was a dreaded Xbox gamer.I bought the base game + pets for 29.99. Let's round that up to $30, remembering that I suck at math. That's our first number. 30.I bought The Sims 3, rather than waiting just a few weeks for The Sims 4 to come out, because I have no impulse control whatsoever, and thought I'd save money by buying an older game. Perhaps I did initially save money. This, however, went down the toilet after six more DLCs, at 19.99 each. Round up to the nearest whole and our second through seventh numbers are each 20. For simplicity's sake, let's just multiply that out now to $120.But wait, there's more (there always is): The Sims does this darling little thing where it shows you all of these awesome items and worlds and stuff that you can buy with points, or whatever they're called. I don't remember at this point. Now, I know that I spent at least $50 on these, not all at once, but over time. There was some cool stuff offered, and I like cool stuff.If we add all of our lovely numbers together, we get $200, though without rounding, I suppose, it would be $199.93. This, however, is a very low guesstimate, due to the points I purchased. Keep in mind that The Sims 3 was not at all new by the time that I spent all this money.This is entirely my own fault, of course. And I do take responsibility for it. However, with 7 total DLCs (world adventures and into the future likely causing the bulk of the issues), my game was unable to run after a while. It now crashes inenvitably after just ten minutes or so of play. These DLCs are HUGE, and to anyone who plans on buying them, it is important to remember that you really need to choose which ones you really want, they do put a strain on your system.I actually bought the game thinking that it would be easy for my computer to run, since it was all sandboxy and such. I was dead wrong, and don't even know where I came up with that idea. Pretty much any other game will treat your computer with more kindness than this game will. At least in my experience.In short, I do, in fact, recommend this game. But I do so with caution. Just know what you're getting yourselves into, and also remember that the Sims may not seem as fun now as it did during your childhood. In fact, in this version, Sims can get out of the pool without a ladder. Isn't that lame? I think so. Anyhow, have fun and don't go broke.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been a fan of the Sims, and the features that came along with The Sims 3 added a lot to an already great game. I'm really excited for The Sims 4 to come out later this year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Sims 3 is wonderful but the DLC's are extremely expensive. I suggest buying DLC's when they are on sale. However the base game is very fun to mess around with and just enjoy! So I recommend the base game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of fun. WAY better than previous Sims games. Most of the things you hated doing in Sims 1 and 2 are long gone leaving an easy to use but deep and expansive progression system. Sims 3 has evolved into more of a videogame than a simulator which I find much more entertaining. Would highly recommend this game to those who couldn't get  into other Sims games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think the Sims 3 was okay but compared to the Sims 2 it falls short in MANY ways, Originally the sims 1 was supposed to be all open neighborhoods with no loadscreen between houses,etc and all familys going simultaniously, but computers of the time just couldn't and weren't able to do that sort of processing just yet. The Sims 2 on the other hand allowed players to finally go INSIDE the Sim's places of work and to build it and even run it (to a degree) and you could even visit it with your other sims, etc -> this is one MAJOR thing I feel was left out of the Sims 3. I also don't care for how cartoonish the Sims series has become, The Sims 1 was sophisticated and articulate but the sims 2 got more childish and the sims 3 is just a complete mess, The makers of the game need to appease to all age-groups, I couldn't imagine this game making me feel any younger way into the future one far off day when I am in my 80s vs. some maxis classics like Simcity 2000. I -am- aware that will wright didn't make the Sims 3 and that that may be a HUGE part of it but still, The cartoonish-ness levels need to be brought down heavily. With that being said if I could give this a nutral rating a would, I will do a thumbs up but only because the game itself can still be a lot of fun, but only in limited amounts,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. I've played since the origional sims. It is something I can always come back to even years later and pick right back up. I love how customizable everything is with online downloading and the store. Always a fun game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. Well, thats if you know how to grant wishes and stuff. The character creator is amzing. I made Armin Arlert from Attack on Titan. But one hard part about this game is the needs. My sim almost died because I didn't see his needs going down. I reccomend this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I truly love this game cause theres so many options it seems like the options are endless. Ive been playing this game for almost a year and I give it a huge thumbs up. You cant win or lose on this game all you have to do is sit back and play the game how you want. You can create sims that are amazing to you and play their life how you think they should. The sims you create their lives are you your hands which is what I love about this game. I totally recommend this game to other people.			",36,12,0,5,4,0,1
