												This is one of the best city simulations out there, especially when looking strictly at games with good graphics. That said, it is not without its flaws.The Good:- Lots and lots of replayability. You could get lost in this game on just a single city for weeks.- Your cities interact with each other to an extent. You can trade things like water, fuel, industry, and office services amongst the cities you create. This allows you to specialize your cities, such as creating an industry giant that feeds industry goods to your cities where you want to avoid polution, such as a resort town.- You can point and click your way through everything. Given how many options you have for roads, buildings, etc, the menu is easy to use and allows for quick access to everything.- The game feels like a semi-sandbox during normal play, as there isn't really many restrictions in place (and you can switch the building restrictions off in the settings).- As you build up your city, you get to a point where you realize it isn't just about building anymore. Management becomes a much bigger deal. One of the biggest management challenges is transportation, and that adds something to the game that I find quite enjoyable, making it a bit deeper than it might look on the surface.The Bad:- Some of the mechanics for laying out streets (especially bridges) and buildings can make things a bit frustrating.- The whole Cities XL series are just reboots. They look the same, play the same, and feel the same. This makes for a bit of a hidden ""good"" I guess in that you shouldn't feel the need to own them all (I do and don't have any reason to play any of the previous ones).- They removed the online function that the original had, rather than making it work. The idea of being able to have cities existing in a ""truly global"" world definitely had an appeal.- The developer is lazy. The failure to make online work, some small problems and unfinished features, and the mechanics that are still issues still unaddressed after so much time just speaks to the lack of care the developer has for its work and reputation. They did ""fix"" things to a point where they weren't really game-breaking, but it still sits in my mind that they seem to want to skate by at this point (especially given how much effort they put into trying to create a great alternative to another ""CitySim"" game).If you really like city management/builder games, this gives a good balance between the two and should be able to keep your entertained for quite a while. If you can catch it on a sale, then great! If not, you just need to decide what your dollar is worth. As far as putting a dollar value on fun, you have to do that for yourself, but even with the flaws, the value was definitely there for me given how much entertainment I have gotten from it. Decidedly beats spending the money on gas, a ticket, and some overpriced popcorn and soda at a movie theater for me.			",110,20,7,25,100,2,67

												i increased my score a couple point to try to offset the trolls and griefers that wrongfully malign this otherwise great game. and while its not worth a 10 its definitively not a 0!. i would say about a 7 and with all the stuff on xlnation.net perhaps an 8!please understand that this game has a bit of history. over 4 years ago a small company named monte cristo developed and released it as massively multiuser online game. unfortunately less than a year after they went broke due to low subscription rate and were unable to finish the game. soon after focus acquired the writes and reworked it as a single player offline game and released it. since then making minor fixes and about once a year they have been releasing new content dlcs.as you can imagine the people who originally purchased and subscribed to cities xl unlimited edition, the mmo version from the now bankrupt developer, are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that they got stuck with a dead game after only being able to play with it for such a short time.so they troll steam forums and even this site complaining about the long defunct developers and about long ago fixed bugs and basically spooking people away from buying the game.many do not even own or play this game, they just own the other game and since the servers have all been shutdown for that game long ago can't no longer play it. yet they refuse to upgrade to this game, basically wanting the new developers to basically give them the new game.here check out the facts for yourselfhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_XLi own and play just about every city sims/builders that is out therethis is great game, loads of fun, runs great, have played it for hundreds of hours.even better if you go to xlnation.net you will find hundreds of mods for it, everything imaginable and a very active community over 40,000 members!i also want to say that there is no serious memory leak or programming issue like some people are posting. what issue that people are having is that the game allows you to build huge i mean huge cities, ive seen some with population over 90M and basically they do not set limits other than the hardware you have. so as you add more and more buildings and roads and the cities get larger and more complex sure its going to use more and more memory until you run out of memory and until your cpu/gpu cant handle the size of the cities and complexity and the framerate goes down. It's hard to put in words just how large and complex your cities can get, they can look so real that you can't distinguish screenshots from real world images of some of the worlds largest cities. in fact i cant think of a real world single city that has a population of over 90M. so what you have a people with low end hardware trying to build cities they can't support. and since its a 32-bit application, like most games, the cities can only get so large and complex before you hit the 2-3gb limit that windows imposes. the trick is to balance city size and complexity and not try to build cities that don't make sense and would not be practical even in real life.so yes the game is a 32-bit game with the game logic running in a single thread, but most other games out there have the same limitations. the only difference between those games and this game is that this game does not impose limits on you like simcity or tropico or anno does. also this games lets u pack the density of the cities to real world levels and beyond. in this way its more a city builder than a sim i would say.having said that the game, like all other games and software, does have bugs and issues, but luckily they are for minor and can easily be ignore of worked around.

												+/+ Graphics are great for a city building game.+/+ Most game mechanics are well executed.+/+ Great UI.  Very easy to pick up and learn.+/+ Cities can interact (i.e. trade) with each other.  This allows you to create specialty cities.+/+ Large maps.+/- Not as difficult as SimCity 4.+/- Not much different than previous Cities XL games.+/- Includes Steam Cloud, but lacks other features such as achievements and the workshop.-/- Lack of variety in graphic style.-/- Not map editor or terraforming options.-/- Roads & highways can sometimes very picky about how you place them. -/- Game slows down once your city reaches a certain size (very processor heavy game).-/- Developers have a bad reputation and have gone out of business.  Don’t expect new patches.-/- Unfixed bugs and broken features.Verdict: 6.8/10.  While Cities XL Platinum clearly fails to surpass SimCity 4, it does offer a unique and fun take on the city building/management genre.  If you can put up with the late game slowdowns or don’t care about creating larger cities, then I can easily recommend Cities XL Platinum to you.  If you expect more, you will be disappointed.  Don’t spend more than $10 and you’ll likely be happy.Update 9/7/15:  Buy Cities Skyline if you want a city builder.  This game is no longer worth considering.			",461,97,8,92,68,2,122

												I'd love to give this a thumbs up, here is why I won't:The game is great! Its fun, realistic, and you can create economies. Its definitely the best city simulator I have played.But. And this is a big butt (*snigger*) Its so bugged and glitched out that after a little while it becomes impossible to play. Too many aspects of the game have bugs that are game breaking. For instance (and this is the most frusturating) after a while, trading with the AI company is beyond worthless, its actually harmful to trade with them because the glitch makes it that you have to pay to get rid of your goods, as if they were plague infested. I don't mean pay as in like a tarriff, I mean as in you pay as much to sell your good as they should to buy it. If you can't trade you can't expand, and if you can't expand the game is done. Fun, but broken. Please fix. Until then, don't buy this game.			",36,6,3,12,12,1,14

												Cities XL is a great city builder, if you're willing to deal with lag.  Short and sweet, this game is what SimCity 2013 should have been, released a year earlier.  The game scales extremely well, allowing for truly MASSIVE cities to be build.  It has a billion different building types, large amount of road variations, and entirely different themes for all of them, depending on where you want to build.Now, that's all great, other than the fact the actual developer for the game is dead and long gone.  It's got the same problems cities XL 2010 had, and will continue to have them forever.  Those problems are potentially game breaking for anyone willing to invest a lot of time.  The major bug that gets near everyone is the fact it's single threaded.  The game will not use more than one core on your computer, so no matter how well the rest of your system is, a large city will cripple you to single digit frame rates.There are a few other much more minor bugs that people complain about, however I haven't come across.  Overall, I find the game to be very satisfactory.  I've gotten pretty large cities before the single digits hit, and even then it's still fairly easy to play.  For a veteran and novice to city building alike, I highly recommend this game for at least a short try.  It's just a shame there is no more development on it.			",537,88,45,90,61,9,88

												This game has the potential to be far greater than SimCity ever could be, considering EA's corporate greed holds it back so much these days. It features enormous cities and very easy-to-use interface systems to create a city EXACTLY the way you want it to look even with road-following decorations and multiple ways to plop out zones, then zooming in and ""walking"" around if you so desire - the level of detail is astounding, and I've personally been playing this series since it's predecessor, City Life, came out back years ago. The game has a major downside though - it's outdated 2005 graphics engine is a 32 bit engine not optimized for multi-core. No matter how good your PC is, the game is limited to only using 1 core and up to 4 gigs of ram - 2 gigs by default, editing the config file is needed to crank 4. This means large cities on even the toughest PCs will lag like all hell, while your PC shows virtually no sign of wear, often running far below 20% of max capacity. Community guides even state you have to quit and reload the game every hour and possibly even change your graphics settings far below what your computer should be able to support just to keep it running in larger cities.Specs arent the issue for those of you claiming I have a bad computer - I run a hex core 3.5 ghz intel i7, have 64 gigs of ram, and 2 nvidia titans, and yet I clock as little as - well, 0 FPS at times. I have also tried it on a laptop running a quad core 2.7 ghz i7 with 32 gigs of ram and a GTX 680M with the same issues.			",280,35,7,24,85,3,94

												I will recommend this game, but be cautious. This game gets insanely difficult, and fast. Once you get access to basic utilities, like water, power, and oil, it can be so easy to bankrupt your city by trying to offer all of these to your city at once. This game runs on supply and demand. If you're producting a lot of oil, and your city can't pay for it (not that your city won't demand it; they just won't be able to pay for it), your city will lose money by extracting more oil than what it can pay for. This goes with about a dozen different resources the game takes into account. You can also have not enough resources. This makes things rather complicated, because you will always run into a scenario in which your city needs more resources than it can pay for, even if you trade with other cities. Your city will always be plagued with problems once you get to a significant population. Traffic is always a problem. Always. There is no way to really mend the traffic problem. The tourism also really doesn't make much sense to me.However, I recommend this game because it's kind of realistic. You can't make everyone happy. You can't ""pre-plan"" your city by making interstates in a town with 200 population. You have to build your city up and then create those, causing you to have to re-route traffic and demolish structures so you can work on your interstate system, which is a headache I bet most leaders in transportatioon have. You will have to have a ghetto and also a rich population. Your citizens will get bored. The game is also beautiful and zooming into ground level gives a lot of awesome views.			",17,4,0,8,20,0,5

												Nice graphic, not bad gameplay, awful optimization, so just when your city grows(and it happens over 5-6 hours), playing becomes impossible. Despite the hardware you have. It just will lag. And nothing can be done with it, nobody plans to patch it. Every year this game is sold with great discount, and naive customers throw out their money. So I highly warn you against purchasing this game.			",53,9,0,5,13,0,1

												Picked this game up in a humble bundle for a few bucks, and man am I glad I did.  After the disappointment of Sim City 5, this game totally scratches the itch.  A bit less tedious, and has a very impressive feature of zooming down to street level instantly to see what the city looks like from the citizen's view.  Pleasantly surprised to find Sim City has a successor.			",246,58,3,24,16,3,19

												Incredibly detailed and complex city planning and management game. Not for everyone. For those who wish to build a dream city with all the challenges of managing a city, or for civil planning student, this can be quite rewarding, watching your city grow.One draw back, however - the check point system. Once an earlier check point is loaded, it automatically erase all progress after that point and overwrite any later check point, forcing you to start again from that point. It also doesn't help that it is quite easy to accidently load a check point, causing many wasted hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had so much hope for this game it's unfortunate it fell right on it's face I'm only fortunate that I got it during the christmas sell and didn't spend too much on it... Where do I begin?CONSSo the game will work fine for the first hour or two but after that you should have a pretty good sized city the problem is this is where the framerate drop begins. Where this game does justice is that it calculates EVERYTHING unlike sim city which will take shortcuts. Unfortunately this means the game is very CPU intense and WITHOUT multithreading this game is a total mess. Once you use up that first core of your CPU that's all you get. It's like a trip back to 1998. Despite the new name and repackaging the game doesn't incorporate much more than it's previous installments. The same 5  pedestrians and the same buildings with very few added on.Lack of any map editor or terraforming option means you are stuck with the same maps over and over again. The only terraforming option you do have is flatten ground wich can be next to useless and won't let you do much. Roads are very picky on their placement and highways are buggy as hell (tested them out using cheats). When cars get to an on/off ramp/section they stop moving. this creates conjestion on highways when you should be none. Bridges are difficult to create in a way that looks appealing and can take several tries and much wasted time. PROSLarge open maps of which the only limit is how fast your processor is.I could say more but if this didn't convince you to spend your money elsewhere nothing will.			",32,2,0,6,6,0,7

												This is a city builder you'll have to adjust to. I'm a Sim City die hard; So I naturally like drawing my own zone sizes and knowing what will deveolp and what size they will be. This game has pre-designated zones/ blocks. So everytime you want to place one home you will place the same size block over and over (no zoning). But it does allow you to drag and drop the size and quantity of blocks you want in a zone. It also has a nice road building feature where you click to start a build point, click again to anchor, click for another anchor point, then  double click to end.Plus when it comes to building your city, you must unlock all of the features per city in order to build as you wish. You start out with very basic zones and access to all road types.My biggest annoyance about this game is the achievements. While you play, it will pop up achievements, in a huge gold bubble right across your screen. And if you've earned many at once, they're all listed at once so you can't see anything. And these achievements are repetetive and are unlocked per city you build.It's still an enjoyable game, though. Less difficult of the city builders.			",91,20,5,9,52,2,9

												I have been a fan of build and manage games ever since Populous came out on the Amiga, after that came Sim City (they were both relased 1989) and then kinda got tired of them or should I say, i grew up, Sim City got more bells and whistles, Monster invasion and crap never appealed to me.Cities XL Plat is a hardcore city building game, it's realistic to the point nothing in a city can ever be stagnant or it fades away, the better the city the faster the problems, trying to fix to many issues, gets you new ones.As many of these games its about keeping a balance and anticipating where once you grow your new problems will arise.I read some negative reviews cant say I agree with any of them, as a city building game its really fun and probably has 50-100 hours of gameplay before you feels it has nothing more to give you, Sim City has more bells and whistles, but this game has hardcore realism, it reminds me of Banished.Stability i am not sure about, no problems at all so far, intel/nvidia, nothing special.

												Let's face it; this is quite similar to all the other city games; so there is not really that much to say on the gameplay.I enjoy play this game, because it is extremely simple. You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole array of buildings.There are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).Gameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.Performances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.City size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.AI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.OVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.6.5 out of 10 for me.

												The vacuum left by the SimCity series after 4 was a perfect opportunity for another developer to swoop in and claim the city-building throne. After all, as venerable as it was, SimCity never actually ventured into full 3D, and the rare competitors that did could never match the quality of the core simulation. Eventually the folks behind Cities XL stepped up to the plate, and while it ticks all the right boxes for a fine city builder, it also leaves a lot to be desired.XL's pitch was that you could finally build the modern city of your dreams, as huge and sprawling as you want. To that end you lay roads, zone for residences and businesses, provide utilities and services, and manage the finances of your burgeoning burg, just as you would in a traditional SimCity. All of this is rendered in full 3D, with skyscrapers rising from the hills and valleys of your map, all while little cars and even people traverse your network of streets. From that perspective, it's pretty much what anyone wanted from a SimCity 5.But Cities XL is more than just a copy of the old formula. The familiar residential, commercial, and industrial zones are split into types that demand specific resources of each other. Homes can be zoned for unskilled workers, skilled workers, executives, and ""elites"", whatever that means. Industries can be anything from farms to factories, tech centers to office complexes. Different industries require different proportions of worker classes, and then produce goods for your shops and trade outside the city. Some resources are limited by the map, such as having specific agricultural zones for farms or fields for oil. Not every map has every resource, either, so use of the trading system becomes necessary as you expand.New buildings such as larger services and higher-density zones unlock at certain population levels. In a strange twist this happens at specific ""ticks"" that actually make XL play more like a turn-based builder than a real-time one. You can set the amount of time between each tick, but until it rolls over nothing will really change in the city. Income, trades, unlocks, and changes to building status are all held until the next tick. Honestly I found speeding up the ticks more useful than playing slow because it keeps the money rolling in at the pace you need to expand.And boy howdy, will you be expanding. The specific balances of workers against workplaces is so fragile that you'll constantly be zoning new houses and factories to keep up with the alerts pouring in. This isn't the lazy suggestion of SimCity's RCI meter, this is the constant threat of businesses going bankrupt and citizens streaming out of your city. The way Cities XL is designed, your city will never be at peace or even equilibrium. You'll always be lacking something, and forever be pestered to fix it.That brings me to my chief complaint about the game, the feel of it. Stripping away the complexity of the zoning and additional systems, you could almost mistake XL for a SimCity if not for the incredibly cheap feel of it. Every single menu is a simple blue gradient with text misaligned on it, like a developer's first mock-up of a UI. The building menus have teeny-tiny tooltips and titles, leaving you to rely on the blurry icons to figure out what you're building. You have several zoning tools at your disposal but they all map out fields of square zones mashed against each other at awkward angles or in boring grids. Sure, you can make curved, complex roads, but why bother if you're just going to be snapping cubes against them?In the end, the shoddy presentation and the unnecessary complexity doom Cities XL to languish behind even the earliest SimCities. The graphics can't even save it, cursed with washed-out colors and bland models for even the largest skyscrapers. You can make enormous, sprawling cities but they're just going to be grids (or knots) of ugly, samey buildings, with little to even differentiate offices from condos. And honestly, if you can't build a city you can admire, there's just no point to building.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

The UI looks like one guy spent a couple hours in Photoshop; the roads are just awful - roundabouts are useless and ugly, trying to make your own roundabout will lead to annoying texture clippings on the roads EVERYWHERE. The traffic managment just doesn't even exist even though it tries to. There just aren't enough options to help.So if you're looking for a good city sim, do NOT pick this up.			",308,94,3,44,30,3,25

Cities XL Platinum Review - Rating: 2.8/10General ImpressionCities XL Platinum is a… pretty damn horrible game. No offense, but from outdated graphics, camera issues, bad gameplay, and several other issues, I cannot recommend this game. The graphics and the textures are relatively outdated. The atmosphere isn’t that kind of exciting either, it’s not that interesting. The audio and the music are pretty boring and repetitive. The gameplay gets boring really fast, and also it feels pretty uninteresting. The game doesn’t have a story either. The user interface is simple and nothing special about it. The controls are clunky; I don’t like them. The engines aren’t great either, the game still has some bugs and flows, which shows that the developer doesn’t care of their own game at all. The mechanics are repetitive and boring. There are also even other issues, read them in the negative points. Overall, Cities XL Platinum is an overpriced game, with nothing special in it, which I highly recommend skipping, from my point of view. Just pick Cities: Skylines instead, it’s more expensive with just 4,99$, but it far out weights this game.Positive PointsHas a bunch of maps to play onDecent user interfaceA tutorial is availableNeutral PointsA story would have improved the game a lot, along with some missionsTrading cards, Steam achievements and Steam Workshop would improve the game as wellNegative PointsOutdated graphics and texturesUninteresting atmosphereBoring audio and repetitive musicPretty terrible gameplayClunky controlsSome flows in the enginesBoring and repetitive mechanicsThe camera issues are annoyingThe street-laying function doesn’t work well, neither the bridge-laying oneIt misses a map editor, a huge disadvantageA misleading trailer, hahaha, nice one, dear ""developers""No terrain forming options? What the hell, and you put a 19,99$ price tag on it? Along with the many other issues?The developers have already left the gaming industry, don’t expect this game to be fixed, that’s already a strong reason to not recommend it ",655,158,18,43,61,10,69

												TLDR: A great city building game that could've been the best for years to come. There are too many issues though.I still rate it 3rd for me after Simcity 3000 and 2000.Beware of the compatability issues, performance issues, bugs and illogical things (the save menu WTF).The city building is solid and all the info you need is available. Sometimes the city's management information is a bit hard to find, but it's there. You don't have to lay down power lines or water pipes, which I didn't like at first, but got used to. The roads can be curved in any way you want which is really cool.The game is easy at first and the tutorials are good (not voiced though), but there is a big difficulty jump when your basic utility facilities aren't enough for your city anymore. The city will start to demand more electricity, fuel, water and waste disposal very suddenly. Also when you start building high density stuff the demands go up quite a lot.The game also seems laid back and fun instead of taking itself super seriously. Just like Simcity 3000 did (And Simcity 4 didn't). It doesn't mean it makes the game any worse as a simulator, but more fun to play.Graphics look really nice and are freely rotatable and zoomable 3D. You can tilt the view upwards/downwards with only 2 presets though.I can't really get why some people complain about the graphics.You can zoom in to see the details, which I didn't really care at first, but I found it's really cool to see your cities from the street level in the ""postcard"" camera mode.Sounds are what you'd expect in a city builder and music suits the game nicely. The intro song does play a bit too much though.I have not run in to any compatability issues with Win 7 64bit, but there are many people reporting them on the forums.And the to the negatives:The game runs fine when building a small city, but when the city size reaches 500k people or so it brings any computer down to below 10FPS in some situations (like making bus lines or zooming way out).It runs only in single threaded mode, but also must be optimized poorly. Some tweaks to the game files help, but not enough to make building big cities fun.There are some bugs like sometimes the trading does give or take more money than it should, some special building names or descriptions not showing up properly and one or two sounds not playing properly (police station is one).And then there are these logical issues. When you click a diskette image in the menu that is labeled ""Save"" and in the following interface click a save thumbnail, it LOADS the save instead of saving (there is a confirmation dialog, but it's too easy to just click ok). Also it overwrites the autosave instantly at that moment.There are more of these issues, but they're just annoyances, not wasting hours of city building!			",103,7,1,5,17,0,9

												Snagged this in a bundle. Does not look like much from the outside, but that is like judging a book by its cover.It is essentially an offline Simcity, so you can have all the fun you want with no internet. Consider getting this if you enjoy ""Tycoon"" games like Zoo Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon. To add to this, you can trade with neighboring cities, thus adding another way to get even more money. A must have.			",63,9,0,18,4,2,5

												I bought this game in desperation despite all the negative things I heard about it.The game is not bad. It has tons of nice features, different buildings, good details, a decent engine. BUT, it lacks one very major feature: management. You don't need to manage your financials in this game as time isn't a constraint. Once you make a few houses and industries your flowchart turns green and you can skip forward to get tons of money. You don't lose anything by doing that. Just like the first Sim City from 1990.Unlocking some buildings over time and making some old ones obsolete when time goes by would easily solve the issue. There can easily be diminishing tax returns from old houses or you might have to renew buildings over time. Unfortunately in its current state the game is not challenging at all.I don't want to give a negative review because of only one issue and there are no other city sims playable but they definitely have to solve this problem.

												Cities XL Platinum is a tough game for me to rate. I don't have any of the crashing or errors I've seen mentioned anywhere. However, I'm not really impressed with it as a sim-game. Lot of neat details and things to do that improve on SimCity4, yet it feels half-done, or at least kind of indie-ish, despite this being the 3rd iteration of the series.Found this game to have a lot of potential and some great features, especially the progression of unlocking different building and zones which stop your from getting over whelmed and over stretched at the start. However it has some funny quirks and weird problems which do stop the game from flowing the right direction. Still any fans of city building games will likely get a lot of time from this and is enjoyable for the most part.Certainly the game engine is capable of some magnificent looking cities, and overall the gameplay feels pretty solid. But there are some issues present that hold me back from giving a more firm answer.Graphically excellent. Easy to learn. Manual is appalling for a game where you need to understand what's going on inside the system to do well. Game soon becomes repetitive and limited. The problem is that the internal systems are fairly basic. Fun for an evening or two, but I found it hard to play beyond that.			",209,46,2,27,14,2,30

												Ive played Cities XL since the very first one came out, and spent over a hundred hours in the series. Its a fantastic game, don't get me wrong, but there is a massive deal-breaker. The game's engine has been the same since the first Cities XL, and it doesnt utilize Multi-Core, and it can only use 3 gb's of RAM. Once you get a large city going the game will start to lag, and then it will get worse and worse. So after having a completely stable economy and large city, it will be lagging so bad that you wont be able to play your city anymore, even with the most powerful gaming rig.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For its quality, the game should be called Cities XL M - Early Access (alpha).This game was fun but very disappointing. The save feature doesn't work and the game is too slow with even a small city of <25,000 people. I saved my game multiple times with different names while I was playing. The game eventually slowed down so much that it was frustrating to play. I saved again, quit the game and restarted it. When I restarted it only a single autosave from hours ago remained. This game does not meet the barest standards of quality.			",89,13,3,13,27,0,25

												Hey, it lets you play single player without an internet connection or server log-in. 10/10But seriously, I wish I had found this game before I sunk tons of hours into Sim City: DRM Edition. Cities XL is robust, beautiful, has crazy amounts of freedom, and city plots that are absurdly gigantic. Anyone who is a fan of city building sims owes it to themselves to buy this game. I hope some day down the line I recover from my SimCity burnout and can come back and really dive into this awesome game.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												A good strategy game. You build your towns and make them growing up. However, you can not ""connect"" your towns, except for trade, because you can only build one town on each map so the game can become boring.... . You have no multiplayers mode and no steam achievements, only the steam cloud can be used and you can take some screenshots. In your town, you lead everything : traffic, money, jobs, constructs, activities of the citizens, etc etc... there is always something to do or check. As well, there are alot of different maps. Some of them are very difficult, because of a lack of resources for example. Anyway, it's a pretty nice game with however some little negative points that can deteriorate the overall impression about the game.70 / 100			",43,1,2,3,8,0,2

												Don't let my low amount of time on this game fool you; it's basically the same game as its previous iterations; this is just the one now solely available on Steam.  I put dozens of hours into the 2012 edition and got this for about three bucks.Now then, that said.  Is this game anywhere near as good as Cities: Skylines (my 2015 Game of the Year)?  Of course not.  Not by half.  But there's more to it than that.See, XL has one thing Skylines doesn't; a beautifully interconnected resource economy that makes building specialized cities so much more rewarding.  You can build a breadbasket city on a map with a ton of fertile land, an oil town, a manufacturing center, a tourist paradise...and the oversupply in one city is demand in another.  Is the trading sim as robust as Grand Ages Medieval or any of Gaming Minds' maritime trade sims?  No, but it's not supposed to be.Skylines is the builder I reach for when I'm after a ""classic"" SimCity-like experience.  I go for XL when I want to build something on a bigger scale, more like a nation than a city (in that sense, ""XL"" is an appropriate word for it.  Extra-large, indeed.)As I write this, it's on sale for four bucks.  Anything from about $7 downward is a good value proposition for any game in this series.  It's not as good as Skylines (not much is), but it's still worth playing for what it gets right.			",18,6,0,23,34,1,31

												After the big disappointments the last 2 Sim Cities were this game is just what you need to scratch that city planning/building inch. Once you get the hang of it, and understand how the supply/demand and resources work in this game you are set to do pretty much anything you want. The mode where you can handpick any buildings is the best part IMHO, something I always wished vanilla Sim City 4 had.			",230,38,1,83,30,0,69

												At the time of writing this review I do not yet own Cities XXL or Skylines, so for me, this is the best city builder I have in my collection (which includes Banished, Anno 2070, Cities 2008, Tropico 4, as well as RTS builders like Red Alert 3 and AofE) ... and I love it!The graphics are incredibly beautiful and you can zoom in right up close to the action (like Google Streetview) to capture some amazing screenies of your city. Day or night, it is very entertaining to check out all the wacky goings on of your inhabitants. You can select a car, pedestrian, truck, or train and follow it around the map. Travelling along the train tracks will allow you to explore the world of tunnels and underground stations you have constructed.There's a lot of micro-mangement of all aspects your city (including trade between other players and cities youve built) - some may not like this aspect of the game but I find it quite enjoyable and challenging. This is a massive game with lots to do to keep you entertained for endless hours.There are plenty of gigantic maps and hundreds of buildings to choose from. Additionally, the Cities player community is quite extensive and there are countless mods to help you construct the city of your dreams.I bought this game on special ($15) long before XXL was released. I hear there is little difference between the two games, bar a few bug fixes, performance improvement, and a couple of new buildings. I think if you are on a tight budget and can grab this version on a super sale (say $5) then it is still worth buying if you can't afford Cities XXL.			",48,19,0,7,12,0,7

												Long time player of SC 4 here, heavily modded (keep it mind when reading, I ll be biased in that sense). Also, if anyone is color blind read 2 straight (there is the game breaker).I really, really tried to like Cities XL. I tried it more than 4 different times. I really love city building games but I always felt CXL was unpolished and unfinished. My game breaker were always the same 2. 1- Roads and road layout. I am used to a grid like set up from SC 4, I can admit that. But I was never able to get used to not being able to make at least some consistent griding (it was always off and wouldn't stay stright and parrallel, so in the end I had less building space on one end than in the other). That wasn't that terrible. The REAL ISSUE was that I had to manually demolish each and every building to build a road expansion. And given there was no grid for reference placing was always odd. An avenue would not sit on one side as any 2 gridded element might but in the middle, taking up some space from adjacent building. And given that I had to expand a lot this was a nuisance that meant demolishing huge parts of my town just to fit a small avenue, casuse I had no idea what space it would take. If you are used to superposition building (that is to say, build on top of something else and the game make necessary demolishing) be advised, it won't work. (There is a mod that helps partially with this: you dont need to demolish a road if you want to replace it with another one of the same size, the rest of the issues remain).2- Lack of colorblind-friendly interface. Road traffic is codified in red, green and yellow strips over the roads (changing zoom distance makes it a little bit more clear, not that much). I am color blind, I can tell up to a point the difference between these three colors, but it is really hard for me when the colored area is as small as in some cases is. And there is no easy way to have the camera move to the problematic zone. You have to use the map to navigate using the color scheme I mentioned above. Also, when you click a road stretch you get the info on that specific stretch, including a colored ball with the usage. The ball is completly impossible for me to use but if you hover over it you get (at last) a readable tooltip saying usage in percentage. This a too repetitive task to be so hassle ridden, so each and every time I uninstalled the game and went back to play SC 4 that gets this fixed in some simple steps such as using blue-green-yellow-red for traffic congestion (not perfect but it helps a lot).3- Transportation options are really lacking for any SC player. Check the list, many sensible choices you may want may be missing.Very specific reasons but some may agree they are important. On the up side, farm building is quite fun.			",95,12,2,14,21,2,20

												I can't say I like this game a whole lot. I'll admitt I like the options for laying down zones and roads. What I dont like about this game is all the hand holding and guidance starting a city by telling you exactly what the city needs at all times, locking out utilities and public services. What I really hate about this game is the way resedential zones are split into a class system... last I heard you can live where ever the hell you want if you can pay the rent.

												Owned this game since it first released and was excited for it 2 years prior, following all the developer diaries intently.This game is terrible. it was one of the largest disappointments as an excited Sim City 4 player, even after buying each new version they released after the first.Every version of the game is the same, with an extra bunch of buildings that don't add anything new and unique to the game. The largest overhaul that they brought was probably an interface colour change and that's it. Numerous bugs followed each version, including:Alt tab crashes the game even in windowed or fullscreen windowed modeIncorrect income/expense statsUtility buildings not working at all after being placedAbsolutely stupid traffic issues, like cars not moving at allThere was originally going to be a fantastic and innovative multiplayer system where player's cities would be able to negotiate trade deals for resources and different education leveled people from their cities to fill jobs requiring workers, and players being able to communicate with eachother on a global map screen, seeing the cities expand without having to go through loading screens like the newest SimCity.They quickly attached a Pay to Play wall on it where you paid a minimum of 10 dollars a month to access the multiplayer features, and then removed the multiplayer aspect completely after 2 months of release for the original game.They kept the trade negotiation system however, but you only trade with an AI that has an unlimited amount of resources which you trade for your monthly income, and vice versa with your own resources.The first 3 versions of the game had absolutely no road building assistance if you wanted to make straight roads or squares quickly, and relied completely on the tools and putting a lot of time and effort into it creating straight lines properly.I had very high hopes for a next generation City Building simulation from Focus Home Interactive and this the was complete opposite. Please don't put your money into this franchise.			",437,107,12,52,50,3,54

												Really loved it, untill my city started to grow. I'm pasting this from another review because it puts it perfectly ""Graphics engine is a 32 bit engine not optimized for multi-core. No matter how good your PC is, the game is limited to only using 1 core and up to 4 gigs of ram - 2 gigs by default, editing the config file is needed to crank 4. This means large cities on even the toughest PCs will lag like all hell...""So, unless that'd be solved, I'd not recomend to purchase this game unless is on sale with an aggressive discount.

												Like:Huge lands to build your city.Trading between your cities allowing you to customize your city specialization.Beautiful graphics and ground level action adds scale to your gaming experience.Good bugs, like the vacation resort taking up no vacation land. Concentrate them and your leisure skyrockets!Economy management that goes way beyond other city simulators.Dislike:Horrible memory lag when your cities get real big.Highway system is terrible. Use the large expressway, one-way the roads and build pairs to better your city's traffic control.Bad bugs, like some generated buildings that wont connect to road and the leisure buildings not satisfying the citizen leisure parameter.Overall,A beautiful, broad sweeping city simulator that offers many facets of the genre that other games do not. Quick money generation without age or natural disasters. Buggy as all hell but Cities XXL is the same game with all the bugs fixed. If you dont mind the bugs, this game is the best of the genre.

												A quality game that is worth buying despite it's flaws if you are a city building enthusiast.The MegaStructures are a great feature that encourage you to make numerous cities with varying specialties.KEEP IN MIND: There is a known issue with this game where it slows down over time as well as when your city gets extremely large. This should not be a surprise, however, as a city wth 250,000 citizens with jobs and traffic requires more caculations then an empty lot. That being said, there is some ""work"" that needs to be done to work around a few known issues where the game becomes really slow and choppy when left running for extended periods of time. (A quick google search will resolve those issues.)Also, as with any city game, if you have an older graphics card, a slow processor or a lack of RAM, you will have troubles with a sprawling metropolis of 250,000+ citizens.Though it does lack the ""driving mission"" feature of SimCity 4 Rush Hour, this game is a superior rendition in almost every sense of the word to SC4, is highly moddable, gorgeous looking and comes with a solid sound track to boot. Resource management, city-to-city trade, a very diverse and yet easily managed Supply and Demand system, traffic concerns and the need for things like Holidays, Hotels and Food makes this a more detailed and realistic Sim City without the old technology and feel of Sim City 4 nor the various drawbacks of SimCity 5 (or Origins or whatever the hell they called it.)A great pick up for a city building enthusiast. Coupled with the fact that I got platinum for dirt cheap because I owned CitiesXL 2011, it was a must buy.Suggested Purchase Price: $10 or less.			",161,37,1,54,34,0,43

												A good game, and fun from the very start of gameplay. The tutorials are very good at explaining how to use MOST of the features, however some require some experimentation to be able to master. Overall, a good game, however the optimisation is not the best, and the game can get very slow with framerates when you start to get larger cities. I would say that this game is better than a possible alternative Sim City 2013, of which I have played for a considerable time more than 100 hours. This game has got one way streets, a vast range of landmarks, and a good menu structure, and I would recommend it to all people who like city planning or building simulators. I would give the game a 6.5/10 due to the lack of optimisation overall.			",53,8,7,4,9,0,4

												If you never played City Builder games before this will certainly make you busy for a few hours.  It's not a bad game if you want to try out how some basic mechanisms of these kinds of games works. If you are looking for a more creative stuff though, which has more designing and city structuring elements then It's not for you. Pros: - Nice smooth graphics- Pretty easy interface- The tutorial is quiet good. It really teaches you the basics- The road and housing construction is pretty easy if you're just play the game for economic stuff. Cons: - fps problems- The game itself is buggy- Lack of design tools and the freedom of drawing- No multiplayer			",146,31,4,25,12,2,12

												I wouldn't recommend picking this up.So you get to build a city and all that, sure, but it's outdated in the way that it's old graphics are far too demanding, it's bad that some fixes recommend quitting every hour and then firing up the game. Terrible lag due to poor optimization all in all, and there was also the problem of a memory leak.In the end, I think the recent SimCity might beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this instead.But most of all...Cities XL is boring. It feels like a very 2D city builder, it loses the touch fast.City planning means nothing, can build however you want as long as you have the money in game.There aren't any indepth features, save setting up bus lines and metro lines but they work.And most of all it just keeps demanding you build more and more, and upgrading is a hassle, since all of them are so far apart, it really is a ♥♥♥♥♥ when you want to upgrade your residental and having to figure out with was your uneducated or your skilledhousing.And speaking of unlocking, oho, it is the worst, you get four levels of residental, uneducated, skilled, executive, and elite, these all unlock as the population increases, and all them are so far apart, so despite the fact this game says 'go to Hell' to city planning, you gotta end up planning this, which creates issues.I really don't recommend this, there are much better city builders on Steam, and with the release of Cities XXL, which was XL repackaged, I wouldn't expect anything good from these devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most likely the best city building game ever made!!This game is like all the other Cities XL games.They are stupidly complicated, beautifully designed with some amazing features that really really drag you into the game, and make you feel that what you've created is well worth it.  You use a money cheat in the game, fine... It does not mean anything because the city goes on money coming in and not the money you have, it is super hard to get a proper city going and when you actually get going I bet you will feel amazing because you've physically created something that is well worth it.This is the best city building game ever made and I own ALL the cities XL games, and I wish they added a multiplayer elemant to it.  Not sure how it would work but I would love to see it.Worth it, buy it!			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoy this game. At the time of its conception, Cities XL Platinum was a decently good city builder comparable to SimCity. The huge maps and tiny details were fantastic aspects of a mostly bugged game, however. Frustrating? Yes. Industries are very difficult to balance, not impossible, but nevertheless challenging. Cities XL is not an easy game by any standards, which makes it satisfying to overcome the ingame struggles. Every move requires thought. Expand too fast, your entire economy may just collapse, people will be dissatisfied, and you'll be left with blocks of vacant homes. There is a plethora of selection when it comes to maps. Each having their own resources and physical features that can make or break your soon to be sprawling metropolis. The UI is awfully buggy and quite confusing. There is a bit of a learning curve to be had which is a good thing, in my opinion. I purchased this game years ago for 10 dollars on a Steam sale and I think that was a fair price at the time. However, with newer and more refined city builders like Cities Skylines, there's no use in buying Cities XL, unfortunately. With regret and disappointment, I cannot recommend this. I want to so badly, but it's too filled with bugs and unresolved issues that I simply cannot.~Krystal~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Disclaimer :This game might lag a lot after your city has passed 300'000 inhabitants. I didn't experience this because I stopped to play before that point, as I got enough of the game after 10 hours.Review :Interesting & decent city building, although with less charm than the old Sim City 4 (2003) ; it is however more realistic, as planting a couple of trees between your industrial zone and your residential zone isn't enough to clean the air, so it requires a more thoughtful approach to build a functioning city.But there's a big issue : most companies require high ""quality of life"", but neither the tutorial, the manual nor the in-game heat-maps explain nor show what it is ! Looking on Internet, I found a guy theorizing it was a mix of air pollution and noise nuisance.Nonetheless, I'd still recommend the game if you can get it with a discount (if you check the other reviews, it seems the concurrence is better, but a bit more expensive ;-) ), as it's pleasant enough for a while.Pros :- Decent visuals- Can build non-orthogonal cities- Advanced planning required to build a functional cityCons :- I started to have some slowdown with my city reaching 300'000 inhabitants- Different buildings that do the exact same thing and need to catch the tip during loading to know that- Very perfectible GUI usability ; eg: the road selection always go back to the cheapest road, instead of showing your last selection ; some description text missing ; etc.- In-game Ads for a famous french supermarket chain... :-/- Crashed a couple of times in 10 hours of play- A lot of things lack of clarity, and it can get hard to understand some aspects ; eg: the silo enhancing the farms efficiency requires freight ; but shouldn't it actually create the freight it needs if the roads are there ?- It's hard to build a polyvalent city, as the game is designed to make you create several cities that will trade with each other (and I don't have that kind of time ! ;-) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game for any city building fan that desires to have a more in depth and harder simulation on building an entire world, not just individual cities. In CitiesXL you are intrusted with the task of populating an entire world featuring over 60 city locations (more can be unlocked via mods). The objective of the game is to develop a world where cities work with one (via trading resources) to help sustain each other in the world. You will have cities that produce and export food and industry to cities that produce and export oil and electricity. In the same token, your oil and electricity producing cities will export to your food and industry production cities. It is so in depth that you can set which city exports to which other city, the amount of export that you are providing also can be set. A lot of people consider this game to be dull or lifeless, but that is not so. This game is not for the casual gamer, it is for the hardcore city building gamer who wants a true challenge in building and managing an entire world of cities. For me this is the best city building game in the market. Far better than Sim City even.			",448,143,68,120,123,2,113

												Game is clunky. Upgrading existing stuff is a huge pain, and causes you to delete existing stuff rather then allowing you to upgrade it. Because you need to delete existing stuff, if you're not careful the entire city can get thrown out of balance. The area of effect for the schools and other utilities is really bad. The roads auto-snap is very poor, so even if you try and make a grid layout it gets screwed up. If you try and trade but click a wrong button, the game will instantly detuct an insane amount of trading tokens from you, whichs put you at a huge deficit. This bankrupts most of my cities. Yet the game so relies on trading you have to go into the trade menu, which is hard to read and makes it easy to make mistakes. And the game runs like crap.			",96,9,35,4,25,0,9

												BUY CITIES SKYLINES INSTEADThis game could be great, but it isn'tI bought this a while back for full price and instantly started to like the feel of the game. The layout at first is promising but then unfortunately it is a slippy slope downwards. You start of with huge areas to build cities on, which other games namely sim city could do with looking at. But after that it is mainly negative. The game itself is easy enough to plop things down, but the unlocking and class system is ridiculous. It isn't clearly mapped out who works where, and you spend half of your time trying to make sure a factory is operating normally. The class system could work if it was thought out better. The tourism etc falls in the same plan. The game becomes clunky, and to start with you have to build farms to produce food to eat, these are often out of the way of your peeps and have to be rather large, and it costs a fortune in building the roads to them.I have played this for enough time to say it warrents a thumbs down.My advice......buy cities skylines, it's easier to use, more fun to play, and more importantly it has mods to make the game stand out. the people in the workshop make some truly outstanding mods, and the best of all, you can edit the in game assets yourself to make the game as easy as you like.

												I'm a big fan of city builders - I spent countless hous enjoying Simcity 300, and then 4. Seeing the negativity around the latest Simcity, I was hopeful when trying Cities XL, but it just frustrates me in a lot of little ways. For one, it plays like it's in beta: text on the UI gets cut-off awkwardly, there are weird texturing issues with roads fairly regularly, it feels like it needs more polish. And this is a game that was first released in 2009, and has had 3 re-releases including this one! I've no idea what they've been doing all this time.For all the efforts at making you vary-up your cities, with different resources available in different areas, specialising is difficult - I needed fuel, so decided to start a second city just for that, and found that oil-extraction isn't unlocked until you have a fairly large city built.There was nothing pushing me to expand, and no real consequence to failure. My man city has nowhere near enough power, with -5 electricity tokens, and yet it doesn't really matter, and things carry-on as normal. It's trivial to make a city profitable.I'm also not a fan of the art style - the lighting makes everything quite grey, and it's hard to tell different wealth levels apart. It all just ends-up a bit bland.I'm sure if you're after a game that lets you be creative with building, you'll enjoy it - you can individually decide exactly which building goes where, and the curved roads are nice. But as a game, it's a bit lacking.			",85,64,2,25,44,1,39

												Seems great at the start, until your city surpasses 15 000 people...Game with great graphics and features. You can build a city and trade with neighbouring cities. The map is insanely massive, with natural riches and rivers. Amount of detail is quite good too, with people and cars. Night time view is completely different.When you reach 15 000+ residents, the lag is insane! The game cannot be played at all, even though my PC specs are quite good (GTX 760, H97Gaming3, i5 4690). DO NOT GET THIS GAME. If you want a good city game, see Cities Skylines!			",21,4,2,2,10,0,0

												I'm sorry, but I have a hard time liking this game. I just don't find it fun. It feels clunky, runs choppy, it's the same game as before, and the cities are just not as appealing as they are in other games. It always comes to a point in the game for me when the demand for leisure simply surpasses the amount of money I have, which puts the city out of its misery, and puts me out of mine too.

Take your time, keep yourself a rural farm town, or expand as fast as possible into a buzzing metropolis.Choice is yoursHowever it is very repetitive and unimaginative at timesIt also lacks in any type of real tutorial. There are technologies that are unclear how they work or where they should be placed. You can find the answer but it is cumbersomeThe game locks certain tech based on your population which while good ends up making it feel more like a paint by numbers rather than a dynamic city planning experience. It also makes it quite difficult to lose, as money feels like a non factor in early buildingAlso as another reviewer mentioned, the roads will drive you nuts.

												I was actually expecting this game to be pretty bad considering some of the other reviews I've seen, but it turns out this is one of the best ""city-builder"" games I've come across. It does have its share of bugs but they are not crippling to the point of frustration or unplayability. I was not familiar with this franchise so this is the first ""Cities"" title I've played. I must say that I am impressed. The only major negative fact I can say about this game is that it is a SERIOUS memory hog and will bring a low end machine to its knees! I'm playing on a three year old gaming laptop and things don't get too laggy until my population closes in on 1 million residents. Usually shutting down and restarting gets things running smoothly again. My overall opinion of this game? This is what SimCity SHOULD have been! (EA, take note!)			",16,3,2,6,21,0,21

												Not really platinum, better than SimCity, not City Skylines. Buy this game from other sites with a discount, not worth 19.99 euros.I`m writing this review by comparing Simcity and Cities XL Platinum (yeah not the best deal).Positive- more space for expansion- no dlc`s- no stress with internet connection, Simcity servers some times fails to sync correctly- the street view is way betterAlmost Negative- by default is a single core game and it lags, but there is a workaround for this, found on Game Debate written by Paulo Proenca on 02 August 2011http://www.game-debate.com/news/?news=928&game=Cities%20XL%202011&title=CITIES%20XL%202011%20-%20MULTI-CORE%20SOLUTIONStep 1: Open the task menu. (ctrl+alt+delete)Step 2: Go to the ""Process"" Tab.Step 3: Locate the process ""CitiesXL_2011.exe""Step 4: Press the right button of your mouse and select the option ""Set afinity"".Step 5: Chose only the first core and press ""ok"".Step 6: Do Step 3 again but this time select ALL the cores.Cities XL 2011 should now take advantage of all cores. It's freaky but it works. Happy city building!Notes: This might also work for other games with this bug.Negative- saving the game to steam cloud is a bit slowly.			",105,12,26,16,13,0,10

												Still remember the day I played SimCity 3000's demo. And I bought a PC just because of I did not want to wait SimCity's Mac launch date (which was only 6 months later). And I can easily say this is the best city building game ever.And I had never experienced an annoying bug. Don't look to my time at Steam, I played Cities XL 12 and this probably more than 400 hours. And tell you what, if someone say this game is bugy so don't buy it, then answer einstein, which game we should buy? The other game which 'cities' are smaller than smallest village?  If you have a good pc, you will be ok. Otherwise, it's like you choose to not go to MJ's concert just because there is no beer left at the concert hall, and sit at home, listen some♥♥♥♥♥♥music with♥♥♥♥♥♥beer. What an amazing choice!

												Excellent city builder. The ability to trade resources and specialize your different cities is an interesting touch. There is also a suprisingly large amount of content.Fun game.			",131,27,6,36,30,1,42

												This game is what simcity was supposed to become before that last debacle.It's not wihout its flaws. When your cities start getting large, the game tends to become quite laggy. There's a fix for it (partial fix, anyway) that you can find online, but still, seems like the devs could've sorted that out for us...The towns/cities you make could have a more clearly stated connection, by actual roads and stuff, ala Simcity, rather than the 'implied' ones that are there, but they do connect in terms of economies, resources, etc...As one might expect with a slightly 'smaller' dev, the interface is a little clunky, but it gets the job done.Overall, it's a game that has managed to occupy much of my time. Well done!			",166,45,3,50,35,2,35

												Though it's more about management than about transportation, I felt it's more satisfactory for me, a TTD fan, than CIM2. I convincedly vote for ""yes"". Even though the ""cons"" I listed are more numerous than the ""pros"", most of them aren't truly important.Pros:-Pretty good graphics, especially the zooming part-Comprehensive, lot of variety, many building, much items, wow, such realismCons:-No steam achievements-No steam trading cards-No multiplayer, of any kind-Clunky UI, good thing the tutorials are truly effective-Some of the menus are plain ugly, unpolished and odd-fashioned (like the annoyingly dull blue main menu)-Graphics/rendering engines don't seem to be optimized, so the game might lag at points-Connecting roads, bridges and crossroads (roundabouts) can be sometimes unintuitive and difficult			",500,182,16,58,62,8,89

												Cities XL Platinum, ""developed"" by Focus, is a mix of rather if you would like it, or not. The graphics at times, may look nice, but then, the city look lifeless most of the time. That changes when switched to night mode, as then, it gives it at least a bit of life. The unfinished transportation system is disapointing. The game will lag up and become unplayable, when you hit over 200,000-300,000 people in one city. The game does not focus a lot on actaully the goverment, but more or less building the city it self. It's road system often (to me) unfinished and confusing, like the transportation system is disapointing. I can not really say I wouldn't, or would recommend this game, as it is in the mix.

												Still remember the day I played SimCity 3000's demo. And I bought a PC just because of I did not want to wait SimCity's Mac launch date (which was only 6 months later). And I can easily say this is the best city building game ever.And I had never experienced an annoying bug. Don't look to my time at Steam, I played Cities XL 12 and this probably more than 400 hours. And tell you what, if someone say this game is bugy so don't buy it, then answer einstein, which game we should buy? The other game which 'cities' are smaller than smallest village?  If you have a good pc, you will be ok. Otherwise, it's like you choose to not go to MJ's concert just because there is no beer left at the concert hall, and sit at home, listen some♥♥♥♥♥♥music with♥♥♥♥♥♥beer. What an amazing choice!

												Absolute waste of time. Do not buy this game.It starts out pretty cool, you can build highways, houses, bridges, and right from the start pretty much start making the town the way you want it to look.BUT.Remember those highways that you started out with? You get upgrades as the game progresses. As you build more structures and expand the town into a city, residents complain more and more about traffic congestion. Okay, just remove the old highway you had when you first started out, and replace it with a newer, more-cars-per-minute highway, and that should fix it, right? Wrong. When I tried that, the better highway was too wide, I would have had to remove all structures on both sides, and basically start over to fix the congestion. Guess I could have just built a bit more spread out, but IMO this kind of crap shouldn't be an issue in the first place. Structures should just auto-adjust to whatever highway you're slapping down to replace another.Another issue I had, was that (after deciding to try again after the above happened) I was really trying my best to lay out the city properly, and I'd just kind of stuck my city hall down near the edge of the map so I could go right to planning highways. Then later I tried to move it (and I have been able to on other saves), and for some stupid reason, after it was bulldozed I couldn't place another. Completely froze my game, no one moving in, no one moving out, no complaints that there was no town hall and the city can't fuction (that's what usually pops up when you remove it). I feel stupid that I just completely wasted my time, AGAIN, with this cheaply-made game.You can look up tons upon tons of bugs that exist in this game, and I'm sure there was a workaround for mine (not interested so please don't flame me), but really, just save yourself the frustration and buy something else. It's completely not worth it.			",36,17,0,32,12,0,0

												It's fun, but I can't recommend it.Once you get to the point of managing a huge city, problems appear that are unsolvable. No matter how much leisure buildings you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. No matter how many landfills you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. Sometimes, entire sections of the economy do not develop despite whatever efforts you make. (For example, in a city that had no agricultural area, it was impossible to develop retail that theoretically covers other goods as well, and in another, heavy industry, manufacturing, offices and high tech constantly screamed for more of the others while none were being developed because they wanted the others to be there in the first place.)On the good side, it looks good, is easy to get into and is satisfying until you run into the impossible-to-solve problems.The game has potential, and if tweaked could certainly be a very enjoyable experience, but it ultimately got on my nerves more than anything.

												Almost feels like the Simcity 2013 we've waited for as (many of us have played) SC4 fans.  Much larger maps than SC2013, better gfx than SC4, and plenty of community mods out there (though not anywhere close to what SC4 has).I really was gung-ho into this game... and then that's where the problems started.  What problems?  I don't know, it wouldn't tell me.  It just told me people were unhappy... so I gave them things to do.  Industry wanted offices, but the offices didn't want to build, citing quality of life.  My quality of Life info-graphic in the information overlay panels, said it should have been fine.  I even had a modern-looking industrial park surrounded with parkland like IRL.  I don't know how I could have improved things at this point, so I opened more roads out of town, where it'd allow me to.  I also started trading, exporting goods, figured as with any REAL city that'd spur industrial development and hence income... nope.  It sure made the city some money, most of which went back into funding infrastructure and city utilities like POWER, WATER, and FUEL.  My cities, every one of them, seemed to start to fail at around 890,000 residents.  I provided bus lines when traffic got too bad, that cost a lot of money for my city (as it doesn't provide any income due to bus fares, I found that quite aggrivating and unrealistic by itself).  So I looked into other options, to build alternate roads... that option was out, even with all the park-space I left (up to 20% per development, and reverse-frontage lots didn't save me even with new-residential-construction work in my IRL past) to save space to add in larger roadways.So I looked into other options such as trains and high speed rail... OOPS, THERE ARE NONE.  FAILURE... FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE!  Alternative transportation IS OUR FUTURE!  WHERE IS IT?   There's a subway, but it was telling me I had to knock out any building or park land that occupied it's path, so it was next to useless, having to knock down the whole city to build a subway that there'd be no one left to use it!  That was aggrivating to the point where I gave it the alt-F4 salute and haven't played it since.  It was such a nice breath of fresh air to be free of the simcity 4 grid once and for all, but it does not come without it problems.  There are road mods, highway mods, and other cool things available to help you with this game - even a no pollution mod to help fix some of the quirks that break your cities... but they could do nothing to save me from being traffic'ed to death.  I never hit a million people.  Maybe I just stink at this game, but I came away knowing that while this game will be loved by many, it needs work, a lot of it.  For the price they charge, you should opt for the new XXL version if you don't own this game already, as it's pretty much just a re-build of XL (this game) with a few new features.  Could I recommend this game?  No, no I cant, go get XXL if you don't own this game yet, as it supports multicore (which EVERYONE can use by now, it's 2015).  It's a good game don't get me wrong, but my biggest issue with this game is that I couldn't figure out from what it told me beyond who wanted to move into the city that I should be building housing for, is that what problems needed tackling.  Why is my industry vacating and leaving 50% of it's space empty, and not wishing to build, no matter how far I knock down taxes?  Why are the people truly unhappy?  Why are they unhappy with the commute, it's a CITY, it's going to have congestion, no matter how well you do on it.  I can cram over FOUR MILLION people into a large tile on SC4 (and am quite proud of it), but I can't seem to crack a million on this game without pulling my hair out (and getting lagged out once or twice, but that requires only backing out to world-view and going back in, easy enough and seconds on a modern SSD raid setup).  The new game (XXL) is said to improve on these lag-facets and some of the bugs, while some remain, I'd much rather send you along to the newer XXL version than to spend money on last-year's model (XL, this game).  If you already own this game, XXL is not worth the upgrade unless you're a die-hard that wants multiprocessing and a few other options.  Some of the pros if I haven't listed enough of them are decent size maps (XXL has even larger ones, reportedly), and abilities to build off-the-grid if you want, and blueprints to adhere to if you choose to... My biggest issue with this game is the lack of trains, the lack of high-speed rail, and the difficulty of building a subway system.  I am sure that many people may criticize my feelings about this game... but honestly, while I really want to love this game, the first two dozen hours brought me much pleasure, the last several hours (maybe another dozen), brought me only pain and discomfort I can only liken to a stomach virus.  It takes the fun out of the city-building/management challenge when you're playing blind - not knowing what is killing your city - not knowing what is wrong and how to fix it appropriately before your city vacates.  I want a better excuse than quality of life... that's BS.  Take quality of life out of why my offices won't build where they're needed, and maybe you'll have fixed this game 50%.  I want alternate transportation... THIS ISN'T ROME!  We have trains/bullet trains/monorail/maglev is coming out now... let's look into the future, this is a game, not real life, DEVS - USE YOUR IMAGINATION! Also, When I start my city, or even before, Why can I not make my own map?  Why is the terraforming so limited... it does not even change the gfx of the map overlay (e.g. if you flatten out part of a ravine, it'll still LOOK like a 2d ravine is there even though it's flat)... we want more terraforming options and better map-feature-change feedback.This really IS deep down inside a GOOD GAME, unfortunately, the enjoyment of many is cut short by a lack of good positive feedback, as I might as well be having all the read-outs in GREEK, or be playing a racing game with the monitor off until the race is over.  Focus interactive is on the right track on the new game (XXL), honestly, they're getting better, but the mere fact that to fix this game will require re-doing it from scratch pretty much, I'd hold out and see what lies in store for the future.

												Looking for a game like SimCity 2013 that is just as easy but with more room and bigger maps? Then you better start looking right now for mods for SimCity because this game isn't for you. The Cities XL franchise and series has such great potential‎ to become on of the greatest city building games in the world, possibly outruning SimCity 2013. However the navigation in the game and the complex system in this is just to much. Sadly not very many people know about Cities XL. So what this means is that there really is no helpful tutorial for the game on Youtube or any website. I went through the tutorials (no joke) ten times and I still don't understand 1/4 of the game mechanics or how to create a successful city. No, I'm not terrible at games, but instead of learning from the tutorials, they seemed like they where just telling me a story, rather than focusing on telling the player what to do and why and other ways to do it.  How could this be fixed?1) Add a sandbox mode. Sure, there are the built in cheats, but you are still limited.2) Just make a simple navagation system. AND cleary label stuff like: Heath Services, Police Services, etc.3) Fix the tutorials. Don't make people suffer through a story like that.4) Possibly get rid of a few items, like only 3 classes of people rather than 4 and tell how to get them to stay in the city.5) To much stuff, like luxury items. Just have stuff like parks.6) Better information. I don't know what half of the stuff tells me. ( I guess 4-6 count as #1)Now for the grades.Graphics: 4/10 Crap, nothing more to say. Every thing is fuzzy looking. ConTROLLS: 2/10 Read above.Gameplay: 2/10 Read above.Music: 8/10 Great background musicOverall: 40/100.

												Great game, the simulation engine is much better than simcity to my opinionIt's really suited for beginners, the tutorials are helpful and getting a city running with profit is pretty easy(you can make it difficult yourself for the experienced)It's not like simcity stressing every minute to keep your city running, but you'll build your city in phases and how more your city grows bigger you'll unlock more things and then you'll also need to build mor public services!This game also has much more flexibility than simcity, and you can make your city's the way you like it.Some reviews complain about the GUI, i agree that the looks of the GUI are pretty horrible but it functions! and ingame you won't be annoyed by it as the 3d graphics are pretty decent/But there are some memory leak problems, restarting the game once in 2-3 hours helps to get the fps high again. But it's not  a big dealbreaker as it doesn't happen much			",75,4,2,8,16,1,13

												Ok let me tell the truth about this and Skyline, and Sims. We all Know sims was out for years and made a sequel which many fans loved but most agree that the last one well wasn't up to par what it use to be. However people loved the animations and the graphics. Cities XL I had it since release non steam and I had a crap laptop. But it rank ok till I had a pop. of over a million and then I had performance issues. BUT the SCALE and the stats and that you can build an actual farm and an actual industry, i truly liked. Graphics not so much but the tokens made up for it  A LOT... If you don't know what tokens are and hate the game already then you're an idiot. Skyline is the baby of Sims and XL honestly, HOWEVER the scale of the map/cities on a full built map still is way smaller than XL. Max pop of Skyline is way smaller than XL AND you can't trade between any maps WHICH i find to be ♥♥♥♥ing stupid in Skyline. BASICALLY a non-player driven game which is stupid asf. Skyline graphics compares to sim obviously because the release is about 3 years later so no♥♥♥♥♥♥it's going to look better but the animation/scale/traffic is horrible in Skyline even after mods. So is Skyline the best? Sure... But if you want to get a BIG♥♥♥♥♥city and an actualy realistic city get XL/HOWEVER after 1million pop. Goodluck LOL restart the game it works. Sims looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. Skyline is not the best of Both worlds it just took the ideas and made a decent unfinished graphical, non realistic statistical. For crying out loud i worked for the city finances for a city in the Bay Area, Skyline your policies are♥♥♥♥♥♥ No dogs? lol Come onThis game is worth it just performance can be annyoing OH and YOU CAN BUILD WHEREEVER the ♥♥♥♥ you WANT. ♥♥♥♥ Skyline limitations			",57,5,0,5,9,0,7

 No.. Just, no. Potentially this is an amazing game, a true threat to the hegemony of SimCity on city-building simulators, especially after that last pile of dog-excrement 'Simcity 5'. Apart from some minor imperfections there is just one excruciatingly annoying thing about this game, and that is the lag issue. It starts out alright, maybe a little jittery, but nothing too bad. But when your town starts to get going the lag gets completely out of control. It makes the game utterly unplayable. Stay away from this game! You're better off getting Sim-city 4!!

												I can't run the game but my computer reaches the minimum requieries. i keep getting the error ""Failed to create D3D: Unable to find reqeusted mode (800x600@0)"" i googled it and they said i need to update my drivers, well i my drivers automaticly update and i can run directx 9,10 and 11. i don't see the point why im not able to play this game. is it because i run windows 7 64 bit? since everyone who has the same problem runs 64 bit.I found out what the problem is with this game. dotnetfx is not compatable with 64bit and you need dotnetfx to play the game, as long as this problem stays its for people with 64bit a waste of money!DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE 64BIT!!!

												This game it pains me to say this but it is better in so many ways than Sim City 5. The cities are huge! There are tons and tons of buildings! it would be perfect and had the potential to be better than Sim City 5 but sadly all of their game engines were out of date. Like only running on one core and only up to 3gb so when my city hit one million people. Fraps was picking up four frames. And my computer isnt a toaster. But all in all I would still buy it, this game is a ton of fun if you can get past the lag!			",62,2,2,3,10,0,4

												The main problem with Cities XL is its accessibility; it tells you what to fix in your city rather than how you should go about fixing it. Its difficulty curve is intimidating, almost unforgiving. Yet, behind all of that lies a surprisingly deep and engrossing (albeit repetitive) city managing experience. 7.8/10.

Cities XL has no depth and doesn't give you the fine tuned placement control that is the staple of SimCity/2000/3000/4.Pick up SimCity 4 and install graphics mods.

												I bought this game after playing Sim City 4, and I can't express in words how dissapointing this is compared to Sim City. It doesn't perform well, and the interface I found to be a bit of a kluge. If you are used to Sim City 4, don't buy this game. If you have never played Sim City 4, play this game if you want, but when you get tired of it then move to Sim City 4. After all these years, Sim City 4 is sitll the definitive City building game.Yes, I said Sim City 4, not Sim City 5. SC5 has horrid DRM and small cities, and if there are server problems you can't play your own single player game. Don't buy Sim city 5 - get Sim City 4 instead.			",118,15,5,24,19,2,11

												You can see I recced this game but let me tell you, it was a tougher than average choice.  This game is beautiful.  It is thoughtful and more complex than similar games like simcity.  You can make some amazing cities and there is a vibrant community of modders adding new content to make the game even better.So what's the downside?  The game slows down very badly with larger cities.  It's not that I have an old computer than can't handle modern games.  Nope.  My computer is top tier.  Maybe the games designers got too ambitious.  I don't know the cause.  Some say it's a memory leak and others deny this.  Whatever.  When your city gets up in the millions of people the game will get so slow that it is barely playable.  You can mitigate this a bit with the configuration settings.  Restarting helps also but only temporarily.  Thats the worst problem but it is a major one. So why do I reccomend it?  Becuase despite that crippling fault, this is an excellent game for people who love to build cities and see them work.  If it didn't slow to a crawl when you built your masterwork city of 5 million souls than this game would be, hands down, the best in the genre.			",85,12,0,51,43,0,50

												This is the best city builder game out there. The best thing about it are how big the maps are. I have over 250 hours on this and there is nt much of a story or achievments, I just play it because of how much you can do. They have a good amount of buildings to use and if you want more you may upload your own. mods are easy to get and there are some good ones that make the game even better. YOU MUST GET realistic highway mod because the highways in the game dont give you many options for interchanges and the premade ones take up way too much space.The only real problem with the game is how after a while of playing the game will slow down and get a bit laggy, but this is easly fixed by going to the main menu and back into your game.

												I had high hopes for this game, but feel that it lacks the refinement and ""master's touch"" of the simcity series. It is a fun play.. the graphics and music are quite good.. the simulation quality is great.. but there are just a series of things which are annoying that can't be worked around. The building types are also difficult to discern from each other. Once you have built a rather large city, it's all an anonymous blur, unlike with simcity where various building types really do stand out.I still haven't exactly figured out the trading system. Either it is buggy or just not intiuitive.. If you are a huge fan of city simulators as i am, and are bored with simcity, i would say that this game is worth a try. Otherwise, you may not find it very appealing.			",104,27,2,15,15,0,5

												UI: 7/10Textures 6/10gameplay: 8/10music: 7.5/10Notes: A game that's as much a form of entertainment as it is a medatative art, the game focuses on city building and does not waste time with needless minigames, you are an architect and nothing else and it makes the game a resource managment simulation that actually makes you think longterm.

												It has the basics, It is simple and easy to play, almost too simple, it is in no way different to any city building game i remember,Although there are massive maps, hundreds of buildings, traffic and other problems and the ability to construct several cities across the world.8/10 Good game, but dont buy it when it is at full price			",95,7,2,5,21,3,17

												You can see I recced this game but let me tell you, it was a tougher than average choice.  This game is beautiful.  It is thoughtful and more complex than similar games like simcity.  You can make some amazing cities and there is a vibrant community of modders adding new content to make the game even better.So what's the downside?  The game slows down very badly with larger cities.  It's not that I have an old computer than can't handle modern games.  Nope.  My computer is top tier.  Maybe the games designers got too ambitious.  I don't know the cause.  Some say it's a memory leak and others deny this.  Whatever.  When your city gets up in the millions of people the game will get so slow that it is barely playable.  You can mitigate this a bit with the configuration settings.  Restarting helps also but only temporarily.  Thats the worst problem but it is a major one. So why do I reccomend it?  Becuase despite that crippling fault, this is an excellent game for people who love to build cities and see them work.  If it didn't slow to a crawl when you built your masterwork city of 5 million souls than this game would be, hands down, the best in the genre.			",85,12,0,51,43,0,50

												This is the best city builder game out there. The best thing about it are how big the maps are. I have over 250 hours on this and there is nt much of a story or achievments, I just play it because of how much you can do. They have a good amount of buildings to use and if you want more you may upload your own. mods are easy to get and there are some good ones that make the game even better. YOU MUST GET realistic highway mod because the highways in the game dont give you many options for interchanges and the premade ones take up way too much space.The only real problem with the game is how after a while of playing the game will slow down and get a bit laggy, but this is easly fixed by going to the main menu and back into your game.

												If you like city builders, this is the tour de force.  Forget about Sim City... seriously... forget about it.  Cities XL makes Sim City look like an ancient relic of gaming history instead of a valid contender for the title of City Builder King.  Cities XL is much deeper than Sim ever dreampt of being- with more options, more economic concerns, and a level of interconnectivy betwen your cities that has not been attempted before.  I love this game.That being said, like all city builders, interest in this title does tend to run its course after a few cities, so if I were you I would wait to buy it when it was on sale.  Worth some money, but probably not top dollar as all but the die hard fans will most likely chuck it into the back of their game library after 20-30 hours of gameplay.  Not that that is a bad thing- its always good to have a standby game to return to from time to time and to rediscover in all its glory.			",58,3,0,5,9,0,10

												CitiesXL was given to me as an alternative to Simcity 5. And it did not dissapoint. So now and then I still fire up this game and start to build. The possibilities are enormous, and while the graphics are not as good as Simcity 5, the amount of (micro and macro) managment options and map-size make up for it.Recommended if you love city sims.

												If you like city builders, this is the tour de force.  Forget about Sim City... seriously... forget about it.  Cities XL makes Sim City look like an ancient relic of gaming history instead of a valid contender for the title of City Builder King.  Cities XL is much deeper than Sim ever dreampt of being- with more options, more economic concerns, and a level of interconnectivy betwen your cities that has not been attempted before.  I love this game.That being said, like all city builders, interest in this title does tend to run its course after a few cities, so if I were you I would wait to buy it when it was on sale.  Worth some money, but probably not top dollar as all but the die hard fans will most likely chuck it into the back of their game library after 20-30 hours of gameplay.  Not that that is a bad thing- its always good to have a standby game to return to from time to time and to rediscover in all its glory.			",58,3,0,5,9,0,10

												I'd rate this probably a 3.5-4/5 stars. It's a great game at first but I kinda got frustrated with it after a while with constant traffic flow problems no matter how hard I tried and no matter what different layouts I tried. But, that's mostly my inexperience with city building games. Suffice it to say, I wouldn't hesitate getting this game again assuming you can get a good deal on it (maybe $10-15).

												Reminds me a lot of the Sims and other city simulator type games.It has a lot of things to do in the game. You really have to think about what you're doing before you actually do something because it can effect more than just one thing in a positive or negative way.It has a few spelling errors, but nothing that will subtract from the overall gameplay.

												I absolutely would recommend this game, this game takes a little bit of time to get used to it, the controls and the GUI.

Overall it is the best city builder that i have played since the original simcity for the SNES. Great Game!			",146,7,3,16,27,1,23

												This city sim has a lot going for it: huge city areas, easy of use, great graphics, and you can trade surplusses with other cities you have created on your own world.  Seems to cover all the bases, including a lot that Sim City has notably missed out on.  A very grown-up city sim.The downside is that it runs very slowly as your city gets larger and larger.  This can become a problem as a population booms.  So many calculations per second that even eight-core AMD processors simply can't straighten it out.  It's a programming flaw that has been in the Cities XL series since the beginning, and the programmers haven't sorted it out. (It has nothing to do with your graphic card, as some mislead people might suggest.)  It is still superior to Sim City (a little bit childish, really) even with this downside, and if you're debating which to get, I'd push this your way.  Get both, they're now in the budget section!

												Great city sim game, be prepared for memory leaks due to no more dev support. google fixes to make your experience more enjoyable. despite the faults, fun can be had here, but rather grab it on a sale if you can than normal price.The game is unfinished and suffers memory leaks. Googling will produce measures to alleviate these issues along with quiting to main menu avery 15 minutes to reset the memory leaks. These issues aside, Cities XL is an amazing game that had so much potential to be the best city simulator in existence. It has no competitor due to its complexity (I have not played Sim City, and even so, Cities XL is more 'real' in appearance). I reccomend this slighly 'broken' game. Patience is quite important, but this game can be so rewarding. Sale price is better than full price, grab it if you can.			",48,8,0,4,18,2,7

												  I just want to say that I have been playing Cities XL Platinum for about a week now and have had no issues running or using it whatsoever.  I have a nice system, but not tricked out or fancy.  Quad core, 660 Nvidia card, 8gb RAM and lots of disk space.  I have had a void in my life for a long time because of the lack of Simcity and Emperor  ROTMK type games. Games that were more about building your city and managing it rather than trying to figure out the interface or why you can't get the water pipes or electrical to match up.  I had tried many others like Anno (althought not the latest one) but they never felt right.  I want to work with the city more than I want to learn how to use the interface.  Of course I want lots to do and stats to pay attention to but the combination of building my city myself and seeing it grow on its own is what I really like.  Cities XL Platinum really does that for me.  I will proabably buy the new one now, especially because of the discount.What I like so far:- Many useful tutorials.  However, if you are familiar with this sort of game you will probably only need some of them.-City building itself and placing of zones, etc is very easy to learn and there are lots of choices.- Visually awesome looking with multiple zoom levels.  I especailly like being able to zoom down to ground level to see what my city is really like.  You can even click on a person or car and the camera will just follow them.-Plenty of helpful information about your city in both statistics and graphical overlays so you can make informed choices.  I especially like that the colored, graphical overlays, icons  and so on show up in all the zoom levels so you can check out that information whenever you want. - Overall, very fun and absorbing.  Its easy to get focused in on my little world and lose all track of time.- Very large and dedicated fan base with mucho mods and user content available.What I don't like so far:-  Occasionally it is hard to manipulate the zones or roads for what I want to do.  But that has been getting easier for me as I learn more about how they work and the choices I have.  So I am not worried about it.-  I really have nothing bad to say.I wish that I would have played this a long time ago.			",416,114,7,65,35,1,82

												before we begin, i havent played sim city, so i cant commment on whether or not it is better or worse, so you would have to look at other people's comments. The good:-the graphics are, for the most part, very good, the detail on the water is great, and the map in general is pleasing to the eye when zoomed out to the maximum. i like also the fact that when you look towards the edge of the map, you can see the layers of the earth. it's not a game changer, but it's still nice.-The UI. there are several bars that can expand to show you the full options available and be hidden when unnecessary. this can be quite useful when you have a lot to look at, and dont want all that other crap blocking your view. -i like the fact that there are multiple ways to view your city, with the satndard camera and the postcard view, which helps you see a more....well.... postcard view of your city.  you can also switch the time of day to see what your city would look like at night or watch the sun rise and all that romantic stuff.... this helps add to the feel of reality, that your city is actually a city and not just a random map generator.the map selector is also quite nice as you can filter which type of resource you want to focus on, like food or holidays, and get a description of each. there are also city templates like New York and Hollywood so you can attempt to copy / make your own version of each. the bad:get comfortable because we might be here for a while....-you know how i said that the graphics were good? well thats from a distance. up close, the animations of the people are horrific, and make me want to never go down to street level again. For such a beautiful game, the people, and cars, that they are filled with are more reminiscent of team America puppet dolls than real people.-whilst we are on the subject of up close and personal, when you get down to the ground level of the game, the failures of the game become that much more apparent, to the extent i will have to create another sub level to this review:     1) The buildings. whilst the genral view of the city will be nice, some of the buildings just dont make sense. some are horribly out of place, like a snowy resort in the middle of the desert, whereas some are more of the ""what the f*** inspired you yo do that?"" type. i am spekaing, of course, about the futuristic building that pops up at random, and completely ruins the suburbia feel i had going on. its poorely drawn and makes me think the creators were high when they were designing the game.     2) The landscape. yes i know i said it was nice to look at and yes, it is nice to look at....... from a distance. once you get up close, the ""hills"" become more irregular, and turn out to be weird bumps in the land that you cant build on. seriously, it completely puts me off and since there is never 100% flat land, you'll always find those hideous goosebumps around and about.Another problem i have found about the game and people on youtube have mentioned this aswell, is that when you zoom in on the road, no matter what type or whether or not there is a single car, you will always hear the doppler effect of the cars going past, or the horn being honked at nonexistent drivers, by nonexistent drivers. again a sloppy mistake, but considering the grand scale of the game, it's okay to overlook something like this.something else, however, that everry city builder should have nailed from the beginning, is terraforming. whilst you do have the ability to flatten the landscape, it is expensive and often makes the problem worse, making me wish there was a undo button, which there isn't but would make the game so much better. so i tend not to use that when building. fortunately, the placement of buildings does flatten the landscape somewhat, so that you are building the item on a level area. unfortunately, this doesnt change the landscape around your building, and so i have been left with houses surrounded by huge slopes of earth or a jagged drop to the street. all of which makes you again, consider why the developers havent done something about it. but i am not a developer, so i dont know if thats something that possible to do, only that it's something that needs adressing. once more, there are rather basic things in the game that are missing. for example the notices that appear. whilst helpful at identifying what i need to do like ""more housing for skilled workers"", sometimes its general like ""something is wrong with the hotels"" right okay then . what ? and it wont tell me. and sometimes it starts to tell me what to do, but then runs out of space and cuts of the message half way through. this is one of the most blatant and unforgivable failures, that the developers couldnt be bothered to extend the boxes for one or two lines, and really annoys me. and i dont know if there is any way to see it or im supposed to guess.so you might say: But then why dont you go through the tutorial and find out. i did and i didnt find out and it was nightmarish. the tutorial is a shoddy excuse for  a guide, and left me no better than before. the crap attempts to be funny with their stage directions and childish humour makes me really just want to get stuck in and find out for myself, which is shame becuas that is bloody difficult to do. there are so many complex things to work out like bus networks and trade that i feel arent explained in the tutorial to an acceptable level, leaving me to painstakingly trial and error with cities until i figured out how to make money properly. Conclusion.as odd as it might sound, i actually enjoy the game , with its quirky music and beautiful skies. there arent many citry building agmes out there, so i commend cities xl for attempting to make such a complex one, even if they do fall short in some areas. as far as improvements go, i would like another cities xl game as  i feel there are definite ways they could make an even better game which would be well worth the £14.99 on steam (hint. wait until it's on sale). for example, weather features like rain or cloud, more detailed forests, not just some sporadic woodland.NOTE TO ANYONE NEW TO CITY BUILDERS. IF YOU ARE, LIKE ME, UNFAMILIAR WITH CITY BUILDERS BUT WANT TO TRY THIS OUT, GO FOR IT. IT IS A FUN GAME ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, AND THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE WHO DO  GAMEPLAYS OF IT FOR HELP. KEEP PERSISTING WITH IT, AS IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.hope this helps :)			",18,1,0,2,3,0,7

These issues aside, Cities XL is an amazing game that had so much potential to be the best city simulator in existence. It has no competitor due to its complexity (I have not played Sim City, and even so, Cities XL is more 'real' in appearance). I reccomend this slighly 'broken' game. Patience is quite important, but this game can be so rewarding. Sale price is better than full price, grab it if you can.			",48,8,0,4,18,2,7

												I never played a whole lot of the Sim City games, though I've played a great many like them - personally, I much prefer the style and approach of Cities XL Platinum. It's fairly straightforward and more simplistic (to me at least) while also managing to offer depth and variety. You have some fairly basic goals - keep new citizens coming in, while also offering enough jobs to keep said citizens employed and happy. You'll also need to set up retail shops and various leisure outlets to keep your citizens happy and keep the money flowing in a positive direction. Traffic is also a fairly important factor, as everything needs to be moving smoothly to keep things effecient - this is something you'll need to bear in mind as your planning your city!Of course there is an economical aspect to the game as well. You're given free reign to create new cities all across the globe and trade freely between them, as well as with a rather large - and neutral - corporation. Some regions will be better suited to producing specific resources, thus allowing you to eventually set up trade routes between your cities to quickly speed up progress down the line.All in all this is a really fun game that offers hours upon hours of near-endless entertainment for its listed price.

												before we begin, i havent played sim city, so i cant commment on whether or not it is better or worse, so you would have to look at other people's comments. The good:-the graphics are, for the most part, very good, the detail on the water is great, and the map in general is pleasing to the eye when zoomed out to the maximum. i like also the fact that when you look towards the edge of the map, you can see the layers of the earth. it's not a game changer, but it's still nice.-The UI. there are several bars that can expand to show you the full options available and be hidden when unnecessary. this can be quite useful when you have a lot to look at, and dont want all that other crap blocking your view. -i like the fact that there are multiple ways to view your city, with the satndard camera and the postcard view, which helps you see a more....well.... postcard view of your city.  you can also switch the time of day to see what your city would look like at night or watch the sun rise and all that romantic stuff.... this helps add to the feel of reality, that your city is actually a city and not just a random map generator.the map selector is also quite nice as you can filter which type of resource you want to focus on, like food or holidays, and get a description of each. there are also city templates like New York and Hollywood so you can attempt to copy / make your own version of each. the bad:get comfortable because we might be here for a while....-you know how i said that the graphics were good? well thats from a distance. up close, the animations of the people are horrific, and make me want to never go down to street level again. For such a beautiful game, the people, and cars, that they are filled with are more reminiscent of team America puppet dolls than real people.-whilst we are on the subject of up close and personal, when you get down to the ground level of the game, the failures of the game become that much more apparent, to the extent i will have to create another sub level to this review:     1) The buildings. whilst the genral view of the city will be nice, some of the buildings just dont make sense. some are horribly out of place, like a snowy resort in the middle of the desert, whereas some are more of the ""what the f*** inspired you yo do that?"" type. i am spekaing, of course, about the futuristic building that pops up at random, and completely ruins the suburbia feel i had going on. its poorely drawn and makes me think the creators were high when they were designing the game.     2) The landscape. yes i know i said it was nice to look at and yes, it is nice to look at....... from a distance. once you get up close, the ""hills"" become more irregular, and turn out to be weird bumps in the land that you cant build on. seriously, it completely puts me off and since there is never 100% flat land, you'll always find those hideous goosebumps around and about.Another problem i have found about the game and people on youtube have mentioned this aswell, is that when you zoom in on the road, no matter what type or whether or not there is a single car, you will always hear the doppler effect of the cars going past, or the horn being honked at nonexistent drivers, by nonexistent drivers. again a sloppy mistake, but considering the grand scale of the game, it's okay to overlook something like this.something else, however, that everry city builder should have nailed from the beginning, is terraforming. whilst you do have the ability to flatten the landscape, it is expensive and often makes the problem worse, making me wish there was a undo button, which there isn't but would make the game so much better. so i tend not to use that when building. fortunately, the placement of buildings does flatten the landscape somewhat, so that you are building the item on a level area. unfortunately, this doesnt change the landscape around your building, and so i have been left with houses surrounded by huge slopes of earth or a jagged drop to the street. all of which makes you again, consider why the developers havent done something about it. but i am not a developer, so i dont know if thats something that possible to do, only that it's something that needs adressing. once more, there are rather basic things in the game that are missing. for example the notices that appear. whilst helpful at identifying what i need to do like ""more housing for skilled workers"", sometimes its general like ""something is wrong with the hotels"" right okay then . what ? and it wont tell me. and sometimes it starts to tell me what to do, but then runs out of space and cuts of the message half way through. this is one of the most blatant and unforgivable failures, that the developers couldnt be bothered to extend the boxes for one or two lines, and really annoys me. and i dont know if there is any way to see it or im supposed to guess.so you might say: But then why dont you go through the tutorial and find out. i did and i didnt find out and it was nightmarish. the tutorial is a shoddy excuse for  a guide, and left me no better than before. the crap attempts to be funny with their stage directions and childish humour makes me really just want to get stuck in and find out for myself, which is shame becuas that is bloody difficult to do. there are so many complex things to work out like bus networks and trade that i feel arent explained in the tutorial to an acceptable level, leaving me to painstakingly trial and error with cities until i figured out how to make money properly. Conclusion.as odd as it might sound, i actually enjoy the game , with its quirky music and beautiful skies. there arent many citry building agmes out there, so i commend cities xl for attempting to make such a complex one, even if they do fall short in some areas. as far as improvements go, i would like another cities xl game as  i feel there are definite ways they could make an even better game which would be well worth the £14.99 on steam (hint. wait until it's on sale). for example, weather features like rain or cloud, more detailed forests, not just some sporadic woodland.NOTE TO ANYONE NEW TO CITY BUILDERS. IF YOU ARE, LIKE ME, UNFAMILIAR WITH CITY BUILDERS BUT WANT TO TRY THIS OUT, GO FOR IT. IT IS A FUN GAME ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, AND THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE WHO DO  GAMEPLAYS OF IT FOR HELP. KEEP PERSISTING WITH IT, AS IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.hope this helps :)			",18,1,0,2,3,0,7

												An excellent game and a great alternative to Sim City 2013. I definetly recommend Cities XL - Sim city 2013 its way to childish. Speaking of graphics there's lots of space for improvement but doesn't bother me that much. Kinda reminds me of Anno 2070 and speaking of it makes me apreciate it even more.			",234,42,22,25,29,4,17

												This game provides a lot of freedom for those who like to micro manage their cities. I'm the sort of player who creates a new city everytime I play and everytime, this game has been entertaining.The graphics are quite good, although the colour scheme and icons are a little bland. However, I can't fault the gameplay. I only have one comment to the UI Designers... please redesign your save menus. I have been stung by this twice, and according to online posts, so have others.

It doesn't perform well, and the interface I found to be a bit of a kluge. If you are used to Sim City 4, don't buy this game. If you have never played Sim City 4, play this game if you want, but when you get tired of it then move to Sim City 4. After all these years, Sim City 4 is sitll the definitive City building game.Yes, I said Sim City 4, not Sim City 5. SC5 has horrid DRM and small cities, and if there are server problems you can't play your own single player game. Don't buy Sim city 5 - get Sim City 4 instead.			",118,15,5,24,19,2,11

												I'm just going to compare this directly to sim city 4, next i'm going to get cities skylines and give that a try.What I didn't like:- I can't just rezone an aera to a higher density. It has to be deleted first.- I can't pave over a road with a larger road. It has to be deleted first.- It's somehow my problem if people are bored?- The class zoning system is just dumb.- the delete tool is a fairly large area, you cant just delete a single block.- bridges are a pain.- resource managemnt is annoying, given that I can only build in a few areas cant we assume that the rest has cities capable of producing food, oil, water, etc. Why are my cities limited due to what only I can produce.- all buildings must be on a 2x2 square, cant fit into smaller areas.What I liked:- better graphics.- the ability to design bus routes.I guess my problem is a long series of minor annoyances than any large overarching issue. Alright time to get skylines, ive heard good things.			",17,2,0,0,8,1,8

												I love city builders. This one felt different when I first played it. I was only use to Sim City 4 and previous versions. All the roads in those games where straight and not really as good because they where straight. I enjoyed curving all my roads and bridges. It added more realism to the game instead of just plowing through the world you can actually go more with the terrain. Curve around a hill or just softly turn through soft rolling hills. It was useful to build highways in a loop around my cities. Get this game if you love city builders. Enjoy Cities XL.			",268,54,6,30,35,3,28

												Honestly, it's hard to play and i don't get the concept here. Are we making a city or are we running a democracy? I mean, sure this is fun for people who are good at stratergy games but i don't think you should put it in big leetters that your games better then any other. There are other games out there but this one is sadly just like sim city 4. Stratergy, building, and then alot of hard work tht requires brain function. I don't think the dev's had any idea that this would impact on how it affects the players and they really need to rethink their based platform and their gaming stratergy and niche. Sorry.

												Let's face it; this is quite similar to all the other city games; so there is not really that much to say on the gameplay.I enjoy play this game, because it is extremely simple. You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole  array of buildings.There are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).Gameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.Performances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.City size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.AI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.OVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.6.5 out of 10 for me.

												Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep (appears in most sources as Amenemhat Sobekhotep; now believed to be Sobekhotep I; known as Sobekhotep II in older studies) was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period who reigned for at least three years c. 1800 BC. His chronological position is much debated, Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep being either the founder of the dynasty, in which case he is called Sobekhotep I, or its twentieth ruler, in which case he is called Sobekhotep II. In his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt makes a strong case for Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep as the founder of the dynasty, a hypothesis that is now dominant in Egyptology.[1][3] His tomb was discovered in Abydos in 2013 and was assigned to a king Sobekhotep I in January 2014.

												Cheap version of sim city,didn't see nothing special in this game. Games are addictive this isn't one of them looks nice when you start playing it but gets really borring when you continue playing on. Could compare this game also to Tropico which is just building and getting money of things. Didn't feel to write a review but if someone is wondering to buy the game they could come across my review. My opinion? Don't buy,there are better games then this.			",7,1,1,0,9,1,5

												I originally bought this game because it was on special and it looked interesting – I was not disappointed at all! I expected it to work similar to SimCity, and for the most part of it, it does – but the game-play is completely different...almost better.I've played SimCity on/off over the years, but I tend to get bored with my cities quite quickly. This game on the other hand kept me working on cities much longer than usual.Its a pity I don't have more time to spend playing this game – I really love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tricky, this isn't a ""recommendation""I bought the game, so you don't have to. Cities XL Platinum is essentially a DLC for Cities XL 2011  that includes the 2012 content. Oh, and yes... That's the reason why they give you 85% off if you already own either of the two older version (2011 or 2012) because it's the same exact game, but with added content. Same lag, same engine, same intro, same music, same everything... Just saome added new building, new maps, and what not. My recommendation? AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Why'd I buy it? To prove for myself that for the second time around, they haven't really fixed anything important. They just repackaged the game with a new name and sell it as a whole game with the added new content.			",156,48,3,16,39,2,58

												To be blunt, the UI is best described as clunky; the rendering performance suffers despite there being little action (or content for that matter) on screen and is best avoided.  As a game it would be best described as a fusion of Transport Tycoon and SimCity with CityVille-style ""characters"" to help you - at least in the tutorial - and are there to be pseudo-amusing and give you the help required.  Needless to say they fail at both these things, if only in the execution of the latter.I bought my copy as part of a Humble Bundle where, in effect, it only cost me a the equivalent of a bag of crisps.  At a sale price, it might be of interest to some of you out there and I am of the belief that there is an entertaining game to be had *somewhere* in this, but the money may be better spent on a multipack of crisps instead.

												Cities XL isn't a bad game, in fact, it has done some things much better than Sim City.I think the economics of Cities XL are a lot more advanced and interesting than the economics of Sim City.  However, other things are less inspiring.  Something about Cities XL makes it less fun.  I think its because it is more of a sim and less of a minecraft.  What I mean by that is that in Sim City I can build a massive and beautiful city the way I want and do so fairly quickly.  Cities XL makes you really work for your creations.  My other complaint is performance, on a fairly high-spec PC it still has performance issues.  This isn't any differnet than the Sim City titles that have been released in recent years.At the end of the day, I would rather play my Dos-Box Sim City 2000 I bought from Gog.com.

												Only bought because the latest SimCity looked so♥♥♥♥♥♥ And no, it didn't scrath the itch. Feels like one of those games you can't really lose (unless you really make a mess). The game isn't especially innovative either - just feels very genric of the genre.  Infastructure's the only thing resembling a challenge. Still no biggy - just build more of it, or build outwards to speard the load, or maybe sprinkle some public transport on. The game doesn't get much wrong, but it doesn't much right either. The novelty dies quickly, and if you've watched some 'let's plays' of it on YouTube, you've probably already extracted most of the enjoyment this title has to offer.			",17,2,0,1,17,0,5

												This game is great, XXL is better. I was a long time Sim City fan, there latest games look great but are not much fun to play. I wanted to like like Cities Skylines, I realy did but I find the gameplay mechanics clunky, and it's hard to get a small city going with possitive cashflow.  In Cities XL you don't have this problem, and it's rewarding to make progress and unlock things for your city. This (and XXL) are by far my favorite city sims, this is the modern day sucessor to Sim City 2000 and 3000 that I wanted, and I felt the need to post this because people are always blathering on about how great Cities Skylines is.

												Well if your really in to city builders I would say this games worth about 5-10 bucks because the level of difficulty content and all around expectations should be fairly low.  This game is best for people just getting into city builders not for the more experienced it seemed the trading and lessier centers were the hardest thing to do.  In about 3 hours I managed to have a city of about 300k people and about 300+mil in my first play.  So in summary easy, good for people just getting into city builders, lacks content, and fun but not a great game.Keep in mind I also have 1000+ hours into anno 2070 and the learning curve on that is a lot larger.

												In between SimCity 4 and Skylines, there was Simcity Socities, Simcity 2013, and Cities XLThree times I tried a game from the XL franchise, and three times I felt like I just bought a turd.the game advertises the fancy cities that you'll make, I never got even remotely close to that stage. just doesnt play well			",191,11,3,19,40,2,51

												After playing it for about half an hour, it started to bore me. This is one of those games where it tries and fails to copy simcity (atleast thats how i feel) It all fealt the same, and i think simcity did it better to say the least. If you want to become an city planner, then i recommend it. For those who want to play a game for fun, i don't recommend it. Is it worth 30$? The awnser is a plain no. If its anything less than 10$, for instance on a flash sale or on black friday, it's a game that wont truly dissapoint. Although, a fair warning. This is a game where you need to spend a while on it in order to understand the basics. Its a lot harder than it looks.			",118,12,3,18,34,0,29

												DO NOT buy Cities XL Platinum. I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Firstly, the interface of this game is horrible. They may show you extravagant images over at the screenshot area but those are without the interface. It does not look professional at all. Even the tutorial guide with the in-game characters explaining how the game works, it does not at all seem in the least bit a professional game. The storyline does not even gel well!Secondly, this is a ripoff the good ol' SimCity. I must admit that SimCity 5 that just got released this year has its many flaws that Cities XL Platinum could be much better at (eg. Population issues). However, SimCity has been around since 1989! Do you not realise how much the developers of SimCity have improved the game up till how it is today? I have a feeling Cities XL Platinum is just a unprofessional, fast production and cheap ripoff to point out the flaws of the latest SimCity 5. And in itself, there are many flaws such as weird controls and a lousy interface. What's more, lag increases as more zones are built.Lastly, it's not value for money even at the Autumn Sale. Usual price would be $29.90 which is not at all worth the price for such a lousy game. Now it's $10.19, please don't be enticed to buy it! Get the SimCity 5 instead! Or get SimCity 4!That's all I got to say about this game.			",11,4,0,2,11,0,2

												The Game in this version seems to be totally bugged. My sister has a normale CD-Version that works just fine.The Platinum Version here I couldn't even play 1 hour before I was so annoyed that I deleted the hole game from my hard drive.Examples: - Options button when game starts doesn't work. I wanted to turn off the sound, it was simply impossible, it only worked  after I started the game and used the menü there- World Map buttons for cities didn't work, every time I chose a map it jumped to some rocky map no matter what I chose. Choosing over the list on the side worked, but not even after the city was founded it was possible to start it on the world map.- some buildings are missing in the menü it seems (incinerator wanted some recycling center in the vicinity, but there was no such building in the list, not even after I tried to unlock all buildings with the cheat)....I don't really have any more motivation to write about this game, no idea why this platinum version is so much worse than the normal one.....

Well they were wrong, its not. It might have fairly nice graphics and some ctachy music, but it runs poorly and the controls I find unituitive. The most important thing to me though is that I find this game haS nowhere near the fun that SImCity offers, I dont enjoy playing this game I find it a chore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very unfinished: the GUI is unnavigable, and the information relay within the game is unintuitive and extremely delayed. You will get messages consistently contradicting each other and itself.The overall stability of the game will begin to falter after 30 or so minutes of gameplay - due to a lack of proper coding to make calls to the operating system to reserve memory for the game.It is broken beyond practical compensation (you would need to consider having competent technical skills in order to make this game work for you.).

												This game is flawed. It is better than Sim City 4 in many ways, but it is flawed in that it was built many years ago for single core systems. The main thread of the game handles most everything and becomes overwhelmed with you city gets to be about 1/3 the size of a city's maximum footprint. It doesn't matter how many cores, how much RAM, or what kind of video card you have. Everything is bottlenecked by the single game thread which will max out a single core and bring the game down to an unplayable single digit frames per second.If it wasn't for this one show stopper issue, I would recommend this over Sim City. It is a shame they don't rewrite their game engine to work with multiple cores.			",204,31,2,44,94,2,146

												Nice Builder sim, but nothing ""XL"".You either like builder sims or you don't. This is less about being a challenge as letting you scratch an itch to design somehting. Yes, there's challenges and limits, but overall this is more sim than game.The problem is that as soon as you get to a decent sized city, not even a big one, the engine can't handle it anymore. It's not a function of how big and beefy your machine is, the game just doesn't scale up. If you like playing with small towns, this is ok, but ""XL"" apparently does not stand for ""eXtra Large"" in their parlance. I've had cities start to get too laggy to play using only about 1/8th of available space on the map, and any machine I've tried it on has been way past recommended specs.It's a shame that a genre with so many people interested in it basically has no viable product.

												I bought Cities XL 2012 when it first came out. I didn't have a beast pc, just a basic office one from Wal-Mart. I used to play this for hours on end(lag only occuring past 15k population). After I changed accounts, I recently came back to my old account to find out I got the Platinum version for free, which was nice. In my eyes, XL Platinum is a very decent city building game. I mostly just play it with the KIWI MONEY BANK LITE mod so I can make my cities however I want without worrying about money. Sure the game has really bad optimization, I was always closing and restarting the game every half house because at least that made it less laggy. There's always mods for better roads/intersections/light effects.Basically, I would recommend this game:- if you just want to build a city without actually trying to manage it.- if it is with mods- if you don't care about restarting the game every 30 minutes to reduce lag- just to ♥♥♥♥ around in. You probably are better off buying Cities Skylines instead. I've yet to purchase it. Not the best review but BUILD ON!			",29,0,0,1,4,0,2

												Meh, It's pretty clunky and get's boring very fast. I love my city building games but this one is far to difficult to manage. It's hard to keep up with demand and as far as I know you can't easily replace roads with larger highways to deviate from traffic congestion which is extremely frustrating. Graphics are amazing and the idea is solid but they have A LOT of things to improve on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming from SimCity I was expecting great things from all those people that hate the new game. Lots of them praise this game and say its better than SimCity. Well they were wrong, its not. It might have fairly nice graphics and some ctachy music, but it runs poorly and the controls I find unituitive. The most important thing to me though is that I find this game haS nowhere near the fun that SImCity offers, I dont enjoy playing this game I find it a chore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very unfinished: the GUI is unnavigable, and the information relay within the game is unintuitive and extremely delayed. You will get messages consistently contradicting each other and itself.The overall stability of the game will begin to falter after 30 or so minutes of gameplay - due to a lack of proper coding to make calls to the operating system to reserve memory for the game.It is broken beyond practical compensation (you would need to consider having competent technical skills in order to make this game work for you.).

												This game is flawed. It is better than Sim City 4 in many ways, but it is flawed in that it was built many years ago for single core systems. The main thread of the game handles most everything and becomes overwhelmed with you city gets to be about 1/3 the size of a city's maximum footprint. It doesn't matter how many cores, how much RAM, or what kind of video card you have. Everything is bottlenecked by the single game thread which will max out a single core and bring the game down to an unplayable single digit frames per second.If it wasn't for this one show stopper issue, I would recommend this over Sim City. It is a shame they don't rewrite their game engine to work with multiple cores.			",204,31,2,44,94,2,146

												Nice Builder sim, but nothing ""XL"".You either like builder sims or you don't. This is less about being a challenge as letting you scratch an itch to design somehting. Yes, there's challenges and limits, but overall this is more sim than game.The problem is that as soon as you get to a decent sized city, not even a big one, the engine can't handle it anymore. It's not a function of how big and beefy your machine is, the game just doesn't scale up. If you like playing with small towns, this is ok, but ""XL"" apparently does not stand for ""eXtra Large"" in their parlance. I've had cities start to get too laggy to play using only about 1/8th of available space on the map, and any machine I've tried it on has been way past recommended specs.It's a shame that a genre with so many people interested in it basically has no viable product.

												Theres a lot going for this game. A lot more freedom and choices with the location and buildings. More natural road construction, the use of roads that automatically build themselves is wonderful. But the User Interface, good lord the UI. The trading system is one of the most confusing things I have ever encountered. You can only trade with cities that you have so be prepared to have a lot of save files. And you can't trade with cities in the red, so if one of your cities isn't doing so well, you can't trade anything with them. I wish I could say I could over look it, but I can't. It's just too awful and unnessecarly confusing. If the trading system left and the money system was like SimCity, I would recommend this game, but I can't right now, if ever. If you were looking for an alternative to SimCity, look elsewere. This isn't it. I regret buying it.			",95,16,1,15,17,0,8

												Needs improvement. For now, I think world graphics are great, but the game has too much interface bugs and needs polishing. Story is kind of lame. Soundtrack is a strong suit. Also, the game crashed on my first city. It is not very different from other city simulation games. However, sometimes is hard to know what to do. Maybe the learning curve is a bit longer than I expected. Anyway, I do not recommend the way it is now. Perhaps the next one is good.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Interface: 3/10Story: 3/10Fun: 4/10Average: 5,2/10			",104,63,3,21,25,5,42

												I had played this game for maybe a month and I loved it. The cities that you could build were amazing and massive. Sure there were some issues to start but I could work around them. I have always really enjoyed city simulators and have played Simcity 4 for many years and have played a lot of Simcity 5. So as I was saying, this game was starting out really well for me, but then it stopped working. I have read every forum out there and have spent a year trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with it. I have now come to the conclussion that Cities XL is broken and a complete waste of my money. I have followed every step on the forums to fix it and there has been no change. So until Focus Entertainment can get things together and come out with a working version that wont crash and waste your money, I will be saying goodbye to Cities XL, possibly forever. If you are looking for a city simulator stick with Simcity or I have heard that the City Skylines game is fantastic so you may want to give that a shot, which is what I plan on doing.
