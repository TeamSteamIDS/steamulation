												It is an interesting and challenging game... Can't explain it really... I recommend all the Build-A-Lot series! I have played only 2 and 3 but I know 'cause I have seen how Build-A-Lot 4 and Build-A-Lot 1 are. They are as awesome as the others. So I recommend buyng the whole bundle.			",76,7,0,1,8,1,3
