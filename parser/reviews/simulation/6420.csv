												If someone would ask me ""Is this a good game?"", my answer would be: ""Well, ... itÂ´s how the big boys do battle!"" You dont know what im talking about? If you should play this game, you will. :)Imagine this: You are the Captain of a Heavy Cruiser. You are in a space fight. Its your ship against two others. The difference: Your ship is not very manoeuvrable. Its a large vessel. The term ""Heavy"" is no coincidence.The two enemies are smaller, Less powerfull, but more manoeuvrable. So, Captain! Give some orders! What are we going to do? You decide to go straight in. Shields up, Weapons up! Give them everything we got! After a short time, you will realise, that this may not be very effective. Well, Captain. We need a new plan. Decide! ""Plan B:First, we are using our lasers! Target for their shield device. Without shields, they are helpless.""Here we go. We are firing. First hit. Second hit. Minor damage to their shield device. Looks good. Then, our lasers stop firing. Why? Because, as mentioned, the enemies are more manoeuvrable than we are. They got behind your ship. And they keep firing. (Note: The good thing is, you dont have to press any buttons to turn your ship around. Your ship will do this for you. Tell the ship where to go, and it will do so. Because if you would also have to navigate while fighting, this would turn into a mess ..... unless you are George Takei) But here we go. Your Ship-AI activates your thrusters (Yes, you can see them doing so and it looks great). Your ship turns around. Target in front of us. First hit. Second hit. Third hit. Your lasers keep firing! HAHAHA! TAKE THIS YOU B*******!  What?...... no damage?  Why? Well, the enemy ship did just turn around. The shield device is located at the top. Your lasers DID hit the target, but the wrong side. The lasers have no effect on the Hull and there is no shield device at the rear of that vessel. The enemies keep firing. ""To Hell with them! Launch the Fighter Squadron!"" ""But Sir, they .....""""ATTACK!"" (Note: Fighters and Bombers are very effective in destroying devices. And they are fast. Rotation of enemy ships does not bother them) Your fighters are going in. ""They wont know what hit them!""Well .... your Officer tried to warn you. They have a laser flak system. Perfect for ........AI Voice: ""Fighter Squadron lost!"" Did i mention, that the enemies kept firing? Now you may say: ""What kind of idiot would do that?"" I would say: ""Vice-Admiral Norbank!"" :) You will see. There are a lot of things that can go wrong. Most of the time, it is your fault. But you will learn from your mistakes.After reloading, you will take down their flak and launch your fighters, or you will focus on their engines so that they wont be able to outmanoeuvre you. Shields of the first ship are down? Let your laser aim for the devices of the second ship and activate your hull damaging weapons to finish the first one. There are a lot of possibilities.There are situations, when you need a lot of patience. Even when flying trough space. Your ships wont charge in an instant after you gave the ""Move"" command! They are Heavy Cruisers with Fusion Engines! What do you expect?It will take two seconds to heat up, then your ship will start moving. Simple rule: The bigger they are, the slower they move. Last words: The Mission ""The Fight for Earth"" was one of the most entertaining missions i have ever played in a Space-Sim. And it was one of the hardest missions in this game. (Dont worry, you WILL restart the mission if you play it for the first time)Advice: Dont start with the highest difficulty level. You wont stand a chance. My opinion: Yes! It is a good game. I had a lot of fun playing it. It is not a perfect game but it has many good moments, it is entertaining (very important for a game) and it has an awesome ""Final"" Battle.Therefore: 6.5 out of 10.

												I came across Nexus - The Jupiter Incident while searching for a game that would give me the feeling of commanding a capital ship in space battles that I used to enjoy in Star Trek Online before that game became the treadmill grinder it is today.  I can honestly say that this game nails capital ship combat, far better than any game I have played before.Ship maneuvering feels solid.  It feels like you are actually commanding a ship with mass, and not something like a fighter.  Don't expect to be moving fast or nimbly.  A great touch is the fact the game designers put a lot of though in the design of the ships, putting breaking engines in front as well as smaller engines around the ships that fire when the ship is adjusting course or holding position.  It's nice to see a game where ships actually follow the laws of physics and don't just stop like someone pressed on the brake.Because of the pace of the ships, this game is a lot more focused on tactics than other strategy games.  You have to really pay attention to your mission onjectives and thus ship loadouts, as picking the wrong setup can lead to mission failure easily.  There is a learning curve due to the level of complexity in targeting and ship management, but it is not intimidating.A bonus with this game is that is moddable, so if you wish you can command a Battlestar or even one of the destroyers from Babylon 5.  I would recommend playing the vanilla game through first before trying out the mods.  If you are really into tactical strategy games involving capital ships, you can't go wrong picking this title up.  Casual fans of RTS games may want to wait until it is on sale though because the learning curve may frustrate some.			",78,14,0,14,18,0,24

												A rollicking good 25 hour space opera. The tactical battles are difficult but fun and upgrading your ships with new goodies is gratifying. It's even fun to hate Admiral Norbank, who has got to be one of the biggest asses ever put into a video game. The gameplay is unique in that you have a relatively small fleet of large, powerful capital ships that do not maneuver quickly and have multiple weapon systems. They have a weight to them that feels awesome.There are a lot of tools available for modding the game but precious little has been done with them... not sure why. I got the game for $2.49, figuring for that price I could hardly go wrong. I was completely stunned at what I got and I can't figure out how I managed to miss this gem. Even if it isn't on sale it's worth every penny. If you like Sins of a Solar Empire or Homeworld then I can't imagine how you wouldn't like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. Oh... and the Angelwing is simply an awesome craft that you can hardly help getting attached to.I've seen a lot of bad reviews that complained that the game wouldn't run or that it crashed a lot. I'm not sure what their issue is but I can say that Nexus ran fine on my system (Windows 7, Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU) and I never crashed once while playing. On my original playthrough, the game lost some key bindings when I alt-tabbed out and it didn't have any Steam Integration, so I couldn't use shift-tab to access messages and whatnot. I also had to create my own desktop shortcut, as the game wouldn't run via the Steam generated desktop shortcut. The in-game videos also ran choppy from time to time, which was odd. ALL of this has been fixed with a recent update. Current generation resolutions are supported, it has Steam Integration, and the videos now run smooth as silk, though they are somewhat low res when compared to gameplay resolutions of 1920x1080 or higher. The game always looked good but now it looks better than ever! I'm finding myself just as captivated with the story, visuals, and gameplay on my second playthrough as when I first played it. Simply astonishing! If you have been on the fence about getting Nexus, don't wait another moment.Hint: Read the manual. It won't take long, as the information is very concise, but there are some nuances to successful navigation (how to create your own navigation points), using all your weapons (how to attack multiple targets at once), and managing systems that you won't get from the in-game advice popups.  :)			",27,14,0,12,6,0,9

												Great and intense space battles with cruisers, destroyers, fighter carriers and other heavy class battleships.  Real time with pause -gameplay works ok and reminds me of old Interplay classic game ""Star Trek: Starfleet Command"". During a battle, various weapons and resources play differing roles. Lasers and other beam weapons are used mainly for disabling enemy devices. Large missiles are slow and can be shot down with small fighters or FLAK-systems but have massive blast radius. Gatling guns, rail guns, plasma weapons and torpedoes are for hull destruction. Energy bombs are used for anti-shield purposes. Weapon power generators. Sensor arrays for detecting enemy equipment, ECM systems, ECCM systems!! And your battleship can hold few squadrons of small fighters, bombers, gunboats (or shuttles packed with space marine commando teams).Visually game still looks very good after all of these years! The game difficulty can be pretty frustrating.. Even beginner difficulty level is really hard. Players who donât manage their fleets very carefully are going to find themselves in pretty terrible situations, fast and brutal!Some useful keyboard shortcuts (not explained in tutorial mode during first missions):[ N ] - Yes! You actually can create custom NAV points![ S ] - Select all fighters and other smaller craft.[ A ] - Select all large ships.[ CTRL ] + [ S ] - Select all fighters from selected large ship.[ M ] - Manual control panel on or off. [ R ] - Repair panel on or off.

												This is one of the games you can refer to as a hidden gem, largely ignored but actually quite incredible, which is a terrible shame. Metacritics and the score is mainly bashed down due to the learning curve and massive technical aspects.Mission briefings give you fully explorable solar systems, with impressive lighting looking akin to something from KSP.Ship explosions look really good, there's no magically disappearing models, and they even launch escape pods.The ships can be disabled as well and proceed to drift in space (but can still be destroyed)Ship systems are fully modular, which is a crucial aspect of the game campaign, these systems can be targeted and disabled as well. (shoot all engines and the ship stops).Ship movement looks far more real and is far, far less arcade like than the vast majority of mass produced space RTS you find today, they even have small directional engines on board that are fired when the ships turn.The learning curve is indeed very steep, but if you can overcome the vast technical aspects the game offers you'll find yourself a space combat RTS which is Homeworld tier good, it really is worth a try, and this is a game from 2004.

												Wow. Well, I don't even know where to start with this game. I first played it when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it right away. The game is difficult, so at that time with hardly any experience in the field I got stuck pretty early in the game, specifically the scout ship mission.Boy was I in for a ride 7 years later. Everything is just the way I remembered it. Controls are a bit rough around the edges, but it is what would be expected of battleships. Aside from that and a slightly flawed AI, there is nothing I can't recommend in this game to those who love sci-fi. The story is well laid out, no particular flaws. Battles are sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, harsh and unfair, and I can't even start explaining the frustration in the last battle mission (Not to be confounded with the last mission).Yet here I am, 14.5 hours into the game, finishing it for the first time. There are no words to describe my satisfaction, along with my sadness of it ending and the dismay of not ever being able to see a sequel to this magnificent masterwork.As a note to the developers, who might never read this review, thank you for such a great game. It's an element which shaped my imagination beyond most books. Definitely placed along my all time top 5.			",128,12,1,15,23,2,56

												it is a classic one, a real classic. I first stumbled on it was few months after its release.i bought the original CD pack & played for some time but due to having a low performance pc, it soon get abandoned.then only few months ago destiny has brought me to it again in Steam.i was really surprised that after such long years it's still available. so without any further thinking i bought & installed into my new pc. It was a superb game back in 2005 when i still have the CD pack & it still is a great game now in 2015.i spent hours & days on it, offline mode. It's awesome, the gameplay, the story, the designs of the ships etc etc.it's simply the best game i've played in its category.			",25,2,0,1,9,0,14

												Everything i wanted from a space combat game. THe story is surprisingly enthralling and the combat can be, while difficult to master, quite precise. I enjoy the pause feature allowing for a far more tactical approach to combat. I havent played the MP but if the quality of the single player is anything to go off of i would highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to scratch the space combat/sim itch. Think Empire at War's space combat meets the strategic free space movement of EVE...			",99,18,0,27,9,0,35

												The best tactical space battle sim/game out thereYou have control over all systems in the ship!Here comes a long paragraph you should readThe ship behaves like it would in real life if it existed, the thrusters fire and it accelerates to its cruise speed, it even overshoots a bit then cuts the thrusters and uses reverse thrusters to slow down THEN re-engages the forwards thruster to maintaine cruise. When the ship is trying to manuevar around and obtsacle or around an enemy you wil clearly see it firing its reaction control thrusters to spin it or strafe around. The greatest part is if you install auxiliary engines like deflection engines or combat drives then the ship uses main thrusters to get close to the enemy and engages the combat drive and you see it spinnign and dancing around the enemy to make it impossible for them to target specific devices of your all thr while destroying what ever system you have targeted with its own weapon. I like being able to decide what kind of ship I want to fly, for example I can set it up to be deivce killer, get close and knock out there weapon generators and shields with my lasers and bombard them with torpedoes or fit it with bubble energy shells which drains shields then destroy the hull with either torpedoes or mass drivers. If you want to be a badâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥you can equip battleship grade weapons on you little ship like long range CRISIS energy torpedos which (if they hit) will utterly destroy the enemies shields (they can be dodged easily if the enemy has a combat drive equipped), after dropping the enemies shields launch some BIG BANG EM missiles and watch as the brightest explosion you've ever seen destroyes there hull (if their flak system didnt shoot down the missile). Most later missions you get some small ships with a torpedo boat and ofcourse your own unique flag ship, you get to allocated resource points for each ship being able to decide what each will focus on, you could for exmaple have the small quick and agile ships focus on taking down devices like shields and weapons of an enemy with lasers which bypass shields so your torpedo boat can come in and annihalate them or have all of your ships work in unison to bombard their shields with energy shells after which they, in unison, wreck the hulls with mass drivers. I've literraly been playing this game since 2004 and have never gotten tired of it, even with online being down. Its just so good, theres nothign else which comes close to the realism of the zero-g physics which you will clearly see. Theres no game out there that has the cinematic feel this one does, you just sit there as these large capital ships lumber around slowly firing thrusters left and right trying to maneuver around each other to get the best firing position, you will never see any other game that has the same shield ddynamics this one has, a projectile comes towards you and it just smashes in to your bubble shield, the shield reacts, you see magnetic distortion in it as it stabalizes then dissapears and recharges. You wanna be faster? just allocate more power to the engines, you want shields to recharge faster? just give em more power, wait your out of stored energy? turn off support systems and your engines and let the storage batteries recharge. I've played this game dozens of times, and will play it more and more, its just sad that nexus 2 never got the funding it sohuld have, maybe the creators waited to long to bring it back... Only a select few know about this game, shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Just WOW!I all ready lost hope that I would ever use this words ever but here it is. NEXUS is the best tactical space combat strategy game I EVER played. Yes it has couple of bugs and there are thing or two that they could make better but as concept and following execution of that concept just WOW. So let me put it together for you. You are commander of group of capital ships (from one up to ten) starting from corvets all the way to battle cruisers. You do not produce you do not collect resources or any of that crap. You have your little fleet and task front of you. Now that seem pretty dull when you say it but once you get trough the controls (strongly sugget to play tutorial) you find out that you can control each subsystem of each ship and that is freeking awesome!Having limited resouces (means ships) giving this game completly diferent dimension. You will think twice to send your destroyer class against two frigates only to see it blown up. There are no reinforcements there is no help comming and in freezing cold of space noone will hear you scream. You will learn to utilitaze your power creating diversions and new strategies depending from ship to ship. And you will cheer your self for every mauver that put you one step closer to victory.Now as I did finish all the praises there are as usual some problems as well. Tutorial is ok but still suck. Learnig curve is so steap it puts 90degree angle to shame and menu with hud is ...... well bit chaotic. Graphics are Ok but keep in mind that this was made 2004.Frankly I still dont understand why the sequel did not come to live or why someone didnt made remake of this beutiful game.All and all I would sumarise like this. If you like Kerbal space program this is for you, if you like tactical games with anal attention to detail like men of war this is for you, if you like capital ship battles and your secret dream is to be like Commander Bill ""Husker"" Adama and have your own Battlestar this is for you. If by any chance are so mentaly damaged like me and like all those things you will be in heaven I can promise you that.Verdict as fan 10/10Verdict as objective player 8.5/10			",166,30,5,22,23,0,17

												Nexus The Jupiter Incident is one of those games that you wish had gotten popular simply because it deserves a sequel and copycats. It is a stunningly atmospheric game with highly complex, yet easy to use space combat. It is a Space Opera in the truest sense of the word.You start the as spaceship captain Marcus Cromwell in command of the Stiletto out on the fringes of the solar system on patrol. Things quickly pick up speed however as aliens, wormholes and other outside forces conspire to put you smack dab in the middle of an epic conflict between various hostile alien armadas and a lost remnant of humanity. As you progress through the game your own fleet grows in size and power, new characters join your side and you will often get little role playing elements in the missions letting your chose how to proceed.Although from the outside Nexus might look like a classic space RTS in the same vein as the Homeworld games the similarities are limited. In Nexus you command a small flotilla, each ship is named and upgradeable. Should one of your ships be destroyed it will be gone for good and you will be that much weaker in missions ahead. You progress through a series of linear missions, each one putting your fleet in a small area of space with primary and secondary tasks to complete. To accomplish this you must use your fleet and their abilities as best you can. Each ship having a number of different controls allowing you to maximize it's efficiency by directing power to various systems, commanding fighters, bombers and gunships, or using various different weapons when appropriate.In terms of difficulty Nexus provides a somewhat uneven experience, although most of the missions that involved fighting are balanced and challenging the ones that involved stealth tends to be nothing more than an exercise in frustration leaving you reloading your save game repeatedly until you get it right.Graphically the game is absolutely stunning. Space has never looked this beautiful, from the asteroids you pass by to the ripples in your shields when they get struck everything in this game oozes atmosphere. In terms of sound Nexus is a very quiet game which only adds to the immersion and experience of silent space although a good soundtrack playing on your stereo whenever you boot up this game is something I can only recommend.Some bugs and the lack of anyone playing the multi-player, even at release, are the only other negatives I can think of. A decent selection of pretty high quality mods greatly extends the life expectancy of this game.All in all, Nexus The Jupiter Incident is what you want from a tactical space opera, it hits on almost every mark short of the multi-player aspects and provides an absolutely stellar experience filled to the rim with atmosphere and tense space battles.

												AN ONE of a KIND... An almost REAL Capital Ship Simulator!I played this game when it really came out. I was impressed. The idea has NOT been bypassed yet.But let's take things from the start. With what you could compare this game... Star Trek Starfleet Command, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Star Trek: Legacy or Homeworld series? NONE of them.What you'll see in this game. Capital ships fighting each other in most cases. There are 6 races in the game: The Vardrags, the Ghosts, the Gorgs, the Raptors, Humans and the Locust. Each one with different ships, classes of ships and they are many and their own weapons and technologies. When you go on a battle you have to configure every ship.A ship has power source(Reactor), two or three engines(travel engine,secondary engine and combat engine),pairs of weapons on each side,shield, ECM and ECCM modules,fighters and commandos slots, extra batteries that refill from the core extra power supply,individual distribution of energy to every system.The idea... Yes... We've seen many movies and some of us played many sci-fi games. We've seen pilots that can see the space through some kind of glass and guidance of the ship directly. Lies... Those are not going to happen in space battles. Only cameras can give a line of sight, radars and when a ship is in combat in many cases is its computer that decides how to move, because it's faster. But don't worry. You'll see the ships from outside. The ships as presaid have pairs of weapons in each side able to fire in 180 degrees in each axis. The ships have many subsystems as I said upper. Every ship turns itself around itself hiding its subsystems and turning every gun to the opponent until the other one is loaded again. That's why the ships computer does control the ship in automatic mode. At the same time every ship tries to keep a good distance to the opponent for no collision and to shoot at him where it needs.EVERY ship has 4 Modes of reacting.    -The complete auto mode that is the main mode. In this stasis the ship completely automates everything. It does NOT overeact to make a difference and it is based completely to the ships main configurations. The ship will try to attack an enemy with all the weapons NEEDED.   -The fighting one that delivers the most power to the weapons. Like the Auto mode but it will fire with every weapon possible and maybe overload the weapons so to fire quicker.   -The Defensive or Guarding mode delivers more power to shield and engines, so the ship can hold. Only NEEDED weapons will fire in EVERY target.ALL THE UPPER MODES WILL FIRE A DIFFERENT TARGET ONLY WITHIN RANGE AND ONLY IF A WEAPON IS LOADED AND THE MAIN TARGET IS NOT AVAILABLE. YOUR SHIPS SHIELDS WILL BE LOWERED AFTER THE BATTLE AND IF OTHER SHIPS ARE IN GREAT DISTANCE. THEY WILL BE RAISED AGAIN IN SOME DISTANCE BEFORE AN OPPONENT.This is extremely bad in some situations because they need time to recharge in FULL capacity.   -The MANUAL mode. This will be the permanent mode when you'll play a bit. Believe me there is NO other way. You can aim every target individually within distance, enable or disable every system and overload whatever you want.(Overloading systems make them more efficient but they drain the batteries or make other systems work lower or none at all. If there is NOT enough power it will be automatically set to normal for the ship to work. Take EXTREMELY CARE with this function. It makes the difference in battle but sometimes you may lose if your ship fails you)You will be able to make priorities in system repairs if a system have been disabled in this mode.There are 3 different types of weapons   - Energy weapons are the MOST used in every ship. The most of them are Shield Disablers but there are some Hull Destruction weapons too. They have unlimited power that comes from the ships Core. The usage distance is low.   - Ammo or Missile weapons are limited and are HULL destructive. Not usable with opponent's shields ON. Usage distance low too.   - Artillery weapons. High Explosive weapons that are LIMITED and can damage HULL even through opponent's shields but NOT much. It is about the ship class too. Completely destructive if the opponent's shields are down. Usage distance GREAT so don't wait a ship to fire artillery next to the opponent. It will try to make a GREAT distance first.  Customization of a ship is important. Every ship dependant of its class has several slots for enything. Maybe can have two power cores if the first fails or destroyed, two or three engines, several pairs of weapons ,batteries and special slots. You have to know what you'll use the ship before you configure it. It depends on the way you play too.  Generally, the large ships configuration has shield disablers and ammo and artillery weapons. Because of the great mass and the limited movement of theirs they'll try destroy the opponent instantly. They also have great HULL and shields. But because of their great mass and limited movement their subsystems are totally exposed to smaller ships and maybe fighters.  So small ships those fighters and commando ships but if the ship has no flak weapons to destroy them automatically they can be the success in a battle. Flaks are also destroy missiles, bombs, torpedoes and generally artillery weapons. It's a MUST to have at LEAST a pair in every ship.  Smaller ships like frigates have better movement but are weaker in MASS, shields, in the amount of weapons and  destructive power. Though they are much valuable.Imagine a frigate with a very strong energy core and great engines. You'll see that it will dance all over the opponent without him being able to destroy it, while the frigate will aim directly to the subsystems. Imagine now a large ship without shield disablers. Their ammo weapons will be for nothing if they can NOT penetrate the shields. Imagine now a large cruiser without engines. Funny? It can't hide its subsystems and it can't turn its weapons against you... So it's completely vulnerable because the next system you'll destroy is the shield one. And then GAME OVER ...In combat the most ships use their secondary engine or the combat engine. Very few times in collaboration with the travel engine as it is for travelling large distances. The secondary and combat engines are the ones that turning the ship around all the time. So, if you don't install one on a ship you'll see it can have an efficient fight even with every possible weapon ON.As you can imagine here this is NOT a normal game you've seen. The developpers tried to catch reality in most cases. A great masterpiece in simulation gaming.And now let's go to the cons...  -The game is a little buggy. In many cases does different things but NOT so much for not playing it. The feelings after that game will be... WELL , try it and tell me.  -Another one is the Multiplayer thing. They made a game SO GREAT but without Multiplayer support. To get to the multiplayer you have to follow the online guide through Steam. Say a THANKS to this guy. Well done to him. But let's go to MORE...  -Not many maps for Multiplayer. There are very few and without AI the most of them so .. with an OLD game that its public is limited you'll find yourself trying to play WarCraft 2 or 1 nowadays with an internet human player opponent. Sit and wait till... tomorrow? or more?  -Individual waypoints of a ship. Yes, they forgot to make a fix here. There are times that I want to make the ship take a course that I want. Better battle, hiding in asteroids or whatever. In Multiplayer it would be a VERY HELPFUL advantage.

												Alas poor Nexus, I knew thee well.SummaryNexus: The Jupiter Incident is a Real-Time Strategy tactical space combat game that incorporates realistic physics and dynamics involving warfare within the vacuum of space.The story follows a man named Marcus Cromwell as he serves one of Earth's megacorporations to defend their regions of the Solar System from their corporate rivals.Along his travels, he discovers a self-aware AI known as Angel who warns of an impending apocalypse upon all organic life in the galaxy and that Marcus is the only one who can stop it.ProsThis game embodies scientific accuracy from ship movements to how space explosions work.There are nukes and superlasers in this game and they're awesome.The story is rather original and features a collection of unique characters and aliens.There are a multitude of different mission types such as stealth, escort, and base defense.You have complete control over every ship's customization from weapon loadouts to fighters.You can pause the game at any moment to plan out your strategies ahead of time.As of 2016, this game is compatible with Steam Workshop, allowing for user-made mods.ConsThe camera may cause nausea. (you can view a ship from any angle even upside-down)The story feels a bit rushed and the characters, although impressive, are not memorable.Destroying hardpoints renders ships easier to kill, but the same applies to you as well.There is permadeath in the campaign, if you lose your ships, they're gone forever.You only control a total of eight ships while the rest are all temporary, which isn't bad, but the game hints at the idea of hijacking ships, which is impossible except through mods.Because of how the AI works, you're likely to fail some of the secondary objectives.ConclusionThis game is one of those ""almost but not quite"".It has great features worthy of a few playthroughs, but it's now often overlooked.It's got its flaws, but at least it's trying its best and that deserves some respect.Bonus FactsThe funny thing is, Jupiter is only seen in the background for the first few missions and then never seen again for the rest of the game even though the trailer sets it up as a major plot device, which I feel is false advertisement.In addition, the creators planned to make a sequel, but sadly didn't get enough funds. (Twice!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic game with a classic challenge, not like many of the modenr command and control sims coming out where you simply need to have the biggest gun. Here you need to have the right gun for the right job and make sure you fit it first. you also need strategy, what worked last time may not this timeis a great gam, the story i personally find a little slow, but the gameplay is amazing. I spent ages trying to remember the name of this game after having played an old pc demo cd beck when i was a kid and couldnt afford it. suprised it wasnt abandonware, but regardless was worth every cent.

												Nexus is a rare beast of a game, a tactical Starship combat simulator where you command small numbers of Warships and lead them into battle. There is no grand empires to build or Starfighters to command, rather you are thrown into the cut and thrust of ship to ship combat where a wrong decision on where to allocate your ships limited power supply or what device to target can have disastrous consequences. Though an older game, the graphics are still as amazing as they were when it first came out with the eye-candy of stars, planets, moons and asteroid belts. Nexus covers a topic that is sadly rarely covered in video games and is all the better for it.If you like seeing capital ships pounding one another in the vast reaches of space, then this game is for you.

												The game is fantastic for players seeking a tactical experience, being able to outfit your ships with whatever weapons you want, and using them as you see fit. Be warned though, there are some bugs/glitches that show up after playing for a long session. Namely your units failing to follow your orders, or they magically refuse to use their anti ship weaponry when commanded to do raw damage against an enemy's hull.			",59,9,0,9,14,2,17

But you can only customize the insides of your ship.Haven't tried Multiplayer			",669,195,14,136,55,5,120

												This is another one of those gems that you don't see too often. Although the game takes a little while to load up. It's truly spectacular. The single best space game that I have ever played. It has the best engine ever made for starship combat unfortunately for whatever reason it didn't meet the sales that it needed at the time of it's inception so there's no hope for a sequel. There's plenty of mods that people love to play around with but the worst part about this game is that it ends.			",152,21,0,30,23,0,52

												Do you like RTS games? Do you like space games? Have you played FTL, and did you like it? Do you like Star Trek? If your answer to any of those questions is 'yes', you should pick this up. If your answer to ALL of those questions is 'yes', you'll probably love this game.Yes, it's nearly 12 years old. Doesn't matter. The interface seems a little complicated, but it's actually fairly straightforward. Yes, the AI can be a bit dimwitted at times, but the game plays very well. For a 12 year old game, the graphics are fantastic when turned all the way up. I'm running everything at max, 1920x1080, and even with VSync enabled, I'm riding a constant, comfortable 144fps to go with my 144hz monitor and my GTX-970 is barely lifting a finger. Sound quality is pretty decent too, even if the voice acting is a bit overly dramatic. So far it's running fairly stable on Windows 10, about 5-6 missions in.Is the game worth $10? Yes. Is it worth $2.49 on sale? Absolutely, no question. Pick it up.Full disclosure: I also played this game when it was brand-new back in 2004. The game honestly feels like it plays better now than it did back then.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They just updated the game, a game I would have recommended without the 'HD-patch' they just released.This game is pretty cool. To give you a review that brings it a bit different; Think Homeworld, but now you do not build ships, you aquire some throughout the campaign. For the rest it is very similair, expect you do not have to send out collectors to gather resources. You also have a bit more options than setting an agressive of defensive stance.The game makes you expand your fleet throughout the campaign and offers a certain freedom in the upgrades you apply to your ships. Then once you are in a mission you can give very specific orders, or let the ships do as they will. The last probably wont be too succesfull though, but that is pretty much what makes this game good. It allows you do make your ships do all sort of things, target specific equipment on enemy ships, make artillery strikes on incoming enemies, and sooo much more. Often these things can hurt you as much as they can help you, so some thought is required and you should also not forget the AI can do the same to you.			",49,0,0,6,10,0,19

												As a long time Homeworld addict ( both original and remastered ) I bumped intonothing less than a little gem when browsing the Holiday Sales.Do not be fooled by the original release date. Graphics and 3D have been upgradedto todays standard. The story line is very addictive and incites to complete mission after mission.While Homeworld is all about building ships and enemy crushing tactics, Nexus TJI provides for much finer and detailled ship management up to the level of manually tuning every ship system. Missions teach in a gradual way more and more elaborate controls and tactics.Really love this game after only a few hours and for the Holiday Sales price it's a giveway.If you like Homeworld series, you will for sure appreciate Nexus TJI.

												I don't know why I haven't written a report on this game before. I've played since the year it came out before I had it on steam I remembered I had loads of fun and it was one of the best games I've ever played. Years past and I lost my CD and than decided to buy it again on steam, and once again after all those years I found myself completly immersed in its universe. The story and gameplay are amazing as well as the graphics. The only badside perhaps is that it doesn't have a skirmish mode, however there is a mod for that which allows you to have skirmish battles. If you are a sci-fi fan than this game is a must!

												I've played EVE on and off since 2007. So why do I prefer this game every day of the week? Realism. With all due respect to EVE and the understanding of technical limitations, etc: Nexus gave me what I needed. MMOs can be great, but for single-player this game is astounding. Full ship module customization: from weapons to shields to support systems to engines to fighters and more. An actual visible shield bubble around your ship that flashes when hit by enemy energy weapons. The Combat and Deflection engines make for amazing moments, enabling you to narrowly dodge hundreds of battleship-class projectiles that would otherwise shred your frigates and destroyers. The ability to target specific enemy modules, and having to have a good scanner to detect a ship's weapons and systems in the first place. Great fleet battle command controls and more. Unknown space anomalies, allies and enemies that actually make you go ""what the hell!?"" A very frenetic but fantastic automated drone/fighter system as well. I'm not a rogue type of player in the least, yet I applaud the inclusion of various stealth drives, cloaking, ECM, ECCM, and even jamming shields. Did I mention how fantastic it is to view a ship taking hull damage, let alone the sectional explosions leading up to the ship explosion? And memorable stories & characters to boot. Phenomenal. An under-appreciated space combat game. If you're the kind of gamer that prefers more realism than just pure fantasy in your spaceship-combat games, this title may be for you. If you are considering this game and want to know more, PLEASE ask me. I swear by this game but I will also answer questions objectively.			",133,32,3,22,15,2,32

												Warning, this review is based on my several years old experience, haven't played that since, only for a few minutes. YOu can skip to bottom for TL;DR part.Brilliant! I've spent approx 100 with this game (only in campaign!) and it is incredibly tactical. Maybe Homeworld seems to you too much arcadish? Well, this one is more like hardcore tactical RTS :) You can assign orders even to last single battery on your corvette, but don't forget yourself! Too much micromanagement can kill you very quickly. Solution can be a lot of pausing, or simply giving orders in such manner, your ships will perform well even without your intervention, so you can take care of top priorities. Protect your ships, bring them from mission to mission throughout whole campaign and be sure your crew gathers experience, because experience can be more valuable than guns and armor itself.And atmosphere is still ""realistic"". As realistic as it can be in space opera RTS :)) Thanks to music, graphics (right now I mean long trails behind ships, design of Earth ships and other details, not beauty of textures, lights or shadows, more on that in next paragraph...) storrytelling and proportional grow of your forces you get first grade experience. First you start with a single ship that travel from Earth to Jupiter for eight months. That seems to be kinda fast for today's technology, isn't it? Well, wait for your first alien ship that carries you from system to system in no time, compared to Stilleto (your first ship). It takes like ages of ingame time, to get Angelo (if I remember the name correctly), but that makes it even more rewarding. Later you will get another ship to your current one, so you will be able to use two of them. When your fleet grows to number of like 5 ships, you will feel invincible.Today they released patch (first one after years of inactivity) that brings the game to full HD. I realized how much time passed since I started Nexus for last time. Graphics looks really old, but playability seems to be still very high.I really hope in more updates, possibly in remastered edition or even brand new game? (ehm, inspirated by not named studio, right?)TL;DRIf you are fan of space opera where you take care of your ships and where you can really enjoy tactical decisions and story, definitely buy this game while in discount like today's one. For current price 2,49 Euro, it's a must. Even when it's priced on it's full 10 euro, it can be a good buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great storyGreat gameplayGreat mission designThis game has lots going for it, being quite different from your average sci fi space game. It's been marketed as a 'capital ship combat simulator' which isn't too far from the truth. You command a large frigate in this game meaning you have shields and various weapons systems to manage while in combat. This makes for really fun and interesting gameplay. Add to that a rich and engaging story that grabs you from the start and slowly unfolds as the game progresses and you're onto a winner.Nexus is the kind of game I love, and it deserves to be in your games list!

Had a cracked version of it when it came out then bought it as it was awesome and now I have the steam version.Pros:- Looks good even 12 years after it first came out- Game mechanics are easy to understand and still make a lot of complex actions and strategies available- Story is good, even if it is quite predictable- Characters are lovable and you can quite identify with the main protagonistsCons: - Can feel random sometimes- Very linear- No sequel planned at this timeAs you may have understood, I really loved that game back then, and I still do.

												I first played this game shortly after its release in the mid-2000's, and when I saw it on Steam, I knew I had to pick it up.  I had a hard time with it back then, because I was so attuned to the fast twitch combat style of first person shooters and other very quickly moving games of that genre.  I stopped playing Nexus shortly after starting as I just could not get into it.Fast forward seven years later or so and I picked it up again.  I proceeded to spend the next 11 hours in the game in one sitting.  I had aged and matured, and so did my gaming tastes.  It grabbed me and refused to let go.  The game has weight, as in the spacecraft feel weighty.  It feels like they're in space.  I genuinely enjoyed the capital ship gunfights.  The tactics were difficult at first to grasp, but my brains soon caught up to and matched the difficulty.  I had a good time, even though I never finished the game.  It got difficult for me and some other things came up, so I put it down for a bit.  I definitely want to finish the game, just as soon as I figure out how to beat the stealth mission.  If you have played and like Eve Online, Homeword, or Starpoint Gemini, this game is worth $10.  Don't let the release year scare you, even unupdated, the engine stands very well against the test of time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely enjoyable game, not going to lie. The story is a major driving factor, along with the space movements, management, combat, and more realistic feeling.Pros:-Enjoyable gameplay with variety in the levels, envionments, ship design, and more.-Customizable ship loadouts, allowing you to go in with the equipment you want. You can customize weapons, special weapons, engines, shields, generators, and more.-It's a very long game so if you enjoy it it's well worth the money.-You can command multiple ships, and manage each either manually or with help from the AI, which is suprisingly competent, as they will target key systems on your ship. -Pleasant voice-overs of the plot, as the transitions from act to act is voiced by an extremely pleasant voice.-The game runs unbelievably smoothly.-Enormous levels to partake in, although it is 99% empty space.-The game is extremely good at giving you terrible situations but giving you just enough weaponry to steal the day, making it a game that will give you plenty of satisfaction.Cons:-The camera is rather clunky, as it will lock to a certain axis and not move unless you make very specific camera movements.-Some levels are unfair without lots of trial and error, meaning certain levels can be utterly repetitive.-The game never directly tells you about the ship customization option, and some missions can be nigh impossible without a proper loadout.-You do not choose which ships to go into battle with. The only ship you are certain to go with is A) for the early bit, the Stiletto, or B) The Angelwing. All others are strictly variables, which can make the experience a bit depressing when you kit a certain destroyer out only to have it removed for two missions in a row.-Some voices are pretty bad, but others are acceptable, while Marcus himself has a Morgan Freeman tier voice during transitions.Neutral:-Missions can take a very long time depending on your play style, so people with strict scheduals might be daunted.-The soundtrack isn't bad, but isn't good either, as it can feel a bit repetitive when it repeats multiple times, but certain tracks are epic and enjoyable.Story:Set in the near distant future, Nexus - The Jupiter Incident places you into the role of Captain Marcus Cromwell, the son of one of the most influential men of the era, as you work your way through the ranks. You take up when Marcus arrives on an outer moon of Jupiter, and slowly begin to unravel a plot of epic proportion.Plot: (SPOILERS)After the discovery of the Angelwing - an advanced alien spacecraft - and an Artificial Intelligence known as Angel, Marcus and the crew flee through a wormhole away from a mechanoid - an extremely powerful device that is invulnerable to traditional weaponry. The plot expands outward to galactic empires warring against each other and the systematic capturing of earth by these mechanoids. It is down to Marcus and the crew of the Angelwing to rescue earth and defeat the mechanoids, and perhaps save a few space empires in the process.(SPOILERS END HERE)All in all, I give the game a solid 8/10, an extremely impressive game for something that has come out so long ago. My recommendation for a game similar to this is Homeworld Remastered Edition.			",76,11,0,20,37,0,38

												This game is quite simply... awesome.  It's unlike any other space rts ive ever played. It's graphics are almost cinematic and like watching a movie, it's level of control is something rarely seen in games now a days. I was particularly amazed with how even my crappy windows xp laptop (as opposed to my more modern desktop) could run the game at full graphics and still play  very smoothly.There were 2 negatives to this game that you only really notice later on.The first is the ""independentness"" of your space ships. i actually believe that the manual explained this was on purpose, and if done correctly, this function could make the game tons more fun and one of a kind. But they kind of failed. The idea is that your ships aren't under your command as much as following your orders and figuring out things for their own. This could have been a highly unique and interesting feature if they had taken it a bit further (for example, having different personalities of captains on your ships. so one could charge right in guns blazing when when u say attack while the other would naturally  bombard the target from a distance and disable its key systems before going in for the kill). they also could have just not implemented this idea and had the ships follow your orders exactly (like manual almost but as an ai) instead the game has an awkward middle ground that is sometimes extremely annoying. I often go manual on my ships and still have problems. I will send my flagship away from, say, the battle base titan or something similar and send it towards an enemy cruiser to keep it safer. then i will come back to find that my flagship has turned arond and is charging straight into the battle bases guns..... and only a single laser beam is firing from my ship as it charges  . This obviouslycan be frustrating. (sorry didnt mean to rant but in the late game where everything relies on timing, this can be annoying and almost game wrecking if you try to micromanage)The other flaw that i will briefly mention is that the game doesnt seem open to creative solutions. It seems to have been designed with a single solution for every level that you have to find through trial and error (especially in the late game). when you have a beautiful game like this with wonderful control styles and an amazing number of ways of options in combat, it is frustrating when in the end only one or two ways will work for the ""mission"". After that rant, you probably think the game must suck, but actually in all other aspects this game is awe-inspiring, one-of-a-kind really. I recommend it heavily			",9,0,0,1,3,0,10

												Wow. This game brings tactical 3D space RTS to the next level. Homeworld was one of my favorite games, but the level of detail put into the balance of this game is stunning. Ships compete and dish out damage in a unique number of ways adding some rock/paper/scissor elements I love. Also no giant cruiser ship is going down in a few seconds here so there is long-term strategy involved in battles with time to adjust micromanagement of individual ships. I love that part. The big caveat though is there is no skirmish generator to keep enjoying the mechanics after single-player making this purely a single-player experience. I curse fate for not allowing the sequel to make it on kickstarter, but the creators still seem motivated on their facebook page.PS - back in the day you could never finish the second to last mission due to the massive load on your graphics cards and CPU. Now luckily you can play this game without having that fear if you got the latest hardware. You will just have to find some work-arounds for the higher screen resolution and window size customization. It is worth it though.			",30,6,1,10,11,0,9

												TL:DR;In order to avoid sudden game overs in last mission you need to keep your distance from the anomaly. Order ships to move away or attack enemies that are on the opposite side.Use CE table to get upgrade points, because game is imbalanced ;(In case of a crash during a mission restart inside that mission or load a save from the previous one. This will randomly solve the problem.Summary: 7/10, solid note.Despite multiple shortcomings that this title presents, it is strangely enjoyable game.Graphics is decent, sound average, UI somewhat messy.Story line is not that bad really(could be worse).Ship modability is very limited (seriously, use CE table otherwise you won't even be able to fully outit them!).There is no resource or research management. This is straight forward fleet to fleet RTS space battle game and if this is what you are looking for, you found it.Compared to Homeworld I would say it is 6/10 where 10 is Homeworld, but since that game is also dated hence the total 7/10 score.

This game truly is a gem from the pastSadly I missed it back in the day und just rediscovered it after the release of the recent patch.The story is really motivating as I was always looking forward to what was going to happen next!Yes the gameplay is slow on occasion yet it is a lot of fun to optimise the shipsâ equipment for the next mission and try different ship to ship combat tactics during the missions.The mission objectives are very diverse thus I never felt bored or annoyed by them.I had a few crashes to desktop but nothing too serious, IIRC about 5 in total, which, compared to the number of missions (26) as well as their length, is quite okay.So just make sure to save every now and then during each mission and youâre good to go. :) (The game creates an auto-save after each mission)To sum it up:If you're into sci-fi space fleet simulation games then you should definitely give this game a try! :)PSI played this game on the following system with max settings in FullHD @~100+ FPS:Windows 10 Pro x64Core i7-3630QM16 GB RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cool space game, though linear in its story and missions, but it gives you the feel that you are actually give specific orders, allowing you to choose different approaches in space battles, rather than simply leftclicking a unit, and ordering to kill tings with the right mouse button.Deconstruct your enemy by disabling their various systems, be it weapons or propulsion, send in marines in boarding vessels (after diabling enemy flak weaponry. Very important, lest your trusty marines are going to be proper frosty, when blown into chunks of haggis, hurtling through infinite space)The story is interesting and sometimes there are moments worthy of a chuckle, at times on purpose, others are less so.You are allowed to customize your ships, making them longrange bombers, or perhaps they are stuffed with shuttles meant to transport boarding parties.My only complaint is the linearity. And of course how many spacefarers seem to have sharp (yet understandable) scottish accents. Sheepâ¥â¥â¥â¥ers in space, arent believable, no matter how scruffy they sound, or look like captain Price)			",209,44,1,38,32,3,59

												I liked this game and it was fun while it lasted, but a malfunction in the core won't allow me past the first part of the last mission. So I cannot recommend a game I'm not allowed to beat. Once the game gets to the Noah Colony it gets pretty good for a while. Then it tails off at the end leaving a mediocre taste in your mouth. If you want more you can continue reading. At the end some problems become apparent. Your ships remain un-upgradable just stacking points on, the Angelwing was god-like at the end. While others wither to your backlines because of a real deficit. Then you get a few ships late in the game that never really live up to anykind of hype. Wonky AI that will take a ship attacking another behind an ally not allowing your ship to fire. Mission with the convoy after arriving at Noah Colony, I'm looking at you. Some equipment is downright pointless. Seriously, lasers... never worked for me. Then you have the Cyborg units, I was like cool I'll land some heavily armed men on a ship (even a small one) then take it over from the inside, or destroy it at least. Nope they just go in and die, not from the counter unit batteries just infiltrate, be there for a bit, die, or return to the ship like nothing just happened. Aside from a few side missions that net next to nothing, there is no reason to waste points on them, except the Angelwing since you'll have nothing better to spend them on.I was awaiting the ability to command an armada and thinking it was going to be glorious, but it really got rid of some of the intensity of the fights. I found most of my time trying to micro-manage the movements of the fleet to keep them in a battle formation that made any type of sense. Once conveyed into battle units twist and rotate at random, tending to push guns out of sighlines forcing them to stop shooting. So you need to manually move them with the shift key, which isn't explained in the tutorial. Then clicking and unclicking the modules that were once an awesome dynamic to the battlefield, now, a tedious chore that prolonged a battle for longer than it needed to be.Yet, it does get it right throughout most of the game and for that I can say I enjoyed the game. It balances strategy and tactics with an emphasis on prioritizing targets and launching suicide runs with your fighters to occupy the anti-fighter guns while your bombers attempt to do strafing runs. The ability to adapt to ever changing circumstances in the constantly shifting battlefield will push your plans out of sync. Force you to improvise at times, and sacrifice the few to save the many.So the modules are a cool little thing that lets you send battery power to boost the efficiency of weapons, engines, shields, etc. to over 9000. Which also opens a vast array of strategies to utilize against your opponents. Strike out with the Brutus, then full power to shields and engines to try and lure a few overzealous captains into range of the Angelwing. Which in turn strikes with a fury. So there you have it. Like I said this game gets it right for most of it, but tails off at the end. There are few others that can match it in gameplay while ""right"" but the end just kinda made me happy it was over.

												Nexus The jupiter Incident is probably one of the game that too few people know about. This is partly due to a very complex road from the developpement to the release. Because of lack of proper publisher funding this game is only partly as good as the original idea of making an Imperium Galactica III game that would have certainly make a mark in the world of space strategy.The final release of this game while not as great as it's original potential remain a testament to it's root and offer a very good visual experience and a very tricky tactical experience that may challenge you. There is also a few good mods for it but sadly the community isn't too alive anymore.I think for a low price this game is worth trying and it's a lot of fun for anybody that enjoy space warfare.

												Even today the game is a lot of fun, especially due to its higer difficulty.Seriously this game is challenging but never unfair!The upgrade mechanics are complex and allow more tactical depth compared to what you normally get.The story is ok and keeps you motivated through the game. Especially the characters are very interesting tho.I have not experienced any technical problems so far (after 13 hours gametime) and the space scenes still look pretty good.The only negative aspect is that the game doesn't completly explain itself, so you still have to test some stuff out or check the internet sometimes.A game you should seriously consider to buy if you are into space games, because i have enjoyed every minute i played it so far.

												A beloved game that I bought here because I had lost my old physical copy. However, it is unplayable. It starts great, but eventually, you will come to a mission where it crashes repeatedly.Update: After some finaggling, I was able to get past the point it kept crashing at. So, other than hoping it doesn't crash somewhere else, and one very irritating obligatory stealth mission, it's a great game.			",30,4,0,5,7,0,12

												i have not played through the game, but i figured id be a while anyway so i may as well put up an initial rewiew. i like it so far although it doesnt interact too well with windows 10. i would definitely love to see an HD reboot to make the game work and look better. not to mention the possibility of drumming up a crowd and some buzz for a sequel.UPDATE: I figured out the problems with Windows 10. Setting steam to run as administrator will fix any problems that ive been dealing with. Now to the game     The game is a very good game. I love playing it. its a little bit of a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥because the interface is old and not really fantastic, however the game makes up for it in interesting stories and trying something that was completely unusual in its time (and still is unusual even now although thats starting to change a bit). The game is challenging and ill admit ive started a second save because something I did in the past screwed me in the present. (i strongly suggest not overwriting old saves). Itll kick yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥a lot but it does so like an abusive spouse whose very good at it..... and youve got a thing for being abused.... youll love every minute of it even when its making you furious. Its weird like that. I cant not reccomend this game. If you like a challenge, this game is for you. If you like an interesting story (even though it uses very old tropes and such) this game is for you. If you want  a nostalgia trip, this game will be good for you. Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nexus: The Jupiter Incident is a bit rough-around-the-edges, but once you start picking up on the nuances of gameplay, it becomes just as fun (if not moreso) than the more popular Homeworld.  Nexus: The Jupiter Incident takes a decent amount of nods from Homeworld 2 in that you have systems to manage in real-time 3-dimensional combat, with multiple capital ships trading an astronomical amount of fire.While the multiplayer has practically died, for US$10, you can't go wrong with an enjoyable game such as this. For 2004, the visuals are brilliant, providing excellent effects for various weaponry and a massive amount of attention-to-detail on weapon and ship systems.			",655,134,32,120,86,3,104

												I've actually bought two copies of this game. The first many years ago and this current one from steam. What can I say...proper tactical space combat, no huge ships whixxing around like fighters, they're big and they're slow (and not always doing what you tell themj to do), it's absolutely enjoyable and down right annoying at the same time.ProsSingle player campaign will teach you all you need to know about the ships and weapons. (not sure the multiplayer is still up and running atm.The game mechanics are spot on. big ships move slow, small ships scuttle around and annoy everyone.Really engaging storyline with fairly good voice acting.ConsGraphics and music are a tad dated.AI ship can sometimes just sit there and do nothing leaving you in a serious hair pulling state.Linear story line with little to no room whatsoever for deviation.That being said, tha game worked straight out the box when I first bought it and during that time there where only a couple of patcheds added, which kind of shows the level of quality Mithis put into the game before releasing it (wish some game companies today would follow suit).

												This is an awesome game! Marvelous atmosphere, good story, challenging gameplay, everything a good space themed game needs is included. Campaing is not very long but missions are really challenging, up to some rage quitting point. For every mission, you need a whole new tactical approach if you want to succeed. Musics are terrific and becomes legendary when something important or critical happens during the mission. The only thing I wish they put more customization options for ships other than just infrastructure. If you love space tactical combat games and you do not mind replaying a mission over and over to find the right approach, you should definitely buy and play this game.			",6,1,0,0,2,0,4

												One of my first true space games and it will always have a special place in my heart.  The myriad of weapons and upgrades adds a great depth and customisations.Fun, real time, complex and quite excellent 3D space combat will keep you coming back.Except the escort mission(s), which are unbearable.Pity the sequel kickstarter failed.Stop reading and buy this game.

												this is another one of the best rts games ive played i highly recomend this game to anone interested in small group ship combat and large fleet control in both offensive and deffensive roles, the only draw back is you dont get 100% control of your ship but you still tell it where to go and how fast to get there cobbat systems are at your full disposal, from individual control for surgical strikes to multi weapon systems fireing from multiple ships at once. this game is very indepth control wise and i my opinion features a very interesting and difficult storyline.

												As far as combat goes, Nexus:TJI represents what I think 3D space combat should be. Unfortunately, ship customisations are incredibly limited rendering the ability for completing the story a bit of a crapshoot. At any time, and with little-to-no warning at all, you could find yourself going back to a savegame far before a certain mission which requires very specific upgrades. It's downright painful at times.Other than that: The backgrounds and environments are incredible, the AI can be rather surprising in its tactics, and it's not a cheating â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. You can do the same thing to AI as you can do to human players and vice verse, there's no compensation going on. The story is nice, and none of the characters are in any way portrayed as ""perfect"" or ""exemplary."" It's all just hap-and-circumstance in an intriguing take on robots-gone-wrong.There needs to be more games like this one, but without the crappy ship customisation restrictions.

												Nexus is easy to recommend: there simply isn't any other game out there like this. Realtime strategy games set in space are few and far between, especially ones that focus on tactical battles between few capital ships and allow you to customize your fleet and its loadout to fit your own strategies. For a game nearly seven years old, it has aged quite well and still manages to look stunning from time to time. There are also plenty of mods available: Stargate, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek or Freespace - whatever fits your style more.If you call yourself a Sci-Fi fan, go grab Nexus. The campaign is fun and the replay value considering all the mods is very good.			",231,38,3,29,36,1,45

All that's left for the player is the tactics and the long single player campaign. The latter of which being what Nexus stands up on entirely alone.I love Nexus and I wish there were other games like it.*(so you get lost ships back at the end of most missions but they can loose crew and get their equipment replaced with the default)			",134,24,0,11,18,1,21

												It has been years since i last played this game, before Steam was a thing. But technology advances and the game was left to rot in some publishers archive, thankfully THQNordic has the IP rights of this game and it's been restored to work with modern computers. I played this game once before when it came to steam.It still has it's moments where it is really interesting and fun ""Boom! a nuke explodes on the OSC Dangerous"" as the Lieutenant is yammering away and you think to yourself ""whoa!"". But there are moments where it's still just as annoying as it was originally, like trying to destroy gorg ships in a secondary objective without losing any other ship to a siege laser and without them escaping.With all it's flaws it come back, and frankly it's perfect with it's flaws. Is it worth playing over? yes for sure.			",44,3,2,4,7,0,9

												This is a game that slipped under my radar but this is most certainly the case of better late than never.  While a few years old, this game is a gem.  In a nutshell it is a space capital ship & fleet command simulator.  You start out commanding one ship, along with some fighters and transports which are used to capture vessles or disable enemy subsystems.  As the game progresses you will get new ships as well as more ships under your command.  You will be able to outfit their ship as well as your own with new gadgets, weapons, shields, fighters and transports.  There is no resource management or building.  You get assigned vessels each mission and prior to the mission start can outfit them.  During the missions you have control over all vessels, fighters and transports under your command.  You have a great deal off control on how your ship and fleet works, control over combat, power optimisation, behavior etc.  Despite this the game has a relativly low learning curve and the tutorial in the first few missions teach you most of what you need to know.  The rest is through good old fashioned trial and error.  Overall, if you are a fan of space sims, have been looking for a game that lets you command powerful capital ships in a nice looking environment then this is definatly worth a look, especially at â¬10.Graphics: 7 - Despite being a few years old, the graphics hold up in 2013.  Ships are highly details and the weapon and explosion effects are gorgeous.  Could use better resolution options however. Sound: 7 - Combat sounds do the job, weapon and engine sounds are crisp and the music, while nothing spectacular sets the mood.  The voice acting is hit and miss, with one character in particular being rather annoying but for the most part is servicable.Gameplay: 10 - Lots of fun, controls work and you can pause at any time with the spacebar to let you issue orders without stress.  I would prefer a camera with slightly tighter controls but that is just a personal issue. Replayability: 5 - The game campaign is based on linear missions and once you played the campaign the only real reason to start over is to try on a harder difficulty setting, try to complete hard secondary objectives you missed or simply to blow stuff out of the sky.  Multiplayer is pretty empty at the time of writing.  The game could have used a random mission creator.  There might be a mod that adds missions but I have not had a chance to delve into that side yet.Addendum: The game supports mods as from the launch screen.  I personally have not had a chance to look at it yet.			",175,16,0,37,46,1,57

												Simply amazing! Other than ""Homeworld"", it's the best space strategy game in existence. It's beautiful and very intense with an engaging story full of sci-fi's best elements. You'll feel the menace of the vast outer space.While ""Homeworld"" has a more typical RTS approach, with resource gathering and units to manage, ""Nexus"" has a more ""navy"" approach: it's about commanding 1-8 ships at a time (persistent along missions), making use of their different weapons and managing the engine and systems generators. I love both approaches and I think fans of space sci-fi and RTS/strategy games can not do much better than this game and ""Homeworld"".Nexus 2 coming soon, check news page on steam.

												A tactics RPG with persistent fleet and detailed micromanagement? In theory, I should love the hell out of this game. But I don't. Pros: - RPG aspects, level of ship customization - your captains are persistent, and so are your ships. You upgrade both of these, which is costly, and customize them for various roles and against various enemies. You lose a ship, you lose everything you put into them - which is costly. Customization includes a multitude of weapon types (for different roles), different strike craft and various, various equipment.- level of control over ships - you can control the ships down to singlar guns targetting different targets, engine throttle, subsystem management, repairs, etc etc etc.... best set of options I've ever seen. If you could only control individual shield quadrants, this game would take unit control to a whole another level never seen in any game. You can blow crap up, you can just disable, or you can board. It's up to you.- scale - the battles and scenarios are just the right scale, and just the right escalation. - ship design and details - all the different engines (including some on the front), moving parts, turrets... also very utilitarian ship design. I like it.Unfortunetly, that's it for pros.Cons:- relatively boring cliche storyline - good twist around 1/4th in, but that'd be all- clunky camera - think Homeworld 1. Unacceptable - you can't issue move orders on empty space - yes, that's right. You can only head towards/away from a specified target. As a result, your battle plans are very limited, flanking is difficult, and on more than one occasion I got stuck and had to restart a mission because I didn't have any targets in sight - unreliable controls - that's right. The level of control is incredible, but very often ships don't do what you tell them to. They stumble, they pick the wrong direction, randomly stop firing, or decide they won't target X. ""Derpy"" is a diplomatic way to say it. It happens all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ time, especially if you have more and bigger ships. Very often you're stuck manually reloading ships' weapons because they stop firing for no reason. - random outcomes - very often if you do a mission and do the same thing let's say three times, you'll get 3 different outcomes. Good on paper, not so much in a tactics game. - difficulty - the unfair, random kind. Sometimes you just have everything stacked against you. Enemies roll good dice, your units decide to disobey orders, which happens infuriatingly often, and you just are left screaming at the screen ""why didn't you follow my orders"". It doesn't help that missions on their own are pretty difficult, While the cons aren't very numerous, the camera, move orders and unreliable behavior of your ships make the game incredibly frustrating at times. I really wanted to like this game. It was supposed to be my replacement for Star Trek: Deep Space 9: Dominion Wars. Unfortunetly, The Jupiter Incident has even more issues.			",295,41,6,22,17,1,42

												Great game and very playable now with the latest updates! Well done to the devs. I mean, this game was released in 2004, and while the graphics have aged a bit, they're still not bad once you get into the game.I remember when this was first released, it was complicated and functionally opaque. Most people who hated it, just never figured it out. But boy, once you learned how to manage your star ships and how to attack enemied, what a game.This game makes you feel like you're controlling a fleet of space ships like no other (if you know what you're doing). You have to wear down your opponents by attacking their modules. Destroy shields>Destroy weapons>Disable engine>Send in your marines or just destroy them with your hull destroying weapons.Piece of advice: Major issue at release thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥people off, was not knowing how to outfit your ship for the next mission. And if you set it up wrong, sometimes it was impossible to win. So make sure you always have mutilple saves to go back if necessary. ",80,29,1,21,42,1,30

												I played this game when it came out on CD way back in the day.  There simply isn't a game like this on the market anymore: fully-3D space maneuvering, 1-to-5 ships that are fully customizable, a brutally tactical space opera.This was the ""you died, try again"" game of my youth, and playing it was worth the frustration, because the game is just that good.  I bought it at full release price, and I got every penny out of it.  For 10 USD it's an absolute steal.			",157,42,2,25,25,3,35

												I bought this game when it came out.  I absolutely loved this game.  It was like homeworld, but more oriented towards my small fleet and completing strategic missions.  Kind of like those old command and conquer missions where you have only so many units to complete a mission and you have to figure out how to get through a map and survive it.  This is a good RTS, with fun RTS space combat.  Not too fast, not too slow, not too crazy.  Things are well animated, and the graphics are still decent.  The story is interesting too, though the voice acting is so so.  Overall, this is a good space RTS game with RPG elements and mission based story.  It is a must for anyone who liked homeworld, but didn't want to build stuff, just concentrate on combat and story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please rate if you liked my review. Thank you.Genre: Real Time TacticsTheme: classic Science FictionType: Singleplayer/Campain  ----   MultiplayerWhen I first played Nexus - the Jupiter Incident (NJI), I was like: ""Wow, if someone threw Homeworld, The X game series and Supreme Commander into a mixer, this game would be the result""I couldnÂ´t have been wronger. Even if the briefing videos remember me of Supreme Commander, the ""zoom"" of homeworld and the environments/plot of X3 Terran Conflict, this is a very different and unique game. And a very good one, tooLets get started: The tutorial mission teaches you about the basic interface and movement commands of your ship, a terran heavy corvette. You learn how to manage your weapons systems, shields, cloaking devices and fighter squardons, to modify the energy flow, and so on. It wonÂ´t take long until enemy ships approach you. Turn on your shields, increase the shields energy flow to 120%, power up your weapons, activate a vision jammer. You will learn the basic routines very quickly. The game is kept semi-realistic and complex. The physics, spaceship movements, projectile physics and the gameplay are very close to my idea of space combat. You can destroy different parts of a ship, eg. the engines, the weapon energy supply generator, and so on. At the same time, the details never get annoying.StoryThe story is what you would immagine to get from a science fiction spaceship RTS. Set in the 22nd century, humankind has expanded and created colonys, connected by naural wormholes and ""Interplanetary Drives"" installed on ships, allowing comfortable and fast space travel within solar systems. You are Marcus Cromwell, a terran spaceship captain. Cromwell sets out on the SpaceTech Heavy Corvette, the Stiletto, for Jupiter. The events that unfold are ""The Jupiter Incident"", which escalates into an intergalactic war.Featuring advanced A.I., various alien races, unknown new enemys and EPIC SPACE BATTLES!!!!. Well, padon me. , the setting is very common Science FictionThe missions are linear, there are nicely animated simutaltions of the various solar systems where you are, but the only thing you can do is to go ""on the next mission"". There is an briefing video before every mission, informing you ""about the latest news"" The missions are solid, most of them are not really very innovative, but they keep you entertained (recon this , escore that, protect this, and so on) Some missions are definitely made with much love, e.g sneaking through a asteroid belt full of enemy ships with a single ship in order to infiltrate the enemys baseShip customisationShip customisation is a big part of the game. You will have 1-4 ships under your direct command, and you can modify almost every aspect of them.For example: Scout Destroyer. LetÂ´s get cloaking/jamming devices, a low-emission engine which makes it much harder to detect, and close-range shield-penetrating lasers to destroy a shipÂ´s devices like itÂ´s primary engines or the weapon turrets. Heavy battleship. Well, I have high-range anti-shield energy torpedos and cluster bombs  for big targets like stations, which are supplied by a bunch of advanced energy generators. Stock up the shipÂ´s remaining slots with Plasma Cells (energy storages). The hull-crushing weapons will be 15 Pulsar missiles, which I will fire after my Scout Destroyer has disables the enemy battleships engines and itÂ´s anti-missile flak-turrets. My third ship, a Heavy Destroyer will be equipped with hull-crushing high-speed torpedos, along with a couple of gunships to support the Scout Destroyer. In order to protect my gunships from the enemyÂ´s fighters, I have added some flak-turrets.And that was only the loadout. You will sit there for hours to figure out how to beat the not-so-dumb enemy ships. Luckily there is a pause function where you can give commands and look aroundI would give it a 8,7/10, if you like space(ships) or enjoy science fiction, this is the game for you[/b] ",96,3,2,2,4,0,15

												While space opera has enjoyed a literary resurgence, the genre is not particularly well-represented in gaming. Ten years since its release, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident remains the best of the genre, and its longevity can be attributed to three main things: 1) The gameplay, story and setting are top-notch, 2) The graphics stand the test of time, even a decade later, and 3) The game's loyal fanbase has produced some truly spectacular mods, including a Battlestar Galactica mod that is far superior to any of the officially-licensed games released for that franchise. Nexus features space combat on a grand scale -- battles stretch across systems and light minutes, weaponry is extremely varied and has real strategic value, and tactics matter much more than in other space combat games. The decisions you make during engagements can produce wildly varying outcomes, and the game's missions require you to think about how you approach targets, which weapons you deploy, which ships you place in the line of fire, how you prioritize targets, and how you utilize the variety of equipment and ship modifications available to your flagship and fleet.Nexus: The Jupiter Incident isn't a game for people who want dogfighting in space, and it's not the type of game that can be mastered with a five-minute tutorial. While some people find the learning curve off-putting, for those of us who are fans of the game, its depth is part of what makes it special. When Nexus was released, there wasn't anything like it. A decade later, that statement still holds true.			",105,18,6,10,13,1,14

												The game looks nice at times and that's about it.It handles like an ox on valium, it is so vague it could have just as well told you absolutely nothing because it is pretty much ""figure everything out yourself, we're not going to tell you how the game works"".You are going to die, a lot, spend hours on trying to upgrade your ship without knowing what's ahead and are going to be punished for not guessing the right ship configuration. So many hours lost on more than annoying useless ""gameplay"".The screen is so busy at times you just don't know what is going on.I finished it because I do not like unfinished stories, even if it's a bad one, but I did not enjoy myself most of the time, the last levels are just a pain and a complete mess.Overrated because there are so few good games in that category.

												I really want to like this game, i really do. Concept is cool and i like space RTS games overall But it suffers from horrendously stupid AI. You can tell the AI ships to do something and they do not do it all the time, they do something else like go next to a enemy battle ship and just stand there without firing and die or when you give them orders to use artillery they do it sometimes and after you have issued the command five times and used the manual panel. Sometimes they tend to go next to the ship you ordered to have on a artillery range and just sit there. AI is stupid in massive scale, in big battles you can notice it too. This game has brought me more frustration than any other space RTS have ever done and not in a good way. the difficulty becomes from the AI being anâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥primarily.			",28,1,1,4,10,0,1

												Another game I wish I could recommend.  It has so much going for it, awesome looking and feeling battles, good weapons control, and some interesting strategic choices.However, the slow and clunky interface get in the way at every turn.  In multiplayer you can't save custom ship designs to speed up ship creation, as well as very few map choices.  The campaign gets very slow very quickly.  The combat takes forever to do anything at all, especially once shields are introduced.  The strategy is hampered greatly by the lack of proper movement controls as well as super hard counters in the forms of weapons.  In the end, it feels like the creators were actually wanting to make a game where you controlled a single ship, but decided not to at the last minute, and therefore the entire game suffers.

												Falls into the classification of ""wanted to like, but...""Slooooow.  Slow slow slow.  And this is coming from someone who loves the Homeworld franchise so you know this is some serious slow motion.  The dialogue and backstory are actually somewhat intriguing (despite some pretty bad voice-acting from some of the characters), but any interest is lost only a couple missions in when the clunkiness of the interface and the speed of ships and action lingers on while you stare and watch for what feels like forever.The interface is clean but unhelpful and tiny.  Good luck trying to find your next objective or any object that the narration has mentioned if there are more than a couple things out there.Graphics are serviceable and nice in some ways, but drab.Most frustrating is that ships don't do what you'd like them to do.  Tell them to stop, and they decide to move a little.  Tell them to fire artillery and they move away from the enemy and don't seem to do anything.Couldn't see any way to rebuild lost fighters, which seems incomprehensible.Overall I was pulled in a bit by the story and atmosphere, but once the missions started my interest faded fast.  I didn't play it long but can't find a reason to want to play it again.I always hate to say that, being a developer myself and knowing that this game must have taken some good effort to create.  But it's just not compelling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lots of times you will continuously crash around the same spot. The solution isn't to restart the mission, it's to restart the PREVIOUS mission!

												Another day, another negative review. A shame, really, because the first chapter of the game was very promising. However, once the second chapter begins, your ship starts to do everything EXCEPT what you tell it to do. Enemy subsystems become indestructable, leaving the only playstyle as pop shields and smash hull. Any subsystem targeting weapon is useless. So you configure your ship to do the thing that works, and the very next mission requires you to destroy subsystems or you automatically fail.Frustrating.			",62,17,0,22,18,0,35

												Fantastic game, one of the best in its genre. But...(Always one of those, right?)...The game will constantly crash on select missions. It may not be the same mission for everyone, but they are all linked to a directX crash. There are no known solutions online that I have found, and the crash to desktop impedes game progression. Therefore I do not recommend this Steam released version of the game.If you buy it while it's on sale for $2.50 I'd say it is worth your money for the missions that you DO get to run, but don't expect to be able to finish this game.P.S. I hear there are works in progress to make a sequel. One wonders as to the purpose of such a task when you can't even complete the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game starts off great... but it lacks several key parts of gameplay to enable this to truly be a game even worth playing.First, the camera controls suck. Whenever I try to order ships in my fleet around, that automatically means that I really want to look at that ship instead of just ordering it to do what I want.Second, the pilots on this ship must be drooling idiots. I'm sorry to the drooling idiots of the world, as I meant no insult. What I mean is that the game doesn't really understand that to fire guns with any sort of accurary I must be closer to the target ship. Or that when I use the ""get closer to that ship"" command, it really means to stay right where I am, because I'm really dumb.Third, the pilots on the ship must be drooling idiots. It's not my inexperience, as I've gotten 5 hours on this game that I was truly interested in, but I can't emphasize how bad the control interface is. Lack of grouping of ships, lack of any sort of AI coordination on the part of the crew members thta I was ordering around as the ship's ""Captain"" make me want to push the pilot and gunners aside and do it myself.In short, if I was ever on a ship with a crew this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'd take the chances on running the ship myself after I'd murdered the grew by 'accidental airlock decompresion.'Don't buy this unless the challenge you prefer is fighting the interface.

												While the premise is interesting, for most of the game I felt like there wasn't really much room for tactics and I felt that there was no control over flying the ships beyond clicking ""head to a point"" or ""fire weapons""  but at the same time you don't actually fire the weapons yourself or do any of the maunvering yourself, the computer does that for you which I found to really reduce the experience/immersion of the game for me. Additionally at time I became very frustrated wondering why my ship was just sitting there spinning slowly around rather than attacking the ship that I had ordered it to fire at. These things gave the game a very ""on rails"" feeling to the game as there was near zero room to do anything other than basic stuff like ""fire at that ship"" or go towards that base. Be warned that the pace of play is VERY slow. While this is likely due to the fact that these are battles between slow moving heavily armored ships there was never really a sustained sense of urgency and I would be sitting around doing absolutely nothing waiting for a ship to be destroyed or disabled as my ship automatically fired at it for several minutes.  It almost feels like as if you are playng a RTS game but only controlling 3-4 ships AT MOST at a given time and very often many less than that. Perhaps I am jumping to conclusions and I cannot say that I finished the game but I really lost the interest in continuing to slave on in the hopes that it will get more interesting. maybe I am missing something that the ~85% of people who reccomended this game did to make this game fun but personally I don't get it. I was picturing visions of getting to pilot a capital ship and instead I got a basic button pressing RTS but with none of the tactical/strategic skill required from a RTS.This game is 50% space sim and 50% strategy game but 0% exciting for me, which is sad because I enjoy both genres usually. I got this as a part of a bundle and am regretting it even at the discounted price that I got it at let alone the $9.99 that Steam is asking for it normally.			",66,23,0,5,20,0,13

												can't get past the first mission. something's wrong because it times out before you can capture/board the enemy ship. Tried it several times, same thing. Mission fails and you can't skip to the next one. Maybe it has to do with the faster clock speeds of the cpu these says (it's an old title). not fun if its behaving like that.			",22,0,3,2,4,0,1

												Unskippabble cutscenes.  Mission objectives that require you to wait 10 minutes doing absolutely nothing.  Missions where your weapons basically do nothing against the enemy so you have to wait for reinforcement and just watch some AI kill them.  Awkward and unintuitive controls.  One mission had an objective to save some station.  Literally 2 seconds into that mission the station was destroyed.This game is unbelievably bad.  Maybe the multiplayer is better, but almost no one is playing it anymore so good luck with that.I got it on sale for $3, and that was much too high of a price for this crap.If you think Eve Online is much too exciting this is the game for you.

												This game is a joke!  It makes the enemy ships in the 'scout mission' invincible, and all your ships fail to even scan the enemies for the IP blocker.  Then the game destroys the scout before you can even scan all the enemies for the IP blocker.  Even when you task each ship to scan a different ship!  !  How can the enemy ships destroy the scot ship when all are engaged with you in battle, and the scout is so stealthy that your own sensors can't even see it?!?!?  This game is glitchy and stupid!

												This game came out a while ago, but still looks and sounds great.  Its as if you are commanding a ""white star"" from Babaylon 5 TV show.  EPIC!!!Game is related to Homeworld Epicness in someways with it's story and RPG/tactical progression and response to previous actions.Game is challenging on some missisons (looking you ambush and bomb missions)  and others are a little puzzle to figure out since the game doesn't hold your hand (yet it always feels fair).Game has a great and ingrossing story, uniqe setting and fun play style.  You have a primary ship that you control/command from.  Babaylon 5 and Star Trek eat your heart out, this game better then any of those big time.Game is on sale?  BUY IT, it was great 10 years ago, its still great now (espically if you liked homeworld or never played it).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The missions are varied in style, you'll go from investigating odd reports to sneaking through an asteroid field in order to avoid enemy ships to going head to head with an enemy ship to commanding a whole fleet.

												The rest of the games on my list are too popular, but many people I'm sure missed this. An interesting take on real-time strategy, you are only allowed a certain number of ships and can set them up before a mission. You must use tactics and your knowledge of what's effective against what to make it through, but you never quite know what's going to happen in each mission and there are plenty of surprises. Had amazing graphics for its time (that still hold up well today) and a decently interesting story, and some good ideas about mixing up the bog standard RTS play of today. Plus I just love space-based sci-fi games.			",339,86,6,63,42,2,74
