												Yet another unplayable release. Akella is a developer to be avoided. Crashes like hell, have to gut options to get it to run.Do not get. Could've been a cool war game/sim, but lazy developers get you lazy products.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												This game at least doesnt crash if you have the settings turned down.  It is ok - not a ton of fun but something to pass the time.  The real problem is that it is just slow to get to the action.			",932,283,50,129,138,9,186
