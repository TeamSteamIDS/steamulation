												595 hours of play at the time I wrote this probably says it all. The combat is lame, but the building element is supreme, and the game being so tweak-able, you don’t have to do both in the same game.Switch off the fighting and build. You’ll love it. 9\10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best in the series. My favourite type of game, this is the one you want if you're into the historical simulation, society building, sometimes warring type game. The gaming landscape is richer because of games like this.Source resources, combine, refine, build. Satisfy population demands, defend your islands. Manage complicated production chains with multiple traderoutes. Never a dull moment.. Throw in some rivals with varying difficulty and try not to be too gamey about it and you'll probably not even come out on top. It's a tough world out there, techs are simple but effective and you just have to make do with what you've got on available land. Graphics, audio and all of that jazz is fine, not fantastic but fine.			",116,29,24,20,30,0,36

												Anno 1404 offers a lot of fun and adventure. There is a lot to do and a lot to maintain in the game which makes it unque. Unlike games like Tropico and other city builders, Anno is set amonst trade which the player can set up trade route between other nations and colonies. The trading aspect of Anno is very good, it adds a important objective for the player to maintian their trade routes to gain money and to import goods you cannot gain inland. The building machinics of the game are very simple and quick, one click and your house is made - no waiting around for your buildings to be constructed. The actual management of your nation/empire is quite tricky for a starting player, you need to feed your populance, house them and protect them from pirates or other AI or players. Again, this offers another objective for the player.The detail of the game is really good, from the populance walking about in the streets to the people transporting goods around your island and to the harbour. Overall I rate:10/10I recomend this game to people who are fans of:Civ, Tropico, Simscity, AOE and Settlers.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The satisfaction of creating the perfect trade route to feed your growing population of nobles is fantastic. No other game I can think of gives the experience of seeing your city grow from a humble collection of hovels to a stone-clad metropolis with a thriving and bustling harbour, thronged with ships carrying spices and luxuries from the Orient and bread and beer from nearer to home. One of the best city-builders ever.			",36,5,0,7,25,0,34

												I love this game. I must say, it's difficult as f*ck. If you can't multitask nor function well in stressfull situations, you are going to have a bad time. But damn, this game is a challenge I'm willing to accept. It's a stragety based game with loads of options, that puts you in the shoes of a colonialist that has to transform islands into big, busy cities. You do this while completing small quests and fighting not only rebellion and pirates, but nature itself. It's tough in the beginning, I'm honest, but when you get the hang of it, it's simply amazing.			",119,19,6,15,12,1,11

												What to say... This game is full of treasures. Litteraly. You just have to launch an expedition or sink ships or dig up to find one... But I digress. I came to the Anno series a bit late, but this one game got me hooked up and never really let me go.You might think that only having two factions, that you have to play simultaneously, is not much and just skip to 2070. That would be a mistake : it just makes the game that much more  complex. Here, the supply lines do matter quite a lot, and so does the place you dedicate to your buildings (houses most of all).The combat system is interesting, although not the main point of the game, and in fact can get quite addicting after a while.And what to say of the overall feeling of the game ? The direction is stunning, for a game that is already packing some years. Visually overly rich, with so many effects... And don't get me started on the music. SeriouslY. Don't.That being said, if you do not like the city-building type of game, or the economic simulation, I cannot in all honestly recommand it to you, because it embodies much of the this type of game.

												And old pearl rediscovered just recently, Anno 1404 offers you a chance to build your own little ocean-colony-cluster at the Occidental-Oriental border. You can either follow the campaign (which is mainly a nicely narrated tutorial w/ substance) or go ahead and dive into the endless game, which can be customised to include some challenges like victory-conditions or island-difficulty.I say 'island' because that's your main business here - islands of all sizes somewhere in the ocean. They're your building-space, resource-pool and battlefield, though half the combat is fought on sea. In the endless game, islands are randomly generated and have different resources available, like certain fertilities or ore-deposits. You'll need to settle on multiple islands after some time in the game in order to provide for your citizens' needs, which develop as they do - Patricians have more elaborate needs than peasants. Up to three NPCs in different flavours. Great graphics - great game.			",218,34,4,40,54,1,46

												I'm and avid 4X gamer; Settlers, AOE, Civ, Anno series, etc. I've found that the more modern Anno series, i.e. 2070 and 2205 tend to be really far fetched and the graphics don't really do the games justice, let alone the gameplay of the more modern games. However, those that like to build and economy, nice cities, peaceful cities, settle new lands, trade goods, build ships, up the difficulty as you get better, etc, I'd strongly recommend Anno 1404. I've previously played Annoy 1602 probably 15 or so years ago now. I've also played 1701, and 1402 is thus far the most challenging, interesting and diverse. The great thing about 1404 vs 1602 and 1701, is that the scope of goods is a lot more diverse which makes for a more challenging game. Another reviewer wrote that there are endless settings to tweak, and I'd agree with that; so there's lots of flexibility to keep it interesting.The graphics on this game are a big step up from previous Anno games too, so the animals moving in the woods or the sea mammals and fish, all animate better. The land and mountain textures are a lot more diverse, meaning you don't get the 'samey' mountains of previous Anno versions. You've also got more diversely generated islands, which is great. I've so far only registered less than 10 hours on 1404, having probably logged in excesss of 500 on the other games, but this has been enough to tell me that Anno 1404 is worth the money. Don't buy this game if you just like going to war - I'd recommend other games for that. If you like developing cities, growing populations, doing mini challenges, improving city culture and services, settling new islands and trading goods, or kitting new goods to make better goods, then I'd highly recommend this game. ^ Probably the geekiest review ever, but hopefully it'll help some people make the right decision either way! >_<			",6,0,0,2,8,0,6

												Starts first game with medium AITotally thinks the AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥and I will stomp them allDeclares war with all AIGets rekt by amazing AI10/10 Would get rekt by AI againEDIT: Okay seriously I think this game deserves a proper review. Anno 1404 is a breath-taking view on city builder games, it's not easy to build a stunning metropolis. First you must meet your people's needs and even take things from other islands in order to satisfy the people. For example they need food, some source of drink, and entertainment. And some of that stuff can't even grow on your island! So you must go out and discover new lands that are fertile for the goods your people demand. Other things to account for are:Economy Management - Every building, every ship and every military building has a maintenence cost, and you must get more money from your people's taxes than the maintenece or your city coffer's will empty.Resources - Every island has the fertility for a certain rresource, whether that is wheat, hemp, cider, spices or mineral deposits such as stone, iron, and coal. However one island cannot have all these things, meaning that you will have to go to new lands, get a different variety of goods from other islands and take them by ship to your main island. But even that isn't easy! You have to make warships to escort your defenseless trading ships and protect them from other players, or pirates that may want to shatter your economy by plundering trade routes! Protection/Competition - Aswell as building up your city, and finding resources to meet people's needs, you must also protect yourself against players that want to declare war by building watchtowers, harbour defenses and a giant wall around your city. Of course all of this costs money and can set you back. However destruction of other players isn't the only thing that you can do to win the game! You can configure things so that maybe to win the game you must have a certain amount of people living in your town, or you must build a cathedral before someone else does! This calls for some amazing competition between players and can lead to massive wars as the competition rises in tension.Graphics - In don't want to drool on too much about mere graphics, but for this game's time it has some excellent graphics, and it just makes the game look fantastic.Story - The game also features a fantastic story-line in the campaign which also functions as a tutorial, the story has some great characters each with a unique personality, and a brilliant and exiting plot twist at the end. It is well written and deserves commendation. Tweakable stuff - So let's assume maybe you love the city building aspect, however you really don't like having to defend yourself and do the combat in this game. Well, this game is still good for you as it features certain scenarios and tweakables that allow you to completely turn off the combat, and just have a nice city building game in a peaceful world. And of course the opposite, where you must destroy everyone!All in all this is a perfect game for RTS lovers like me and city building/management games. I recommend this game more than any other as it is perfect for me. I don't know how good it is compared to other Anno games like 2070 and the other futuristic one, I am yet to try them. But definately give this game a try if you like city builders with a touch of nice combat too!If you read this far then thank you for reading my review, and be sure to give me a friend request if you want to play this game with me!

												An elemental management game. Colourfull and detail graphics, funny but shallow, with a mechanics too basic and illogic: in settlements no relates population number with business opened or town category. The social pyramid gradually reverses. People pay tribute even without work. Not gives access to core buldings since the begining. Lacks of a price system based on supply and demand, can buy and sell a lot for same price at same place. Naval combats are simple and not consider wind effect. Recommended for newbies by its friendly development, nice ambientation, and secondary missions that increase sense of replaying; the veterans will note that it no pretend to be a deep realistic simulator.Visit  the ""must have"" guides on internet to learn about Needs, Population, Taxation, Terminology, Trade and Production Chains.

												Deep and rewarding city building and resource management that's incredibly frustrating in the best way possible.A few golden rules I've deduced during my playtime:- Don't rush it.- Develop your Occidental and Oriental settlements at equal paces.- When expanding your settlement with a new marketplace/bazaar, don't upgrade every new inhabitant to the highest possible level right away. Fill the new space with peasant houses, add fishing huts/cider farms as necessary. Rinse and repeat with each inhabitant level.- You will, at some point, have to import a certain amount of EVERY resource in the game, If you wanna have any chance of making it to Metropolis or higher.

												A strangly addictive and equally frustrating game!I have played through the first few story scenarios and find them intertaining if a bit slow to progress... I have spent most of my time in the continuous mode which is basically a do as you like mode. The great thing about this is the amount of pre-game customisation, so you can make it as easy (or hard) as you like...The only frustration is in this mode it can be difficult to ensure you have enough money to mantain your buildings etc and not run out and cause game ending bankruptcy (although there are tried and tested trainers out there) however if you start slow and make sure you are producing and trading enough items through your ports it can be done (note it gets easier the more you play with the produce increasing in value as you unlock the raw materials to produce higher quality items)One very handy tool that I discovered by accident (it may be explained in a later scenario) is just above the map in the bottom right are two stats, clicking on these displays extra data, including current tax income and expenditure, which is hugely helpful to ensure you stay in the black.Overall a great game in which to lose several hours, and I will be, for sure trying the next two when I get board of this one!

												While the game is made with some love for graphical details, it simply misses the depth of any build-up strategy game before 2000. Where in Civilization there are several paths to win the game, Anno is always the same: build everything as efficient as possible. There is no either-or. Often the game does not obey to its own rules. There is a Corsairs nest with no option to get rid of it, no matter how big one's navy is. At some point the player is better off by paying them not to attack because they are a nuisance which distracts from the build-up part. The campaign offers missions, but in the end they are really just about doing what some advisor tells. The main difficulty is to find out whether for fullfilling the task some where-is-Waldo game is needed. There is not much openess about the open world. To the degree that I tend to attack the computer opponents just to have something to do between waiting for resources piling up to build some more.Which brings me to the battles: On sea it is basically smaller ship vs. bigger ship. Build big ships and you win, build small ones and they sink. But at least there is some tension when reinforcements have to cross half the map and victory and loss are still open. The land battles on the other hand are just clumsy. I take Civ's approach of making one unit disappear to the tedious battles, which in no way capture the spirit of medieval warfare and just go on forever.In the end the game is more disappointing than bad. It offers a lot but fails to bring all game mechanics in line. It makes me miss the real strategy classics and ends up being just one more casual game.			",131,75,2,16,35,1,38

												It's beautiful, enchanting and addictive, but if you're into city builders and love the natural feel to a city that has a life of it's own then it may not be for you. For all it's good points, I couldn't help but harken to what anno isn't. New players will suddenly realise that you can't just build what you want where you want, the extreme siphoning of your gold on anything that isn't planned for efficiency is ridiculous, so that building something because it looks organic and pretty and that's how humans normally build will eat away at your profit to the point that your colonial venture will crumble in on itself. This leads to you having to build in a boring, mathematically efficient style that makes any production chain look as if humans have been conquered by a race of accountant aliens who push efficiency, efficiency, efficiency! The lack of a pause button means that you have to plan and execute your city building as your cash drains away and you can't even pause while you're setting up your trade routes which means anything happening while you're catching up with company business - fires, attacks from rivals, tornado's, locusts, the second coming, will all push for your attention so that you lose track of what you're doing and have to start all over.I always think that if anno1404 and Banished (colonial charter) where to have a love child it would be quite possibly one of the greatest games of all time, sadly, it doesn't seem set to happen, so until then, enjoy the whimsy characters, the pretty view and remember, efficiency, efficiency, efficiency!

												Anno 1404 is a good solid game that you would expect. I cant review much as i have not had much game time with the game but when i have played of it is a great Anno franchise. If your into city building with set objectives and a good stroy then buy it! 8/10.			",177,25,9,22,39,1,19

												Some of the most beautiful graphics any game has ever had. Gameplay is very well balanced, and the sandbox experience is very engaging. If you like city builders, strategy games, civ-like games, this is for you. I do like the fact that it's not very heavily influenced by military actions. I always prefered the economical and social aspects of these sort of games.			",93,66,4,27,35,3,34

												This game will make you afraid of red downward arrows. Your citizens are incredibly vain and willing to burn down the whole town because they don't have any books to read.The game is fun but the user interface is atrocious and gets worse the more you play. By unlocking people you unlock tabs and by the end you will have five tabs for storage buildings and production.The big battles at sea are total cluster♥♥♥♥, all the units clip inside eachother and make it impossible to understand what is going on.Still better then Anno 2040 tho.

												Average city building game that is missing depth and gets boring really fast. I never thought I would say this but Tropico 3+ games that sometimes take forever to win one mission even on max times speed are more fun than this. The constantly poping main missions and side missions and city actually responding to your actions make Tropico way more fun than the dull experience of Anno 1404. Anno will make you stare on a ship slowly getting to its destination without any possibility to speed up time. Your city feels completely dead and making people happy is no challenge. And what is going on with the production buildings dont need any population to function feature? People just run around doing nothing and magically spawning money that you immediately milk from them to pay the magical gnomes that actually work. Pharaoh and Tropico are far superior to this game in every angle.Rating 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For some reason this didn't get me. It isn't hard to play but understanding how this game works is pretty hard for me. Whatever I do, the AI players are much stronger already. This game is not about slowly building your own town, it's about building efficiently, even if the end result looks nothing like a real town/city. You constantly get nagged by missions you don't have time for. You can build residential and working areas that are not connected by roads, still works and is actually more efficient that building a town the way everyone would do. after a very short playtime everything becomes repetitive. No seasons, no build time for buildings, material volumes are odd (I can have 40t of wood, build like 20 houses from that but a single small ship can carry 40t too... I don't know, Banished was  a much better experience. This game feels dated - it probably unfolds it's strengths in the long run, but it doesn't offer anything to make me stay until then.Diplomacy didn't work for me, I could't even interact with some factions, then suddenly one did muster armies and overrun my island.

												Perhaps I have not played this game enough to write a decent review, but I am struggling to find a reason to recommend this game, let alone play it further.Pros: Nice voice overs.Cons: Average graphics running on a very poorly optimised game engine. Larger maps lead to excessive load times. The graphics can be choppy especially when compared to more graphically impressive rivals. Boredom seems the norm for the early levels. Some 'obvious'/basic game mechanics are not explained very well, which can lead to confusion.I am trying my best to complete a few of the tasks at a time, before getting bored and exiting the game. Once I have played more chapters, I will try to expand my review.			",67,9,2,16,11,0,18

												STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! OMG! Baught it for me and a friend so we could play together... Well, not so easy.It was on 75% sale when I got it, and after downloading it would not run!After 12 hours, they fixed it so we could actually run the game.But turns out, you need the DLC to play multiplayer?! How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that.So I thought, well, let's just get the DLC (Venice), it is on sale so it does not cost much.NOPE, they turned the price back up. So now the DLC is gonna cost me 4 times more than the game cost me.Gonna try to refund. Never got to play the game. Never looking back. I hate ubisoft!PS: Singleplayer probably works, but I only play multiplayer with friends.			",242,29,4,13,13,2,17

												This game is awful. The game has a supposed tutorial, but it doesn't explain all of the cryptic mechanics. I spend half of the game resorting to Google in order understand how to do basic stuff. Maybe the game gets better after you become a master cryptographer and understand how this♥♥♥♥♥♥works.Just to illustrate what is wrong with Anno 1404 I'll give the example that was the last straw. Loading and unloading goods like wood, tools and fish is self-evident. You just drag and drop stuff between the ship and a warehouse. However, in one mission I had to send stone from one island to another. Now stone is not stored in your warehouse, instead it's up in an abstract bar on top of the screen. Or maybe it is in the warehouse but I just didn't find it. Maybe there's a special button in the HUD you have to find to access your stone reserves. Anyway, I managed to build a Stonemason's hut near a quarry or stone pit or whatever. It definitely produced some stone, and I saw a guy bring it to the warehouse in a cart. I saw on the bar on top of screen that there is stone there, but I didn't figure out how to load the stone onto the ship. Google didn't help either. That's when I decided, I've had enough.This was just one example of how cryptic it is to do basic stuff in Anno 1404. If it sounds fun to you, knock yourself out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
