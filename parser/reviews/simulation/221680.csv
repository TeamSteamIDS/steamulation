												Having played guitar for nearly seven years now in rock, metal, blues, and jazz, I was really needing something that put interest back into playing, like a new piece of gear. I found that in Rocksmith, and played it nearly 35 hours in my first five days of owning it. I love having the callouses back. That being said, the game is not perfect. I'll make a simple rundown of pros and cons for simplicity.Pros:- Definitely inspires you to play and learn songs. Whether you find your own style of playing before or after you learn a steaming pile of songs, it's always good to learn said steaming pile of songs. Rocksmith will definitely help you do this in a fun, relaxed, pseudo-Guitar Hero environment.- Has a nearly flawless session mode where you can construct your own band that has a wide variety of styles, sounds, progressions, and can play in all the basic modes and scales with all 12 roots. It also has a very helpful and changable neck layout to show you exactly what scale they recommend you use. This is like a loop station +4, people!- Songs have a fluid difficulty. If the game sees you rock, it'll make the next bit a little bit harder. If it sees you're having a lot of trouble, it'll dial it down. This spans from pretty much root notes only to having every note be invisible. This game has an infuriating way of making you learn songs ;).- Has a sometimes helpful section repeater for every song.- Has a MASSIVE amp emulator where you can try out digital versions of generic and some name brand gear to see what you want for a new song or purchase. These are all dependant on the quality of your computer speakers of course, but it's still nice to have a reference.- You can change your tone in the middle of a song if you despise song's preset tone.- An interesting pro, this program's DLC and price per song is generally roughly the same if not cheaper than sheet music, and you get a lot more. You get to hear the song, see a visual representation of how it's played, get alternate lead, rhythm, and bass parts, and a preview of how the guitarist got their tone with the amp emulator. Plus you get to beat the snot out of it over and over and score points.- There are several other little pros scattered throughout, but these are the big ones.Cons:- My worst complaint with the game: Some of the ways this game has you play songs are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS (yes, I mean to shout), and there's no way to change what frets it wants you to play from what I can tell. Fortunately, the game is just based on tone recognition, so if you can play it on a different string and it's easier for you, do it that way. Problem is, you have to ditch the way the game wants you to play at that point, so there's no on screen reference. For example, Are You Mine by the Arctic Monkies has you sliding all around the neck. I have learned to play it to where I hardly have to move from the second fret. Ultimately, this is kind of beneficial, as you should be learning the way you want to play, and hopefully that's without having to watch the Rocksmith screen. On a similar note, some of the rookie ways of playing songs can actually be harder than the advanced way because you don't know all of what's being played. This is a problem for me as an advanced guitarist because it's easier for me to play by chord names rather than some stepwise building of chords throughout the song.- The other pretty unfortunate bit of this game is that it has a serious case of death-by-interface when you're first starting out. Everything the guitarist played on the song has to come down this alley at you and convey, in it's entirety, everything about that note: string, fret, duration, slidel vibrato, bend, temolo picking, harmonics, tapping, hammerons, pulloffs, anything that the guitarist could do has to be contained in that one tiny note flying toward you, and it's one of several at a time. The game will modulate this problem a bit by removing some of the extra things like bends and tremolo, but this is still serious information overload, so be prepared to have some difficulty with reading what's happening for a pretty long time.- The nearly flawless session mode's one flaw is that it changes dynamically with how you play, which in terms of musical expression, is not always the best way to do it. Do you want to rip a screaming solo while the band lays back? Ehh... This will have problems figuring out what you want. Conversely, are you trying to rip a screaming solo, and the band's dying away? This happens too, especially when your guitar is producing rather low output like with tapping. It may be great to change with the band, but when you both follow each other, pretty soon the band stops playing 'cause you're too quiet.- The riff repeater can slow down parts and manually change difficulty, which is good, but all these parts are pre-determined by the game. If you have a problem with one part at the very end of a solo, it's very likely you'll have to play through the whole solo a billion times to get it right and understand what you're doing, which may or may not be a good thing. Also, and this is infuriating, the slowing down of a song has no metronome or click track that I can find, and past about 80% speed, the audio quality is so bad you can't tell what's happening anyways. Good luck finding a tempo here. You're better off just watching what is happening at slow speed and trying to master it at full speed from there.- The tone recognition isn't perfect, and it never is. This is extremely frustrating if you're going for note streaks, mastery score, and basic video game statistics. I've missed chords in the middle of strumming a long line of the same chords just because the game herps a derp (It was punk rock. 1/8th note power chords? Don't tell me I randomly missed one lol).- A few nitpicky things here: On the minigames, the notifications can seriously get in the way of what you're trying to see so you can play the right thing. The score attack sounds are also extremely distracting when you're trying to rock your awesomest.- And a technical note from one player to another: Always tune up. The game seems to hint that as long as you tune down to the right note (say for drop D), you're good. This is not always the case, especially if your strings are a little too thick for your nut. They can stay just a hair too tight on the playing end compared to the segment after the nut. This means that as soon as you bend or play one of the strings, your tension will equalize and you'll be slightly flat. So remember: Always go below the note you want and come up from below it. This could concieveably make you slightly sharp, but if you're having that much problem with string tensions, you need to get your nut slots widened for your apparently super-thick monster-tendon He-man/Hercules strings.So, on the whole: Is it awesome? Yes. Will you learn guitar? Yes. Will you learn songs? Yes. Will you happily lose track of hours of your life? Yes. The review officially ends here, but I have a few personal notes for the dedicated reader.Just remember while you're playing this game, take the time to learn what's comfortable and right for you. Just because Rocksmith says you should play a song a certain way doesn't make it right. You'll love guitar that much more if you find your own voice on it. This game will definitely teach you to play if that's what you're looking for, but always try to put your own spin on what you learn afterwards. For example, the game doesn't recognize if you play more notes than are in the song, so I always add my own licks, fills, and harmonies when my part gets quiet just so I can get a better feel for what I would want the song to sound like. By all means quote songs you love and guitarists you idolize, but don't become a riff junkie who brings nothing new to the table. Put your own inflections on their ideas, because that's what makes your playing interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic and is a must-buy if you play guitar. If you don't play guitar and are curious, it's actually good enough that I'd still recommend getting it. It is far and away my favorite music game on the market.Be warned that it's more of a guitar practice tool than a game. But that's exactly what it should be: a practice tool that has just enough game-y design to keep it interesting, but not so much that it gets in the way of practicing. The only linear progression the game has is in the form of ""missions"" along the side of the menus that encourage you to try different things. You can ignore them entirely if you want, but sometimes they are very helpful (especially the ones associated with the Session mode, which teach you bits of relevant music theory). It's a well-designed experience.The interface is very slick and the game has no loading time or lengthy transitions between browsing and playing songs. This is great news because the interface was the main flaw in Rocksmith 1. ""Riff repeater"" phrase rehearsing options are integrated into the pause menu, so you can drop into them on the fly while playing songs.The soundtrack is excellent. It has hits (Knights of Cydonia, Paranoid Android, etc), more obscure music with fun guitar parts, and even a few tracks from small indie bands I have never heard of. The song Stay In by Jaws is one of the indie songs that stuck out to me. And it's very worth it to import Rocksmith 1 songs -- they have had their tabs updated to fix inaccuracies and to use new features in the new game (RS1 DLC songs have be updated as well).The game has a Session mode, where you can load backing instruments, jam, and have them follow along with you. It's alright. It's implemented well and has a ton of options, but I and other friends find it odd that it follows you, rather than maintaining a constant rhythm for you to improv over. Your mileage may vary with it, but it's a welcome addition.There are also a number of Guitarcade mini-games that focus on various guitar techniques. They are a distraction for when you're bored with performing songs, but some of them are pretty amusing. There is even a House of the Dead 2 spoof where you play chords to shoot zombies.I'm an amateur guitarist, but it's thanks to Rocksmith that I've kept up with practicing as frequently as I have. When learning an instrument it's easy to get bored when it turns into a grind and you don't know what music to try. You need some structure. Rocksmith is that structure, and it makes it easy to practice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, Rocksmith 2014 (now remastered!), the sequel to Rocksmith and a game, which is claimed to be 'the fastest way to learn guitar' (and bass). I'm here to elaborate on this statement. First, I'd like to answer some potential questions related to the game.  Q: ""What do I need and how do I start?"" A: Well, it IS in a way a guitar teacher, so you will obviously need a guitar or bass (notice: it can't be a classic or acoustic guitar) and the Real Tone Cable, so I advise the reader to buy the Rocksmith bundled WITH the cable. From what I heard, there was also a bundle with the guitar, but since I already had a guitar, I decided to buy Rocksmith for Xbox 360 with the cable. Starting is relatively simple, you plug the cable in your guitar and the computer, read the manual, and start the game. Q:""Will I learn to play it like a super pro?"" A: I can't guarantee anything, it depends on YOU and YOUR dedication. If you want to master the guitar, you will have to train hard. Q:""How long will it take for me to master the guitar/bass?"" A: Once again, it takes some people a couple of months to get really good, some might train for years. I learned the guitar in two years. Now, questions aside, I should write down pros, cons, features and setbacks of the game. Pros:  -You can play this game anytime. Unlike having scheduled lessons, choosing the perfect time is up to the player. -This is not just a teacher. Rocksmith has many other features, which will be written down below. -Huge amount of DLC. You can buy lots of songs you prefer, from Social Distortion to The Smashing Pumpkins. -Cable versatility. If you, say, bought an Xbox 360 Rocksmith 1 version with the cable, like me, you can still play the PC version of Rocksmith 2014. -You can finally play without the cable! Yes, that's right, if you have a microphone, you can connect it to your computer and play the acoustic guitar! Alternatively, you could choose to play without any input, although this way most of the game's features won't be available. Cons: -Poor song selection. Not that I want to say there are more bad songs than good, there are just not enough free songs bundled with the original game. However, if you're willing to pay, there are lots of songs listed as DLC in the store.  Features: -Guitar lessons, Rocksmith 2014 includes over 80 interactive lessons to help teach you almost every technique associated with guitar and bass. -Session mode, where you can assemble and play with a virtual band. -Mini-games. Yes, Rocksmith 2014 includes mini-games, concerning different techniques. -The tuner. You will also be provided with a variety of guitar tunings to choose from. Not all Rocksmith 2014 songs are in E standard tuning. You can choose from several open tunings, as well as Eb, Drop D, C; D, C#, C standard and many more. And now you can even skip it! -The chord book. It's not much of a book, but it sure has lots of different chords. Diminished, augmented, 13th, they're all there. Setbacks: -Uplay account requirement. Yes, unfortunately, you will have to create a Uplay account to play Rocksmith 2014. However, I somehow managed to start Rocksmith 2014 directly through steam, so I suppose it is no longer necessary. Apparently, however, now it's not a requirement. You COULD use it once or twice in order to unlock special songs and arrangements, but for the most part it's unnecessary.Of course, I could not fit all of the things I wanted to say, but I believe it is enough to form the reader's opinion.In conclusion, I would like to say that if you want to learn to play the guitar/bass and don't know anybody who can teach it, or just want to have fun in the game and play your favorite songs, Rocksmith 2014 would be one of the best solutions. Do get the game if you get the chance!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is not an ADVANCED system for learning guitar. Nor is a complete system. It doesn't provide much background in music theory, nor does it provide support for reading either music or tabs. However it is a GREAT tool for the beginner. This is because Rocksmith 2014 gets you to play the instrument from the first lesson. And it is fun. It's a LOT of fun. After over a year enjoying it I'm finding a natural limit to its usefulness. But great game and highly recommended for the beginner,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game since Christmas 2013 and let me tell you. THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE! I didn't even know how to hold a guitar or do a chord. Now I can rock out to my favorite songs from System of a down to Marvin Gaye. If you've never played any guitar and you want to be able to play your favorite songs, this game is for you!Enjoy being a rockstar!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is interesting and fun even if you don’t want to learn guitar.Pros:It really teaches you.Informative.You can play it even if you don’t have any experience with guitar.Many lessons.Various mini-games.Riff-repeater (you can repeat part of a song, slow it down, see your mistakes etc.)Session mode - good way to learn scales.Good price.Cons:No music theory lessons (It would be great to have at least beginner level)..RS2014 miss some notes (especially low E string on first frets).Game will count some notes and chords even if you miss them or play wrong (for example palm\fret muting).Song progress freezes - you can play song for 90%+ accuracy/mastery, but some parts of song still stay on “easy level” (To fix this you need start that part in Riff-repeater on 100% and then press “resume song” from ESC.menu.).No global statistics (like those huge graphs of your success etc.)About the game:Half of my life I listened metal\rock\electronic rock music, but I never thought about playing e-guitar, then I saw this game and listened Amon Amarth - As Loke Falls (omg I love that intro - I tried to learn it when I was creating this review, and now I can play it, now I must focus on alternate picking to play all song). RS2014 interested me - you can play and you can learn, this was something new to me. So I bought this game ,cheap guitar and cable to try it.Good interface, interesting modes, various guitar amp\pedal effect settings. There are a lot of DLC’s (official and not) - you can find almost all you want from reggae (which is not represented in game) to game music. Game freezes sometimes (like once in week for me, may be that because of broken unofficial DLC). Overall game is good and worth money.I started with games - simple Nintendo-like games like duck shooting, street racers e.t.c. After like 10 hours of playing I decided that it is time to try some songs - playing with you favourite bands that is something, even hitting 1 string is super fun, I never had so much fun playing games.After like week of “playing” songs I decided that it is time for next step “Lessons”. Rocksmith covers like 80-90% of all you need to know about guitar playing only questions I had\have are about my better posture\picking\sitting\guitar holding methods\thumb position.I played every day for 1 hour minimum. Whole month I played lessons and after I finished all to 80-100% “score” I thought “Now I am ready to Rock \m/!”. RS2014 have very interesting thing - “Session mode” where you can play along selected instruments, learn scales or use metronome. So after I “finished” lesson mode - I launched Session mode to Rock like hell.  I hit strings and instead of epic music heard nothing even close to what normal people call “music” that was random note pickings\bends. “I suck”, “Time to uninstall and die”, “60 day challenge”...So what was wrong with me or is it game? -nothing is wrong here, you can’t play like Slash after 2 months in Rocksmith, sorry. Then where is problem, why I felt so badly? I could play some songs like to 90%, but when I try session - almost nothing (I can play some parts from songs but no improvisation). Main reason for that is - game teach you how to play Guitar, but almost nothing about how to play music. You can learn how to drive a car, but how you will ride if you don’t know any rules? And that was the answer for my suffering - game gives you good start, then you must walk by yourself - and here comes youtube, books, lessons etc. After Rocksmith you will feel more comfortable with guitar, you will understand what that cool guy on youtube says about technique.And I continued to practice, even more every day. I watched many videos on youtube, read forums about techniques (how I hate my boney fingers when I practice bar chords). Next I decided to buy new guitar and amp to practice without RS.2 months after that (5 total in RS) I hear some melodies and clean sound when I play , I still can’t play good improvisation, but I can see progress - from someone who picks string, then looks at monitor and picks next one, to someone who can play some songs to 90-100% and play without RS2014. With all my progress I still think that I suck - and that is normal too, it is called “Learning”. More you play more critical you become to yourself. I still play RS everyday, downloaded many DLC’s - some easy, some hard. With time you will play better, you will see mistakes what you are making (wrong finger placement, wrong hand position) and understand how to fix them - for example now I more and more try to place my fingers correctly and mute strings that aren’t used when I play, month ago I hadn't even thought about it.Worst thing in all this is when I start comparing time wasted on other games and time I played Rocksmith. 169h in RS gave me more emotions, skill, progression and joy than all other games with 4000h+ together - so much time wasted.Try Rocksmith, it can change your life.Some thoughts about game:Many people ask same question over and over again: “Meh cool, but can you play without RS? Can? Silly game!”Well there are 2 different things - learning song and playing it. You can read book many times, but you still can’t repeat it word by word - same with songs. It is possible to play without Rocksmith if you Learn a song.Don’t waste your time and go to real teacher.Well that is good advice. I even hear stories, that in our small city we have someone who can teach you for bottle of vodka for 1 lesson (1-2 hours). Some people don’t have money for teachers. And even if you take lessons - Rocksmith can help you learn faster (session mode\or repeater). Plus this game is cheap,and you can buy it on Summer sale.Ubisoft:Only problems I had with game are freezes (only killing process helps) when you start song. And I think because of bad Custom DLC songs. Game runs without lags, no sound delays, easy interface.Real Tone Cable:There are horror stories about how often this cable breaks - I use it every day and it still working without any problems. Also I heard there are cheap alternatives.DLC:Official are made by Ubisoft with all copyrights etc. and are sold for money (you can buy them twice cheaper on Sale). Unofficial DLC’s made by users\players and can be downloaded for from customsforge.com. There are many songs from games - try search: Doom, Morrowind, Skyrim, Darren Korb (Bastion), Mass Effect M4 Part II by Faunts - 8 minute song which will melt your hands :D and many more. Gear:My first guitar was Rocktile Pro ST60-BK (also bought real tone cable).Now I have Epiphone Les Paul Standard (Black), Marshall MG10CF amp, Boss DS-1 pedal.Useful lessons (search on Youtube):Steve Stine,Lessonface,SecretGuitarTeacher, BB King Guitar Lessons.justinguitar.comThank you for reading, I hope that my experience with RS2014 help you make decision to buy it (or not.).

												Let me begin by saying that I am an experienced guitarist, playing for 34 years, and therefore I am unable to provide a beginner's view of this software. If you are a beginner reading this review, please understand that I can't fully appreciate the suitability of this software to your personal needs as a new player. I hope that you will still find my review useful.RS2014 is an interactive songbook which features fully notated guitar and bass arrangements for a great many popular songs, mainly from the past few decades. The base content is diverse, and the DLC includes a wide variety of genres and styles with the abilty to download band or theme packs or individual songs. Many songs have two guitar parts, plus bass. Not all songs have two guitar parts, but you'll find plenty to keep you busy.The way the notation is presented may be difficult to get used to at first, especially if you are used to using TAB up until now, but you will adapt to it and find it quite intuitive. Beginners seem to have little trouble adapting where experienced players may be more....resistant :XRS2014 is the ultimate practice tool, motivating you to pick up the instrument often and therefore practice regularly. There are lesson features and technique guides which cover many aspects of guitar playing, like hammer-ons, slides, harmonics, pull-offs, etc. Some arcade style games are included, using the guitar as the controller. These games are designed to improve your skills and muscle-memory.A session mode includes a band that dynamically plays according to your own playing intensity. This is a useful jamming tool, and good for practicing and learning scales.'Learn A Song' is the main part of Rocksmith, and the notation will be simplified at first, then as you improve it gets harder until you have the whole tune. At the end of each song you will get stats on the percentage of correct notes hit and your longest continuous streak. This is a fun way to learn new songs and you always have something ready to practice, just a few clicks away.With very few acceptions, the songs are the actual recordings by original artists, so you'll be playing along to tracks that sound like they should. Additionally, your guitar tone will sound like the guitar in the recorded version, allowing you to play the song more authentically. This raises the immersion and enjoyment level as well. I don't know if the emulation is perfect, but it is certainly very good.For added motivation you can use the leaderboards, though I don't personally, but many others do and seem to enjoy the challenge very much.You need the Real Tone Cable to use this software. I like RS2014 so much I bought an extra cable. Check online stores. One cable is compatible with all platforms and works with guitar or bass.There are literally thousands of hours of value to be found amongst the core content and the additional songs available as DLC. This is not a game, this is a guitar practice portal. Rocksmith is a digital interface for an interactive guitar tutorial/songbook which encourages you to practice, makes you want to play, helps you hone your techniques, and teaches you songs.Rock on, brothers and sisters.Oh - and Hendrix. So, yeah.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just uninstalled it. After ~ 170 hours.Because I wanna sell my pc.For money.That I will spend on a new guitar.*Edit: (now its kinda a real review ;D) I started with this game/program and it helped me to teach myself a little of guitar but mainly bass, and it helps you a lot to become familiar with your instrument and the techniques. This was great for me because I already knew music theory from my epic Sax playing :P After some time you can simply switch to normal tabs/sheets with tabs like me. If you start learning songs in Rocksmith, you should REALLY practice through a real Amp, too, because, no matter how well your system is set up, you HAVE a delay with the Rocksmith Interface Cable. This confuses your ""sense of rythm"" or how you wanna call it on the instrument and really makes it almost impossible to play faster stuff (I noticed it on Toxicity by SOAD) if you really hear yourself playing with that delay. But for a total guitar beginner it was great in my experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a guitar Player. I've been playing it for over 15 years. I bought the game out of curiosity, and what can I say? It impressed me. I remember my days learning to play guitar. The basics are crucial. The exercise and motivation are crucial. It is very difficult to do it by yourself. I needed a teacher for over 6 months before I could start searching and learning things on my own. With Rocksmith you have a teacher at your place. Not only have everything you need to learn to play guitar, but it’s also fun for people that already know how to play. People compare this to Guitar Hero, saying it’s like Guitar Hero but with a real guitar. I wouldn’t say that. Guitar Hero it’s an awesome and fun game, but what Guitar Hero can teach you musically ends in maybe a month. I think Guitar Hero can teach you a little bit of rhythm, but that’s it.The only issue you might have is that you need the cable to play it. Also, it does not support a lot of Audio Cards, so if you have a good Card installed, you will have to switch it to the one that came with your motherboard or so. That is my only complaint. I have a Monster Cable with a M-Audio interface, and I need to use the cable they give me. I don’t buy the whole “it’s to protect us from piracy crap”… but oh well.Buy the game if you want to learn to play guitar or just have fun ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rocksmith 2014I'm absolutely in love with this game. Learning to play guitar or bass has never been more fun than this. All you need is your electric guitar or bass of choice, the game and a cable that you can buy in a lot of stores that sell things related to music or just electronics in general. When you first start up the game you get to set up a few things just so that you get the most out of your Rocksmith experience. I went with the option of starting out as someone who has never played guitar previously although I did have some knowledge about how to play. If my memory isn't failing me you get to calibrate and tune your guitar before the game lets you continue onwards. The game then explains the basics and how the layout of the so called 'Note Highway' will show you what notes to hit on the guitar. After you've made it through the basics you're ready to go! At the start menu there are a lot of options to choose from such as 'Learn a song', 'Lessons' and 'Guitarcade'. As most other people I went with Learn a song instantly because I was so excited to start playing songs. If you chose the option of starting out as a complete beginner the game will take it easy in the beginning by only giving you a few notes now and then. It will feel slow but it was still enjoyable for me. The way this works is that the more notes you hit and the better you do will increase the amount of notes you get on screen. This is called 'Dynamic Difficulty' and is one of the main reasons Rocksmith actually works as well as it does.I would recommend starting out in Lessons learning some more of the basic stuff like posture, picking and how to use a strap if you want to play while standing up. I think that most people, like me prefer sitting down when playing Rocksmith or they just don't have a strap to stand up. There are a lot of great lessons ranging from the more simple techniques like chords to the advanced stuff like tapping.Something that a lot of beginners tend to neglect is the Guitarcade, I really think that the Guitarcade is one of the most important features of Rocksmith as the mini-games are fun and help you build up muscle memory that you will need if you want to play the guitar. One of the best mini-games for me is the 'String skip saloon' as it helps you learn to hit the right strings without looking. 'Ducks ReDux' is another important one teaching you the distance between the frets of your chosen instrument.The most commonly asked question is probably: ""Does Rocksmith 2014 really work?""Yes! It most definitely works. It provides the motivation and fun aspect needed to learn to play the guitar and your favourite songs. If you are thinking about buying this game and your biggest concern is ""does it actually work?"" then buy it and see for yourself, I can guarantee that you will atleast to some degree improve your playing and general technique.Rocksmith 2014 has to be one of my favourite games of all time just because of how detailed and enjoyable it is. A function that I didn't even discuss but is a great way to get better is the 'Riff Repeater'. It lets you slow down and practice certain sections of a song or a lesson and really fiddle around with a lot of settings to make it easier for you to learn. Also in 'Session mode' you can jam with AI musicians playing scales at your own tempo and with a lot of different instruments.10/10- Liam			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you think the first one was good, Rocksmith 2014 is light years ahead! RS2014 is faster, better and harder, automatic tone switching is awesome and the system that recognizes the notes has been improved and you will have to play really good if you want a good score, it's more responsive to mistakes but if you have problem with a riff or section the Riff Repeater will help you in a faster and simpler way.Guitarcade is simply awesome, that section alone is worth the price of the game but if you're still hesitating, the game includes the Session Mode, that mode is simply one of the best innovations that  I've seen in game history, seriously Rocksmith 2014 can be considered a game only because it's entertaining and fun but this software is a state of the art learning tool, it should be sold in instruments stores. If you're willing to spend $100 an hour on a teacher better grab Rocksmith 2014 and use it to improve your skills, to get faster, to master some techniques, the first years of learning at music schools are always frustrating, hours and hours and hundreds of dollars to play boring scales, RS2014 will help you with that, you'll feel motivated and with practice and dedication you will be a better guitar or bass player, after that if you still want some proper music education you can always pay for lessons or a teacher but you won't struggle anymore with the basics and your teacher will see that you're not a beginner but a Rocksmith player, the real stuff!!! Now do yourself a favor and get rid of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plastic joke, yeah I'm talking about that piece of crap Rock Band and Guitar Hero call a guitar LOL.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is not only for beginners who want to learn how to play, but also for fairly experienced players who wants to improve their skills or simply take advantage of the many tools in-game. There are several modes:''Learn A Song'' which allows you to play along to one of the songs that are included in the game or can be bought as a DLC. It might be remind you a bit about games like Guitar Hero. The difficulty adapts after how good you are, and get harder and harder as you learn more and more.  ''Session Mode'' gives you a virtual band to play with! You can customize and choose your scales, tempo, groove, atmosphere (club, studio, arena) and what instruments that is in your band. Or you can load up a stock one, like ''Electric Blues'' or ''Psychedelic Rock'' all after what music you intend to play.There are also a whole catalouge of lessons that learns you everything from playing chords and the basic scales (and even how to hold your guitar, lel), through harmonics, hammer-on's and pull-off's, to the master classes. Also there are arcade style mini-games that let's you train on your tecnhicques. Temple of Bends, Scale Warrior and Harmonic Heist are some examples. Along with that you get some very useful tools. The tuner which allows you not only to standardize your tuning, but also change into different tunings based on the song you are playing. So it might be smart to plan ahead so you aren't stuck too long in the tuner. Also you get ''Tone Editor'' which allows you to change your effects, pedals and amps. Coolest product placement ever with Eden, Orange and Marshall. Every song that you play also have an ''authentic tone'' that loads up when you start the song. If for example the solo and the riff has different tones in a song it changes automatically. You can also load up these in Tone Editor so you can play with it in Session Mode. The included songs ranges from hits like ''My Generation'' and ''We Are The Champions'' to songs from underated indie bands that no one has ever heard of. Try to play every song, you might find something you like. If you have the original Rocksmith you can import them with updated tabs or you can buy it if you didn't own it previosly.Looking at the large amount of DLC, it's easy to think of this as another ''DLC: The Game'' but it isn't. New songs are released to this game constantly, but the artists need to be paid. So you have to pay for the license.If a song you like hasn't been released however, you can download custom songs for free using some modding tools. They might be faulty however since they are made by sparetime modders. There are some things to remember though: This is not Rock Band or Guitar Hero. You might and should have fun while playing this game, but remember it's an educational game. This means that you can't expect to learn the songs by playing it over and over again. You have to go deeper and use the ''Riff Repeater''. Riff Repeater allows you to slow down certain sections of a song and play it at any speed you want, again and again until you get it. Also this is a TOOL not some kind of potion that magically transforms you into Jimmy Page. The challenge to take the skills you learn in the game into the real world might be tough. Sometimes you will find yourself cutting shortcuts just to hit the notes, which makes things even worse (espescially when soloing). If you really want to learn, you are gonna have to use other means too. In short: It is a great game if you want to learn the basics of guitar/bass, improve your skills or just have some fun. Use it with caution and don't rely solely on it if you want to learn guitar properly. Great songs, good tabs and useful tools. It's worth buying for every aspiring or aspired guitar player out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith is a brilliant package. It's essentially a self-contained training program. The main component is an automatic tab player that lets you play along to album versions of songs. The self-adjusting diffuculty is key here - if you're playing well, the game scales up the complexity of the tabs to match, eventually having you play the song for real, chords and all. The majority of the songs come with seperate lead guitar, rhythm guitar and bass guitar tracks, so you don't have to stop at learning just one part of a whole song.The game also comes with a collection of arcade-style games designed to help you develop muscle memory, teach you chord names, fretting, scales, bends, harmonics - the works. There's also a dedicated lesson section to help you learn the basics of guitar playing and maintenance. Another interesting feature is ""Session Mode."" Here, the game lets you set up a virtual band that plays along with you. You play hard and fast, so do they. Play softer, they slow down too. It essentially gives you a crash course on how songs flow and gives you a free environment to get creative with your playing.Now, the bad news: while it IS good, Rocksmith is not going to magically turn you into some kind of Hendrix-Slash-Dylan-Malmsteen-hybrid guitar beast. Think of it as a tool, not a magic potion. If you want to learn guitar, and you're serious about it, Rocksmith will definitely help. In the end, though, it comes down to you.Basically, let me put it like this: the game has an achievement named ""0.25% of the 10,000 Hour Rule."" Google it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Posted on 8/17/2016I purchased this software 3 months before my 49th birthday.  I had always wanted to learn to play the guitar but I just never had the time or money to do it before so I had absolutely no experience when purchased.  I was a total novice.The initial investment was expensive (I purchased a very cheap electric guitar online along with the realtone cable and some picks, a strap, etc.)When I first started the lessons I was having some trouble with the software not picking up the notes as I played them but this was fixed by turning the gain on the realtone cable up to around 5.5 db or so (2/3 of way up bar.)  Once this was fixed I spent the next 3 weeks injuring my left wrist by playing as much as my  body could stand.I had to take a week off of playing.  When I went back I quickly realized my fingers were too short and fat to effectively play a 6-string at the level required.  I was muting way too many strings.  My chords sounded awful and I couldn't get passed 60% mastery on any songs.Before I totally accepted defeat I decided to bite the bullet and invest in a bass.  Probably a better bass than I should have.The first song the program suggested to me was Def Leopard ""Pour some sugar on me.""  As I was playing it I noticed (with more than a little amusement) that the entire song only uses 2 strings.  Since the program slowly shows you more and more notes as you play (you start off only playing certain notes in a bass line and the program will slowly fill in more notes as you properly hit the ones they are displaying [it is genius]) it took me around 5 tries hit 102% mastery on it.  This truly boosted my confidence.  While this song is easy to play I do love it and have since I was a teenager *cough* As I tried more difficult songs and moved through the bass lessons and mini-games I realized that the extra space the neck of the bass provides between the strings allowed my fingers to move a bit more easily up and down the fretboard.  The thicker strings also stood out more to my pudgy fingers.I am sharing all of this with you, reader, essentially to say that now that it is 2 weeks before my 49th birthday I just tried to play ""Everlong"" by the Foo Fighters and nailed a 99% accuracy on my 2nd try.I am bouncing up and down the fretboard like I have been playing the bass for a year.  The more difficult songs still give me trouble.  ""Play that funky music"" by Wild Cherry and ""Satch Boogie"" by the great Joe Satriani are examples of just hellish bass lines.I have managed to impress all my friends and I play a version of ""Hollow"" by Alice in Chains that brings chills to them (they say.)At this point I will only get better at the bass and I cannot believe how well this program has taught me (along with help from some youtube courses to nail techniques.)If you are willing to put in the time, money, effort and maybe even some blood this program will teach you how to play a guitar or bass.  How well you do does depend a bit on talent of course.I whole heartedly recommend this program.  It has been worth every penny.  But I usually wait for a good sale to get the expensive song packs.

												I would describe Rocksmith as a learning tool disguised at a game. I have used it for practicing guitar and bass, and my skills have developed a lot since I started playing the game.There is a plethora of features to be found in Rocksmith 2014, the most prominent being Learn a Song mode. In Learn a Song mode, the game basically plays similarly to Guitar Hero, except the notes may span the entire fretboard of the actual instrument you are playing (guitar/bass). When you are first beginning, the songs are watered-down. Rocksmith decides to just throw a few notes at you at a time, until you get the hang of it, then it gradually increases the complexity until you are playing it just the way it was recorded. The game registers all kinds of techniques that are used with a guitar, such as hammer-ons pull-offs, slides, bends, harmonics, palm-mutes, etc. The Real-Tone cable just knows. You can unlock new songs by doing missions, you can also buy song-packs as DLC.Another feature I enjoy is Session Mode. It allows you to program a backing band that plays according to the scale that you are playing. It sounds really sweet and gives you a feel of playing with an actual band. Session mode also gives you some pretty good tutoring about scales, and playing with a band if you follow the in-game missions. Also, the game offers a huge amount of video based, interactive guitar lessons, to help out the newbies, and experienced players too.Rocksmith has local multiplayer for Score-Attack mode, Session mode, and Learn a Song mode. It works great, you just need to have two of the Real-Tone cables (and two guitars, of course.)There is a tone designer within Rocksmith, which basically allows you to choose equipment and effects for the game to synthesise. Allow me to say, the game sounds almost as good as my amplifier through my stereo, and the latency for playing a note is unnoticable. You can unlock new sounds for your guitar, just by playing the game.Rocksmith also offers arcade-style games to help you practice with techniques, which are pretty fun, to say the least. I have put in a lot of hours just trying to get the achievements in these, and I'm still working at it.Does anyone else play this? Add me through Steam if you do, I would love to have some friends to compare scores with and stuff. I got it around Christmas time and I'm up to 250 hours through Steam (only counting online sessions.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith will really help you improve on your skills, Rocksmith 2014 is a good sequel to the first game and is worth the purchase. I started off with Rocksmith 2012, played over 130 hours of that and here we are, 2013, over 120 hours of 2014 played and i am a hell of a lot better than i was at playing guitar before. Now, of course this does not replace an actual teacher but for the price, and the fun... It's very much worth it. The only thing i would like to say is there are issues that STILL have not been fixed. Tuning in this game is all over the place, one second the volume is too high and the next it's too low. But putting aside the small issues, i highly recommend this game, or the first game. Either will be great fun and help you become a GUUUITTARR LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe not, but you will get close :]*EDIT* There are now custom songs for 2014, and lots of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredible piece of software. I tried to learn guitar when I was 18 and then again at around 22 and quit both times after struggling just to learn a few basic riffs. At 27, I  thought I'd give it one last hurrah and my fiancee purchased me Rocksmith 2014 to assist in my learning.  I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 since July 2015 and I'm excited to say that I can play full songs now. Not just one or two, but over one hundred at 90%+ accuracy. I still have a long way to go but I believe Rocksmith has cemented this as a life-long hobby for me. The developers are amazing and released a free ""Remastered"" update for existing owners of the game. They also release DLC song packs on a weekly basis, and while they are not free, they are an excellent value considering the price of lessons and how accurate the tracking of the notes is. I recommend this software wholeheartedly to anyone aspiring to learn electric guitar or bass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After decades of playing (off and on), I can say without hesitation that this is the BEST method for learning songs on guitar and bass I've ever come across.  I think my hours played alone vouches for the game's appeal and effectiveness.  Can't really speak to this effectiveness for completely new guitar players though.  I imagine it could be difficult for some, but I would recommend its use in conjunction with a knowledgeable traditional teacher.The absolutely best feature of this program is the Riff Repeater -- and this has been improved in the  latest Remastered edition.  The ability to slow down a song or even a portion of it to work on a difficult section is PRICELESS!!And check out the Weekly Guitar and Bass Challenges on the UIbisoft Rocksmith 2014 forum.  These are for ALL skill levels -- from complete beginner to expert -- and are a great way to improve with community support.http://forums.ubi.com/forumdisplay.php/151-Rocksmith-2014-Edition ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was dubious at first about Rocksmith 2014, mainly due to how quickly I grew tired of Rock Band and Guitar Hero. However, those fears were quickly put to rest due to one simple element - the use of a real instrument. I've been playing guitar on and off for over a decade now, but hadn't played for a few years due to no longer being in a band. So Rocksmith was a great excuse to pick it back up and give it another go.So if you had any fears about this being another Rock Band or Guitar Hero put them to bed, this is guitar tutorial software wrapped up as a game. It'll take you through all the techniques you need to know to play guitar, with explinations and video demos. It even teaches you scales... SCALES! Imagine that. Scales in a music game. Black Magic.It does a good job of easing you into the program, and providing you with some lessons and advice before jumping into a song. When you do pick a song to play it starts off with an easy note track to follow and play. Basically a reduced note count, often root notes, to get you used to the song and moving single fingers around the fret board. As you get better at the song the complexity increases and chords start to form, and more notes in a bar (Section of music) appear too. This can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're somewhat used to playing guitar and want to play all the notes you hear, however from a beginner's point of view I can imagine this is a very useful level progression to build up confidence.There is a slight 'delay' from auido input of guitar to audio output through the headphones, which can be a little disorientating, however you grow used to it if you continue to play. Other than this I've had no real issues with the game, and enjoy an hour or two once and a while.I've lost countless hours just jamming away in the Session Mode, while it isn't as complex as I hoped it's still a good little tool for popping out riffs and licks. I think the only real issue I have with Rocksmith at the moment is the lack of some genuine Classic Rock songs in the track list, however I'm hoping this will be resolved via DLC at some point. So if you've been interested in guitar and sort of held back about learning then this could be a useful game for you, especially if it has songs you like on the set list/DLC. Likewise if you have a guitar but haven't touched it for ages due to a lack of interest, why not dust it down and plug in! The only caution about buying the Steam Version of the game is that it DOES NOT come with the Real Tone cable that you'll need to play. However, you can pick up Rocksmith with a Real Tone Cable very cheap on Amazon (with the added bonus of being to port over the RS1 songs to RS2!).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SOME TiPS TO GET THE MOST FROM THiS AWESOME GAME AND TO MiNiMiSE FRUSTRATiON: ( Please Thumb Up if this helps so that others get to see! )Rocksmith 2014 is VERY sensitive to deviations in tuning. Contrary to the usual recommendation that light strings ( < 9's ) are better for beginners (because they are kinder on the fingers) I would suggest that, for Rocksmith, slightly heavier, medium strings will serve you better in playing this game. (try 10's on regular guitars, perhaps even 11's on shorter scale guitars: Les Pauls, Jags, Mustangs etc.) This is becuase the thicker strings tend to be more stable in pitch and also deliver a stronger signal than those skinny, so called 'easy' strings. Trust me - it's more important for this sortware to 'hear' your notes consistently and in tune. Those bendy, skinny strings' pitch will veer all over the place as your fingers struggle to learn their correct position and pressure. Slightly firmer strings give more positive response and feedback - Your fingers will toughen up soon enough cry-babies! GET NEW STRiNGS! - Especially if you have an old guitar that's had the same strings since it got chucked in the back of Dads cupboard back in 1979; don't wait for them to break! - I put Ernie Ball Slinky 10's on an old Stagg Strat I was given and was astonished at the strong bright tone they delivered. Compared to with the dull old 9's that were on it before, this was like a whole new instrument!THE PERFECT ViSUAL AiD FOR NEW ROCKSMiTH PLAYERS -  Dr Neon strings UK[www.amazon.co.uk] USA[www.amazon.com] may look a bit gaudy however they perfectly match the Rocksmith string colouring system and this really, REALLY helps to coordinate my fingers, moreso than I thought they would and particularly in the guitarcade excercises where I'm learning to move my fingers quickly between chords. Once I'm at the stage where I can play without looking at my fingers, then I'll switch back to Ernies or Elixirs or or such-like. 'til then, these definitely have accelerated my progress!TUNiNG, TUNiNG, TUNiNG. I can't emphasise it enough. I often found this game incredibly frustrating when I'd see myself missing notes I'd swear I'd hit. I assumed at first it was because of my utterly crap technique but soon realised that often I'd hit a note or chord and it just wasn't being recognised. This became particularly apparent in the Guitarcade modules, Starchords and Castle Chordead, where I'd find myself thrashing away at a perfect simple chord with no effect as the opposition chewed me up. Getting an expensive new guitar made very little difference  (:-o - What I've since discovered is that keeping your guitar perfectly in tune is what makes the critical difference. Make sure also that your guitar is in tune all the way up the neck. If the intonation is out, Rocksmith is extremely unforgiving; consider investing in getting the instrument serviced by an experienced guitar tech. Even if it's a dirt cheap guitar, having decent strings, optimal action and accurate intonation will help avoid a whole world of Rocksmith pain, perhaps even make the difference between keeping your guitar or defenestrating it. Seriously, even Eric Clapton would suck at Rocksmith if his boutique vintage strat ""Blackie"" was out of intonation.HERE'S A TiP FOR GUiTARCADE - Pausing the game, you can see a little tuning meter at the bottom left of the display that indicates which note you are playing and the degree by which it is sharp or flat - Sound each string repeatedly and make sure the circle around the note lights up promptly and consistently to indicate it's in tune. I find this tuning method far more effective than the dedicated tuning module you get at the beginning of each song - Your foes will fall before you!Finally: TiMiNG, TiMiNG, TiMiNG! - It was when I was getting to grips with ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" that I realised that there was a very slight but significant difference between the music I was hearing, and the moment the chords ""arrived"" in the display. I didn't know whether to play the chord the instant when I see it or when I hear it? The answer is in the Audio Settings where you can adjust a delay setting. On my own Mac this corrected the difference on a setting of 4 - (Setting the delay at 0 caused an alarming bug/issue where all sound became completely distorted - Robot Voice says ""Raa.aa.ck.smm.iithh"") Once I'd nailed the timing setting (trial and error) my playing has really come together quite literally. Specifically, I can look away from the display and when I look back I haven't missed the notes because the display, the song and my guitar are all syncronised.OKAY - so this hasn't been intended as a review - It's just my hope that sharing what I've learned in fine tuning this amazing game helps you to find it as rewarding as I do and ensures that you get to enjoy playing WiTH Rocksmith rather than against it. - If you've found what I share helpful then please give it a thumbs up promotion so that others get to see it too.Thanks - Pól			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 Remastered9.99 / 10.0 Rocksmith  Rocksmith 2014 Remastered Learning to play Guitar or Bass is a lot of Fun with this game; heck, just playing along with your favorite song is a blast. You play Guitar or Bass? then this game is for you. There is nothing like this software out there.... Unique.I purchased both Rocksmith (original) and Rocksmith 2014 (auto upgraded to Remastered version) and I am telling you to buy both. Buying both gives you access to more songs. Any song purchased in the older Rocksmith(original) version is automatically installed in the 2014 Remastered version. Rocksmith Original: 51 songs (6 unlockable, 169 DLC)Rocksmith 2014: 55 songs (10 unlockable, 800+ DLC and growing)Customforge 2016: always adding custom DLC (CDLC) == FREEMany basic skills are covered in this game; although nothing beats a real teacher for instruction on tone, clarity, smoothness, and savoir faire; THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE the most pleasure per dollar spent; your teacher cannot match this. It is literally as fun as jamming on weekends with your band. Pure fun. Pure entertainment. Pure value. Get it.NotaBene1) when you purchase the Rocksmith(original game) add the ‘disc import tool’ to import the original songs. DLC is automatically transferred to the 2014 Remastered version whether or not you purchase the disc import tool.2) Fun includes discovering songs and styles that you do not listen to on the radio or in your car.... Play every song that you can and learn; I discovered Bob Dylan for the first time on my Bass Guitar [Bob won the Nobel !]3) Don’t like the Steam/PC choices of songs? Just download all the custom DLC that is on the .net [free].... Heck, why don’t you make custom DLC of your favorite song and upload it so that everybody can learn the song that you love?!My scoring system / 1010 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done 7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great improvment to the original Rocksmith. It feels fluid and there is no more loadtimes in the same song when you try to Riffrepeat.Having features like the Riffrepeater, tuner and all the guitarcade games, makes Rocksmith 2014 truly the fastest and by miles the most fun way to learn to play the guitar.The Added session mode is one hell of a feature, just try it and play with a virtual band and it'll feel awesome and also you will learn new tricks.

												I was that guy.. Ive probably tried learning guitar around 10 times since the age of 11. Always start of well... but then get bored with the lack of direction and inspiration.UNTIL NOW!! After seeing this game advertised on steam and looking at videos I was intrigued enough to purchase it from amazon (free usb cable) I have been regularly putting in hours everyday and can definatly see improvements. I could go on about all its amazing features, but I would like to keep this short. This game inspires you to believe that you can play guitar. The learning curve can be steep at times but the entertainment value makes it worthwhile.  There is no doubt that down the line you will need to do your own research into theory etc. But this is by far the best software to get you playing songs you know!!You can even download Custom DLC for FREE... Any song ive wanted to play, ive found..Well done Ubisoft..  10/10  Would lick guitar strings again.. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not a substitute for a *good* teacher, it is a much better option than many crappy teachers, and most guitar teachers are pretty crappy. While I haven't gotten to ""hero"" yet, I've gone from Zero, to well, having callouses and being able to improvise over scales in a mere 30-something hours of practice with the app. The way I've been explaining this game to my friends is, think Guitar Hero but make it an educational game with a real guitar. Individual phrases are simplified and you level them up individually from each other, and instead of ""failing"" you if you miss too many notes the game tries to keep you at a level to where you're on your toes.One thing I really appreciate about this game is that it's teaching me actual songs I can relate to. I sat down the other day to practice a prhase from one of the Radiohead songs, realized it's in the same key as the primary Salsa riff, the Game of Thrones theme, the Legend of Zelda theme and the Super Mario Castle music, and had a lot of fun going between them all. I'm not just learning more about the guitar, I'm learning more about music.One thing I find really frustrating with this game is that it has a hard time recognizing my playing of some techniques. It doesn't recognize a vast majority of my pitch bends, for example, though an accomplished guitarist friend of mine says they're fine. The game doesn't offer any feedback on how I might improve them, other than to watch the tutorial video again.Overall, if you want to learn guitar, it's hard to go wrong with this game as part of a larger practice. Props to Ubisoft for creating something that's more about learning and less about ego.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to learn the Electric Guitar or Bass in the comfort of your home while stoned and or drunk this is the way to do it. It takes Guitar Hero/Rock Band but instead of using 5 buttons you use a real guitar struming the real notes to the song while it plays the actual  note you play. It has a very nice step up system for learning the song starting off with the basic easy notes and as you play it successfully it adds in more notes until your playing the full actuall song.It also has a hand full of mini games for warming up and fine tuning your skills*************************************************WARNING YOU DO NEED AN ADAPTER THAT CONNECTS YOUR GUITAR/BASS TO THE USB*************************************************************You need it to play, Eb games or any pawn shop well have one for cheap			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like Guitar Hero, but with a real guitar.It's pretty good, and will actually teach you songs. Although the multiplayer being constricted to local only is annoying, meeting up with friends to jam is a fun experience. New songs get added to the game very regularly.I'd reccomend it if you either want a hard, realistic version of guitar hero, or want an easy and fun way to learn songs. (I would not, however, reccomend making this your only method of learning songs.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL:DR editionBasically Guitar Hero for guitarists, Rocksmith 2014 lets you play along with popular songs with either a 6-string electric guitar or a 4-string electric bass. You do need to buy a cable to plug your guitar into your computer, a special 6.5mm-USB cable specifically for Rocksmith which adds roughly $40 onto the cost of the game if you don't already own one so keep that in mind before buying it. Also DLC is expensive, just buy Cherub Rock and mod in songs instead.+great tool for learning guitar (if paired with other things)+fun way to practice+solid selection of tracks in base game+easy to mod+supports both guitar and bass+local 2p multiplayer-only 2p multiplayer-requires an overpriced cable-overpriced DLC9/10Full ver.This game is pretty much perfect, and I would say it's an incredible tool both for people who want to learn guitar or bass and for those who already play and just want to jam some new songs. There's also a solid modding community who are constantly making ""custom DLC""/CDLC/mods that import songs into the game unofficially.I used to find the ""dynamic difficulty"" feature annoying and patronising in the first Rocksmith, you'd start off playing one note every 4 bars and the game would get harder as you improved. In the beginning it was annoying because it was too easy, once you got to a solid difficulty it was still annoying because it would drop you back down to baby mode if you ever made a mistake. This feature makes a return in Rocksmith 2014, but is vastly improved by the option to turn it off if you already know what you're doing.I like that it has local multiplayer, a rarity in PC games, however it is a bit of a shame that you can only have two players at a time. Most songs on Rocksmith 2014 have 3 different parts for each song (rhythm, lead, bass). Unlike a console, you can have more than 2 USB ports and multiple displays on a PC and it would've been really cool for Ubisoft to include the option to have a third player on a second monitor. This way, a whole band (sans drummer) can practice and jam together.There are really only a few minor issues I have with Rocksmith 2014, one of which is the tuner. It's pretty sensitive, which is good, but its idea of a guitar being in tune is a bit too lenient imo. A few times the game would tell me a string was tuned when I could clearly hear that it was out in relation to other strings.Also, the game seems to have trouble detecting very low bass notes, low Cs are missed in songs that call for C standard or drop C tuning but maybe that's just my bass' volume being too low. I wouldn't know since I don't have a second one to test on multiple instruments.Another problem is that many tracks teach the player ways to play the song that are harder than necessary. Gonna get a bit technical here. Keep in mind that in standard bass tuning, the 5th fret of every string plays the open note of the next string, meaning the 7th fret note of the E string (a B) plays the same note as the 2nd fret of the A string. Many songs will have you moving from, say, the 2nd fret to the 7th on the same string, when it would be much easier to stay on the 2nd fret but play the next string. R U Mine? by the Arctic Monkeys is a very good example of the game making a song harder than it has to be.My final, and biggest, problem with this game is the pricing. Going by current conversion rates, the game costs $53.65 AUD. This would be a very reasonable price, however buying a separate Rocksmith ""Real Tone"" Cable is required to play and adds roughly $40 AUD onto the price (and a guitar, fairly obviously). The game offers a decent amount of songs without DLC but you'll want to make sure the song list is VERY much in line with your music taste if you want to get a decent experience from the base game. DLC songs cost $4 AUD EACH, which I think is a pretty unreasonable ask for one song, especially because this game has around 480 DLC songs at this point. Even if you don't care about most of the DLC songs it's still likely to run you a few hundred bucks for the ones you want. Thankfully the only DLC you need to buy is Cherub Rock so you can mod in CDLC. After that just torrent the other official DLC or wait until a sale if you REALLY want to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One part rhythm game, one part music instructor, Rocksmith 2014 takes away much of the tedium of learning and practicing the guitar by presenting drills and exercises as games. There are plenty of video lessons included, complete with ""graded"" practice tracks to help you with the techniques. Songs are learned through a system that auto-adjusts difficulty depending on how well you are doing, and the Riff Repeater allows the user to stop, slow down, and loop segments of the music (even the entire song) to help master difficult passages.The song selection included with the base game[en.wikipedia.org] is decent, and the catalog of music available through DLC[en.wikipedia.org] is incredible, offering a wide range of (mostly) western music across a number of decades and genres. Another fifty or so songs[en.wikipedia.org] can be added cheaply and easily with the purchase of the original Rocksmith and the Disc Import Tool, which re-licenses the song list so it can be used in RS2014. All songs are by the original artists; no cheesy remakes. (It's fair to warn people that due to licensing issues there are a few songs which do not transfer from RS to RS2014. Notably, the Clapton songs. These songs are still playable in the original Rocksmith, however.)I would highly recommend Rocksmith 2014 to anyone involved with the electric guitar. Whether you are picking up the instrument for the first time, or have been playing for decades and would just like something fun to help motivate practice and master a few difficult songs, there should be something for you to use.

												great gamea helpfull tool to learn guitarit can be a fun game for both beginner and the more experience guitar playerthe best thing about this game is dynamic difficulty , it allows the game to adjust the difficulty of the songs to your skill levelfor a beginner the song would be reduced to its very core by only playing the root notes, this will make it so you can play the song and it will still be recognisable for others because all songs are at your skill level you can pretty much play any of them with the help of the game, this gives more variety while you practiceanother issue learning a single song can have is that some parts of a song can be very hard and you will probably take months to be able to play that part, but here you can play a reduced version of that part that is within your skill level, and its more fun to play a song because it will still sound good even if you play less in the hard partso you'll play this song more=more practiceanother great thing about being able to play more songs is that some songs require different techniques and these might be executed at different speeds or they move around the neck moreso in song x you for example a set of slow barré chords while in song y they are done much faster, now if you start learning barré chords you might be able to play them in song x but not yso you can practice barré chords when you play x and suddenly song y  will become easier because even though you just played x for fun you still practiced these techniquesand practice is all you need to do to get better, doesn't mean it can be funthis makes the game so good for me you can just have fun and still get that hard needed practicethe game also has some interactive lessons that will teach you pretty much anything a person that never touched a guitar has to know, while it isn't perfect it does the job, and maybe some video's on the internet, can help too, but an experienced guitar player will always be better   another great tool is the riff repeater it allows you to adjust the songs difficulty, or if you wanna start practicing a certain section of the song, you can set it to loop that specific part and adjust speed, difficulty, pretty much anything you wantits great, easy to acces and you can approach learning a song in a more traditional way( slow it down and slowly ramp up the speed)the more gamey parts of the game consist of a score attack for the songs with some set difficulties guitar hero styleand you also have the guitar arcade, these are mini games that are build around a certain guitar technique, you have some that help you have an on rail shooter where you kill the enemies by playing the chords shown on screen, you have a saloon where enemies come down 6 lanes and you shoot them by playing the coresponding string this will help you learn skipping strings, and you got other that help you learn scales move around the board, they are a fun distraction and it helps you practicethe last big thing of this game is session mode, it is a place for improvising and experimenting, they have created a virtual band for you, you can change what instruments they use and these instruments have a certain style associated with them, jazz, rock metal blues, besides a the normal instruments you find in the average band you also have some more special ones like a kazoo or some rain or city noisesyou can also pick wich scale they will play and in which key, its like haveing a million play along improvise songsbut the best thing is here it can change dynamicly and you can change how much they will vary(from aways playing in same scale and key to dynamicly changing key and scale) you can set the bpm of a song but the band will react to how you play if you play fast they will pick up speed too while if you play relaxed they will also do so,for beginners this might seem overwhelming and it kinda is but the game can slowly guide you through it, it will also tell you what notes will sound good, besides that you can do anything you want and use the plenty effects the game has for your guitarintermediate/experienced players will get less out of the game because dynamic difficulty isn't something they need and they already have the means to learn songs outside of the gamebut if they can get over the unique interface( its easy to read on the fly, but different from anything else)the gamey stuff still exist and the many effects and session mode can still have their value for youbass is also fully supported and it wasn't an afterthoughtyou need the realtone cable thoughoveral i fully reccomend the game  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It isn\'t a music teacher and it can\'t spot things that you\'re physically doing wrong (like using the pads of your fingers instead of the tips, or having your nails too long), but this will teach you more than enough to be confident in picking up a guitar at a party and playing in front of everyone. When you get to the advanced levels you\'ll be surprised how much you really do know. It snuck up on me and Rocksmith made sure that I was having a blast the whole time. Oh, and it does stuff for those bass players, too, but I forgive it. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a guitarist for 8 years.I've learnt the hard way, learning by tab, by ear, through sessions musicians like Amy Winehouse's Personal Guitarist...but this game reminds me how sloppy of a guitarist and bassist I can still be at time.I don't even use guitar on this because I already know all there is in term on techiniques that are implimented in the game but I love the session mode, I got to try it out pre-release at Gibson HQ in London last year and it caught me.For those like me who own basses but don't get to use Bass much, this is very much for you alike, some of the greatest basslines are in this game and even with CDLC you have unlimited learning of music material on offer to you.It's not a toy.It's not even a game.But it's a SELF TEACHING TOOL and an ENHANCER for those who knows the fingerboard			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game..  I  really love it and play it often for a couple years now.. i have over 1000 hours playing and I have noticed a difference in my playing.  Learing songs is cool and a good motivator to play but the session mode will make you a better guitarist.   Something else that I dont see commented about the game and for me a perfect reason to buy the gaem if nothing else is the AUTHENTIC TONES.  you can just select the tone from a song you like and your guitar sounds just like the guitar in your favorite song.. You can also create tones with sound from just about any guitar equiptment out there.  The cost of just a decent amp  is alot more than this game, and this game offeres you LOTS of amp and pre amp options, with pedals.   soo much to play with.    I have not p[ayed a game more than this in my life and im 39. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're wondering whether Rocksmith 2014 can teach you to play guitar with no prior experience, the answer is a resounding yes.  It's not going to teach you perfect technique, but it will get you started on the basics.  You'll likely need to suplement it with youtube lessons (I highly recommend justinguitar), or in person lessons - but they're not necessary to have a good time, and pick up some basic skills.It provides the motivation, enjoyment and sense of progression to keep you playing (and learning), and while I'm by no means ""good"" after 100+ hours, I'm definitely learning, improving, and having a lot of fun.  Sometimes I even sound good while doing it!  This was a great buy, well worth picking up.  The cable can be hard to track down (and is required, no-cable methods just don't work properly), so check you can get one before buying the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I got some trouble to get the Real Tone Cable in my country because it wasn't sold seperatly but now that I got it I don't regret any time/money I spent to get this game. For what I've saw  I've been getting better playing guitar since I played this, but only more time will tell.10/10 You should buy if you've a guitar or bass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played this game for 16 hours in the past 2 days so I feel like a review is necessary. I've been playing guitar for 17 years and I got this game as a fun way to jam without my band and maybe learn some songs. Little did I know that despite playing for as long as I have, I've learned more in the past 16 hours than I have in probably the past 5 years. Whether you are an experienced guitarist or are thinking about learning, get this game. Period. You will not be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing guitar for roughly 8 years now and only got rocksmith a few months ago, but it's great. I'm having a lot of fun learning new songs, and downloading custom songs is definitely a must, adding potentially hundreds of songs to the setlist. I mean, the technology isn't 100% there are flaws, note recognition being the most damaging to gameplay, but for the most part, rocksmith is a must have for guitarists and bassits. You will have fun mastering songs and developing your skills and techniques.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing Rocksmith daily for 11 months now and my playing has improved tremendously. Nothing motivates me to practice like this game: I used to find it hard to motivate myself to practice an hour a week but am now playing at least this much every day.I used to think of myself as a decent bass player, but I'd say that I've improved more over this past year than the last 20 years combined. I am now comfortably playing material that I used to think would forever be out of my reach.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												great game, it tought me how to play guitar. my only issue with it is that the menu is pretty bad.i will say, the learning progression system didnt work great for me because it starts with just one finger on one string, then slowly adds more strings and more fingers. but its hard to tell which fingers are meant to go in the places that are displayed, so you figure out a hand position. when it adds another finger position suddenly you realize you were putting your fingers wrong and now you cant fit the new chord with your hand. so you have to learn the proper way all at once instead.after realizing this, i turned to the riff repeater. that thing is great, you setup the section of song you want (you can do all the song if you want) and you can turn the dificulty all the way up, then slow it down to 5% or something so you have plenty of time to figure out where your hands go between each chord/note. then once you are comfortable at that speed you turn up the speed.doing this i learnt to play the songs at full speed.there is one thing the game wont teach you though, and thats how to make the notes sound good. it will accept the note as long as its close to the same pitch and timing - if it sounds weird that doesn't matter. i suggest after you can play a song you play it while paused and listen carefully to your notes. this helps you not only hit the notes, but make the notes sound good.

Posted: June 19, 2016
												Very easy review to write, it's a freaking great program.Pros:Rocksmith 2014 is a tremendously efficient guitar tutor masked cleverly as enjoyable entertainment.  If you have any desire to learn guitar or bass you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  Even at full retail price it is bus fare compared to one-on-one guitar training at a music store.  You'll learn the same stuff, perhaps not the nitty gritty theory, but certainly the techniques as you would from a professional tutor but at a fraction of the cost... easy peasy decision.  You will Rock out... oh yes, you will.The Steam version doesn't come with the cable but it can be sourced through Amazon and other retailers.  Be aware that it 'could' cost more than just buying the physical box with the game DVD and cable when they're bought seperate.The only Con:Cost of DLC.  Most songs are 3 bucks a piece, gets expensive fast.  Buy packs where you can, and wait for Steam sales.Edit (March 2017) -250+ hours in, time for an update...I've found that I get the best experience playing Rocksmith if I use pedals, not effects, just pedals to get a better line signal.  I have a buffer, a compressor, and a noise gate and they are all set to be mild to medium in their attack and release.  I find this tightens up the dynamics enough that notes I'm clearly playing that didn't register with the game engine, now do.  It has meant song scores going way up and a near ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic level of joy playing the tunes I like to play... okay maybe that last bit was too far.For anyone that might be interested, here's the rig:Gretsch/Strat -> Boss NS2 -> Friedman SirCompre (omg so cherry) -> TC Bonifide Buffer -> RealTone Cable -> Profit???I've actually got an A/B switcher in place so I can push my pedal board to either the RealTone cable or to my audio interface.So yeah, if you're reading this thinking I like the idea of the game but half of what I play it ignores?  Get a cheap compressor at the minimum, or borrow one to try first before investing that it does indeed work for you, but I think you'll find it does.I mean, I got 'Eye of the Tiger' up to 99.9% and I totally suck!Cheers!

												1. I have both this and the original Rocksmith and this one is better. Though I do miss a few things from the original, that this has superior note recognition, less lag and a few more techniques give it a solid edge.2. I can only review this as someone who has played guitar for years. I think it would work for learning guitar to begin with but what I can say for sure is practicing with this will maintain and improve your guitar skills if you already play. It is much better than just picking up a guitar and noodling around for an hour and it is more fun than practicing with a metronome. The only thing I could recommend over this is jamming with other players.3. For new players: learning guitar takes a long time. That 400 hours you spent before you got really good at twitch shots in Counter Strike, that is not even close. Sorry you had to hear it from me.4. For everyone: learn to play and get good at the songs you don't like. You will be exposed to techniques and rhythms you would otherwise miss. It will make you a better player. 5. Getting 100% on a song does not mean you can actually play it well. I have seen way too many YouTube vids of people 100%ing songs with this that just sound all kinds of shaky rhythmically. This gives you the ability to listen back to your performance. Give your fingers a break and do this every now and again.6. This still has trouble with note tracking on bass sometimes. Sometimes it's pretty severe. Yes, I checked my intonation. 7. If you follow the path specified for you in this game, it makes you spend a lot of time playing w/ these cheesy jam-along tracks and that is just annoying. I dunno about you but playing scale notes to a poor sounding fake classic rock band is just not my idea of a good time. 8. The guitarcade games actually help you so play them. They do help w/ your playing somewhat but they really excel at is keeping your attention on the screen and not on the fretboard since you can't memorize them like you do a song.9. It is kinda a bummer that they make you pay an extra ten bucks to play the tracks from the original game. Or, not so much that, but that you pay ten dollars and it still doesn't transfer your progress over. Sucks to you for that, Ubisoft!10. The feature in this called riff repeater that lets you repeat and slow down tough parts of the songs is way better than in the original where I found it nearly unusable. I do wish you could just play slowed down versions of whole songs though.11. I would not suggest sinking too much money into a guitar for this if you are just beginning. A guitar in the range of like $150 or maybe even cheaper will be perfectly adequate. Buy it at a guitar store and ask if they will check the intonation and set up for you as a condition of your purchase. This is a reasonable thing to do and they won't think you are being a big nerd or anything. 12. Every now and again you will be truly killing it on a rad song and the dumb cable will stop working and you will get really, really mad. Express this anger. You are an artist.13. There is more to life than video games and more to life than playing guitar but if you put both together, you are pretty damn close. Maybe have a kid or something if you feel unfulfilled. I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love the program; hate the selection of music. Give me some 60's and 70's. Give me some Eagles. Give me some Don Henley. I understand the allure of the new stuff for the younger crowd but us older folks want to learn guitar too and we would like to learn it with songs we actually listen to.That said, I do recommend this program.

												HIGHLY Recommend this if you're serious about learning guitar.  Ive been playing for 7 days at this point and can play 2 songs completely at about 98%.  It works.  Like any instrument, hours of practice is how you get better, but the thing with Rocksmith2014 is that it helps you feel like you aren't 'working' or 'practicing'.  It cleverly disquises learning chords, progressions, scales and harmonics (you know, all the boring♥♥♥♥♥♥ by putting them into arcade games.  It also spoon feeds you (if you need it, which i do) in learn a song mode, gives you a little bit at a time, but also helps you by pushing you with new techniques and chords.  But the BEST FEATURE is RIFF REPEATER,  at any point you can stop the song and repeat any part on any difficulty at any speed up to 100%.  keep cranking up the difficulty and speed until you're playing just like it was written.  Awesome...  my fingers are killin me, but I don't care, I can't stop playing! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little background history: I have had a guitar for like 15 years and never had enough motivation to actually learn chords and such. I've only been practicing specific metal songs from tabs, until now.. One day one of my friends told me that they have the cable and I decided to borrow it, bought the game and started to practice.Now on to the actual review: The game provides lots of lessons, starting from very basic stuff all the way to the ""master"" level lessons. The way things are taught is good and simple, even I understand them!There are also different sorts arcade games in which you can practice different techniques and finger dexterity, altho I have to admit that the game design in these minigames is not that great. Many people might say that it's down right broken, but I'd say that at least you can improve a bit while playing, despite how merciless the minigame might feel like. For example the Harmonic Heist -game can be rage inducing when it comes to the guard you have to avoid. Sometimes you just can't avoid him despite how well you're performing.Learning a song starts off simple enough. Once you've completed your first song the game gives you tips what to do and where to focus on improving. There's also a neat feature called Riff Repeater, which allows you to practice specific parts of the song. You're allowed to slow the song down and practice that part as long as you like. For me this tool has been a blessing.You might wonder if your electronic acoustic guitar works with the game? At least for me it does, but keep in mind that the mics in a acoustic guitar might not be as good as in electronic guitar. For example while doing bends my acoustic's mics are giving me trouble, most of the time I get misses while bending the strings. The problem might be guitar specific but then again, I don't have hard evidence.So far I've loved this game. I've improved a lot and the passion of playing guitar burns bright in me once again. I'd highly recommend the game if you're about to start practicing and have few extra bucks in your pockets. Some purists might say that you'd be better off practicing like they were before the wars, but that is just a preference in my opinion. Pick whatever style you find comfortable for you.4 strings out of 6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please ignore my current game time (3.5 hrs), I have played Rocksmith 2014 for well over 100 hours on PS3.Rocksmith 2014 is truely a great way to learn how to play the guitar or bass and it's very ideal as you're not paying for lessons (which could cost more than the game and cable and maybe even some DLC) and you can practice in your own time. If you have an electric or electro acoustic guitar/bass that you haven't learned how to play, money for the cable (I believe it's around €30) and time to dedicate I would strongly recommend you to buy this game. Guitar/bass is a great skill to have in life. I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 for over a year now (26 December 2015 is current date, game bought for PS3 on 19th June 2014)Pros- Easy way to learn guitar/bass- Really fun to play- You can practice in your own time- If you buy Cherub Rock you can also get loads of Custom Downloadable Content (CDLC) from http://customsforge.com- Guitar/bass is fun- The game features an automatic level up/down system called the Riff Repeater. It will judge your skill based on how well you've been playing at the current difficulty and make the riff easier/harder to play.- Loads of DLC and CDLC is available- Includes minigames to practice scales, techniques and chords- Rocksmith can tell you what you need to improve on, for example, if your bending was a little poor Rocksmith will say ""Check out this Bending 101 lesson""Cons- Riff Repeater can sometimes be annoying- The Real Tone cable is pricey and a bit fragile- You don't get a Real Tone cable with the Steam purchase. I would advise you to buy the disc edition starter bundle (two exist, one with game and cable and one with an Epiphone Les Paul, game and cable). The disc edition is installed through Steam.- The game sometimes has trouble picking up signals from your guitar- Audio latency can become an issue. It's advised to have your video and audio running through 2 different cables. I have my video going from my laptop to my TV via HDMI and sound going from my laptop to my headphones via 3.5mm.- lag between video and audio can throw off your sense of rhythmI've taken lots of care to cover as many pros or cons in my review, if I've missed any, please tell me.If you enjoy Rocksmith I strongly recommend you to buy an amp for your instrument so you can practice outside of Rocksmith.Final conclusionRocksmith 2014 is a great learning tool/game and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to learn how to play guitar/bass. If you have enough time and dedication I guarantee you many hours of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												learn how to play guitar.all you need is an electric guitar or bass, and a £20/€25/$45 cable  - **edit after game update** you no longer need the cable to play. use a microphone to register notes, or go unplugged completely with no note registering, just the notes on screen.Pros - *caters for total newcomes and for experienced players wanting to improve*variety of DLC tracks *slow down and isolate difficult parts to master them*score attack and mini game modes, i don't use these much but its an awesome incentive with leaderboards*once you're accustomed to reading the notes its like a new language, and learning tracks becomes very quick*the below cons don't make this any less of an essential purchase if you want to learn guitarCons:*some PC soundcards have input delay issues, but swiching to the onboard sound fixes this*digital sound - tones are emulated digitally which is fine, they've done an amazing job but some are badly designed on certain tracks compared to others*collecting official DLC can get expensive*your fingers will hurt!

												Rocksmith 2014 is amazing. I began playing guitar at 12, and when I was 13, I got the original Rocksmith for my Xbox 360. I played the heck out of it, and it helped me learn many techniques I would have otherwise never known about. I have since progressed with my ability to play guitar, and bought Rocksmith 2014 on my PC. I was very grateful that my RealTone Cable from my Xbox 360 was compatible with my PC. I started the game up, and shreded away. The best part about the Rocksmith franchise is that it is not biased towards beginers or experts. You can start the game knowing nothing about how to play guitar/bass, but if you give the game some time, it will pay off, I promise. The best feeling while playing this game is when you reach 100%+ mastery on a song. I remember the first time I did. I noticed the notes seemed to be fading away until they did not show up anymore. It was as if I was jamming to this song in my room. The game automatically put the song on ""Master Mode"" seeing as I had already been hitting every note. I finished the song, and I was ecstatic to see that I had 104% mastery. This game is for anyone interested in learning guitar, or simply just jamming if you already know how to play. Do be warned though, it's like being on a diet; results do not show up overnight. If you want improvement, give the game time and patience, and be sure to practice frequently.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am your classic bedroom guitar player with two fat hands and stubby short fingers. But this game has allowed me to live the dream of being Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Matt Bellamy and many more. I even love playing the bass parts for all of my favourite songs from the past and present. I don't care how good or more importantly how bad you think you are at learning or playing the guitar. This game is a must have for anybody with a musical bent. The game comes with loads of great songs and many more are available for a small outlay as official dlc or free from the excellent modding group who can easily be found online. Note this is not guirar hero so you will need to own a real Guitar or Bass. But boy oh boy is it worth it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First and foremost, based on reviews, the Rocksmith Real Tone Cable is very fragile so take extra care of it! Over at my place the cable is not easy to find and is rather expensive so you don't want to go through hassle of getting another one or modding a guitar usb cable. Rocksmith is a fine tool for beginners and pros alike. There are plenty video lessons that would be helpful for beginners, even when you are playing a guitar for the very first time. In Rocksmith, you don't do readings, unlike reading tabs, chords, music notes or using Guitar Pro software. Rather you learn through videos, visual graphics and repetitive motions. All you really need is an electric guitar, and the game will handle the rest. The tones, amps, and all the tools that will mod & filter the sounds that are available in real world are all installed in the game and it sounds really, really awesome. *Branded, expensive stuffs, mind you*. Jamming in real life won't get you the exact sound without these proper tools thus in this game you will play the songs as it is meant to be played. *Thank god the tones are not DLC's* *No, I'm not giving any idea, Ubisoft*The game has a mode called Riff Repeater where it allows you to learn sections by sections of the songs. It also have difficulty setting whereby you can control your pace of learning so it really caters to beginners very well. *Imagine learning the solo's without this mode, oh god*. Practicing would be boring, if you're not interested in the song in the first place. So song choice matters! Start immediately with the songs you like and don't just play at random! Also, it has a build-in tuner so you won't get your tuning wrong for all the songs. Having said that, outside of the game, you gonna have to learn how to tune the guitar to suit the songs perfectly and that would depend on your own initiatives. Ultimately, with or without Rocksmith, you have to be passionate and dedicated enough to be able to enjoy playing the guitar. Rocksmith is just a tool, and it's not a game where you will have fun without practicing a song over and over again. I see that many started this game but stopped after a short while because they seem to lost interest. So take this into consideration if you are going to start this game as you don't only have to buy the game, but also the guitar and its cable and almost everything that accompanies it which by then you will find out this hobby is as costly as any other. Points doesn't matter, as long as you enjoy playing & I do, I enjoy playing. So if you are looking to play a guitar, whether beginning or restarting the musical journey, I wish you good luck and have fun! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I finally got around to buying this game for the third time. The past two being on the 360 and One. (Not including the first installment) I can tell you right now that if you aren't prepared to spend a lot of money, or don't have the mindset to learn, then do NOT buy this. If this doesn't fit you, keep reading.Rocksmith 2014 is a game that requires you to plug in any electric guitar into your computer and play along to a set of notes on a screen. This means that in addition to buying the game, you need an electric guitar, and the Rocksmith Real-Tone Cable, which you can find here: http://www.amazon.com/Rocksmith-2014-Cable-Trilingual-playstation-2/dp/B00I0701P4/ref=sr_1_1/183-4779015-1118238?ie=UTF8&qid=1462759501&sr=8-1&keywords=rocksmith+realtone+cable . I have heard there are ways to use a microphone to listen to your guitar and effectively do the same thing, but I have not tried it and I recommend just using the factory issued cable. Now to gameplay. With about 1000+ hours between all my copies; I can tell you firsthand that this game will teach you to play from no experience, as what I did when the first game came out. This game is for all levels of play and is not restricted to experts or newbies. This is the current way to learn guitar fast, while being fun too. With the overwhelming amount of dlc (It's like $3000 for everything at full price atm), you can also download tracks that other users have created here: http://customsforge.com/ (You need to make an account).Given what the game is, the replay value of this game is literally limitless, and is well worth it. The final bits to note are to not give up on this game! The better you get at the game, the more fun you will have mastering all your favorite songs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're like me, you played guitar WAY before even the original Rocksmith came out. I started playing 9 years ago and still love it to this day. However, at some point I stopped playing for a few reasons. Guitar is an instrument that suffers from feeling kind of lame if you aren't jamming with other people. Playing alone to a song is cool, for around an hour or two, but then you start wishing you had a drummer, or a singer, or a bass. Hence the reason why lots of people form bands and showcase their talent, put it to good use. I was like many who didn't have the opportunity growing up to join or form a band, I just simply didn't have enough friends that played instruments that would sound good together. That's when Rocksmith came around. I'm sure you understand the basic premise of Rocksmith. Simply put it's real life guitar hero. Notes come on the screen in vibrant colors to actual rock songs and you play along, except the catch is you play on a real guitar and are actually learning to play the songs. Great concept!Here's the deal. Rocksmith will NOT teach the average Joe how to play guitar. The thing Rocksmith succeeds at is making guitar fun for people who already play guitar. I'm sure if you gave it your all you could learn to play guitar with Rocksmith, but it doesn't teach you how to read sheet music or tabs which are rather key in playing guitar outside of Rocksmith. Nevertheless, Rocksmith is awesome for people that play, and it also took me down a peg, realising that playing guitar is NOT like riding a bike. You don't just set it down for a couple years, then come back to it and start jamming to Holy Diver. You have to rebuild lost calluses, regain flexibility in your fingers, all that great stuff. If you have never touched a guitar before and think you can learn how to play guitar from Rocksmith, that all depends on your determination but like I said before it doesn't teach you to read music. If you're a guitarist like me and are looking for something to bring back that initial spark in your marriage to your guitar then this is the preverbial sexy weekend getaway. With some drinks, a few half broken guitar picks, a spare pack of strings, and a whole lot of 80's hair metal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many years ago I bought a bass. A sexy matt-black Epiphone T-bird goth.I've been ""playing"" it on and off but I never really learned to play it.Now, along the years I've been tempted to buy a 5-stringer for that deep fatty B-string.But I never did, as I would remind myself that I couldn't even handle that 4-stringer.Enter Rocksmith 2014.................3 weeks of f@#king around with it and I really feel like im able to handle that T-bird.It only took one drink too many and a halloween sale...........I now own a  6-string bass.Buyer beware.

												Ohh what to say about Rocksmith?If you want to learn the guitar on a small budget and you are a motivated person, then rocksmith is amazing. Yes to be optimal you need to purchase the real tone cable, and yes you might have to adjust some settings. Once you have the game optimized though you will find that the game is pure gold if you are truly trying to learn the guitar. The first point is riff repeater, being able to slow a song down and play with the slowed tempo note for note while having the correct tablature is absolutely amazing. You play with the song at a slower tempo to match your current skill level, just as a student of the guitar would try to learn via a metronome however you feel the groove and you can miss some notes.... people trying to learn a new song for the first time miss notes all the time, and the game lets you know what notes you missed for further improvement...constant practice is ideal and this system is the best I have found. The second point is the in game effects. Being able to play any song that’s on the game and not having to worry about effects (it automatically switches for you) is a great addition. In order to play and sound similar to songs at home you need to have effects, all of which cost money to have in pedals or software programs. You can also have have fun in tone designer where you can create any tone you want via the provided effects, which seem somewhat comprehensive. The last point is the session mode. As a guitar player you will be expected to improvise and jam. Session mode lets you load up any scale you are currently studying, or just for a jam to be played with automated band mates. The mode is great for ""finding yourself"" on guitar and its displays all of the notes that you are trying to jam on.pros:guitar hero like learning experience that has been optimized for real student’s playerstrue guitar effects offered in game that would cost much more than retail price of RS14Riff Repeater... need I say more?Session mode to be there when you have no band mates.As a gamer it seems like it makes learning fun, things not mentioned are guitarcade, score attack, in game tuner to many popular tunings. Cons:Requires purchase of real tone cable. (this is a small cost when compared to the value of RS14)Requires guitar to be setup or in the ball park. (you cannot accurately play RS14 with a cheapass guitar, care about your tone and be careful about buying a guitar. look for an ideal neck and most importantly play the guitar and get a feel for it. I add this only because my first guitar had a warped neck due to the ignorance of myself, the buyer when I purchased it from a pawn shop. additional thoughts:Grab a guitar, have a positive outlook on things and I can guarantee that you will progress as a player. Take the time to slow songs down, develop your ears, and try to improvise as a player. Check out guitarcade if you get burntout, however its more of a game than a teaching toolI would be estatic if a new release of this tittle came out, till then jam out brothers.final verdict: 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2 and a half years into my guitar journey, hundreds of professional hours being tought by a fantastic guitarist, a few thousand hours clocked on personal practice time...was told this is what counted so took it by the horns. Started adding a little of Rocksmith to my diet as well..I`ll admit in the beginning I could not play sheeeeeeiiittt, but with my tutor slowly guiding me, my practice time clocking up and the odd little fiddle with this software my playing has become less of a chore for people listening to me. Now when I come back to Rocksmith, it is with a renewed excitment, I mean most of my Steam Library I`ll never complete...game debt if you call it, buy more than I can handle during sales but who doesn't right :o ...anyway back on topic, some of the songs I thought I could only play if I sold my soul or my left nuttsack like the other players but over time I have come to realise it really is about forgetting the pain and struggles and the horendous sounds I was making and just to pick the dam thing up and push through each session until you hit a moment you feel awesome about and have no clue where it came from. Anywayz enough waffle from me, probably full of more grammatical errors than my guitar playing so who gives a toss, I can play meaningful sounds from my Gibson :) Happy Days people! For those looking for a single tool to learn from then wake up, there is no one tool...in my own person limited experience unlike many other awesome players here, I feel strongly that what is required is an awesome teacher, followed by your unfaultering patience to learn and put in the hours, and I mean hours...then add this into the mix and it will come together ;). Thanks Rocksmith Team, now go put some Dire Straits on for us to play to!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i would say if you have an electric or even a semi acoustic guitar, but if you will use your semi acoustic you will have to make sure that your pickup/pickups are strong enough, if the pickup is not strong enough it will have a delay from what you are playing irl and what the game picks up. this game is 100% a really easy way of getting to know some awesome songs and even learning a little bit about guitars, i would give this game a rewiew of 8/10 the reason i do not give it 10/10 is because you will still need to get the official cable that does not come with this  purchase.there are a big and helpful community, and some of the guys have even made some songs that are not a official dlc songs that you can download for free on (http://customsforge.com/) under cdlcs but im not gonna get into that here you can just google it or look on youtube for some tutorials how to download the songs. have a good time and happy rockin ! ! !

												Temp review (will update as I learn more and more)This review is coming from someone who is learning his first instrument and from scratch, on a brand new Fender acoustic guitar with the cable. I have the game set to Rhythm Guitar. In short, the game is definitely good, it will definitely help you learn an instrument in a way that is more fun than having a tutor throwing mass amounts of complicated difficult to remember information at you, but has enough imperfections to make you frustrated and annoyed with each song until you're able to push through them with patience and get used to it. So it might not be better than a tutor, but it's probably not worse either. And it's likely a lot cheaper too... so there's that.I don't know the game all that well, so I won't pretend to know everything about it, and there's a good chance I might be wrong on a few things I'm about to write, but this is my experiences so far.I wish the game had better options for setting the difficulty and song speed before starting each song and during the song, instead of a regular speed and instead of the difficulty curve based on how well you do during the song. Because most of the time, I'll finally start to get the hang of the song's current difficulty, but then throw a bunch more new notes at me, overwhelming me with notes I can't handle at all. Most of the time, it'll go from 1 or 2 notes per strum to 5 or 6 in a very awkward hand position on the guitar and quickly go to other notes without even giving you a chance to figure out the first set of new notes. I just end up looking at the screen and going ""Are for f****ing kidding me?"" and just quit the song and move onto another one that I haven't played yet. Now if I was able to manually set the difficulty myself and maintain that difficulty until I'm ready for the new notes, and if I was able to manually set the speed of each songs, and maybe increase or decrease both while in the song... then I'd probably be a lot less frustrated, would enjoy the game far more and would definitely learn a lot quicker too.I will add that this is currently the only way that has helped motivate me into learning an instrument. I've tried to self teach myself into learning the piano, drums, etc... I could never learn proper notes on a sheet, let alone get used to the hand positions and hitting the right notes, etc... I can see this game becoming quite fun once I actually start getting pretty good at it. So far, the highest I've reached so far is about 55.9% on 1 song, 50% and lower for the rest, but one of them hurts my fingers a lot (and it tears through finger tip protectors quickly, which isn't good cuz they're expensive) and the the rest seem to get more and more difficult rather quickly.The game is really good for tuning your instruments (even better / more accurate than the built in guitar tuner), picks up on the notes while playing surprisingly well (unlike Songs2See), it even has options to allow the game to be more lenient on your imperfect / badly timed note playing so even if your instrument isn't tuned in 100% perfect, it'll still pick it up just fine so long as it's set up at a lenient setting.I do definitely recommend this game since it's currently the best program / game out there for learning how to play an instrument (much better than Songs2See even though S2S might be better for learning the actual notes on a sheet).On a side note, I do wish the game had a few easy / beginner songs in which rookies could actually complete 100%... like a sort of tutorial, to allow us to get comfortable with this style of game and feel like we accomplished something. Right now, I have a nasty bloody blister on my thumb, I still feel like I completely suck at playing the guitar, I have nothing at all to show my friends for all my efforts, even after almost 20 hours of playtime, I still don't know how to play any of the songs and I have the feeling it's going to require around 100 more hours before I can finally complete 1 song. I have no intentions of quitting, of course, but I just wish the game had a motivational song which we could complete 100% instead of slowly being able to get better over time and maybe someday be able to complete most if not all the songs all of a sudden (since they all feel equally very difficult).

												I can't guarantee whether or not it's the best way to learn guitar, but it went a long way towards getting me started. There are a wide variety of lessons and technique games for practicing them, and with the tone designer, you can have a lot of fun messing around with a lot of ""equipment"" and making all different sounds, turning your computer into a makeshift amp.I was actually sold on the game because of the ability to play along with a band, but find I actually don't use that feature as much as I thought I would. The downside of learning guitar by playing other peoples' music by rote is that you don't really end up learning how to make your own stuff that sounds good, and though they try to help by highlighting the notes that ""go together"" in any given key, I feel like the band would require a lot of fiddling to set up and getting used to to keep it going as I noodled around trying to make something, anything, that sounded good.Really, though, for learning songs you like and learning your guitar and building up your confidence with it, you really can't go wrong here. It's so much more fun than just playing tabs all by yourself, especially when you're starting out and they don't sound like much of anything. This will ramp up the difficulty as you continue to succeed while still letting you feel like you're playing along with the band, which keeps motivation high.My one complaint about the game would be in the technique games: it doesn't seem to be a problem everyone has, but I'm not alone in experiencing that the low E string doesn't always register properly, and sometimes you have to intentionally make it out of tune for it to pick up the note it expects. It's a consistent problem across all of the minigames, but not in the song playing section. Other than that, and my anticipating laying out a few grand in DLC and a bass guitar down the road, I can't really complain. I'd easily recommend this to anyone who's looking to get started or get better at playing guitar.If you've ever wanted to learn guitar and you can pick up a nice beginner electric or you've just got one collecting dust and you've been promising yourself you'll learn one day, pick this up and give it a shot. Don't let your dreams be dreams!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whoever green-lit this game was a genius! Anyone who's ever played Rockband/Guitar Hero has had the thought of ""man, I wish there was a game like this where you could plug in a guitar and get good for real"". And this game indeed grants that wish.While I wouldn't make it a primary teaching source, it is exemplary supplementary material that will familiarize you very quickly to the fretboard, the strings, and the feel of holding your guitar via a marvel of lessons (excellent introductions for novices, and decent review for the experienced), cute arcade-esque games (with LEADERBOARDS to give you some competitive motivation)…and of course, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of DLC songs to play along with (yes, the vast majority of songs are only available as DLC-- suck it up and support your favorite artists already!!).I had purchased Rocksmith 2014 under the impression that it was going to ride hard on the gimmick of using a guitar as a controller, but nope! You can tell that all hands on the drawing board really goaled for a feasible, functional, addictive, QUALITY product and could be both instructively useful and still hella fun.Much of this game is quite intuitive in what and how it allows players to control their practice. For instance, song difficultly gets automatically upped ever so slightly whenever the game detects you getting a steadier handle on certain song segments. And plus, there's RIFF REPEATER!: You can control the speed, select which part of the song you're struggling with, and even manually lower/raise the difficulty-- and it loops automatically.^^ Those are such little things that really facilitate the learning process in how much it smooths over what could have potentially been extremely frustrating moments to a player. And in a world where more and more devs seem to delight in ripping off their consumers with crappy product and shrugging and spouting bs like ""TRUE fans won't complain!"", it's so gratifying knowing I gave my money to people who actually seem like they cared and put a lot of thought into the players' experience.And as a result of their effort, I tend to plug in my guitar with the intention of only playing for a bit to kill time, and then only much much later realize I'd just spent hours simply dicking around on this game. It is that enjoyable. Definitely one of those things that earns the 'what a time to be alive' phrase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Combine this game with you tube lessons and a ton of practice and you will be well on the way to playing guitar.The lead is sold seperately.Invert the strings as soon as you load it (OPTIONS MENU) as you will encounter tabs at some point and it will all seem upside down if you don't.Well worth buying right now in the sale if you want to learn ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Rocksmith Cable does not work with Intel H81 or H87 USB controllers on Windows 10. Ubisoft support sent me through a bunch of troublshooting steps (most of which I had already found online and tried). In the end, their response was ""Windows 10 is not supported, so there is nothing more we can do for you."" Never mind that I had the same problems wiht Windows 8.1, and tried upgrading to 10 in hopes of solving the problem. Works great on my AMD laptop (which isn't supported either) though.I love the game, I really want to give it a thumbs up, but since they don't support Windows 10, and MS is pushing to get everyone off the OSes they do support, I can't give it that thumbs up until they fix this.

												The only game that channels your dopamine addiction into the possibility for an active sex life....but in all seriousness.Please Note: This isn't the be-all-end-all of playing guitar. You still have to put in the effort and practice while watching Netflix or something to improve your fingering strength. Studying music theory to increase your understanding also goes a long way.Now on with the VERY positive review...If you're addicted to flashing lights and a reward system then it might just be the thing that starts-off or increases your passion for playing guitars. I bought the game and yes, it is possible to play it without the Rocksmith plugin cable but you have to hack it to use a mic (A Good One), a direct line-in or a sensor plugin: I'm using an acoustic guitar.Shame on you Ubisoft for forcing people like this when it's clearly not neccessary. You did however redeem yourself by making this game because it's Fncking brilliant! EXTREMELY detailed! If I had the money I would rebuy this game every single time for the amount of effort Ubisoft put into it. I would literally remove my clothes so that Rocksmith could have its way with me. Seriously, that's how much I appreciate the creators of this game. Dammit, my nipples are moist again after I promised  a serious review.Pro's*Reward system helps you learn and actually puts the enjoyment back into playing guitar.*It looks pretty with the notes flashing when you get it right which adds to the dopamine reward system brain effect thingy...fnck, you know what I mean.*There are built in retro games where you can use the guitar as a controller called Guitarcade.*Its tutorials are some of the best I've ever seen, mainly because of its practical implementation. Also note that there is a negative side to this because sometimes the tone doesn't register in practice mode no matter how accurate you play it.*You can repeat and slow down song parts, which improves how fast you learn it.*It shows which finger goes on what string, this helps when it comes to studying notes and if you want to do them correctly. Although, this might be somewhat misleading because there are a number of ways you can play a chord and that's why I said you have to study how music works.*You can flip tablatures vertically to read it ""Upside Down"", which begs the question. Why the fnck do professionals write their tablatures the hard way around!? It's like the music industry is refusing to use the metric system.Con's*Sometimes the note detection is unresponsive so you'll have to live with a few ""missed notes"" and just listen if your play style was correct, you know, like they did before all this technology. This might be my biggest beef because of how much frustration this can cause.*There isn't a feature where you can slow down the games in Guitarcade, this might be frustrating to new guitarists because the vanilla difficulty doesn't really build up slow enough. Unexperienced players will spend more time in the Game Over screen than the actual game.*Ubisoft forces you to buy their Rocksmith reciever to play, unless you change your game settings. I understand why, it's business, but still shame on you Ubisoft: Doing that after all those private teenage sessions I had with the sexy girls in Prince of Persia Warrior Within!*For some, Uplay might be a con but to that I say, stop whining and play the god forsaken game for fncks sake! It's the only game on the market that teaches you a skill people find sexy! Playing Dota or Starcraft doesn't induce arousal!*Unfortunately this con is something no game can fix which is patience, practice and dedication. It does increase the passion with its reward system and this makes all the other aforemention aspects more bearable.In short I give it a 10/10 for what it set out to do. So, if you're a veteran player who stagnates on your passion or a gamer who procrastinates when it comes to playing your expensive guitar then open your buttcheeks and let Rocksmith have its way with you, darling.

												Rocksmith 2014;What started as a dream is now turning into a reality for thousands of people across the globe. You said to yourself as a kid while listening to the radio to your favorite song, or while listening to your favorite cassette/8 track (whatever you grew up with) that you wanted to be just like the people in that band. You wanted to grow up to be a ""rock star."" Well Rocksmith 2014 is the way to go. While it might not make you a rock star it'll certainly show you how to play guitar/bass.Rocksmith 2014 is the fastest/easiest way to learn how to play guitar. Either buy yourself a Real Tone Cable (the 1/4"" jack for your guitar/bass to USB) or with their newest ""Remastered"" update of Rocksmith 2014, use your microphone that's on your computer. Personally I would recommend you spend the extra money for the cable if you don't have that amazing of a microphone.Rocksmith 2014 is LOADED with tons of your favorite artists/bands to choose from and believe me, that list of DLC can look a little intimidating but if you don't wanna spend the money now. just wait for a Steam sale. As of now, the total cost if you were to buy all the DLC at one time is well over $3600 USD (1/2/2017) but there is always more content being released for you to choose from.So what are you waiting for? You've wanted to learn how to play since you were a kid. Get up and do it! There's nothing stopping you now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best games that I own.I've always had a dream to play guitar since I was two years old, (now im 16) and I must say that this game is helping me make my dream come true. I went from a complete beginner 7 months ago to now being able to actually play guitar and play full songs and impress the people around me.I love the the Riff Repeater feature that the game has because when im stuck on part of a song I could just put the section into Riff Repeater, slow it down and get comfortable and then slowly speed the section/s up.There's also a session mode option that you can use and you're able to form a band, and while you play the band keeps up with what you're doing which may help you come up with some cool riffs of your own or just jam out.In conclusion I would say that this game is a must buy if you decide you want to learn how to play gutiar. P.S; Remember to practice everyday!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I find Rocksmith 2014 a lot more playable than the original version. Notes are easier to strike, the tutorial is better organized and playing a song is a smoother experience (thanks to less latency). Arcade games are fun and session mode is a good way to improve your solo act.For all those who kind of gave up on Rocksmith, I recommend trying out the 2014 version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game/teaching software.While the lessons are somewhat of a mixed bag (you quickly stumble upon a problem of unforgiving difficulty), learning songs works perfectly and is very motivating. The idea of progressive difficulty based on player ability to play is implemented flawlessly.The selection of default songs was disappointing in the beggining. However after learning basic of playing guitar, I started to enjoy many songs, which I found mediocre at first. If standard set of songs is not enough, there's always DLC, where most players should find something interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game to add to your guitar practice routine. I wouldn't recommend relying solely on Rocksmith to further your guitar playing, but if used in addition to normal practice, it's a great tool to either introduce the basic fundamentals to beginners, polish up some skills for more intermediate players or just to have some fun and learn some songs. Learning songs is very easy as you can slow down the songs or simplify them until you're comfortable enough to move up in difficulty/ speed. The ever-expanding library of available songs to add to your playlist is huge and you'll definitely find something to suit your tastes in the vast selection of DLC songs. The only small problem I've come across is in the dropped tunings (mainly Drop C), where the low notes don't always register.Overall 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can rock out to Iron Maiden's ""The Trooper"" in my underwear and kill zombies with the magic of power chords. 10/10In all seriousness, though. I adore this game, and I deeply thank who recommended it to me. It's not only the most fun I've had playing games in a long time, but has also reinvigorated my love of guitar in a big way. For so long I would just pick up my guitar for specific things, like accenting synth lines or playing the same Cure and Bauhaus songs that I've been playing for years. Rocksmith has kind of lit this spark in me where I once again am picking up my guitar with a renewed sense of joy and wonder. I've been playing Rocksmith a LOT, but an interesting side-effect is that when I close it, I don't want to stop playing. So, I'll immediately after closing it pick up my other guitar and start to work on songs I've been writing and whatnot.Don't know what else to say about it. It's absolutely wonderful.

												After years away from music playing, I decided to start getting guitar lessons a month ago, then I noticed RockSmith.It's not going to make me quit the lessons (a physical teacher can give you more feedback on your posture mistakes), but it's making the learning process more fun, and coupled with my normal lessons it's also getting me better at playing.It gives challenges that guide you through a personalized path, and helps you get a grip of the phrases where you encounter the most issues.The minigames in the guitarcade section also allow you to get better at scales, chords, and technique, besting your highscores and giving you a fun way to learn technique.Expensive (especially because you need external hardware), but well worth it!

												I quit playing quitar in 2006 and picked up bass because my friends didn't have a bassist in their group and my guitar sucked really hard. After that I always wanted to pick up a new guitar and restart guitar but didn't have time although last year I bought a fine guitar. This fine piece of educational game really helps you get it up from where you left off. I don't know if it would let you learn from zero but if you learned at one point and want to continue but don't have the courage, this game might be the thing that you need.Also session mode is awesome if you don't have a band to train with. Only downside is you can't plau a smooth solo under a fast rhythm because they immediately follow you and slow down. Other than that it's amazing.10/10 highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first got Rocksmith I couldn't tell you the first thing about guitars. I ordered it for christmas just so I could set my new years resolution to learn guitar. Now, a little over a year later, I can play all of my favorite songs, I know tons of chords and notes and I have a great time playing. For the price it's asking that's hours upon hours you could be spending money on a lesson playing scales or something gross. In this game there are scales, but when you're first starting all you're gonna want to do is say ""Hey, I played my favorite song!""Also, NO MATTER WHAT. You MUST buy the ""Cherub Rock"" DLC. It's only around 3 dollars or something but that enables you to get ANY custom made song off of www.customsforge.com and play that on your rocksmith game. All you have to do is get the DLCThen go to customsforgeThen find a song you've been wanting to learnFrom there you can navigate to your DLC folder under rocksmith 2014And all you have to do is drag the file from your downloads to the DLC folder, and then you're set.Rock on.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Don't go into this game thinking its going to teach you how become a guitar god or something like that. This game is more suitable for beginners than it is for intermediate players.Songs sound accurate but have weird note positions that make simpler songs more awkward to play. Game is good for finger  exercises and muscle development but not that good at ear training and or teaching more complex guitar techniques. Other problems I encountered were the game's difficulty in recognizing or even registering some notes. If you are playing through HDMI there will be some slight audio lag that is kind of annoying. Also make sure to use a guitar that is properly intonated because the notes higher up the fretboard will be misrecognized by the game.  Other than that its a pretty fun time killer I would reccommend buying it when its on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have tried to learn guitar a number of times before. My friends all told be ""Just look at some YouTube Videos"" or ""just get some tabs and you're away"". Realistically, you need 1 on 1 tuition to get started and for the price of a couple of lessons you can buy this game and a real tone cable. I am really glad I got this, it encourages me to pick up my guitar every day and practice. I am sure I will reach a wall in terms of how useful it is, but it got me over a lot of hurdles and gave me a lot of confidence. I still have a long way to go, but I feel like a have a path mapped out and I look forward to playing a little every day, which is always a good sign for musical instruments or games.Based on discussions with a lot of my muso mates, I picked up a Yamaha Pacifica to use with this and it works really well. I have suffered no input lag with the real tone cable and I've really enjoyed how it lets me play the way I want to. I have learned a lot by playing the songs and then going into session mode and mucking about. I am not a huge fan of the arcade stuff, but it's easy to avoid. If you've always wanted to learn to play then I think this is a really great place to start. Alternatively, if you have never really cared but have enjoyed playing games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero, this is the natural progression (a basic starter guitar like the Yamaha doesn't cost much more than the cheap plastic peripheral you need to buy for these games either, and it certainly feels a lot nicer to hold)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE AFTER 100 HOURS IN GAME.....OK, so we are changing our review of Rocksmith 2014 to a thumbs up.  I now have 100 hours in this game.  I sometimes do exercises and cord drills while watching TV but not as much lately.  So why am I changing my review?  Well, although I feel that I am not musically gifted I now know that I can play and this is really growing on me.  I can actually play songs, hear what I am playing and am actually getting better at them without even using Rift Repeater.  I have more fun playing every song on lead and rhythm over and over and naturally progress.  Now Rocksmith will never let you rest so you have to be patient and know that if you nailed that song the last time then it will be harder this time.I can now say that I am very happy to be doing something really fun like playing a guitar rather than just playing some other game that takes you nowhere – I still do love unwinding with Defense Grid 2 and watching people playing Rocksmith on Twitch.As for errors: Once in a while a song by Foreigner and another song lose their tone but that is it.  The broken string thing never happened again.  As for the Xbox – Have not went back to that as I loving it on Steam with no issues.  For the bass – I am so busy with both guitar modes that I have yet to have time to get to that.  As for not hitting notes when you do – Try not to retune a lot and when you do tune again once you enter a song and you should be fine.So lately rather than logging out and feeling like a failure or know understanding my progress I now able to improve on practically everything that I play.  There are a couple of songs where I just need to dive into the Rift Repeater to move them forward.  Right now though I am just playing everything in both guitar modes and having fun.  In a few months from now I will probably start attacking songs one at a time and finishing them up.As for this being a computer game it could have some really easy improvements in functions and graphics but it does do what you want it to do.  So after 100 hours I can really see some improvement, can learn new things on my own, am having more fun and suggest this game for you to try.  Still faithfully doing 1 hour each night (even if I am in the mood or not  LOL).FIRST REVIEW.....If you REALLY have a passion to learn the guitar or bass then get this for sure.  If you want to play a game and learn guitar then pass.  For computer gammers the graphics are just horrible in the learning games.  There are no slow modes in the games so you spend more time restarting the games rather than playing them.  Every time the game tunes me from E standard to E sharp my little E string breaks - Lost 2 now.  DRM so watch that.  The people that you see ripping it up on Twitch have all played for years and just use Rocksmith to see what to play on a PC rather than on paper.  This game will not teach you to read music but only Rocksmith string colors.  Rocksmith also seems to favor speed over slowly developing good habits.  This is probably because the game is geared to hard rock, metal and alternative music.Now, I am probably not a natural at this and am a total beginner.  Am I getting better? - No clue really.  After 40 hours still cannot play Mary Had a Little Lamb yet.  I can play partials of many songs though - That said I have yet to attack any one song and have played everything once on lead and rythm.  Even when I do good on a song run I play it again to relive that experience and they throw more at you - You really never get a chance to just relax and repeat things.I play some pretty intense computer/console games and always have fun - I seem to log out of Rocksmith a lot feeling like a failure despite getting good progress in most things.  I have even logged out flustrated a few times.  Each night I play the games until I beat any 2 of my high scores then off to songs.  Lessons are horrible for me as I have to practice just to do one - Well the first few are easy but after that they are just way to fast.  Session mode is really cool if you can already play but if you are like me then you are just making noise even though they tell you what notes to play.  Game has some weird issues at times like the path tells me to go into session mode and tune my guitar using the tools - I do that but never seem to get the progress.  I have two hung progress goals so I quit doing those.I first bought the game for Xbox One thinking that this would be a cool living room game but that was a total failure - Freezes/hangs and is practically unplayable.  The PC version from Steam is much better with only minor issues.  No matter how good you play you will see everyone on Twitch rebooting the game after an hour of play.I have tested the bass and guitar.  My guitar is a Mexican Fender Stratocaster and I seem to like it but cannot tell you what is the best one for me or you.  So for me Rocksmith did show me that I can learn the guitar but I doubt that it will be my end game.  I have found some passion and play 1 to 2 hours each night.  I am also afriad that I am doing things wrong that I will have to unlearn later.  I might look into lessons later but will continue to test this out.Oh, one more thing: A note to play comes down to you put #1 finger on it and play it only to find out that that you are about to play some notes in the other direction so you need to shift.  Why not just show you the range that is coming down?  I will keep at this game and see where I am at a month from now but I am already worried because I cannot seem to feel good despite getting better.Good luck to you all with this game....

												Amazing learning game! Usually, I'm absolutely useless when it comes to instruments and all that, but Rocksmith is a great tool for learning how to play. Perfect balance of teaching lessons and popular songs to learn. The only downside I see about this is that the music is limited to songs that are available for purchase/download.All in all, excellent! I fully recommend this one :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those of you who want to rock, here it is: the answer to learning guitar. If you are some neckbeard who hates going outside and intereacting with people to learn guitar, this is the next best thing. Not only do you not have to interact with anyone, you can learn at your own pace.With a variety of custom songs on the internet, you don't have to drain your wallet until the next Steam sale for the official dlc's (which is worth). Depending on what kind of music you like or how you want to play, find those songs and jam to your heart's desire. The game has been getting frequent updates, so don't like ""2014"" make you turn and scratch your head. It is a very modern program and enjoyable. Not a game that will give ulcers or hernias like most of the other games with script kiddies or the early access ones.Only beef with this is that some notes can't be heard when played, but for me it's on the second fret and usually have to give more thrust to the string. Though the game and cable has been out for a while, the price of the Real Tone Cable has not dimished. It is a steady $30 new, sometimes $25 used from certain websites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever wanted to try out the guitar? Or maybe you laready own one, and you need help geting good at it? This might be the tool you need.When the first RockSmith came out, it was a novel idea, but not a new one. Games had tried to teach people to play music for real before, and the guitar was no stranger to this. But what made RockSmith good in my eyes was that it actually worked. It didn't just drop you in the deep end and say 'go', it helped you get through each riff step by step until you could play them note for note without even seeing them on screen.But it wasn't without it's faults and shortcomings. Thankfully, that's where this version comes in.The 2014 version added many features to the game, but it's overall shape became much less of a 'game', so to speak. The score you earn for each song is outright removed (available in a seperate mode if you still want that though) so now learning a song only tracked your progress in learning it. You still have objectives to clear, but these are all again geared towards advancing your learning of the instrument. While bass guitar was added late in the first game, here it's a native choice to play bass. And for both the guitar and the bass, the style of playing guitar has taken leaps forward. Gone is the options of learning a chord ttrack, single note track and combo track for each song; Now they exist as a much more sensible Rhythm and Lead option, alongside the Bass.Playing the instrument itself is now much clearer too. Many styles of guitar and bass play that were sorely absent from the last game, such as two-hand tapping, pinch harmonies, fret hand muting, and slapping and popping for bass, are now in the game for you to learn, alongside a far more accurate slide and bend notation, that actually shows you how far to bend the string this time and where to raise or lower the bend as the note carries on.But if you ever want to make it just  little more 'fun', then the returning Guitarcade can perhaps help you there, featuring a much nicer looking set of games to help you learn guitar play while under pressure. As earlier mentioned, there is also a new Score Attack mode for those that still want to chase the leaderboards with their songs, and it also features the ability for you to fail out now, meaning you'll have to know what you're playing before you come in here.Last but certainly not least, Session Mode. An entirely new addition, this is a more free-form jam mode that allows you to play your own riffs and have an AI band back you up. It also helps teach you the different scales. A very useful addition for those looking to move beyond playing cover songs.Overall, RockSmith 2014 is an improvement over the first game in far too many ways to count at this point. You'll need a decent rig to run it, mind, but if you're looking for a good fun tool to get you somewhere on guitar, there isn't really anything else out there that meets this standard.As long as you can get the RealTone Cable, of course.

I use the session mode almost exclusively, and the sounds and feels you can produce are good.takes a little getting used to, and you need to calibrate the game properly to get the right response.

												You will absolutely learn how to play guitar exactly how its supposed to be played.  You can learn at your own pace and modify the learning experience to meet any need that you have.  If the song is too fast, you can slow it down,  too many notes, lets break it down and remove a few, or if you want to really learn a groove you can put it on repeat.  The song library is generous for all genres and the dlc is well worth its price.  You can make any guitar sound like a million bucks with the amp features.  If you want to play bass but only own a guitar, the game can also emulate bass.  This is the perfect education program to get into learning guitar.  If you already know guitar then you can pick it up easy, this is not Rockband or GuitarHero, you'll learn exactly how to play the song.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I consider myself quite a skilled musician, when im not on this, im on my other instruments, and have been so for a while.. even after picking this game up i constantly find my self playing songs on it not only  practice but just for fun. The tone designer is amazing, and ive played albums with literally spot on tones. Its good for learning, and its good for people who just wanna play with a full backing track. The jam mode is amazing and ive melted faces with it! highly recommend if you play any sort of instrument. As a learning tool its pretty good, it teaches you some tricks, you can get scales down, but it will not teach the single most important thing in music: phrasing. This game did teah me some things, it did help me figure out some riff, but id recommoned using it in combination with some good ol fashion practice. Its good for staying fresh, warming up, and just playing songs without having to memorize the notes, which comes in handy when you know hundreds of songs. I recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This ""game"" is a must for someone who would like to start playing the guitar and does not know how to get into it. I did this and then started learning some music theory to, just to expand my abilities and understanding of music. It is rather a tool than a all in all guitar experience, do not fool yourself into thinking that you can be a guitar player just by following this simple yet addictive teaching platform. Now, first of all, it does not have everything, it misses the human interaction but I guess, it excuses a real teacher from having to wait for you to get better. You can learn at your own pace without having to get distracted, it is just you and your will to learn. Now, that is fine as long as you do not resume your learning to just that of the game, it is fun, simple and addictive, but why not take it further and start learning music like a pro? You can do this but only outside the game, as Rocksmith 2014 does not teach music theory, only techniques define-related to guitar or bass. The presentation of the game and menus are nice and they tell you exactly what to do, but it can get overwhelming sometimes, as too many representations of notes on screen will get you into believing it is all a sad joke. After a while you get used to the pace and start playing by memory because simple eye-hand coordination from the display wouldn't normaly be enough to play, it is that fast. It has a guitarcade, an area of the game where you do stupid-fun games to further enhance your skills, these are fun laid back games, made for gamers. These minigames are difficult and they will better your dexterity and skills with the guitar, a nice addition to a good package. It also has a session mode, where you jam with your guitar in different rithms and beats accompanied by other simulated instruments. The way you sing and the pace you give the play will make the instruments come to a good play and you can sing like this for hours. Great mode!I will give this a 9/10 for minor bugs and crashes. The only downside is that it can only be compared to it's earlier version, Rocksmith. It is a great and simple tool to make you start playing the guitar. If it does this I guess it serves it's purpose.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't a game, this is a tool and an amazing one.RS2014 is for those who want to learn to play guitar/bass but don't have time, money, availability, or something else to take lessons with a teacher in a music school or even with a ""personal"" teacher.I never took guitar lessons and after ~3 years of ""RS"" I'm able to play guitar even without the game, either known songs or just jamming, this tool allowed me to be able to accomplish that, which I would never be able to do it by taking lessons..... I'm not saying that with RS guitar teachers are ""disposable"", not even close, but for those who cannot take lessons, RS is the perfect solution imho.Just play every day, even if it's just 1 song and you're very tired from work and it's late and you need to go to bed..... just play every day, the maximum amount of time you can and sooner than you ever thought you'll be playing guitar like you probably never thought you would be capable of doing.Ofc I highly recommend this amazing product, which is an extensive and most certain a lot of hard work from the game devs, since the game basically doesn't have any significant bugs (or even insignificant, just no bugs at all, at least that's my experience) and works perfectly, exactly like expected.Kudos to the RS development team, they've ""invented"" and accomplished a product(s) that changed and will continue to change the lives of many people, for better ofc.

												OK, so I have played this game for 24 hours now and I feel like I can give a decent review of it. Suffice it to say that I love it! It is a really engaging way to learn to play the guitar. There's hundreds of songs to learn to play, dozens of games to play, and lots of video lessons to take. There are exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself to see how well you've mastered each one. The games are pretty cool, each game covers a different playing technique, so if you feel like you might need more practice in a specific area of playing there is most likely a game that corresponds to that certain skill, i.e. scale games to build speed and learn the notes and scales and chord games to build up your set of chords and to learn to shift between them.Learning to play the songs is by far the best part of the game to me. You might want to check out the game thoroughly to see if the DLC and the core game has music that you like! I know the game is called ROCKsmith, so if you are a country music fan and want to learn by playing country tunes, you might be a bit disappointed by the absence of country tunes in the game. I can see that the devs really try to keep a healthy mix of rock tune styles, which I really enjoy. I have heard a lot of songs that I would not have ever have had the chance to hear if it were not for Rocksmith-it really has broadened my musical horizons, as it were.I am still on the ""easy"" levels but I can feel myself inproving. I really look forward to practicing my guitar now because I truly enjoy playing Rocksmith 2014. Lastly, the other people on Steam that play the game are pretty cool. I can say without reservation that Rocksmith 2014 has the best Steam Community that I have ever seen. There's lots of help and support and friendship from the other Rocksmith players should you ever need it.Get it! Play it! Love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is so fun trying to get a highscore on a song, or a minigame, however, i didn't really feel like i've learnt something. I don't really remember the songs i've played without looking at the screen, and i believe that i becomes a too big of a reliability for thos who have just started playing the guitar. But all in all, it is still a great game, and i guess you could use it for learning to play guitar, just also remember to play without rocksmith.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is the only game in the world that makes good on its promise to teach you an actual real-life skill, and it's super fun every step of the way. The Remastered Edition takes what was already a solid A game and polishes it up to an A+ with bug fixes, UI improvements, and so on.If I had to spend the rest of my life on an island with only one video game, it would be this one. Purchase it if you are even slightly interested in learning to play guitar and/or bass.EDIT: I forgot to mention the most important thing - the custom songs! The game has an enormous community of creators who make custom songs that are 100% free to play and function exactly like official songs.

Practicing guitar has never been more fun.Only downsides are that you can't disable the lead guitar / rhythm guitar and bass parts from the backing tracks and that it's risky to get a tendonitis from practicing too much.

												I recently purchased Rocksmith® as I had seen quite a few good reviews and wanted to give it a shot. Keep in mind that you may have to purchase the Real Tone Cable ($28 USD) unless you have a good microphone to use.I've been playing guitar for about 30 years. The first thing that I did was set up the Settings to Never played Rocksmith®>Beginner>Lead Guitar>Lessons. I wanted to see how helpful the game was to someone that has never played a guitar before and quickly found out that it was not very beginner friendly. I tried the same Settings as Rhythm instead of lead and came to the same conclusion, a new player may get seriously frustrated with learning from this game.The Guitarcade seemed really thrown together in comparison to the rest of the game.My first attempt at difficulty set to Master (which does not even show the tab during the song) I received a platinum score that placed me around 800 out of 18,000+ other players. With even the slightest delay, it can affect your score, so I'm sure I can do better if I can sort out the latency issues.The game is fun for someone that already knows how to play, but I would never trade the lessons I received for what they are trying to sell here. I would highly recommend that you get personal training over this 60-day sales pitch.The one thing I can say that I currently like about this game is the preset tones for each song. They did a really great job on that part and if I can fix the latency issue, I can see myself enjoying the game a little more.However, I can't say that I'm shocked at the amount of money you must dump into purchasing additional songs. After I added all the songs available to my cart, the total hit $2,000+ USD... To sum things up on Rocksmith®: If you’re new to guitar, don’t jump straight into something like this. Take the time, spend the money and learn from a human first. Buy this game later to have some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith is a game that attempts to teach guitar via a Tab-like medium not unlike ""Rock Band"" or ""Guitar Hero"" type of games, but via real instruments connected to the computer. This kind of software has its benefits and shortcomings, though in my opinion Rocksmith is one of the best solutions of this type today.I will begin and say I am a Bassist and have spent about two minutes on this game playing guitar. So 99% of this review goes towards the Rocksmith Bass experience.PROS:- Learning an instrument requires repetition. ALOT of repetition. Rocksmith takes these repetitive basic exercises and makes them fun! Learning accurate slides is annoying? Not if it helps a ninja jump from pole to pole! Skipping strings is boring? Not if it saves a bar from an invasion of drunken cowboys!- One of the best ways to get motivated to play more is playing songs. But most songs are too hard for a beginner to play. Rocksmith has a solution for this: Dynamic Difficulty. According to your experience in the game (i.e. success rate and playing time), the game suggests songs and even changes the amount of notes shown in order for people of all levels to feel their gradual success at playing songs.- The game does not expect you to get new things on your own. There are instructional videos about every technique used in the songs, and you can always practice these techniques separately until you can use them in the songs.- The game has a humongous variety of songs, and in addition to them, a huge database of FREE user-made DLC that you can get from customsforge. It's all legal and requires you to buy one DLC song - Cherub Rock by Smashing Pumpkins.- The game also lets you play around with various amplifiers, cabinets and effects. Can't really say much about this one, since I never use this function, but it exists so nyah. (Unfortunately there is no expression pedal input so no WahWah and the flangers are automatic only).CONS:- It's very easy to mistake the game for a full fledged course in music. Musical Theory, a very large part of playing music, goes completely ignored. I can understand that - it's much more complicated and less hands-on, so basically the developers would spend alot of time creating content that almost nobody would use.- Despite what they say in the trailer, you will never remember the songs you play in the game unless you practice them separately. I think it has something to do with processing efficiency of our brain - once it decides the song does not have to be memorized to play it (because the notes run around the screen), you simply won't remember anything you'd play. This is true for ALL the games of this type.- I think the order of the song, by difficulty, in this game is kind of wrong, and was much better in the first RS version. They might've fixed it in the Remastered version. 100 hours is enough for the game to automatically suggest everything on ultra-hard difficulty so I may have a wrong experience about this.- The ""Real Tone"" cable that needs to be used with this game has its limits. First and firmost - it's really bad for Bass guitars. It can't read sustain unless your guitar is Active and Neckthrough and has a huge amount of overtones (Tested with a Fender Precision and Cort A4 - Precision has more sustain but the game thinks the A4 does). Second, its driver is really bad, so if your guitar is quiet and the microphone driver for the cable needs to be turned up, you will have to turn it up every launch of the game.All in all, it is a very solid game that can definitely give a huge boost to beginners, and breathe new life into practicing for pros. I recommend. If you grab RS1 and the RS transfer DLC, you will get like 60 songs for $30 so it's also a good deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In December of 2015 I bought rockband 4 and I loved it, but I wished I could use an actual guitar I did a bit of reseach and found Rocksmith 2014. 10 months later I have played 483 hours of Rocksmith, and just loving every minute of it, and each time I play I am quantifiable getting better.I've had some conversations with other people playing Rocksmith and it seems everyone learns in a different way. Rocksmith excels by giving you many tools to learn in a way that feels most natural to you as a player. You can just ""Learn a song"", use the ""Riff repeater"" to hammer in a specific part of a song, use the ""Arcade"" to learn specific technices, use ""Session mode"" to learn improvising, and ""Lessons"" to learn the theory and practice technices.Here is how I use Rocksmith. I play pretty much only use ""Learn a song"" without the Riff repeater. During my session I will go through many songs. I think this trains me to do sight reading, and being able to play anything that comes my way. In fact when I buy a DLC, Rocksmith will start me off at pretty high difficulty as it is tracking how well I play songs for the first time.There have been many cases where a song is too hard to even do at the easiest levels when I started out, I just exited the song with 30 seconds. Yesterday I thought I would try them again, and although it was only at about 40% difficulty I was able to finish the songs this time with 80% accuracy. It gives me a very good feeling to all of a sudden being able to play a song after having to quit in frustration just a few months ago. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know if I can write anything here that hasn't already been written in praise of this game. I will start off by saying that I'm 38 years old and I haven't touched an instrument in years. I played piano for 6 years (grades 2 - 8) which taught me to read music and a lot of music theory. I plunked around on an acoustic guitar here and there in high school, but never really learned to play anything. A few years ago I was introduced to Rock Band 3 and had a lot of fun with it. I got back into Rock Band with the release of 4 and started wondering about turning that Rock Band experience into real music experience. I remember running across Rocksmith reviews and reading good things about it. I started looking into Rocksmith, reading reviews and watching videos. I was floored when I saw that playing along with songs was nearly identical to Rock Band. Hey! I know how to do that! :)Fast forward through boring details about buying a guitar with my boyfriend and then buying a bass for myself...Going into Rocksmith, I knew that all the important technique things that you need to force yourself to practice were disguised as games (the Guitarcade). I usually don't get caught up in score chasing or leveling up or earning banana stickers so I wasn't sure if I'd be motivated enough to play them. Holy cow, they are fun! My goal is to be able to play without looking at my hands and playing String Skip Saloon and Ducks ReDux has gone a long way in helping me do so. I was spending 50% of my play time (playing at least 1 hour a night) in the Guitarcade and it was paying off in leaps and bounds. My boyfriend, who has been playing guitar on and off for years, noticed that I was outpacing him in a few areas. (He tends to put on continuous play for an hour and go through songs.) He remarked ""I need to start playing more Guitarcade games!""I also follow along with and try to complete the goals that Rocksmith sets out for me. Although I don't do much with Session Mode, I did learn a lot about using it and learned some important music theory along the way. Pretty neat!After 3 weeks of playing, I am floored by the progression that I have made. I never expected to be as far along as I am. I am by no means a ""Rock God"", but I'm doing way more than plunking out Mary Had a Little Lamb or Happy Birthday. :)I look forward to practicing. Let me say that again: I LOOK FORWARD TO PRACTICING. Crazy! The Guitarcade games are fun and challenging. It's fun learning songs and there are a lot of fun songs to learn that come with the game. Through Guitarcade playing I found that I unlocked some original Rocksmith songs. Neat! I haven't bought any DLC yet and I'll wait for the Steam sale for that.We bought a second copy of Rocksmith and we will sometimes play multiplayer mode. It's a lot of fun! ""Oh my god! This is real life Rock Band!""Just like any talent, if you put the time into it, you'll get something out of it. Rocksmith makes it super easy and fun to put that time in.			",44,9,0,8,6,0,3

												Works really well when configured properly, it's very sensitive with the calibration and sound settings, but once you get past that and the tuning you're good to go!!! Definitely helped me get better at guitar and is continuing to teach me. I don't know about the 60 day challenge, but I (and probably most people) don't have time to dedicate 2 or 3 hours each day to the guitar to do that challenge, but regardless it will help you and what you learn you won't forget. I stopped playing Rocksmith for a couple months, but one I picked it back up, it didn't take very longer for me to get past my previous playing level. There's a huge selection of songs, so give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always dabbled with bass, but never got really serious with it. Now I find myself reaching for perfection in certain songs and trying to improve my skills. While some of the guitarcade games don't work very well with bass, the songs are fun to learn, and mastering a song gives you a true sense of accomplishment while you learn a skill.Rocksmith has inspired me to go beyond the game and pick up some theory and technique books, as well as seeking out information on how to become a hobbiest Luthier and build my own guitar for fun. (Why not, right?) I'm sure everyone's experience will be different -- some may approach it like Guitar Hero and play it only as a game, others (and most of us) will use it to learn a few tunes. I was a mediocre bassist before, but I truly think RockSmith has given me a better understanding on how to play. It's a great starting point for learning, and also excellent to learn some of your favorite songs.Beware, you will probably get calloused fingers. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game!* I play bass and I don't have any tuning issue, all my notes are recognized perfectly. Just be careful to turn up the volume of your bass or guitar to the maximum, otherwise the game will definitely miss a few notes. *When I started I had never ever played bass in my entire life. This game teaches you a lot through lessons and adjusts the difficulty according to your level... And when you start from ground zero, it's such an amazing feeling to finally get 100% on a song - even if it's the easiest one hahaWhen I felt more confident with my skills, I've actually spent some time learning songs outside the game and the rythm and maniabilty skils you get from the game perfectly transfers into ""real"" playing. I'm far away from being a pro yet, there are some techniques and positioning I definetly have to work on, but this game is a very fun way to practice and keeps you motivated everyday.  PS: if you play bass (I guess guitar players don't have this problem), remember to turn up the bass volume in the game and turn down the other instruments a bit, just to hear what you're playing more clearly.

												At the time of the review i played the game for about 90h. I started as a complete guitar noob and now i can play a lot of songs pretty decent and got my first song on 100% completion! I should have bought that some years ago and i would probably play in a band right now (so many time wasted with guitar hero :D ). Think about it more as a learning programm than a game, because you still have to put in a lot of effort and ambition, but it makes learning a lot more easier than to do it by yourself by tabs or online tutorials. I recomend this firmly to everybody who wants to learn playing the guitar!11/10 would buy again to travel back in time and give it to my younger self ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are two things Rocksmith 2014 stands for.One is that it's the most fun and probably the easiest way to learn to play guitar. You may have zero knowledge about music and musical instruments yet still play the game and get results. It will teach you everything you need to start playing and creating music - from how to attach the strap to the guitar to more advanced things like slapping or using effects pedals (available within the game).Another thing is that even if you're already a good guitar player, you can still enjoy playing Rocksmith. There are over 50 songs of different genres and decades you can play along with. You can have a friend connect their bass guitar and join you, or you can even sing in the mic. You can also treat the game as something to beat, by mastering all the songs without any visual help from the game. You also get to experiment with the large amount of sound effects Rocksmith provides. Still not happy? Try the mini-games with leaderboards. Beat the world or just your Uplay friends at sliding, playing chords, scales and so on. And if that doesn't satisfy, the Session Mode will give you a band that can equip a variety of instruments related to many genres to create a rhythm for you or support you adjusting to the way you play.All in all, it's a must-buy if you have an electric guitar or a bass. The amount of money invested totally pays off, even if you buy the Import tool to get the tracks from the original Rocksmith or choose to add more songs by buying separate DLCs from well-known bands like KISS, AFI, Muse or The Police (Sting).Having a music teacher, finding a band, guitar tabs, buying amps, effects pedals or a dedicated computer program that would emulate these would require way more money and effort.

												I purchased RS2014 just wanting it to be a ""game"" like Rockband or Guitar Hero. I didn't have a real interest in learning to actually play the guitar (I've tried numerous times in the past and given up), all I wanted from this was something I could casually play, but with a bit more challenge/reward than the ""plastic guitar"" games.It started off exactly how I was expecting - just playing a single note every now and then, but as you improve and play the notes its' giving you well the game will adjust and add more into the mix. Before too long you'll be given chords, double-stops, legato techniques, and plenty of other new bits to play.The way the difficulty works is good, it won't give you something to play that's way over your head (too often), but keeps you improving at a good rate.In the few weeks I've been playing, I've progressed a lot further with my skills than I have in all my previous attemps to learn guitar without Rocksmith. I'm interested in learning to play again, and this makes it a great way to do it.Pros:* Very cost-effective way to learn (if you already own a guitar).* Being able to have your skills quantified (Mastery percentage, song accuracy, scores etc) and improving is great motivation to see your progress and keep playing.* Makes practicing fun!Cons:* Music choice is decent, but could do with a lot more songs. New songs are released every week though.* There's no option to see the music to play in Tab format.Overall, I highly recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you learn something while you play.

												A sequel to a game that I could not fault in any way smashes the original into a brick wall and recycles it into toilet paper. Rocksmith 2014 is fantastic. It improves upon every aspect of the original game and has a metric tonne more features to rock out to.Firstly it has done away with the performance mode, which was where you would play a gig at a number of Royal-Albert-Halls to a crowd of cardboard cutout people. The people were well rendered greenscreens of actors, in a very L.A. Noire-esque style, but they were all individually animated and in great abundance, so the game would lag on a lot of systems potentially making the songs unplayable. The other problem was that the actors danced away to a predetermined tempo, so every few seconds the animation would have to restart itself, assumably to prolong the lie of synchronisation. Rocksmith 2014 has scrapped the stadiums in favour of silhouettes of your audience all dancing in time. It's simple, pretty and doesn't defeat the object of a musical game.Everything in the game feels a lot more smooth. There's no delay or lag within songs like the previous game had, especially when the computer had to decide if you played a chord right. There are 100% no loading screens. You pick a song and it throws notes your way. It is nice to see that Ubisoft have taken what the community says on board. The original greeted a loading screen with the information that you could give your guitar a little play while you wait. After suggestions from consumers, you can now play at any time in the menus.The types of notes that you play are improved very well. The bend notes are described excellently telling you how far to bend and how long to bend the string, which is a damn sight better that the ""It's a bend, off you go"" from the first game. The same goes for slides, which before reminded me of ""cut it carefully"" from the Cooking Mama series. You can now expect to see palm mutes within chords as well as single notes and you can expect regular mutes as well. Two-hand tapping is also included in the songs which is great fun.In short, this game is everything a sequel should be: more refined, more features and so much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith is a great great if not the best starting point for learning the electric guitar in my opinion. Yes, a personal guitar teacher would be great. It would also be great if you could study music and art at the same time and tour with a band to learn your instrument.the problem is, not everybody has the time and oportunity to do this kind of stuff, it also involves quite a commitment. This is where rocksmith shines, it gets you playing. Despite all the flaws and the lack of theory it teaches you it gets you started soemwhere you gain not only an understanding on how to play the instrument but also an actual feeling for it.I'm looking back on playing the guitar for around 1000 hours now thanks to rocksmith, whereas in total the rocksmith hours float around 300ish i think... the other hours i played outside of rocksmith using whatever rocksmith taught me to understand and work on music theory to become an actual musician the way i like it.Rocksmith will teach the fastest and the most effective on how to improve technically on the guitar. How your fingers move on the fretboard, how to hit your stuff. It won't teach you how to compose a song, or what actual music theory is, but let me tell you this:it's great WHEN you decide to dip into music theory that your hands are not holding you back anymore because you can translate what you learn so much faster than if you had to learn this from scratch as well. (and THAT is boring as hell).10/10 for this life changing game.			",172,24,2,23,42,0,49

												I am going to edge towards recommending this game, because there is no maybe button.If you are learning the guitar I think this would be a great tool, but I have been playing the guitar a long time and bought it as a practice tool, there is nothing more boring than practicing by yourself - so I was basically looking for glorified backing tracks and maybe to branch out and play some styles I wouldn't ordinarily play.The first problem I hit is that you have to basically learn a new notation, also I am colour blind so the colour coded strings were not a great help to me. I've spent 20 years reading tab and standard notation sheet music and suddenly I have to learn another system, let's just say that motivation was low.Also as other reviewers have mentioned it starts you out very slowly which is frustrating if you know the song, but I discovered if you just play the full part then it will quickly build it up. The problem I came to was when I was completely unfamiliar with the song I didn't get enough warning of what was going on to follow along. So a song I could have easily played along with if I had had the tab or music I was left with no idea what was going on.Another issue I had was it not recognising when I had played the right notes, especially at the low end on my Les Paul - maybe it didn't like the signal from the humbuckers. I found it greatly frustrating to have played something note perfectly and it to tell me to repeat a passage because it hadn't registered the input correctly.So - in conclusion: If you are an experienced guitarist this may provide more frustration than fun, but for a beginner I can see it being a fun way to learn.

												Rocksmith is a great tool to learn how to play guitar, whether it be from just playing along to the songs, playing the games to get to learn some of the techniques (Tremelo, Harmonics, Volume Dynamics, String Skipping) or even just jamming along to a band of your choosing. This game is great, it has some great songs on it for beginners (like R U Mine?, Blitzkreig Bop) and great songs for expert players as well (Satch Boogie, Bat Country, The Spirit of Radio, and The Trooper). If none of those fit your taste, there is also the 1000+ DLC songs to choose from, with everything from Metal Bands with shredding solos, to bands with more Pop-Oriented chord progressions and bass lines. Overall, its a great game for music fans, and for those who want to learn a type of guitar, whether it be Lead, Rhythm, or Bass, its great for everyone... And its a great Transition from Guitar Hero/ Rock Band.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this thing. Been plucking away for over a year with this system and it has helped keep me engaged while I've matured from a complete novice to a slightly more experienced novice. Would have certainly lost interest in practicing without this software. There will be things you need to research and learn outside of what this program offers, but it keeps me coming back to play that one more song which is what I consider most impressive and worthwhile.

												The remastered version is better. It added a tracking option where the player can pause the song and view the notes one by one. Better than going into riff repeater and putting the song at 1% speed. I hated playing the songs that slow. The tracking feature makes learning the solos much eaier. Also the song search option is great. Instead of just sorting the songs via a catagtory, the player can now type in a specific song. Good for intermediate players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like the concept of guitar hero but want to play an ACTUAL GUITAR / BASS, Get this. I have played and improved a lot since I started playing on March 2015. Though you will need to have some of the fundamentals before attempting the game. I suggest checking out justinguitar.com for the very basics. Have fun! :^)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am going to edge towards recommending this game, because there is no maybe button.If you are learning the guitar I think this would be a great tool, but I have been playing the guitar a long time and bought it as a practice tool, there is nothing more boring than practicing by yourself - so I was basically looking for glorified backing tracks and maybe to branch out and play some styles I wouldn't ordinarily play.The first problem I hit is that you have to basically learn a new notation, also I am colour blind so the colour coded strings were not a great help to me. I've spent 20 years reading tab and standard notation sheet music and suddenly I have to learn another system, let's just say that motivation was low.Also as other reviewers have mentioned it starts you out very slowly which is frustrating if you know the song, but I discovered if you just play the full part then it will quickly build it up. The problem I came to was when I was completely unfamiliar with the song I didn't get enough warning of what was going on to follow along. So a song I could have easily played along with if I had had the tab or music I was left with no idea what was going on.Another issue I had was it not recognising when I had played the right notes, especially at the low end on my Les Paul - maybe it didn't like the signal from the humbuckers. I found it greatly frustrating to have played something note perfectly and it to tell me to repeat a passage because it hadn't registered the input correctly.So - in conclusion: If you are an experienced guitarist this may provide more frustration than fun, but for a beginner I can see it being a fun way to learn.

												Best tool out there for learning guitar. Lesson mode is really helpful and has helped me a ton. I've only ever looked up tabs before so I had no idea how to properly play but the game teaches you proper technique making it much easier to play. Pretty good song selection on base game but has TONS of dlc you can get.Session mode is a blast, tons of different options for instruments the game throws in to play with you as you warm up or just mess around.  Arcade mode is pretty cool too, uses 80's style arcade mini games to help you practice scales, chords, and much more!If you've got a guitar get this game. If you don't go get one.

												I've only learned how to play guitar through Rocksmith and RS2014. I've played for almost a year and can master most songs. If you have the money and are interested in learning an instrument (guitar) buy this game! You won't regret it! I would recommend looking through the songs Rocksmith and RS2014 offer and then Youtube-ing them to see how they are played in game to see how awesome you will become! Don't get me wrong...your fingers will hurt, you will get upset with some techniques, and you will never want to tune a damn guitar again while getting use to the game. The outcome of being able to play was extremely cheap though...This game actually teaches you a skill that can be displayed away from a damn PC. If you are debating on it please contact me! I will try to help you with any questions you have! \m/ ROCK ON \m/			",107,10,2,2,8,2,4

												This game is a masterpiece. It actually teaches you how to play guitar and it's doing it better than it's predecessor. It supports more tunings and techniques. The DLC's are expensive, but if you don't find the song you want to learn as one of them, there's always hope that someone made a ""custom song"" at CustomsForge for free.

												Get it while it's cheap! You will still have to buy the real-tone cable, somehow.I've played guitar for over 20 years, on and off.  When I picked up Rocksmith a little over a year ago, I didn't think I'd be playing it on a daily basis.  It's a good stress relief and learning tool.  The 'bass emulation' feature has got to be my favorite option, since I don't own a real bass guitar, I can use my electric six string instead and have the software mimic a bass tone.  Get it if you know how to play guitar and wanna have fun and maybe learn more.Get it if you're a guitar noob and want a fun and easy way to learn guitar or your favorite songs.PS:  There's a large community site that offers 'customs' of songs made by the community from real songs.  There's thousands to download and the community is pretty active. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LONG OVERDUE:I stopped using Steam to play this game and I now use a pirated version that still supports custom songs. This game no longer does that. I suggest that no one ever pay this company for a copy of this game again.Playing acoustic with books and sheet music/tabs for a year hasn't gotten me the experience I've had in a week with this game. No more stumbling around or being unsure how to hold your hand for a certain chord. Rocksmith has everything easily explained, as complicated as it knows you can play, rewarding with levels of progression, and an awesome session mode. It suggested I play along with it's band for 10 minutes, and I was locked in learning scales and chords for two hours. A cheap guitar is 100 bucks at your local pawn shop and the cable you can order online. This game is good for your soul and you need to be playing it.EDIT:300 hours later and I can say this:My fingers have hurt for the last year. I play as much without the game as I do with it now, maybe more. I'm making my own music, meeting new people, and I feel like I'm developing a skill worthwhile.I don't know how many people have asked me ""Does it really work?"" or ""How long have you been playing this?""This game is motivation. Without it, I might stop a painful riff after 5 or 6 reps of it. When a song is 7 mins long and you've gotta repeat that thing 100 times, it whips the ♥♥♥♥♥ little ""uggn... my FINGERS huuurt..."" into shape and keeps pain levels at maximum. When you finish a song over 95% when a quarter through the song you were sure you wouldn't make it? Best of feels.I mean, I rocked out to ""Killing in the name of"" on bass so hard the first time I caused my fingers to bleed. I didn't notice bleeding fingers I was so into it.I'd notice bleeding fingers if I was playing TF2.			",142,24,6,15,14,1,13

												Ever had an interest in learning to play guitar? Or Love music rhythm games, well this is for you.Personally from my experience so far, Rocksmith 2014 is much more polished and with lots of new fun features in the new 2014 edition to the first release, arcade games are better and the learning process for each song has improved too with feedback and recommendations after you play, built in video guitar lessons from professionals (which are very good), and you learn at your own pace. Even if you cannot play guitar after playing this you will be able to learn to play or enjoy playing a simpler version of the song with the simplified notes.Also another thing is back in high school i took guitar lessons, and played guitar but i never actually played a song from start to finish, usually just random riffs or just mucking about, but Rocksmith makes learning the song and practicing even just a single song for hours fun.Also for a low price, if you own a guitar and don’t already own this game, I recommend giving this a go, Super fun, and makes even the boring and hard part of learning guitar extremely fun, and having the progress bar is extremely nice to see how well you are doing and the game motivates you to try and 100% master the song. Also for musicians the Jam sessions have intelligent Ai to Jam with which is pretty cool.Only issues I had was a little audio lag, and also the volume on my High E and sometimes the B string might not get recognized however takes a bit of time calibrating the right settings, but once everything is all set up and sounding nicely, it’s a very fun game and fastest guitar learning software & game out there.

												Although I had already played guitar for 3 years prior to picking up Rocksmith, it has helped me improve in a lot of ways! If you are a beginner who wants to learn how to play, then RS is great for you. If you are a seasoned veteran it is also great for you!The songs in the game aren't that great (atleast not for me since I prefer metal, there are only a couple metal songs in the game), but there is Custom DLC! If you head over to Customsforge then you can browse thousands of songs to add to RS, which is amazing! And there are normal DLC songs to buy aswell, that are official. The arcade games are fun and very helpful aswell. RS is definately worth your time if you are wanting to learn guitar, or just looking to have fun!also you need to hit 10K hours to git gud			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best thing that happened to my guitar. I had a Classic guitar for 10 years, and an Electric for 3 years prior to Rocksmith, but I never practiced as frequently or intensively in all these years, progressed that far, or had so much fun as with Rocksmith. Just plug your guitar and have instant fun. I always dreamed about something like Guitar Hero / Frets on Fire for a real guitar, so when I discovered the original Rocksmith on Steam, I grabbed it right away, and a year later also got the 2014 version on launch. It's not without some flaws, but the Value I get from it dwarfs any negative things I can come up with. If you like to play guitar, Get it. Buy the original Realtone cable, buy another one so you have spare, and also buy the original Rocksmith 2012 (preferably cheaply on sale), so you have access to the original DLC library. Don't ask why it refuses to work with non-original cable, or why it requires you to buy the original Rocksmith just to be able to buy a DLC from original library that appears in Rocksmith 2014 anyways - no one cares and no one will fix it. Concentrate on playing the guitar and having fun.The DLC library is pretty damn amazing to my taste, and keeps growing constantly at a steady pace. And now with the addition of Spinal Tap DLC it rightfully goes to 11.Best game on Steam. 11/10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I never had touched a guitar before this, I always thought it would be impossible to play songs from my favourite bands as it would take years of learning with teachers and it would feel like a chore, but rocksmith made everything easier and more interesting! I played for one or two hours each day and I couldn't believe the way I was progressing! It was way faster and more enjoyable than I expected! I think that playing guitarhero/rockband in the past helped me understand and follow the way notes are presented in rocksmith cause they appear in a similar way as in those games. If you are not familiar with those games, you will find it a little difficult at start, but as you keep practising you will get better and better in no time!I Recommend it as a great tool for everyone that has a guitar!-Xzibit: Yo dawg!

												Back in the day when Guitar Hero and Rock Band became popular, I used to think how cool it would be if you could do the same thing but with real instruments.  Well, I've only put 10 hours into this so far, but it's very useful for learning to play guitar.  The starting selection of songs is OK with at least one or two songs I wanted to learn to play.  The prices for some of the DLC songs is a bit much for my liking but assuming they keep adding to the list of songs it may very well prove to be a case where I'd actually WANT to purchase and use the DLC.  Right now I think I can live without them (especially since I'm still very much a beginner).You've got basically a set of lessons for everything from how to hold the guitar and manually tuning it all the way up to some complicated techniques.  These include practice lessons so you can demonstrate to the game that you've mastered it (except for the first few lessons that don't include actually playing).  From what I've seen, most of these lessons can be taken from 0% to 100% mastery in no time at all, though some of the techniques are tricky enough that it could take some hard work to get it down.The Voice Over/Teacher in the game does his best to sound non-intimidating, but can instead come off sounding insincere, especially when you know that you flubbed the lesson and he says ""good job!"" at the end.  Then again, at least one point he told me I needed more work and yet another time I was told ""it could be worse"".  Gee, Thanks.Your other options include ""Learn a Song"", Session Play (where you have a virtual backup band play for you), and the guitarcade.  Learn a song is self-explanatory, Session Play could be fun when you're ready to jam assuming you can tell the backup band just which chords you want to play, and the Guitarcade is a great way to practice without it feeling dull.I've played a bit of the guitarcade to help familiarize myself with the guitar and it's slowly helping.  I can feel myself reaching for the right strings more often, and hitting the proper frets without having to look quite as much.  I am not sure I exactly agree with their system of levelling up on these games, but that helps to give you a secondary goal to just increasing your score.   Speaking of goals, this game is chock full of them.  Sometimes the game will decide it's time you looked at a new song, or tried a new mode, and other times the game considers you need more practice with chords and sends you to the guitarcade to work on it.  This is kind of a nice feature, but it feels too random at some times.   Other times the goals make more sense, like when you're learning a song, it may recommend you work on a particularly hard phrase.  However, It can be rather demanding for a newbie.  When you first learn a song, it tells you to play one note on one string and that's it.  After you demonstrate you can do this ONCE it may decide to up the ante and now you're playing two notes on two strings.  Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it throws more at you until you feel like you're overwhelmed again.  I would like to feel like I've made progress first before going into the harder territory.  I think there's a way to reset progress on a song but that could put you too far back.At least when you're using the ""Riff Repeater"" you can choose how much it throws at you, for how long, how many times you have to play it before it moves on, if it should get harder or not, etc.  The riff repeater is probably the best thing about learning a song since you can customize it fully. The store has tagged this mistakenly as having Uplay.   The game itself does not require Uplay at all though.  It doesn't show up in my list of games on Uplay when I do launch it, and even though I am given the option of logging into Uplay, it's through the game with an email and password only...No Client running in the background.Also, the Rocksmith website offers a ""60 day Challenge"", where you can show your progress from complete beginner to novice guitar player in just 60 days.  The caveat to this is that they expect you to play at least one full hour per day, and the timer doesn't run unless you're actively in a lesson, learning a song, doing the guitarcade or whatever.  Steam at this time says I've played for 11.4 hours, Ubisoft says I've played for 3 hours and 44 minutes and the 60 day challenge website says I've done 2 days worth of practice. :(I was going to update this at 60 game hours but that  blew right by so fast I had no idea it was gone. Instead I'm editing this at the 60 day mark since I got the game.  Can I play a song 100% No... almost though.  I've got a couple in the 80%-90% range right now. Next update when Ubisoft thinks I've completed their challenge.  It seems to only record 1 day of the challenge if I've spent at least 2 hours in game (not in menus).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever had an interest in learning to play guitar? Or Love music rhythm games, well this is for you.Personally from my experience so far, Rocksmith 2014 is much more polished and with lots of new fun features in the new 2014 edition to the first release, arcade games are better and the learning process for each song has improved too with feedback and recommendations after you play, built in video guitar lessons from professionals (which are very good), and you learn at your own pace. Even if you cannot play guitar after playing this you will be able to learn to play or enjoy playing a simpler version of the song with the simplified notes.Also another thing is back in high school i took guitar lessons, and played guitar but i never actually played a song from start to finish, usually just random riffs or just mucking about, but Rocksmith makes learning the song and practicing even just a single song for hours fun.Also for a low price, if you own a guitar and don’t already own this game, I recommend giving this a go, Super fun, and makes even the boring and hard part of learning guitar extremely fun, and having the progress bar is extremely nice to see how well you are doing and the game motivates you to try and 100% master the song. Also for musicians the Jam sessions have intelligent Ai to Jam with which is pretty cool.Only issues I had was a little audio lag, and also the volume on my High E and sometimes the B string might not get recognized however takes a bit of time calibrating the right settings, but once everything is all set up and sounding nicely, it’s a very fun game and fastest guitar learning software & game out there.

												 A Very good Game /learning tool, but you MUST make sure prior to purchase that the PC is up to spec and that any existing software on your operating system will not interfere with this game, as it is so heavily relient on audio and graphics.There has been an issue with users not being able to download Dlc for 2014's previous incumbant Rocksmith. this is due to the unique way that valve downloads its Dlc, as dlc is not usually compatable with two concurrent games. The Cheapest way around this if you do not want to wait for a fix is to download the original rocksmith game for about £5 or  7 euro's and register it on Steam.  you will then have access to all dlc. A further purchase of the Rocksmith import tool will for £8, $10.00 10 euros will get most of the original on disk Rocksmith songs, (Licensing issues).for the 5 missing ones.TIP :-buy a spare cable. they do break. they are on offer you just have to shop around.So what do you get:50 songs of varying difficulty.blitzkreig bop - so easy its unrealprogreesing to intermediate songs like Aerosmith's Walk this way and the Muse, Pantera stuff through the more difficult Rush and Avenged Sevenfold.to the insane Satch boogie- Uber difficult- master this virtuoso piece you can tell your mates 'yeh I play a little bit'.The lessons are very good, shows you from the basics to more difficult techniques encountered.riff repeater is an improvement. But not 100% reliable it will tell you you have missed a note when you know you haven't , you can slow a phrase down, take away notes add them. it fits to the way you play.Some people say that it ramps up the difficulty too quickly, the counter to this is that, well you must have been doing something right for the software to increase it,try harder find your level.The Session mode is awesome you can do what the program recommends or use it to back up what you have learned in the lessons or songs.The score attack feature is very good as it gives you a level of easy, medium and hard or master. I use it to check my timing as I play; as it tells you whether the note was good, missed or perfect. So its good for tempo and feel.The games are quirky, scale racer you really need to know the shapes shown in other games and by using the zoom out function in session mode(this extends the scale forms across the fretboard)bending gets you bending quickly and to pitch.harmonic heist gets you playing harmonics. I am sure this game has been adapted from something off the Commodore 64 but i cant remember.Scale Warriors gets you playing scales and memorising them.String Skipping gets your picking hand moving, Its part of my daily routine.Ducks gets your fretting hand moving and should be played without looking at the fretboard it explained this in the Original Rocksmith but not in 2014.ninja slides is self explanatory gets you sliding everywhere, backsup the lessons.Hurdles is another picking hand game but is more about adapting the technique of the game than good picking technique. IMO the original rocksmith game for this was better.So can it teach you guitar- no only the user can do that.you need time, patience,and be prepared to stick the hours in.But, its a lot better than trawling through shedloads of tab,  tweeking fx units.and using a pause and rewind button.No it doesnt teach theory either, but if you went on to learn theory for the purpose of being a musician or expanding your musical vocabulary there is enough in this software to guide you . You just have to relate the highlighted markers as notes and pitches and listen to what you play.Will it replace a teacher, probably not, but you will know a lot more for using this software.I am a guitaroholic so I may be biased do i recommend this yes. because like everything in life you will get out what you put in.

												I can't praise this game enough. I love all forms of rock and soft metal music. From a very early age I always wanted to play guitar but will openly admit that my skills don't match my enthusiasm. Many years ago I tried electric guitar and wasn't very good. I eventually gave up through lack of improvement and and injury where I lost my left middle finger tip. It wasn't until just over a year ago when I was fancying the idea of trying guitar again. Because of my finger I thought about trying bass and out of the blue my girlfriend bought me a bass starter set for my Christmas present. I was immediately hooked but again my enthusiasm exceeded my skills, then I came across Rocksmith 2014. For me it has been a revelation and although I accept the purist musicians might not think it's great for people like myself that have a love for music but lack the skill it is a must to have. I don't have a very good memory and can't really play son's without out the help of Rocksmith 2014 but the big incentive is that I can now play music to which I consider a pretty good standard. I am now the guy that has all the gear and no idea lol. I bought myself a Schecter stiletto custom 4 bass with an Orange bass amp and various pedals and use Rocksmith to compliment them. While i'm realistic and know that i'm no Duff McKegan I couldn't have achieved what I have without rocksmith and in the end of the day I have fun and enjoy it which is what it's all about. For other people like myself I couldn't recommend Rocksmith 2014 enough. I would like to add that what you get for the price is an understatement. I would dread to think how much money I would have spent on lessons to get to the stage i'm at. While I accept with tuition I might be at a better standard for the cost difference involved it doesn't compare. Also initially I played this on my PS3 but moved to using my PC as I love being able to have such a massive library of custom songs available to me through customforge.comI can honestly say that I only have found two drawbacks but this is not due to the game itself as the things I am doing are outwith what the game was originally designed for. I'm a bit of a gadget geek and I use Rocksmith via my amp and tv for sound by using a switch blade+ spliter which can sometimes cause issues with the real tone cable and also the game very rarely crashes after prolonged use using custom songs. But as I say these aren't official features of the game so it's unfair to mark it down on these cases.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally I can pluck a G string, Drop E, and finger a minor on Steam!I feel I have progressed more in a day than in the last few year bumbling around by myself with a guitar. The jam sessions are good for learning timing and practising scales. The song lessons seem easy at first just having you play key notes, but it ramps up according to your level and gives you feedback on your performance, the goal being to eventually play every note perfect and master the song. The only downer is you need the cable for the full experience and it is overpriced, make sure you get the game in a steam sale and then the cable price is a bit more palateble. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly the best way to learn guitar, picked it up a few days ago, can now play Stone - Alice in Chains flawlessly, it teaches all techniques, and adjusts difficulty. There is a built in riff repeater allowing you to slow down specefic sections of songs which you may find difficult to comprehend. My only concern prior to buying the game was  the Song catalogue, but there is no need to worry, here are some of the bands, Alice in Chains, Slayer, Tenacious D, Iron Maiden, Def Leapord, Megadeth, Alice Cooper, naming a few. Another great feature is the ability to test out a huge selection of amps, from the marshall jcm800 to the orange tiny terror, there is a large variety, this serves as a try before you buy, and allows you to make some pretty nice riffs, either with a high gain crunch sound, or a low gain clean sound, its all up to you. You can even tune the amps!.To conclude if you want to learn guitar, or master it for that matter, this is the way to do so, the UI might be difficult if you are used to tabliture but you can get used to it.

												Do you want to learn to play the guitar/bass guitar then get this game. Hundreds of songs to chose from (although 99% of them must be bought first) and different difficulties to help you in the journey to becoming the next Jimi Hendix, Dave Mustaine, Slash, or whoever your favourite guitar player is. Metal, rock, even jazz lessons are included in this game.However, more gamemodes can be added into the game to make it less frustrating to learn to play a song, and the cable is VERY expensive. 45$ for the cable from Ubisoft, because other cheaper cables like this dont work with the game.9/10 Get it if you like playing the guitar.

												I've played acoustic for about 7 years now and had a really crappy electric laying around the house. Yesterday decided to buy a proper electric + RS2014 + Tone Cable for my birthday. Funnily enough today the game just got remastered which is awesome! So far I've had A LOT of fun with it. I honestly feel like I just purchased an ultra portable AMP considering I've got the game running on my Lenovo Y50 laptop. Despite what some older reviews said - YES this game DOES fully work with Windows 10 64Bit and the tone cable recognises as a piece of hardware and works with my guitar totally fine. My only gripe with this software is the painful $3.30 CAD for DLC. I understand it takes time to develop professional sheet music and gather licences but $3.30 CAD is a lot of money when you consider how quickly it adds up. I couldn’t help but purchase ""Smooth"" (one of my fav Santana songs) but I'll likely need to hold off for a DLC sale cus at the moment its totally wallet killing.RS2014 Edition - Remastered is totally worth the buy. There is a lot to do, and with the ability to import custom songs you can pretty much play anything popular enough for someone to make a file for (which is like over 500 songs to download free online). For those who are interested, the guitar I got is a Monoprice Route 66 (Les Paul Impressionist Electric). It's got legit humbuckers and looks/sounds/feels fantastic. For $250 CAD and free shipping via Amazon, it was hella quick to arrive in just two days. Check it out if you're thinking of getting a good quality but affordable intermediate guitar above the crappy beginner Epiphones / Academy / Squire models that are about $100-150.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ok im pretty sure that i got enought time in this ""game"" to get a well based review,so lets start with the pros first to note it's NOT a replacement for a real in person leasson, although it really is a great way to start and feel like a great guitarrist.second to note is if you never played before rocksmith will give you a nice way to learn or just to train the techniques with the sometimes overlooked guitarcadethrid is that the game wont push you beyond your level and if it's too hard the game will ajust the song level for you and the same if it's too easyfourth thing is that the songs avaliable are all great for leaning some techniques and have a good timenow lets start whit the consfifth, the amount of song packs are way above the average to dont find something that you like you probably dont like music in general (what you doing here?)first the cable is not perfect soo some times you may feel like some techniques are not really recgnized second is that sometimes the leasson seems weak and lacking a better explanation so you will need figure out by yourself or with real lesson elsewerethird to note is that the session mode its way bellow the rest of the rocksmith it lacks a better band creation and a record modefourth is that a lot of good bands are overlooked while some other got multiple song packs (may be because of the legal mumbo-jambo)and for the last you will need to always have spare strings and picks\overhall its a great way to get started or just to learn new songs, but with some flaws that dont affects the experience,and just in case you are looking for some cool songs check the custom forge if you dont find the song you are looking for in the official packssorry for the bad english and hope you read it all and decided to give a chance to the best ubisoft ""game"" ever			",116,14,0,18,11,1,4

												I've only just started playing with Rocksmith 2014 and I can already tell I've stumbled upon something really cool! I can't wait for the Remastered version. I never really understood the Guitar Hero/Rockband craze of the early 2000's and I doubt Rocksmith would ever catch on the way those games did, but for a guitarist who has been in the musical equivalent of cryo-stasis for the last few years, this game is simply words-can't-describe amazing!If you're reading reviews, wondering if you should pick this up, or if whether you should get it for a young guitarist to be. Look no further. This game is worth every dime! They even make coated strings that color match the games strings for extreme beginners. Have some fun with your instrument. It doesn't always have to be work!Pros:1. Rocksmith cable is easily modified/repaired with a bit of soldering. (I put a right angle jack on mine)2. Tone Control section lets you set up a killer amp model with way more options than my Peavey Vyper modeling amp3. Learning has never been this entertaining in the 15+ years I've been playing.4. Custom songs found online are awesome and free to use once you've purchased and installed Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub RockCons: 1. Paid DLC songs can become a bit pricey if you are trying to create some sort of huge library (Cheaper/cooler than song books though!)2. It's made by Ubisoft... Meaning Uplay... Meaning projectile vomiting.3. The cable's 1/4"" connector supposedly breaks easily due to the thin cabling. (Easily repaired, I modified mine out of the box.)4. Doesn't come with a free 1967 Les Paul Custom guitar... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, short review. I like this guitar learning tool. It's easily the best way to learn guitar because it gives the player incentives and puts the notes right there, on the screen and you play that note like it's Guitar Hero, only real. This game has several different modes too, it has a session mode where you can jam with a virtual band equip with any musical style you wish to jam with as well as having several minigames that help you hone different techniques. There's a game where you have to bend the string at a precise point, there's a game where it's like Space Invaders and you hit the notes on your guitar to shoot at the aliens coming down. Rocksmith's main feature is the song list it has and by itself. this song list does appeal to everyone, even the old rock fans, like myself. I got to play Don't Look Back by Boston or My Generation by The Who. It's got other songs that tackle different genres but I haven't really paid any attention to those. The game will adjust to your skill level and you can, now, manually adjust to the skill level you think you're ready for and the game will work with it. I highly recommend this to beginners and advanced players alike because Rocksmith 2014 is just plain fun and you can even get the DLC from the previous game so it's a win win. Don't get the previous game but this one because it improves everything from the old one. The old one felt clunky and didn't let you play at a skill level at your choosing. This one does. You can also play Bass on here so if you're a bass player, they got you covered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith is an amazing way to improve your guitar & bass playing abilities, jam, learn new songs, and even discover new artists. I've been playing bass guitar since I was 16. I haven't been in a band for 5 years and it's hard to stay sharp and find time to practise. Also, bass is a pretty boring instrument to play by yourself. I continue to write and produce music independently and Rocksmith is a great way to get through the grind of practise. The game works great with my basses and electric guitar. It also works really well with my classical acoustic (which has a built in pickup). The acoustic has been a very fun way to play too since I have the heavy guitar tone coming out my headphones, but I can hear the body of the acoustic as well which confirms that I'm actually playing something nice.I had no idea I like Metalcore, but after playing an Avenge Sevenfold track on bass I've spent my whole weekend mastering all of their songs. Thanks Ubisoft!I've played with the settings and have only 2ms latency with the real tone cable which I'm very comfortable playing with. My DAW tpyically runs at 5ms, so as an audio processing app it's pretty legit. There are also amp modelling modes and an effects board. The tones in this mode are really great, however it is difficult to use the menus to really dive deep into all the functions. My guess is that the menus were designed for console and not PC.One thing that I would love would be the ability to set my own tuning in the game and have the tracks update as per my bass config. I play a 5-string bass so for a SOAD song I can just as easily play on the low-B rather than tuning my whole setup to drop C. Also some songs are very reliant on open notes which I personally don't like, I'd like to be able to say rather than going open D, playing the 5th fret on the A string. This is all nit picky stuff though, the game is amazing.The songs bundled with the game cover so many genres that there really is something for everyone. The DLC has been great since day one. I've bought DLC for Avenge Sevenfold, Motley Crue, Iron Maiden, Deftones, Killers, Strokes, Smashing Pumpkins, Rush, and Pantera. I plan on buying a whole lot more but I need to master a few tracks in my library first!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I almost never review things, so this is really telling you something. This is better then getting taught by a real guitar  player. You can focus on what you need to learn. You play any song you like. Yes, I have been taught by other people, I know how it is. This is WAY cheaper then real lessons by A LOT of dollars.  I saved myself a ton of money. Also, you can slow down the song you're playing, repeat riffs that you need work on, and play mini games to help you learn the ways of guitar. Amazing peice of work. I began with no experience of bass, and now I have learned so much about it. Would rate this game a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you bought this on sale? Have you bought this at all? Do you like to play guitar or bass? If you do stop reading and start buyiong. If you don't: are you gifting? No? buy anyway!!! This game is amazing! If you don't know how to play, this game will teach you! It has lessons to teaches you from the ground up. you you play, you can choose rythum, lead, or bass and you dont need a bass to learn(it has a bass emulator for those who oly have electric guitar and want to learn). start with some lessons, move to some excercizes to get you familiar with the fretting, finger and note placements, the notes and chord names. Then move on to learning your favorite songs. I love this game for how well it was made and how well this teaches. doesn't matter wether you're brand new and just touched a guitar, or wether you are an experienced player this accepts players of all difficulties. THANK YOU creators and I hope you keep doin more and more songs.			",162,23,1,13,12,3,9

												The game is good, provided you keep in mind you need to order a Real Tone Cable seperately. Additionally, there is over 1.000 EUR (or USD) of DLCs. It does come to mind, that's a lot to spend extra for serious musicians who want to learn through Rocksmith. Although an incredible step up since the days of Guitar Hero, it's not the same as picking up a bass or guitar tab online and figuring it out on your own... remember, that's free! So yeah, the game is definitely worth buying, although I find it pricey. Yousician also offers lessons for free or with a paid premium account.I do have to admit this game WILL offer lessons for people who just started to play, and even advanced players will be able to pick up some new tricks and hone their skills, as long as they don't forget to play for real too ;)Pros:- Nice songs, and you can pick your own favs as DLC- Good quality graphics, gameplay; the game analyzes your style and level, and suggests how to improveCons:- Pricey; lots of additional costs to keep in check- Although there are LOTS of songs to add, it always sucks when a song or band you love isn't available			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From my controversial review from the 1st Rocksmith game - it seems that certain individuals persist on crushing your hopes and dreams of one day playing with Clapton at the Albert Hall. He knows who he is and is what I like to call a ""life speed bump"".

												1) Most people who don't like this game are having issues with installing it. Or there's a conflict of some kind on their computer. Or they're using a 3rd party cable.2) The overwhelming majority of people are able to install it without problems and get it up and running in no time.3) The game is fast. There is little to no delay or loading time between songs or exercises.4) Session Mode ALONE is worth many times the price of purchase. It allows you to select from among dozens of different instruments to create a backing band and jam in any key and in any scale in any style of music. And it shows you the notes in that scale on the fretboard so you can learn the scale and work on your improvisation. Not only that, but the band REACTS to the way you play -- softer, louder, faster, etc. Not too long ago professional musicians paid thousands to set up backing track systems that weren't NEARLY this sophisticated.5) There are 55 or so songs from multiple genres to play, plus hundreds of downloadable tracks.6) There are several mini-games that teach guitar skills for those starting out and for those who are rusty. Back in the day, you had to practice alternate picking/chords/bending/scales etc. by rote.7) The game has a Riff Repeater where you can take sections (or the whole song) and slow them down and practice it until you have it down.8) You and a friend can play along with the songs or with Session Mode at the same time: Guitar/guitar, bass/bass, guitar/bass.9) There are lessons with video demonstrations and practice sessions for most guitar techniques. Even tapping!!!If you, or anyone you know, are at all interested in playing guitar or bass, this is, by far, the best money you will ever spend.ps Some people have problems with note recognition. That is, you play the note correctly but it doesn't register. If this is happening it's probable that your guitar's input level isn't high enough due to quiet pickups, guitar volume not being high enough, or your cable input isn't high enough. When it asks you to ""make some noise"" it's calibrating the input level. If you strum with regular force, it will turn up the input to an appropriate level. (You can re-calibrate at any time through the menu.) If you strum too hard it will set the input so that when you play at regular levels it won't always pick up your notes. When calibrated correctly, the game picks up notes perfectly on both guitar and bass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally I can pluck a G string, Drop E, and finger a minor on Steam!I feel I have progressed more in a day than in the last few year bumbling around by myself with a guitar. The jam sessions are good for learning timing and practising scales. The song lessons seem easy at first just having you play key notes, but it ramps up according to your level and gives you feedback on your performance, the goal being to eventually play every note perfect and master the song. The only downer is you need the cable for the full experience and it is overpriced, make sure you get the game in a steam sale and then the cable price is a bit more palateble. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is plenty of discussion around how good Rocksmith really is as a learning platform. However, the biggest thing for me has been the ability to see easily how much you are improving within the game. That is a great motivation to keep coming back, and means I have probably done more practice in the past six months, than the entire two years before that. If you are going to use RS as your primary tool in learning guitar though, it is always worth using headphones with one ear uncovered so you can the actual guitar for comparison. I wish I had bought this sooner!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is an amazing game.  It is guitar hero but with a real guitar.  The game has many features you can use to learn to play the guitar.  For example the game has lesson, songs to play, and even the ability to play with a band.   And that isn't even all it can do.  You can play minigame!   Which will help refine skills used to play the guitar. All in all rocksmith is a 9/10 game for playing the guitar. The only negative part about the game is it sin't cheap.  So if you want to learn guitar buy Rocksmith 2014!			",212,34,1,20,25,2,12

												I got both Rocksmiths for myself on Christmas 2014. I have had played bass and guitar 9 years before I got the game so I didn't actually think that the game would teach me anything, and it didn't.EDIT: After releasing more Rush songs and some Dream Theater, the game definitely has given me something of a challenge.What is Rocksmith good for if you are a long term musician?- It's a game like Guitar Hero- it's fun to play and get scores- This means that you can play while putting your brains away, just watch the screen and play.- The game took me out of my comfort zone, it made me learn songs from k-pop to Mozart, some things I would never play myself.- This game offers Riff Repeater which  is awesome for learning long and pain-in-the♥♥♥♥♥style of guitar solo's.

												I've always wanted to play guitar but every time I've tried I got to a point where I'd get bored, reading tabs was confusing for a beginner and I was really having trouble with chords. I've had Rocksmith since February 2014 and at the point of writing this review in July 2015 and after putting in I'd say around 200-300 hours with the xbox 360 version and now the PC version, I've pretty much got to a point where I can play most songs without trouble, some chords I still struggle with and obviously Sweet Child O'Mine can be a tad difficult but I'm definitely pleased with how far I've come in regards to ability.The learning tools are fun and the skill games in arcade mode are challenging and actually help with remembering notes. The DLC track packs are constantly being rolled out so you're never short of songs to play, not to mention CLDC being made by members of the community (check out Custom's Forge, they have literally thousands of songs to download for free).As far as the graphics go there's not much to say really, similarly to Rock Band graphics aren't really important, that being said the menu's and in game interfaces are all solid.Overall, well worth the money, I don't think I'd have ever got to the point where I can actually say yes I can play an instrument.

												For anyone who has a guitar laying around, and wants to learn to play. Period.Basically, Rocksmith combines the gameplay of Guitar Hero and Rockband, to teach you how to play the songs you dream of playing.The only problem is, you need the Real Tone Cable in order to connect it to your computer.You can buy it seperately, or, do what I did, and buy the disc bundle for cheaper.Overall, the game doesn't require any skill beforehand, and can run great on most computers.I wish I wouldv'e gotten it earlier!

												Decent learning tool. Defintly for novice guitarists like myself to lean the ropes.  However it is not perfect.The note detection is hit and miss. How the tracks are set up, slowly adds notes once you hit a track perfectly or removes them when you miss a fraction, is a decent idea. Once you put it into practice though it is psychologically frustrating. Here is why. Once you learn a riff on a lower dificulty you have to relearn that riff again when the difficulty ramps up. Subconsciously you are relearning a single song multiple times over and over again. Then muscle memory will not have a clear memory to focus on. Leading to frustration for guitarists. No matter who I talk to about Rocksmith is irritated with the software.You can however max out the song and play at slower speeds then manually make them faster over time. This slightly less irritating because hitting/missing unkown chords or riffs will continue regardless. What would make it better is for the a training mode to stop a track until you hit the note or the chord perfectly then move to the next one to get a taste of the dish. Then move on to nonstop tracks. Occasionaly, on my rig anyway, the chord is very picky about how it is placed in the guitars output. Buzzing sounds cut off all outputs as well as the output cutting off alltogether. Rocksmith provides a lot of information and is a decent escape for bordem. But you could search for the same information online for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a complete beginner with stringed instruments as a whole, I have never before played a song on the guitar, or even held a guitar for more than five minutes without getting bored of it, in just four days, I was already playing full length songs on a beginner level.Well, until my guitar's high e string snapped while tuning it. I need to get that replaced. :')This game definitely does teach you guitar. While it may not teach you music theory, it is recommended that you teach yourself on the side so that while Rocksmith teaches you how to master the guitar itself, which it actually does, you can also teach yourself how to play guitar notes on the side so that you can read sheet music.You can play guitar by ear and skill, sure, but you're only half a musician until you know music theory too.This game's definitely a great choice for a beginner or even an experienced guitarist.And yes, it definitely makes practice addicting. I had to stop because my finger was about to bleed and I didn't want to be unable to play the next day. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith is more than just a game, it is a teaching aid.  It won't turn you into a shredding speedking over night but it will, if you practice and stick with it improve your playing a great deal.  The good thing is you will have fun while learning and it doesn't feel like a chore.The riff repeater with plenty of options to adjust things like speed, number of attempts before moving on, playing just tricky sections or the entire song is invaluable.  This coupled with the lessons and guitarcade will have you playing full songs in no time.I would definately recommend this game (Aid) to anyone wanting to learn the guitar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First review on steam - That should say enough.This game is a must have for anyone even thinking about stepping foot into the musical world. I am NOT musically inclined at all, but I love listening to music. I'm about 30 now. I played the drums as a kid in a drum core.. dont remember how to play.. and only memorized music from my brother, never knew what I was doing. I was forced to play the clarinet in high school marching band.. hated EVERY second of it. I skipped most of my band classes/practices and only showed up when it was a must... band just was not for me.. or so I thought. I always kind of felt a passion to make music, even spent a ton on a music producing program ""Stagelight"" and just can't figure it out. So to get on with it... my Birthday was this month, and my pops gave me an Amazon gift card for a couple hundo. Finally a music note slapped me in the face and BAM.. ordered an electric guitar. Never played a stringed instrument in my life.. no f**king clue what I was getting myself into.I travel for a living so getting someone to help teach me just wont happen (lol) so I found myself picking up this game from Gamestop. I dont think I could be a happier man right now. Traveling around Cali, learning how to play guitar by myself.. actually making it sound good. My time shows 22.2 hours as of right now and I think 10 hours were AFK on accident. In those 12.2 hours though (5 days)... my fingers are getting trained by the session to not hurt, music notes are starting to come out, I feel very comfortable with a guitar now. I can't wait to rack up more hours on this game learning where my failing fingers need to be placed. ***This is said in below posts, but the one bad thing I wish was more in this game was learning how to read music and tabs. I've always heard to play guitar you really just need to learn tabs. This is something you will have to research on your own. There is tons of info on this online though. I cant speak for the game as someone that already knew how to play guitar, but just starting out... this game is badass. If you have the opportunity, go balls out. You can pick up a great electric guitar online or in a pawn shop for less than $200.			",58,2,1,3,3,1,2

												This is extremely helpful to learning guitar, as it is incredibly fun. The only drawback is that personally, I am a heavy metal buff, and the playlist is mostly made up of old school rock, cringe-worthy british punk, pop music and other ""music"" I consider to be rubbish.While I appreciate that the traditional rock songs are great to learn from, and far simpler than modern day heavy metal, it is just not all that enjoyable to listen to, therefore not all that enjoyable to play.I would love to see some music from Demon Hunter on here. The Disturbed music pack is nice, there are some system of a down tracks, and deftones tracks too which is about all I will play, but needs more variety.The tutorials are fantastic however, they ease you into things, they are encouraging, and progressively get more difficult as you progressively get better which is great for beginners and experienced players alike.The downside to those tutorials is that it's not always very accurate, and can become frustrating when you think you're shredding it up and the game/software thinks that you are playing incorrectly.All in all though, my skill with the guitar is better, my familiarity with musical terminology is better, and I can't wait to keep playing and see where it takes me.When I play this game/software, I need to give myself an entire day too, because once you start, it's hard to stop because it is so addictive.Buy it! :D			",367,47,4,25,44,2,38

I've been playing for about 6 years, and have learned more songs in my 27 hours of having this than I would learn in a year without it.  It has drastically improved my playing, I can do pinch harmonics now :DNot to mention the song list - there are tons of classics to choose from. They generally cost about $3/song, but truthfully it's worth it.If you're looking to learn the guitar, or simply improve upon your playing, this game is the way to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty dissapointed with the song selection, but it's still a cool game.Now what it REALLY needs is a mode that completely stops the song on every note and waits for you to play it before moving to the next, rather than flying them all past your screen. Because note by note is how we read and play tabs, right? You look down at the note, play it on the guitar, and move onto the next; it's not as if your eyes skim past the tab while your fingers helplessly play catch-up, but that's how this game does it.Granted, you can emulate something close to that with their Riff Repeater mode set to 1% speed, but that also isn't perfect.The note-by-note function is already present in the very start of the game, but you never see it again after that. I just wish the developers provided an option to play songs using that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I had ever heard of this game, I had bought a guitar years ago. I always wanted to learn, but never came through to learning how to play a song. I had once in a while picked up the guitar and strummed a few cords, just for the heck of it. Until December 2013 I heard about this new program called Rocksmith 2014, and although I've heard about the Rocksmith 2011 and I heard reviews that the 2011 edition was not accurate guitar teacher, I passed for buying the game. Since I heard about this new 2014 edition, I seemed interested on what all the fuss was about. After reading reviews and watching videos, I finally decided to buy the game. When plugging in my guitar for the first time, I was confused with scheme of the game. When I reversed of to the Learn a Song section, and played a song, I was confused with the notes and did not seem to be getting anywhere to playing the actual song. However, after playing the song for about a half-hour, the notes started to adjust to my ability as I learned the song more and more. I even used the handy riff repeater that can strengthen my skills within the notes of the song by speeding up or slowing down, and/or adjusting the difficulty. The game includes mini games if you ever get bored of Learn a Song and want to practice chords, finger picking, or just strumming the guitar. Don't worry too much about the option as I focus much with Learn a Song and the mini games. And after 8 months and 20 hours of practicing, not including off time practicing, I have learn about 10 songs fully. And the worth the price rather than paying a guitar teacher, in addition to paying the game on your own time. -Also supports bass :P ",68,6,3,2,10,0,1

												I will offer a review in two parts. 1) The software itself2) The steam application that supports it. The Software Itself. I was a professional guitarist for a number of years, a guitar teacher for a few more, and have played guitar for somewhere near 30 years. Rocksmith 2014 is a remarkable tool for entertainment, and most importantly, education. The teaching system is very well realized and the result is a product that gently guides you through the process of learning guitar by teaching you to play songs. Dynamic and responsive difficulty means the song gets harder as you get better at it, and the recommended lessons that are also in Rocksmith are about 80% relevant. Since you are using a real guitar, the quality of the experience of actually playing is under your control. So since I use a very carefully set up guitar designed for fast lead, it's a comfortable and pleasant experience even if you get caught up in the features for hours. A cheap squire strat would work just as effectively, but I am sure you would tire more quickly. The song selection is, in my opinion, diverse to the point of ludicrous but out of the 50 or so songs, you can find a good 15-20 you would probably want to learn. As an experienced guitarist, I would appreciate the ability to set a certain degree of difficulty for the song so that I don't go through the callibration process of making you play one note instead of 6 chords. The tone editor is neat and you do get access to a pretty extensive guitar ""rig"" so you can tailor your sound, but more often I found myself simply using the tone supplied with the song as generally they were sufficiently well designed to match. The session mode is a slightly infuriating combination of unbelievable to unusable. The correct way to fix this would be to allow the guitarist to lead the band, or have the band start the jam with an intro. While blues works amazingly with a blistering solo lead which sets everything up, the other options, such as funk or metal would be very well served by an intro fill and first few bars to establish the key, chord progression and the like. Blues, however, is custom made for this (Jazz should be looked into, but may push the dynamic element too far) and the structure of 12-bar allows you to know where the band will go so you don't need to lead anything other than the actual dynamics of the tune. Guitarcade has don't nothing for me so far because it relies on the callibration to be better than it is. So as a product, rocksmith 2014 is excellent and the flaws, while apparent are not enough to stop this being a truly engaging and effective teaching tool, or in my case, a tool to keep skills sharp by using all the various options the software has to offer. 2) Steam implementation. There is a significant issue with the steam application and this game, and since they are directly tied together, there is no escaping the issue. If you buy the ps3 or xbox 360 version, you can use any of the previous title Rocksmith's DLC and it works just fine (though with fewer features) in 2014. You don't need the previous rocksmith. The software and ubisoft themselves tell you this is the case. But not so with Steam. If you want to download the Cliffs of Dover by Eric Johnson it would cost you 33 dollars on steam. $3 for the song, and $30 for the inferior guitarsmith to allow you the right to buy it. This is pathetic and an issue that has no excuse not being fixed. Should you think that perhaps $30 is a good enough deal due to the songs you get in rocksmith (which you can transfer to the 2014 version) I will warn you that it will cost you $10 just to do that ... making rocksmith more than just a piece of software you never use by taking the songs in to 2014 will be a $40 endeavor. Clearly steam is profiting from this as there are people doing exactly that to get the content - and thus may be the reason they haven't fixed it, but this is something you should absolutely be aware of if you had plans to get some of the DLC songs to learn as part of your Rocksmith 2014 experience.

												Fun way to play with guitar! I've played guitar for years so I don't know how easy it is to learn with this, but still a lot of fun to learn new songs. At first it was a bit hard to read the note highway as I'm used to guitar tabs, but after a while you get it. And of course harder songs need to be learned first and not while playing for the first time the whole song. Quality of the transcriptions will vary, some song are very good some are not as good transcriptions. Some lead tracks don't have rhythm almost at all which is in accurate in most cases. Mostly RS1 songs and DLC are crappier than RS2014, but had to buy the old one to get old dlc... Otherwise I enjoy this, it's the best that is available at the moment, hope they bring new version later and add possibility to see the songs in TAB format! Only other I've played is Bandfuse, I like it more than this, but as the company is bankrupt, this is the best we can get.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8 hours of gameplay so far.First impressions are good, I feel asthough my bass playing has improved already. I really enjoy the way Rocksmith has taken away the ""punsihment"", it dosent tell you off if you play a note that isnt there or top the song if your not doing well enough, this combined with the way that ricksmith seamlessly increases and decreases difficulty makes the Rocksmith encoraging to play and learning to play alot more enjoyable. There is a wide varitey of songs to chose from, however it would have been nice to have seen more tracks includeing those from other genres. Its also anoying how dlc songs will show up in the track selection with no way to turn this off other than playing offline.PROS:    *Easy to pick up (no pun intended)    *Encoraging and fun way to learn music    *Wide varitey of tracks included and avalible as dlcCONS:    *Included tracks could be larger    *Non-owned DLC show up in track selectionTL;DR: Incoraging way to learn guitar 10/10 recomend for anyone trying to learn bass or guitar.PRO TIP: if you want more songs cheap percahse the origonal rocksmith and import tool to get all the tracks from rocksmith 2013.

This game is perfect for beginners and experts. I'm pretty average, and still manage to do fairly decent on some of the songs.

												I saw a guitar teacher in a video on the Internet say that it takes about 3,000 hours of practice for someone to really become decently competent at the guitar. His point was simply that there was no substitute for putting in the time, and no real shortcuts  - though of course good instruction (such as his own) would help.RS2014 went away from its more ""gamey"" style predecessor to become more of a full-fledged training tool for the guitar. This was a good move. It's easily three times better than the original Rocksmith at meeting this goal. Everything is much, MUCH more instructive and convenient. It gives you lots of tools to learn popular (and not-so-popular) songs... really learn them, to the point where you can completely play them from memory. From the basic ""Learn a song"" tool to the flexible ""Riff Repeater,"" which allows you to practice a section of a song over and over again, to the ability to test yourself at various skill levels in Score Attack - which is a lot like classic Guitar Hero / Rock Band type play. But it also includes dozens of lessons - many with practice tracks. And a number of ""Guitarcade"" technique games to take some of the boredom out of common drills. You can simulate a large number of amps, cabinets, and effects to simulate all kinds of tones and use the game like a sound system and amp - and to learn how your favorite band got a particular tone for a particular song. `There's a ""Session Mode"" where you can practice jamming and improvising with a computer-controlled band. The game supports lead guitar, rhythm guitar, *AND* bass techniques - including a ""bass emulation"" mode to learn to play bass on a regular six-string guitar. And there's multi-player (really 2-player) capability, so a friend can plug in (with another cable, which currently runs $30) and the two of you can learn songs together, jam together in Session mode, play a duet with different song parts for a high score, and go head-to-head in a competition at the same difficulty level and part to see who is the better player.The game isn't perfect in detecting the notes, and will allow some sloppiness in your playing that does not sound good to the human ear. Unplugging or adjusting the mix and really listening to yourself is a must, or you could develop some bad habits because the game will let you get away with it.Ultimately, the success of the game is dependent on how successful it is at teaching you to play guitar. It's supposed to be ""the fastest way to learn guitar."" I don't know if that's exactly the case. But I will say this - it's helped me make more progress in the last six months than I had in twenty years on my own, so that's a good sign. I've been playing about 45 minutes per day, on the average, and it's really made a difference.But the important thing to remember is that it doesn't work miracles. If you think you can master the guitar in the time it takes for you to master Super Mario Brothers, you are going to be disappointed. You won't go from being a beginner to playing like Eddie Van Halen in 60 hours. That 3000 hour thing is not super flexible. The game does help in two ways:1) It can provide lots of feedback and support to help make your practice time more efficient. This may yield somewhat greater improvement per hour of practice than doing so unaided.2) It can make your practice time more fun, which may encourage you to practice more, and stick with it. And that's really all it can do, though that's awesome. In the end - if you want to learn to play guitar, you are going to HAVE to put in the hours. There's no way around that. If RS2014 makes those hours more productive and more fun (and I believe it does), that's a win!			",522,222,11,120,68,3,108

												Pretty dissapointed with the song selection, but it's still a cool game.Now what it REALLY needs is a mode that completely stops the song on every note and waits for you to play it before moving to the next, rather than flying them all past your screen. Because note by note is how we read and play tabs, right? You look down at the note, play it on the guitar, and move onto the next; it's not as if your eyes skim past the tab while your fingers helplessly play catch-up, but that's how this game does it.Granted, you can emulate something close to that with their Riff Repeater mode set to 1% speed, but that also isn't perfect.The note-by-note function is already present in the very start of the game, but you never see it again after that. I just wish the developers provided an option to play songs using that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So to start this review off , I started playing guitar 6 months ago and I bought Rocksmith roughly 5 months ago I suppose. So this review is by an actual beginner guitar player.Rocksmith really is a great tool if you want to learn how to play e-guitar , more speficially said it helps you play your favorite songs. There are technique lessons in there that you can tune in to and it might help you get better at the overall guitar playing techniques. the different scales are also included, so if you want to deeply delve into stuff like that , it gives you the most basic informations, but I guess further research is requiered.But now the most important part about Rocksmith. Does it help, wil you get better at guitar and just as important , is it even fun?Yes, Yes and Yes.It helps- It's just TAB's made into a graphic game basically. You play it kinda like the Guitar Hero games , hit the notes/acc/bendings/etc when they hit your screen.One of the biggest benefits for a beginner is the visualization of the Rhythm. It's much easier to memorize the rhythm when you kinda see when , which and how often you have to hit each strings.Furthermore there are quests that help you to be diversive, which brings us to the next point....It helps you to get better at your guitar playing.Even in the standard game there's a good bunch of songs that range from country to metal , from very easy beginner friendly songs too songs that are for more experienced players.The quests kinda motivate you to try out songs that you normally would'nt have touched and this will not only broaden your horizon in terms of music , it will also help you too see and use techniques that you wouldn't have used otherwise.I can only give you the advice to try a majority of the songs. Even if you dont like them , they might be fun to play and since you bought the game anyways you own them.And ofc , yes it is fun. It's fun because it is an easy and kinda ""fast"" way to learn the guitar. Is it the fastes like Ubisoft describes it? I doubt it , since every human being learns different. But alongside the song's you also have funny little minigames that are educational and let your train your chords , bendings , scales etc.It's also just a fantastic feeling to rock out your favorite songs and learning them, until you can play them without Rocksmith with your home equipment.What brings me to my last point , the sound of the ingame Amps.The guys that decipher the songs note for note and try to get the tone for the song as real as possible , they do a great job. On all the songs I own , the sound is very close to the original.But on the otherhand , the ingame amp sound without the original tones from the songs is not the best in my opinion , I would not want to use this for any kind of playing besides Rocksmith.But there's also a major problem with the game that I don't think will be ever fixed.Some of the bendings in some particular songs track very horrible and playing with a very low tuning like Drop C can be frustrating , some notes , strings and chords get veeeerrrry poorly detected.You can still learn the rhythm and tabs however.A quick summarize.Positive+ It helps you start your guitar hobby and helps you to continuesly get better at it+ You can very easily learn your favorite songs and discover new bands/tracks that you never heard off+ You can learn probably the majority of the most important techniques and scales+ The tone of the songs is very close to the original tone , on the other hand....Negative - .... the standard ingame amp seems to lack a good tone. might be only my configs though.- Bendings get sometimes very badly recognized- If you want to play in low tunings like Drop C , be prepared to be frustrated. I would recommend getting thick strings , they tend to help the real-tone cable to recognized your chords better when tuned down.- CARE THERE ARE SONGS OUT THERE THAT REQUIRE A CAPO. (ex. ""WONDERWALL"")I hope my review might help you guys ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yet, a lot of other chords involving the G String work without a problem.There are some flaws, but the game is still VERY much worth getting.I know it can't be my guitar, the first game works fine on PS3. I have an Epiphone Les Paul and I will be running a new Gibson Les Paul 1959 through it here in a few weeks! :)			",262,44,7,20,17,1,14

												At the time of writing this, I have around 27 hours in the game. That's not much but I will definitely be spending a lot more time on this game.I'd reccommend this to any guitarist, beginners and experienced players alike.  I've been playing for about 6 years, and have learned more songs in my 27 hours of having this than I would learn in a year without it.  It has drastically improved my playing, I can do pinch harmonics now :DNot to mention the song list - there are tons of classics to choose from. They generally cost about $3/song, but truthfully it's worth it.If you're looking to learn the guitar, or simply improve upon your playing, this game is the way to go.			",102,7,2,9,8,0,7

												Fun way to play with guitar! I've played guitar for years so I don't know how easy it is to learn with this, but still a lot of fun to learn new songs. At first it was a bit hard to read the note highway as I'm used to guitar tabs, but after a while you get it. And of course harder songs need to be learned first and not while playing for the first time the whole song. Quality of the transcriptions will vary, some song are very good some are not as good transcriptions. Some lead tracks don't have rhythm almost at all which is in accurate in most cases. Mostly RS1 songs and DLC are crappier than RS2014, but had to buy the old one to get old dlc... Otherwise I enjoy this, it's the best that is available at the moment, hope they bring new version later and add possibility to see the songs in TAB format! Only other I've played is Bandfuse, I like it more than this, but as the company is bankrupt, this is the best we can get.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is extremely helpful to learning guitar, as it is incredibly fun. The only drawback is that personally, I am a heavy metal buff, and the playlist is mostly made up of old school rock, cringe-worthy british punk, pop music and other ""music"" I consider to be rubbish.While I appreciate that the traditional rock songs are great to learn from, and far simpler than modern day heavy metal, it is just not all that enjoyable to listen to, therefore not all that enjoyable to play.I would love to see some music from Demon Hunter on here. The Disturbed music pack is nice, there are some system of a down tracks, and deftones tracks too which is about all I will play, but needs more variety.The tutorials are fantastic however, they ease you into things, they are encouraging, and progressively get more difficult as you progressively get better which is great for beginners and experienced players alike.The downside to those tutorials is that it's not always very accurate, and can become frustrating when you think you're shredding it up and the game/software thinks that you are playing incorrectly.All in all though, my skill with the guitar is better, my familiarity with musical terminology is better, and I can't wait to keep playing and see where it takes me.When I play this game/software, I need to give myself an entire day too, because once you start, it's hard to stop because it is so addictive.Buy it! :D			",367,47,4,25,44,2,38

												So to start this review off , I started playing guitar 6 months ago and I bought Rocksmith roughly 5 months ago I suppose. So this review is by an actual beginner guitar player.Rocksmith really is a great tool if you want to learn how to play e-guitar , more speficially said it helps you play your favorite songs. There are technique lessons in there that you can tune in to and it might help you get better at the overall guitar playing techniques. the different scales are also included, so if you want to deeply delve into stuff like that , it gives you the most basic informations, but I guess further research is requiered.But now the most important part about Rocksmith. Does it help, wil you get better at guitar and just as important , is it even fun?Yes, Yes and Yes.It helps- It's just TAB's made into a graphic game basically. You play it kinda like the Guitar Hero games , hit the notes/acc/bendings/etc when they hit your screen.One of the biggest benefits for a beginner is the visualization of the Rhythm. It's much easier to memorize the rhythm when you kinda see when , which and how often you have to hit each strings.Furthermore there are quests that help you to be diversive, which brings us to the next point....It helps you to get better at your guitar playing.Even in the standard game there's a good bunch of songs that range from country to metal , from very easy beginner friendly songs too songs that are for more experienced players.The quests kinda motivate you to try out songs that you normally would'nt have touched and this will not only broaden your horizon in terms of music , it will also help you too see and use techniques that you wouldn't have used otherwise.I can only give you the advice to try a majority of the songs. Even if you dont like them , they might be fun to play and since you bought the game anyways you own them.And ofc , yes it is fun. It's fun because it is an easy and kinda ""fast"" way to learn the guitar. Is it the fastes like Ubisoft describes it? I doubt it , since every human being learns different. But alongside the song's you also have funny little minigames that are educational and let your train your chords , bendings , scales etc.It's also just a fantastic feeling to rock out your favorite songs and learning them, until you can play them without Rocksmith with your home equipment.What brings me to my last point , the sound of the ingame Amps.The guys that decipher the songs note for note and try to get the tone for the song as real as possible , they do a great job. On all the songs I own , the sound is very close to the original.But on the otherhand , the ingame amp sound without the original tones from the songs is not the best in my opinion , I would not want to use this for any kind of playing besides Rocksmith.But there's also a major problem with the game that I don't think will be ever fixed.Some of the bendings in some particular songs track very horrible and playing with a very low tuning like Drop C can be frustrating , some notes , strings and chords get veeeerrrry poorly detected.You can still learn the rhythm and tabs however.A quick summarize.Positive+ It helps you start your guitar hobby and helps you to continuesly get better at it+ You can very easily learn your favorite songs and discover new bands/tracks that you never heard off+ You can learn probably the majority of the most important techniques and scales+ The tone of the songs is very close to the original tone , on the other hand....Negative - .... the standard ingame amp seems to lack a good tone. might be only my configs though.- Bendings get sometimes very badly recognized- If you want to play in low tunings like Drop C , be prepared to be frustrated. I would recommend getting thick strings , they tend to help the real-tone cable to recognized your chords better when tuned down.- CARE THERE ARE SONGS OUT THERE THAT REQUIRE A CAPO. (ex. ""WONDERWALL"")I hope my review might help you guys ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why people were giving this bad reviews. If you look on Amazon there's complaints about tons of things. I installed it and it started up just fine and I had no problems with it. It's a pretty amazing game. I've learned about 3 songs already and I haven't even played it for more than a day. This game is perfect for beginners and experts. I'm pretty average, and still manage to do fairly decent on some of the songs. It's a good game, now I just gotta figure out how to put custom DLCs on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No matter wich experience level you are, rocksmith will help you improve your playing. (at least i think so)The mini games help you with the techniques, in the virtual studio you can test and find your sound and of course with the songs you can learn famous and not so famous songs. i personally use this game as an amp-substitute, this wway i can practice playing even late at night.Just make sure you own a nice guitar.

												For a learning tool, this game is a 50/50 situation. It effectively teaches you to play, however since you don't have a teacher next to you, you can often get confused on how to play a part of a song, or potentially get a technique wrong.This game is very effective when it comes to teaching even then though, so don't be fooled, I couldn't play ANYTHING on my bass before Rocksmith. I could only play.... about... uhm...  two notes on Wrathchild (by iron maiden) and to me, it felt REALLY difficult. But after 20-30 hours on Rocksmith, I could breeze through about 50-80 percent of the song. 150 gaming hours later and I can play just about any song on the setlist and get above at least 80-90 percent.Being a massive Iron Maiden fan, I was pleased to see Iron Maiden DLC. I currently have 98% on Two Minutes To Midnight and I've reached one hundred percent on Run To The Hills. It feels great acomplishing a song on Rocksmith as it can be very stressful and hard trying to complete a song. As I've mentioned earlier though, because there is no teacher to help you, it can be very frustrating trying to learn techniques. Especially harder techniques such as ""Tapping"" And ""Slap/Pop"". And if you simply can't get the technique right, the game will keep making you do it over and over without ANY further tips or advice.It pulls you by the nose really. The arcade games are rather dull, although some like *deep breath* SCAALEE WARRIORRS! are quite addictive if you know your scales fairly well. (I don't.. but oh well.)Guitarcade's Score Attack is certainly worth a look, I think it's a very engaging way to improve on your songs.The DLC offered is mostly brilliant, but if you ask me, they needed more metal classics, hell, I wouldn't mind if they added video game music! I feel they needed a wider variety in terms of genre, but eh, I have my Maiden and that's all I'll ever need. It's definately, DEFINATELY, worth the buy if you're a music fan. Just hands down. If you get bored of the setlist, you can download custom songs online, which has certainly kept me occupied for a good 50 hours. XDAll in all, fantastic. I'm very pleased with this game.

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great starting point for anybody that has wanted to learn the guitar.  For a long time I've wanted to learn how to play but never had the means or resources to do it.  Like most people I got hooked into the whole Guitar Hero and Rock Band craze which was fun but at the end of the day it did nothing to help me learn the guitar.  If I could take all those hours of playing those games and invested it into Rocksmith who knows how much better I would be.  Games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero had one thing going for them in my opinion: They made me realize how much fun it was to be ""playing"" music that I liked.  Fast forward a few years and I learned about Rocksmith.  I researched the game a bit and saw some videos which demonstrated how the game worked.  In theory the game sounded amazing: a way to learn how to play songs that I like (and discover some new ones) with a real guitar.  I was skeptical at first because on one hand it would require you to own/buy/borrow a real guitar to do it.  After a few months I broke down and went to Guitar Center to buy a guitar to play.  I first purchased the game for the PS3 off of Amazon because it shipped with the Real Tone cable and it was on sale.  Firing up the game for the first time the game asks you a few basic questions about your skill level and your guitar.  The game boasts that you can enjoy it whether your a pro or never touched a guitar in your life.  There are a variety of lessons that range from the basics (how to hold the guitar, put the strap on, and intro to chords) to more advanced techniques like palm mutes (and other techniques that I'm nowhere close to trying).  There is a session mode where you can jam with a virtual band that will jam along with you while you mess around with all the tools they offer.  The other instruments will play differently depending on how fast or slow you play.  There is the Guitarcade mode where you can play mini games designed to help you work on different skills.Finally there is the Learn a Song mode which I probably where I spend most of my time.  There is quite a collection of music and it spans many genres.  Since purchasing this for the PC I've also picked up some extra songs whenever they go on sale (usually during the holiday sales).  Most of the songs have three different paths you could play on any particular song: Lead, Rhythm, or Bass guitar.  Once I started playing the notes were few and far between with little to no emphasis on chords.  You don't have to worry if you mess up too much because unlike Guitar Hero or Rock Band you can't fail a song.  The game will simply take away notes to make it easier for you to play.  There is also the Riff Repeater tool which allows you to focus on certain sections of a song, slow it down, and change the difficulty if you are having trouble with a particular riff or section.  Within the last two days I've gotten close to entering Master mode on a couple of sections of certain songs.  As you progress and improve the notes will begin to fade away so that you will have to start memorizing the song.In my opinion this game is an excellent tool for anybody serious about trying to learn the guitar.  It is not a magic wand that will make you a master guitar player but it's a great place to start.  If you are not willing to put the time in and practice no tool or game will be able to help you improve.  I can honestly say that the time I've put into the game has at least allowed me to improve .  I still have a long way to go before I'm anywhere close to being good but I'm having fun learning and I believe that is what will keep me practicing and trying to get better.			",120,27,0,15,9,2,15

												This game is an absolutely incredible learning tool and peice of software. It really isnt so much a game as it is a practice device but with that said I really love it. The way the game gradually ups the difficulty as you go along strongly aids in the learning process. There are tons of modes and minigames with which to hone your skill.My favorite part may be the amp integrations and fast transitions they make during the course of a song. It feels really great to have a near identical tone to the song without having to fiddle with a peddleboard. That said I am a little dissapointed at the amount of songs and the cost of the DLC ones. $2.99 per songs seems a bit steep for me but I will still probably end up getting a couple here or there. Bottom line if you even have a slight interest in guitar then I highly recommend Rocksmith 2014			",832,218,29,100,73,12,139

												Absolutely brilliant and innovative piece of software. I was cautious with a piece of software that claims to teach you something like this. As with any piece of software like this, learning a lanugage, or any other slightly more abstract skill isn't always something you can compress into software. However RS2014 really does what it claims. The Realtone cable matched with this software is a winning combination and a pleasure to use. In the few days that I've used this software, I'm already feeling more confident, and am moving more easily up and down the frets (even if still very spazzy). The great thing about this, is because it's a hybrid of game and learning software, it doesn't feel like a chore. The only thing stopping me from using it longer are my sore fingertips. Jamming along with your favourite tunes makes you want to learn, and it almost doesn't even feel like learning.			",52,2,0,5,12,1,0

												It is difficult to purchase Rocksmith 2014 without reflecting upon a plethora of unanswered questions: ""Will I be able to play guitar after playing this game?"" Well not necessarily, but it helps.""Will I be able to play the songs outside the game?"" With a bit of persistence, you will.""Should I buy a guitar?"" Yes, of course you dummy!Coming from a world of bass, I did not know what to expect from a 'guitar game'. I knew it was possible to play bass on a variety of tracks, but I didn't expect the songs in Rocksmith to be picked due to its groovin' basslines. I was wrong.For a time I stuck with guitar and happily jacked in my trusty telecaster to learn the classic guitar rock songs and had great fun, whilst getting motivated to improve my guitar skills every day. Then it happened, the game broke, the real tone cable could not track my notes properly. I figured it would be my guitars intonation and started adjusting it, but to no avail. Alas, and overcome with grief I tried plugging in my bass to at least get SOME worth out of the game, and I couldn't believe what I found. I wasn't stuck with playing root notes following the guitars every move, I had options such as mastering the tapping solo in 'Knights of Cydonia', joining in with The Who in 'My Generation' and even playing as Geddy Lee in Rush! And this was all without acquiring any DLC! Be advised that playing with the emulated bass is not the same as properly playing bass. Get a bass.Generally I am quite thrilled with my purchase and would gladly recommend it to everyone whether they're musicians or not. The only thing I miss is the ability to view the tabs in the game without actually having the play the track in the game, and no, riff repeater isn't the solution. Oh, by the way, if your game doesn't track properly, try changing the guitar strings. It worked for me.			",21,1,0,6,1,0,2

												This is a really awesome game and a great way to learn guitar or improve and hone your skills if you already play guitar or bass. I'm really impressed with the minigames that teach you proper technique and dymanics, and they're fun and challenging. I recommend this game, I bought it during the summer sale and I don't regret it. I've been playing this a hell of a lot more than Pokemon Go.PROs:* Fun* Learn how to play or get better if you already can* Learn without tryingCONs* Challening or overwhelming to a beginner* 50$ cable to connect your guitar* 3$ DLC SongsI've personally has audio issues using this with TeamSpeak 3 and just general bugs like the amp emulation stopping, and the game not loading fully. Though I think it's worth a little frustration, still I wish I didn't have to deal with them at all, and other days bugs can be so bad I just stop playing the game. Definatly something they need to improve on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool  and a helpful game for beginners and advanced players as well. I makes you learn new things so you won't stuck in your comfort zone. If you are not super ambitious or perfectly dedicated to guitar playing or practising but you want to improve your skills in your pace then it is the perfect game for you.I really like to play guitar, but i don't have much time to do it. Now I practice 2-3 times a week and it doesn't feel like practising more like enjoying the music.Plus: I discovered many good music, and started listenening their albums.So, yes I recommend this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith does work! I bought it on PS3 to see how it'd play, much like guitar hero with more than 5 buttons. I showed great improvement. And now I'm at the point where I can play on our stage in our house without the help of the game! Great song choices, if you're into heavier stuff, and you can definitely buy hundreds of songs, just don't go too crazy. Definitely reccomended!			",65,8,0,9,6,0,4

												About me:I starting playing guitar in January of this year and bought the game two months later. I am playing on a Yamaha FSX700SC acoustic. Although music has been a part of my life for many years, this is the first time I have tried to learn a traditional instrtrument. Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool for learning songs and techniques without requiring the use of teachers or traditional self help books and videos. I do not recommend using this game as the only resource for learning the guitar but it is a great adjunct for players learning in a more traditional way. The learning curve has felt daunting and frustrating at times but patience and persistance has helped me learn some really cool stuff from this game. With that said, there are some things that this game cannot teach you:Strum patterens are covered in some detail in the Lesson mode but the game never indicates if you need to strum up or down. This makes playing 'rhythm' songs that are very chord heavy almost impossible unless you are already familiar and comfortable with this concept. Same with alternate picking; there is a lesson on it but beginners will inevitably have bad habits because the game has no way of knowing or correcting your technique. Learning outside of the game seems crucial for really getting better down the road.Now here's what this game can teach you:Self help books and videos are great when it comes to timing, strum patterns, and reading sheet music but one thing I love about this game is that you are playing real songs which means you are constantly playing up and down the neck. Books and sheet music for a beginner feel restricted because it is a very slow process. Learning scales and keys means that you are only working with a limited amount of frets at one time. This game has helped me learn which string/fret represent each key in a way that is fun and fast.Chords are obviously essential and this game is worth it for the chord book alone. Learning all the different shapes and barre chords can seem daunting but this method of learning is a lot more intuitive and fun. I really like how it tells you the chord names as you are playing/learning a song.My experience with playing the game on acoustic has been alright. Electric might be better for this game because a lot of the songs were originally played that way. Also, there can be some sound issues with acoustic because of how loud they are but the 'Mixer' option let's you tweak the sound to your liking. If you are thinking of picking up a guitar for the first time this game is an essantial learning tool. Learning the guitar without real lessons or a teacher can be almost impossible in the long run but this game is the beginning of something exciting. I credit this game for the majority of my current skills with guitar, and who knows where I would be in terms of skill without it. Sure, I may have bad habits in some areas but the gratifying feeling of playing real songs and learning real concepts is unparalleled to other methods of learning.			",15,0,0,1,2,0,1

												I learnt to play guitar during my undergraduate days, that was not too long ago. I had buddies, rhythm guitarists, vocalists, drummers, bassists, life was good. Then I graduated, and everybody separated. Playing guitar is not much fun by yourself. This game does a great job of filling up void of not having band members to play with.To learn a new song I still use tabs and guitar pro. Then I play that song with Rocksmith for the joy of playing, The authentic tones are a joy to use. Really gives you the perfect tone for the song you are trying to play,I am also trying to teach my girlfriend how to play the guitar, This game is no way a substitute for a real guitar teacher, but it game makes the practising by yourself part a lot less tedious and loads more fun. Guitarcade games are fun way of practising your basics.I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys playing guitar along with their favourite song.			",21,1,3,3,7,0,3

												Wether you are looking to pick a string for the first time or want to get back into play guitar, this is the game you want to go for.With numerous modes such as Non-Stop Play  and Learn A Song you can easily pick up a guitar and RockSmith guides you though the song- slowly at first with not many frets to play but then, as you practise RockSmith adds more notes and riffs to play- slowly building up a song.Guitar-cade is another thing I like about this game, it allows you to practise slides, fret finger placement and more through use of old arcade style games.Really worth picking up for a guitarist or someone who wants to learn.

												This game is an absolutely incredible learning tool and peice of software. It really isnt so much a game as it is a practice device but with that said I really love it. The way the game gradually ups the difficulty as you go along strongly aids in the learning process. There are tons of modes and minigames with which to hone your skill.My favorite part may be the amp integrations and fast transitions they make during the course of a song. It feels really great to have a near identical tone to the song without having to fiddle with a peddleboard. That said I am a little dissapointed at the amount of songs and the cost of the DLC ones. $2.99 per songs seems a bit steep for me but I will still probably end up getting a couple here or there. Bottom line if you even have a slight interest in guitar then I highly recommend Rocksmith 2014			",832,218,29,100,73,12,139

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great starting point for anybody that has wanted to learn the guitar.  For a long time I've wanted to learn how to play but never had the means or resources to do it.  Like most people I got hooked into the whole Guitar Hero and Rock Band craze which was fun but at the end of the day it did nothing to help me learn the guitar.  If I could take all those hours of playing those games and invested it into Rocksmith who knows how much better I would be.  Games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero had one thing going for them in my opinion: They made me realize how much fun it was to be ""playing"" music that I liked.  Fast forward a few years and I learned about Rocksmith.  I researched the game a bit and saw some videos which demonstrated how the game worked.  In theory the game sounded amazing: a way to learn how to play songs that I like (and discover some new ones) with a real guitar.  I was skeptical at first because on one hand it would require you to own/buy/borrow a real guitar to do it.  After a few months I broke down and went to Guitar Center to buy a guitar to play.  I first purchased the game for the PS3 off of Amazon because it shipped with the Real Tone cable and it was on sale.  Firing up the game for the first time the game asks you a few basic questions about your skill level and your guitar.  The game boasts that you can enjoy it whether your a pro or never touched a guitar in your life.  There are a variety of lessons that range from the basics (how to hold the guitar, put the strap on, and intro to chords) to more advanced techniques like palm mutes (and other techniques that I'm nowhere close to trying).  There is a session mode where you can jam with a virtual band that will jam along with you while you mess around with all the tools they offer.  The other instruments will play differently depending on how fast or slow you play.  There is the Guitarcade mode where you can play mini games designed to help you work on different skills.Finally there is the Learn a Song mode which I probably where I spend most of my time.  There is quite a collection of music and it spans many genres.  Since purchasing this for the PC I've also picked up some extra songs whenever they go on sale (usually during the holiday sales).  Most of the songs have three different paths you could play on any particular song: Lead, Rhythm, or Bass guitar.  Once I started playing the notes were few and far between with little to no emphasis on chords.  You don't have to worry if you mess up too much because unlike Guitar Hero or Rock Band you can't fail a song.  The game will simply take away notes to make it easier for you to play.  There is also the Riff Repeater tool which allows you to focus on certain sections of a song, slow it down, and change the difficulty if you are having trouble with a particular riff or section.  Within the last two days I've gotten close to entering Master mode on a couple of sections of certain songs.  As you progress and improve the notes will begin to fade away so that you will have to start memorizing the song.In my opinion this game is an excellent tool for anybody serious about trying to learn the guitar.  It is not a magic wand that will make you a master guitar player but it's a great place to start.  If you are not willing to put the time in and practice no tool or game will be able to help you improve.  I can honestly say that the time I've put into the game has at least allowed me to improve .  I still have a long way to go before I'm anywhere close to being good but I'm having fun learning and I believe that is what will keep me practicing and trying to get better.			",120,27,0,15,9,2,15

												I've only played a couple of hours, but so far its a very interesting experience. You actually do learn, and you do so at a pretty quick pace. Once you start doing chords and reach 25%+ on a song (which you manage to do <5 hours in) you realize that ""hey, im not so bad anymore"". Cool stuff.			",205,41,4,18,14,3,42

												Have you ever played one of those plastic toys? You know those toys that you jammed so hard on with a rubber band to master Through the Fire and The Flames..  and those baby plastic toys broke within months due to shredding 5 colored buttons for Guitar Hero? Well yea, you had a dream didn't you? A dream that you could intentionally smash that piece of crap plastic and pick up a solid piece of wood.. You know.. Wood with strings, tuning pegs, and.. real wood.                                       Guess what.. Ubisoft had the same dream.. But unlike you.. they made it a reality.. and here it is, Rocksmith 2014! Rocksmith had came out in late 2011 and was a game that you had a simple cable plugged into the guitar in one end.. and the other end of the cable going into your computer or console. The game was meant for anyone of any skill. But for people who do not know how to play guitar, this was an amazing teaching device. 3 years later Ubisoft released a new Rocksmith.. Also known as Rocksmith 2014. This jamming game was a kick A** version of their original game with improvements to almost everything from visuals to lag compensation. This is a dream come true. At first I thought it was a big gimmick.. but only a month later I already felt like a true rockstar. I went from not knowing how to tune a guitar to knowing how to play Chop Suey by System of a Down. And if you bought this game.. some of you may be wondering.. ""Um.  How did you get Chop Suey? I don't see that in the game.. I also don't see it in the DLC store. I am very confused..""   Well let me help you out:  CDLC (or Custom Downloadable Content). This is content created by the community (Not to be confused with Steam's built in Community Workshop).. There are many videos out there on Youtube and plenty of guides people have created on both the internet and Steam that explain how to do this. Please remember this is NOT official Ubisoft material! Ubisoft has allowed this to be done but they do not endorse it. Remember this is not a work around to Ubisofts offical released DLC you buy through the Steam store. That is considered copyright and is not allowed! But anyways back onto the game, Rocksmith 2014 is an amazing game. It does not matter if you are Van Halen or some little boy from Germany who has made his way to the United States with very little money and nothing but a computer and a guitar but has no knowledge of how to shred! There is a skill level for everyone! You will never regret this purchase, as long as you want to play guitar and are willing to buy a Guitar and Rocksmith 2014. You are all set. (Please remember if you buy the digital version of Rocksmith / Rocksmith 2014 you must own the OFFICIAL licensed USB - 1/4 Cable Rocksmith sells. Third party adapters will not work. The cables work cross platform.. so the same cable you buy for Xbox360 will work on PS3 and PC and vice versa).  Do I need to say more? Buy it!Edit: October 4th, 2016; Ubisoft just did a big update ""Remastering"" the game. It is amazing they are still showing their support for this game! If you have not bought this yet, I highly reccomend it still!			",199,35,4,18,12,2,16

												Let's get down to business... This game was certainly one of Ubisoft's best games. You require an Electric guitar/bass guitar and a Rocksmith Real Tone cable in order to play this game. But I'm very impressed with how it worked, I understand that there are so many glitches in this game, but when the game works, it is just amazing.To simply state upsides and downsides, I'll list them:Pro's:You can learn guitar easily.There are many songs to choose from whether it's Rocksmith 2012/2014, DLC, or CDLC.You can get a Rocksmith 2012 import for Rocksmith 2014 giving Rocksmith 2014 a lot of Rocksmith 2012's songs.There are lessons and arcade games to play which uses the Electric guitar, it certainly helps.Missions to unlock songs/gear/inlays.Layout is simple and easy, whether it's the interface or the Riff repeater.Con's:For some, guitar is hard to play, I certainly had trouble, and that was beacuse I didn't practice the practice tracks, which I recommend you do if you're having trouble shifting/bending etc...DLC is way too expensive, asking £2.39 for a DLC with Rythym guitar, lead guitar, bass guitar and vocals... a little too much right? YOu can find all this stuff on the internet, but I buy these DLC's to help me learn the songs.Some CDLC may crash, and a while back Rocksmith 2014 just kept crashing when I started a song or lesson.Setting this up with a♥♥♥♥♥♥ took me at least five hours to fix the bugs myself and get my guitar to be picked up on this game... thanks internet too.Missions... now, these... are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've never seen a game as bad as Rocksmith 2014's mission system... you had to do it... you had to be a bunch of idiots, put a basic coding into the missions, and from like... play 1 new song, you ask for 3. From a 10 note streak, you go up to 300 after a while, and you have to get 100% mastery in songs... and yet, no matter how many times I repeat the song, you can't get 100% mastery, and once it had bugged out and not registered. And every single mission is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, allow for skippable missions and I'd recommend wasting time completing missions. I have to alt-f4 and launch the game to get a decent easy mission since I am only a beginner. Ubisoft idiots went too far with judging players skills, Beginner mode is what I started out as, and because of missions, they appear to think I'm pro. Also, there's no support for guitars with more strings. And no support for drums or vocals.About the stupid coding stuff... let's just say, there's only 2 songs on each path that the game recognizes, or at least 3. 2 CDLC's and one Rocksmith 2014 song... why not any of the others? Why not? Seriously, fix this or at least release an expansion pack that doesn't cost anything. But I recommend this game for the guitar player who wants to learn songs and learn guitar. But this is not for completionists, it is impossible to complete this game, it's just an unlimited game. For ♥♥♥♥s sake ubisoft, release updates for this, not DLC.			",104,15,3,5,9,1,7

												Rocksmith 2014 - GOTY.You are new to the guitar line or veteran playing in a rock band, this game is definitely for you.It has everything you need for training: detailed descriptions of guitar game styles, showing video tutorials, arcade games (think this is one of the best parts of the game).You definitely get a lot of positive emotions with this game. Put the game 10/10.Good luck and have fun from Enichi Missa. Russia, Moscow.			",112,4,1,11,2,1,9

I'm self learned guitar player so this game has a lot to offer for an amature guitar player, with a large rouster of songs and even more songs with payed dlc at a fair price, and with an easy to understand techniques, This game not only makes easy to learn the guitar/bass it also makes it fun.

												When I first heard about the Guitar Hero franchise, I thought it would be a game that you actually play with a guitar.  I ended up enjoying a few of the games, but I was always dissapointed by that cheap plastic controller that it came with.  A few years ago Rocksmith came out and I finally had the game I had always wanted.The first Rocksmith game was an awesome teaching tool.  I was pretty much an absolute beginner when I got it.  Today I've still got a long way to go, but I'm miles ahead of where I started, and I can now complete some of the easier songs with 100% completion.Rocksmith 2014 improves on the base game in almost every way.  Menus are easier to navigate, the rift repeater tool has been overhauled, and support for more tunings. ",961,283,36,155,117,8,161

												Remaster Update:They made some smart changes to the game menus, allowing you to more quickly filter and sort your songs. This is awesome if you have a lot of DLC. The overhauled Riff Repeater is great as well. I still recommend this game -- they consistently release DLC, and the quality of life improvements make the game even better than before.Original Review:I've been having a blast with this game. It takes the addictive elements of guitar hero and rock band, and teaches you real guitar techniques. There are lots of fun songs across all genres to learn, and the game does a good job of letting you ramp up until you are playing every note. It also has a cool ""riff repeater"" mode that lets you slow down and repeat sections of the song in order to practice. I've played about 50 hours of the game and I can actually play a few songs on my own already.There is also has a mini game mode that turns practicing scales, chords and other drills into games, which is more fun than just practicing those things over and over.My only complaint with this game is that it doesn't have very good tools for calibrating audio/visual input lag. I wish it had more robust tools like Rock Band does, because there's not much you can do to correct it. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who has had fun with Guitar Hero and wants to actually learn guitar.			",194,41,3,28,18,1,18

												Having put over 250 hours into this game, I can safely say that this game taught me how to play the guitar by itself.If you want to learn how to play the guitar but don't want it to turn into a chore, buy this game and play whenever you like and learn whenever you like.With Custom DLC you can play almost any song you want and combined with Dynamic Difficulty, you can learn so many songs at your own pace.The lessons that are included in the game are of great help for those who need it.Of course the game has some flaws, such as not picking up all notes (especially low ones), but they matter very little.tldr;Pro's:Great for beginners and experienced playersGreat for learning almost any song easilyLessons that can help you when you're stuckGreat way to spend your timeCon's:Sometimes won't recognize notesDLC is incredibly expensive9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have both versions of this game for xbox.. and now rocksmith 2014 on pc now that my xbox finally died on me. Though I feel the first Rocksmith had more of a reward system and felt closer to the rockband/guitar hero games. I Feel that this version is more inclusive and adaptive for the player. If a section gets to hard for you then it dials it back a bit, if its to slow for you it dials it up a notch. Now had they incorporated the rewards system (ie earning new guitars and venues from the first rocksmith) instead of the new amps and heads i think it would make it feel more rewarding.. With that being said I REALLY enjoy this game. I enjoy the guitarcade games and some of the changes they have implimented, there are some changes i didnt like, (the sessions menue wasnt much to my liking, but i can see why the added it and the way you change up your ""gear"" needs some improvement) but all in all  i feel this is a good game for people who are learning guitar or want to add some knowledge to what they already know and get started learning songs quick.

												An absolutely unique and excellent game... program... teacher?Rocksmith makes good on its promises of being a efficient, fast and (extremely) fun way of learning guitar (or bass). I have been playing for roughly 10 days and making more consistent, noticeable progress that I could ever hope for with a paid, limited-hour teacher, or the myriad of unorganized videos and programs around the Internet. Rocksmith has an unique edge on them by providing you with dynamic tracking of your progress, adjusting difficulty and providing many suggestions and options for you try to improve your skills, having easy to understand lessons on multiple techniques and aspects of playing guitar, a good and varied number of songs (which you can greatly increase with cheap official DLC, or free community-made ones), as well as unique and interesting minigames and oppotunities for focused, efficient learning. After all, practice doesn't make perfect, perfect pratice makes perfect.Still, Rocksmith is far from perfect. There are a couple of glitches and incosistencies here and there, some weird mechanics, a lack of variety for some of its more unique features, and the game fails to specifcally recognize some more specific nuances when recognizing notes, like harmonics. It also doesn't do much in the way of teaching you music theory or how to improvise. Session Mode feels like a novelty more than anything, and a beta implementation at the most. In the end, even playing actual licensed songs is little more than having a tab coming at you in pretty graphics, since the game has, unfortunately, no multitrack options, and you merely hear the sound of your guitar ""over"" the original recording. I mean, this was something even Guitar Hero was capable of doing (however there are some custom DLC that allow for this). Nonetheless, it is still extremely satisfying.My biggest gripe, though, comes from the fact that RS doesn't fully utilize the possibilities of modern gaming. We have seen many games on Steam which ranged from mediocre to downright bad on launch, only to be progressively improved with each update and DLC, free or not. Rocksmith 2014, however, limits itself to launching new songs as DLC (which it has been doing with excellent frequency!), there are no new features, new Guitarcade games or obvious refinements (like a search function) coming our way; testament to this game being published by Ubisoft, which has never been very fond of supporting their games for a long time. Perhaps in Rocksmith 2017?			",134,5,19,6,20,0,23

												Like guitar hero but with a REAL GUITAR. Teaches you to play guitar and/or bass with your favorite songs.Maybe not your ""favorite"" but there's a HUGE library of songs so something will grab your attention.Hell, you might find something new you really enjoy.If you ever feel like learning some theory there's several games that teach chords and scales. It won't teach you the names of the notes however, just the scale shapes. I've had a lot of fun with this and am excited to see how much more there is to learn.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, do ignore my playing hours. I've put this game down and restarted so many times my ACTUAL gameplay count would be like... 2 at best.Now, onto the review.The bad:Missions. Missions you say? What is this, GTA? Skyrim?!Yes, this thing has ""missions"". And that little rectangle will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off beyond belief. A good chunk of said missions are useless. ""Play ____ in the guitarcade!"". Yes, ""guitarcade"". You get to play little minigames, like a weird version of flappyybird or some kind of space invaders thing. Except with ducks. I don't know why ducks either.The idea is THERE, again, but the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor ability of the cable to distinguish various sounds makes it harder to actually hit anything. And god help you with the chord games.The tuners.There are two tuners in the game: one when you calibrate your gutiar between songs (eg. one that is regular E and one that is dropdown D) and the tuner in the options. The calibrating tuner is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sure, you can't expect your guitar to be precisely calibrated every time because tension physics is a thing. I would suggest using the tuner in the options more than the calibration tuner. It's more accurate.More songs than technique.The game has a lot of songs. Like fifty that come with the installation and an option to download more, assuming you're willing to shell out a few bucks. They're not too expensive, though I must say that I haven't tried to purchase any yet. Not sure how THAT bit would work.My guess here is that Ubisoft is going for the idea that if you learn a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of songs, you'll be able to rearrange the chords into your own style. Kinda having this whole thing as a secret, GIGANTIC tutorial.The good:The game does try to encourage you using recordings of a ""hip"" guy, presumably in his thirties who may or may not have played in a band in college and now his life is in shambles as he tries to recreate his glory days.He somehow sounds both happy and depressed at the same time. Not sure how, but he also has this ""punch me in the face RIGHT NOW"" voice.There is, in fact, an amount of basic explanation of how to perform various techniques needed for songs. Sure, there's no explanation of how to practice them, but at least you're getting information on what you can do with your guitar. Before I encountered Rocksmith, I thought you just hold strings and flail like a maniac.The basic pack is actually good!In many games with a ton of DLC, such as Rocksmith, the basic pack is there to provide you with a reasonable experience, ending up with you yearning for more. Usually, the DLC is stuff you wouldn't even ponder. Here, the situation is quite the opposite: You get quite a versatile list of free songs to choose from, and if you want to search for a song that you desparately want to learn and it's not in the free pack, it's probably in the DLC somewhere.There's a ♥♥♥♥ton of DLCContinuing my previous point, there is indeed at least one metric ♥♥♥♥ton of DLC. Assuming you don't get bored and/or die of natural causes as you attempt to bring all of the free songs to 100%... level...? rating...? You have quite a lot of DLC to choose from. So far, it's only extra songs to play, meaning, no equivalent's of Skyrim's golden horse armor plating. The DLC in Rocksmith is actually USEFUL!ConclusionIs this game fun? It depends on the personality. I personally tend to get obsessed with a game and the drop it for a year. As I'm writing this, I'm trying to get my obsession back up.I do believe that if you give it quite some time, you will master the guitar much faster than youtube classes.You may also end up in ER with insane calluses, bleeding fingers and possibly, bone fractures on your fingers and wrists, but at least you'll enjoy getting these injuries.

												I can't recommend this game enough!  I've owned guitars for a long time, but never really stuck to practicing.  Most of the time before playing Rocksmith 2014, I would just fiddle around with making melodies and wanting to figure out how to make chords go along with the melodies I was creating.  I didn't get very far with Guitar.When Rocksmith (original) came out I was excited to pick it up and give it a shot, but had many issues with the game:  Input Lag, Audio feedback, and just wasn't really into the method.Then comes Rocksmith 2014!  So far I've put about 45 hours into 2014, and I'm still having a blast.  All of the issues I experienced on Win32/x360 versions of Rocksmith 1 have been resolved.  And now there is a recommendation system that suggests things for you to do.Rather than level up like in the first game, you focus on mastery of each song.  Once you have mastered a section of the song, the notes will fade out, and force you to memorize the patterns. (brilliant! and optional if you dislike it)I have yet to play Bass with this, but from what I can glean about being able to play Lead Guitar or Rythm Guitar, I expect it will be just as fun to play.  (I will probably pick up a bass soon; but there is a bass emulation mode as well for guitar)I have a deep musical background, and the only thing I find lacking is that it's all focused on Rock.  (But it is Rocksmith after all!)  I wish it had some classical guitar tunes that can be very technically hard, so I could focus more on picking and more difficult techniques.  But overall this is a great start, and I'm excited to see where this takes me after another 40 hours of play (or practice)			",430,92,9,71,48,2,91

												I am very happy with Rocksmith 2014 as a learning aid and that it feels like that became far more of a focus when compared to the original Rocksmith. Though it's a matter of taste, I also find the tracklist of the 2014 version far superior and varied. I use it with bass only and feel that it caters to it just as well as regular guitar and I'm glad it takes into consideration that I play a left handed instrument.I produced a short first impressions video with more details and opinions on the game that you can check out here:

												Awesome! I'm learning a lot on how to play a guitar as lead guitarist. I managed to pull off my first riff which is amazing all under an hour. They expect you to do at least 1 hour a day which I believe for 30 or 90 days and they say you'll know how to play guitar! You learn the positions of the frets and strings, it will all become second nature and playing guitar is so smooth. This is definitely much better than guitar hero\rockband! You're having fun and actually learning!			",196,14,5,9,9,0,20

												First off, I'd just like to say the big annoyance of this game. It is that every guitar and bass I own apparently has a really low volume. Every time the tuning screen comes up it says it. These are not low quality instruments. Apparently my massively loud Rickenbacker 4003 is too quiet! I don't not what guitars and basses they were testing with but seriously? So with that out the way I think I can talk about the rest of the game. It's fun! Though I'd question it's worth as a teaching tool. I picked this game up with 7 years bass experience, so I haven't really used it as a teaching tool. I got it because I'm a big fan of guitar hero and thought it'd be cool if I could learn some songs on the way. Unfortunatly, many years of playing Guitar Hero have made me quite good a sight reading this game. Every time I learn a song in the game to 100% or near mastery, I can't remember a single note when I come away. This isn't so much of a problem with the game as a problem if you've played a lot of Guitar Hero that I thought you might want to be aware of.This game has made me less prone to looking at the neck of my bass though. I didn't actually realise how much I did it until I started playing Rocksmith. It has taught me to only look down for the big jumps, which is cool. So it's not without it's uses if you're experienced.The big thing I wanted to get out of this game apart from another cool rhythm game, is a few new songs to learn that I otherwise may not have thought to. It has done a great job of that. I've learned Radiohead, Stone Temple Pilots, Dead Weather. It's all good stuff. Plus there are an enormous amount of custom songs available for download. They're easy to install and they're all actually of pretty good quality that I've tried. Not like they were in Guitar Hero 3. So check this out if you want to learn some songs. Though I haven't seen anything that explains any music theory to you, which you really need if you're starting out. So maybe only get it if you already have a pretty good idea what you're doing.

												As someone who can legitimately play the guitar to a ""mediocre"" level, I probably wouldn't recommend this game as a tool to learn.Let's get this straight. If you don't play guitar, and you ask me if I can play guitar, my answer is ""hells yeah"". If you do play guitar and you ask me, my answer is ""I own two but I don't play them as much as I like"". Reality is I'm OK, but everyone else is probably better than me. I know all the chords, but I don't really know any full songs. I know a few riffs, and I know parts of some songs.This game basically lets you choose a song, and play it over and over again. To start with you have ""not many"" notes to play, it adds them in over time and adapts if you fail by taking notes away next time. It has a few features that let you slow down and increase the difficulty manually, but to be honest I didn't feel like this taught me much.Basically this game is a slightly more educational Guitar Hero. It lets you listen to some banging tunes while feeling like you're achieving something that will matter in real life. To some extent I guess it probably helps with dexterity and the basics of finding notes on the fretboard faster and hitting some chords/power chords.It does however have a really cool ""jam"" mode, where you can play like you're plugged into an amp and have AI play along with you. I probably used this more than the game itself.Don't get me wrong I would recommend the hell out of this game, but it really isn't much more than a ""game"". It's not going to teach you guitar better than online tutorial videos or a tutor. You'd be better of with those.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before Rocksmith, I wasn't good at anything. I burnt all my food, I would fall on treadmills, I would splooge too early (when making love to myself), and I definitely couldn't play guitar. Now all those things are still true, however I have a blast trying to melt faces with my axe. I think that anyone who plays this game more than 5 days in a row will definitely see improvement on their guitar playing skills, and after 60, you can start a horrible band with your mouth breathing friends.The setlist is fantastic. These songs are part of the reason I am prematurely blowing loads onto my belly. There are so many good songs.Buy this and then buy all the dlcs and then buy me something too. Feel free to just gift me things.			",99,28,3,17,15,2,19

												~60 hours ago I didn't even know how to hold a pick, and now I can play at least half a dozen songs.  This software simply works.  However, be wary of buying the steam version, because in order to play you need to have a USB to Guitar wire.  If you order this product online elsewhere you can get the wire and game for roughly $80.  If you want to learn guitar, this is the way to do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am amazed that my terrible playing sounds like a member of the band of whatever song I am playing.  I am 50 years of age, and playing an electric guitar has always been on my bucket list.  Here it is, my best chance of crossing one thing off the list.  There are lots of challenges within the software, and it learns from you very quickly to the point of being too challenging.  Just stop things and wind down the speed or accuracy and away you go.I bought a guitar, amp and stuff in a pack from an E-Bay retailer and then Rocksmith 2014.  So far so good, and the fun continues.			",30,0,2,0,5,0,18

												Rocksmith is a great game and tool for beginers at guitar. I had some basic knowledge before hand, but no real skills. After playing this game, my skills have increased greatly. For the beginer who doesn't want to to shell out the money for lessons or have the time for them, this game is a great substitue. However, this game does not ""teach"" you that much. I honestly haven't learned much from this game that I didn't already know. The game has lessons which teach basic techniques and chords, but thats really it on the teaching. This is more of a very fun way to practice than an actual teaching game. While this game may not be for the more experienced player, I do highly reccomend this game for beginers who are looking to improve their guitar skills without the cost of lessons. The game is very fun and very effective.			",68,14,2,15,23,0,6

Once i have mastered te bass the lead should be no problem as i will have my head around the fretboard.  It is ace that you can jam with your favourite bands so you allready have an idea of the music .All in all one of my best purchases of the last few years imo wish it was out 20 years ago lol.

												Before i Picked up Rocksmith2014, I'd been playing guitar for around 6 years and my first thought was ""oh i play guitar, this is just like an advanced version of something like guitar hero or rockband"". Even after learning for 6 years, in the last few months I've noticed my finger speed improving even when playing casually.I dont know how this would stack up if you where coming in at a beginner level, but certainly for me, even after playing for years this game still has things to teach me, although I wouldn't exactly say it felt like I was sitting down everyday to force myself to practice. All in all, if you've been playing for a reasonable time like me before even trying the game, I'd recommend it.And for beginners i imagine this would make learning guitar a whole lot of fun.

												Incredible improvements over the original rocksmith, which was already an incredible game/tool! I am an experienced bassist, been in a band for years and use this more for fun than a learning tool, but ripping up iron maiden basslines certainly helps with dexterity.  Most fun i have had on guitar without my bandmates around! 10/10			",104,10,14,9,6,1,11

												Awesome game/tool for learning guitar having never played a guitar i find this a very adictive way to learn, I bought a lead and bass guitar and find the bass is easier to master and is teaching me the fretboard without trying to worry about the 6 strings on the lead guitar.. Once i have mastered te bass the lead should be no problem as i will have my head around the fretboard.  It is ace that you can jam with your favourite bands so you allready have an idea of the music .All in all one of my best purchases of the last few years imo wish it was out 20 years ago lol.

												I bought my guitar two years ago just to learn how to play. Learning witha a book or with youtube's help was boring, and after one or two months the guitar found a new functionality - a 'dust-collector furniture'. Few weeks ago my friend told me about Rocksmith and then it began.With help of this game I finally tuned my guitar and learned few chords. I do not need to learn notes, everything is presented in a graphical way. There are many tracks which you can learn. Few lessons will help you with the first steps. Additionally there are lots of other features which I have not discovered and used yet. Additionally you can boost your knowledge by playing Commodore-like games - good for parties (where not everyone has played a guitar). The Commodore/Atari games are just fantastic. Another advantage is that I can plug just my guitar to PC (you need to buy a cable for that, I suggest you to buy this game with cable on ebay, well it's also cheaper) and use my headset - no one (also my neighbours) is not angry.

												Great way to learn guitar!  I already knew how to play rhythm guitar pretty well just by learning from tablatures over the years, but I was never good at scales or soloing.  This game has increased my dexterity quite a lot and CDLC is an awesome way to learn songs that aren't already official DLC or aren't likely to become official DLC (I listen to a lot of indie music).If you ever played Guitar Hero, it's definitely much harder but it's also that much more rewarding because you are actually learning to play the song for real.If you have always wanted to learn guitar and just could never motivate yourself to actually learn, buy this game!  It is THE best tool for learning and is adjustable to EVERY skill level, even someone like me who knows their way around a guitar but still is lacking in certain areas.			",82,10,0,11,3,0,5

												When I started Rocksmith, I played zero guitar.  I could do some air guitar, but that's it.  After sixty some hours, I can play some riffs, and play along to some songs, both bass and electric guitar.  I'm not a musician, but I'm learning and I'm having fun.It's not a substitute for a professional music instructor.  But, it's surprisingly good.  There are technique games for learning chords, slides, bends, etc.  There are a good number of songs included in the game, and they continue to add DLC for a wide variety of tastes and challenges.  Will I ever be a guitar god?  Clearly not.  But it's pretty cool to play something you recognize, and to start learning to play things beyond the songs.The one major downside to the game is that it does not play nice with sound cards.  I had to pull mine out and use onboard sound.  Not ideal, but solved lag and distortion issues.			",83,10,0,11,11,0,17

												An excellent learning and practice tool for playing guitar. Whether you are a complete beginner or an experience player like myself this game is really enjoyable and helps you learn and improve your guitar skills in a fun way. Rocksmith 2014 is completely different than the first Rocksmith game and is much, much better. Ubisoft have improved the game in many aspects including a new jam mode where you can play with a virtual band. There is a wide variety of songs to play with many more being released as DLC. I've noticed significantly less input lag compared to the last Rocksmith game however chord detection is still a bit of an issue in Rocksmith 20149/10			",81,7,1,6,5,1,5

It's a good idea to get the first game, too, to be able to play it's DLC packs natively instead of through 2014, cause some of them were just plain better played through the old game.All in all, though, still  fabulous game and learning tool.

												Rocksmith 2014 is the best game/software I could possibly spend my money on. For a person who wants to learn how to play the guitar it is a great tool as well as entertainment. Apart from many improvements made in comparison to the first Rocksmith, you really have to appreciate the session mode. Learning scales, improvising, learning to listen to the virtual band, it is really helpful in improving guitar skills. I played guitar for quite a while, but having Rocksmith gave a huge boost to my playing ability. Even when it comes to things like learning songs it's much better than tablatures. I learn faster, it's more efficient, I highly recommend it to anyone. Beginners will find it easy to use, intermediate players will have a great tool for practicing in my opinion, and for those who like a challenge there are always difficult songs which are very demanding, and if that's not enough try everything on master mode (I actually like it a lot when parts or whole songs disappear while you play, after all the more demanding it gets the better you try to play). And now it's time to plug in the Real Tone cable again.			",69,35,2,8,5,1,4

												Guitar Hero using a real guitar. Honestly, my favorite game just for that reason. As someone with a music background this works great for learning how to play. It doesn't do a good job of teaching you theory, doesn't touch tabs (let alone actual notation), or some other necessary points. This game-ifies learning the guitar and should be used conjointly with either lessons or a resource like JustinGuitar.The remastered edition was a fantastic update. It significantly improved note/chord recognition (at least for me).The DLC that's always coming out has a good selection of songs but where the game really shines is the uh, modding community. Can't say much here but you can blow the hell out of the main game/DLC selection with anything from Led Zeppelin to Tay Swizzle, Buckethead to the Beatles, and Burzum to Black Sabbath.

												This game is a highly enjoyable highly effective way to learn guitar. The biggest comparison you probably hear is true. It's like Guitar Hero, with an actual guitar. I started playing guitar at the time I got the first Rocksmith. Within a week,  I already had improved in my skill. I highly recommend this game to any aspiring guitarist. This game tracks your progress, how well you play, and adapts the difficulty to your skill level so you are always being pushed to do better, without having to tackle challanges that you can't succed at. You'll improve in skill while learning to play your favorite songs.TL;DRPros:Never have to tackle a challange you can't beatImprove within short amounts of timeLearn to play your favorite songs along the wayA sense of acheivementCons:Pricey cable with reliability issues (so I've heard and mine hardly lasted a year)Game seems to have a hard time detecting bendsHave to pay to import songs from the first RocksmithMy final verdicts? 9/10, highly enjoyable, highly effective, worth while for anyone who loves guitar and music.

												I honestly LOVE this game. I had tried learning the guitar before and after having the rocksmith experience I sincerely feel that the develpoers of this game came up with a fantastic learning tool for the guitar. Really great job!!! I'd love to see som improvements in terms of the steam site and the DLC. Also, i'm a big fan of the DLC, keep em coming!!! My only problem with the DLC is that the list inside my actual game is not current which is kind of annoying and the DLC page in the actual steam browser never opens up... I've purchased my DLC through the rocksmith page by scrolling down but even that list does not include all the DLC that has come out. Either way fixing it in the game i think would be best because it is easier to sort through. Also would love to see eventually Rocksmith incorporates vocals and keyboards, it's such a great way to learn and at the very least i feel that singing is an integral part of playing guitar. Anyways those are just my thoughts on how to make things a bit better but as i stated previously this is a really efficient and fun way to learn how to play the guitar!!! TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!!

												I highly recommend this game if you just want something the jam to every once and while, tighten your guitar skills, or possibly learn how to play in general. I used to play guitar in a couple different bands about a decade or so ago, even traveled the west coast playing shows and opening for some decent acts... then I went to film school, left the music behind me (fun while at lasted, lead to a lot of firsts in my life :) but never managed to sell all my old gear. I've hung onto a couple of amps, guitars with various sentimental values and rarity in the market place through several moves, but in all honestly only jamed on them a handful of times, and usually just playing the old stuff form muscle memory. Rocksmith is perfect for me with a variety of progressive difficulties, and challenges to learn new material and get outside my comfort zone. Been working too hard to play recently, but since I bought the game I've plugged in more in the last couple of months then I have in the last several years! The Mavericks bug did suck though, dragging down my ability to use the software for several weeks, took them the better part of a month the fix... guess that's what I get for jumping into a new os that hasn't been properly tested.

												I bought a guitar when I was 16 and it sat in the corner of my room collecting dust for 7 years. I found myself bored of the initial stages of learning guitar which can be very slow and unrewarding. Then I found Rocksmith last September.When I found Rocksmith, everything changed. Suddenly, the initial, usually slow process of learning guitar became fun. That, to me, is the best thing about this game. It reduces the harsh learning curve of playing a musical instrument by using fun minigames or allowing you to play along with songs even though you aren't good enough to hit all of the notes yet.Today, only 9 months after picking up a guitar, I can play fairly well because of Rocksmith. I can play a good amount of songs from multiple genres including classic rock, country, modern rock, and metal. I still have trouble with fast guitar solos, but it's something I'll get down eventually.However, Rocksmith is not a game that is going to entirely teach you the correct way to play from the basics up to being a master. It works best as a supplemental learning device and you should still be reading and watching videos and even getting lessons outside of Rocksmith if you're serious about learning the instrument.For most people, Rocksmith will do what it says it's going to do: teach you to play guitar. And it does that well. I'd give it a 10/10 as a supplement to regular practice and lessons (even video lessons on youtube). I'd still give it a 7.5/10 if you are only interested in the game itself and aren't going to be playing guitar outside of the game. All in all a great way to pass some time and learn an instrument.

												This is an absolute must-buy for anyone currently owning an electric-capable guitar who wants to learn guitar or better their skills.It has tutorials from as basic as how to put on a strap, hold your guitar, how to strum/pick, etc to some hectic and challenging stages in the Guitarcade games that will challenge your skills in scales, picking, volume control, etc.Also, if you often find yourself wanting to play with your guitar, but not knowing what to play, this is also a really intricate tool for learning new songs to play, and a beautiful excuse to play on your guitar.Every guitarist who indulged in this game which I highly recommended unto them left with a copy and a big fat smile on their face (and sometimes a bleeding finger).Good progression throughout the game, and excellent all-in-all.

Very accurate hardware considering the simple tech behind it.Can be slow to build up for more experenced users but even after 20 years of playing i'm having a blast.Tones are generally very authentic and when everything comes together you can show boat.

												When I started Rocksmith, I played zero guitar.  I could do some air guitar, but that's it.  After sixty some hours, I can play some riffs, and play along to some songs, both bass and electric guitar.  I'm not a musician, but I'm learning and I'm having fun.It's not a substitute for a professional music instructor.  But, it's surprisingly good.  There are technique games for learning chords, slides, bends, etc.  There are a good number of songs included in the game, and they continue to add DLC for a wide variety of tastes and challenges.  Will I ever be a guitar god?  Clearly not.  But it's pretty cool to play something you recognize, and to start learning to play things beyond the songs.The one major downside to the game is that it does not play nice with sound cards.  I had to pull mine out and use onboard sound.  Not ideal, but solved lag and distortion issues.			",83,10,0,11,11,0,17

												I honestly LOVE this game. I had tried learning the guitar before and after having the rocksmith experience I sincerely feel that the develpoers of this game came up with a fantastic learning tool for the guitar. Really great job!!! I'd love to see som improvements in terms of the steam site and the DLC. Also, i'm a big fan of the DLC, keep em coming!!! My only problem with the DLC is that the list inside my actual game is not current which is kind of annoying and the DLC page in the actual steam browser never opens up... I've purchased my DLC through the rocksmith page by scrolling down but even that list does not include all the DLC that has come out. Either way fixing it in the game i think would be best because it is easier to sort through. Also would love to see eventually Rocksmith incorporates vocals and keyboards, it's such a great way to learn and at the very least i feel that singing is an integral part of playing guitar. Anyways those are just my thoughts on how to make things a bit better but as i stated previously this is a really efficient and fun way to learn how to play the guitar!!! TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!!

												Fun game that can teach you basic tools. Don't expect this game to turn you into the next Hendrix, Page, Gilmour, Eddie Hazel, etc. It is really fun and helps pass time.  If you're into actually learning advanced methods you'll probably need a book for that i.e. music theory.But in the end, like stated above, it is a very fun game.			",27,5,0,3,5,0,2

												I would like to start off saying that this is a very, very good game to learn how to play guitar if you are a newbie, or even if you are experienced it REALLY helps you out in learning songs if you're pretty shoddy at playing by ear or tabs. While it has its downsides, an exceptional downside especially for a newbie, is when you go to tune your guitar it very often may get your tunings wrong to a point where once you start playing a song you may be off by 1, 2, or even 3 (pardon me if I'm not very literal in terms of guitar) sections of the string, and it gets very frustrating when you keep missing notes thanks to this, and it's a real pain to tune it perfectly yourself while the song is playing, and I'll say this:  When I try to play System of a Down, those D Drop Cs are a B*TCH to tune and they are almost ALWAYS off, especially the two thickest strings. Which brings me to the fact that I will say GOOD LUCK tuning your 2 thickest strings because it is ALWAYS  pain in the a$$, especially when you try playing Ducks ReDux, you ALWAYS pray you never go back to your red or yellow string. But that is literally the only thing wrong with this game aside from there needing to be more songs (lol).Also a side note:  I think it would be much easier and much better to take regular guitar lessons from someone for at least maybe a month to get yourself much more familiar at guitar playing, and then warm your fingers up to moving with Guitar Hero, because that is what I've done over the past years. I took guitar lessons every Tuesday every week for at least all summer, and played Guitar Hero for maybe 4 years, and when I made the switch to real guitar on Rocksmith, well, lets just say I went from 0 to 65% on BYOB, 0 to 70% on Reptilia (not on this version of Rocksmith :( I have it on Xbox and PC), 80% on Knights of Cydonia, and I'm doing fairly well in Ariels and Toxicity, ALL IN ONE WEEK. Knights of Cydonia less than a DAY. So I don't know if maybe I'm just a natural or all those lessons and Guitar Hero really did helpI hope my review persuaded you to buy this epic way to learn guitar.			",74,6,0,11,4,1,1

												Rocksmith 2014 is the best game/software I could possibly spend my money on. For a person who wants to learn how to play the guitar it is a great tool as well as entertainment. Apart from many improvements made in comparison to the first Rocksmith, you really have to appreciate the session mode. Learning scales, improvising, learning to listen to the virtual band, it is really helpful in improving guitar skills. I played guitar for quite a while, but having Rocksmith gave a huge boost to my playing ability. Even when it comes to things like learning songs it's much better than tablatures. I learn faster, it's more efficient, I highly recommend it to anyone. Beginners will find it easy to use, intermediate players will have a great tool for practicing in my opinion, and for those who like a challenge there are always difficult songs which are very demanding, and if that's not enough try everything on master mode (I actually like it a lot when parts or whole songs disappear while you play, after all the more demanding it gets the better you try to play). And now it's time to plug in the Real Tone cable again.			",69,35,2,8,5,1,4

												Guitar Hero using a real guitar. Honestly, my favorite game just for that reason. As someone with a music background this works great for learning how to play. It doesn't do a good job of teaching you theory, doesn't touch tabs (let alone actual notation), or some other necessary points. This game-ifies learning the guitar and should be used conjointly with either lessons or a resource like JustinGuitar.The remastered edition was a fantastic update. It significantly improved note/chord recognition (at least for me).The DLC that's always coming out has a good selection of songs but where the game really shines is the uh, modding community. Can't say much here but you can blow the hell out of the main game/DLC selection with anything from Led Zeppelin to Tay Swizzle, Buckethead to the Beatles, and Burzum to Black Sabbath.

												This is a very fun way to learn to play the guitar. Both me and my 11-year-old daughter began playing this with no prior guitar playing experience. I've progressed considerably, but am still quite mediocre, as I haven't been able to play very much, nor am I particularly young. On the other hand, my daughter has become quite good in only a matter of a few months. Clearly, she had a hidden talent. Tomorrow she will be playing Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" for a talent show at her elementary school, without using Rocksmith.  Rocksmith is great at adjusting to weaker players like myself, only giving me a portion of the notes and filling in the rest.  If there is one fault, it's that Rocksmith doesn't teach the fundamentals or theory very well.  Adding better instruction to the next version would be one of the the best ways to improve it.

												As for Rocksmith, so far it's done everything I've asked of it, short of giving me a real solid feel of direction. I'm probably going to regret not practicing the basic scales and chords as much, since I've been playing along with some hit songs more during my practice sessions. The fun factor for me is quite high, but I've only found annoyance with the GuitarCade mini games so far. The lessons aren't nearly as in depth and useful as I had hoped. It's also hard to gauge my progression in skill outside of each individual song. I've also noticed it may be a bit too forgiving for timing. I've been singing pseudo-professionally, and feel the timing window might leave too much leeway for folks who aren't particularly good at rhythm to begin with, not giving enough feedback to develop well. 5/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												This is the ultimate game for helping you to learn guitar. From basic lessons such as attaching your strap to advanced lessons such as tapping, this game has you covered. The dynamic dificulty helps you go from a beginer to an intermediate player within the space of playing in a month. It starts off with one note then levels you up accordingly to your skill level at the time. Riff repeater is a fantastic tool for helping you learn and nail that section you just can't get down, allowing you to change speed etc. With a ton of official DLC and forever expanding CDLC, you have a lot of songs to learn till your hearts content. This is the definitive game for any budding guitarist or any seasoned pro. I greatly recommend, 10/10!			",60,2,4,2,7,0,1

												Plug in your guitar, learn to play songs. Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.It should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.			",101,27,1,10,2,2,8

												As a bassists, I find Rocksmith 2014 to be an absolute blast to play. Before the only way I had to play these songs was by printing off tabs from websites, or by having to listen to parts of a song over and over again in order to figure out what was being played. The best part about this game is the Riff Repeater, which allows you to play sections of a song over and over at different speeds and difficulties. I was not a beginner when I started playing, but Rocksmith is a great way to keep my skill up. The only cons with the game are the limited song selection starting out, and the fact that the song difficulty takes a really long time to change for advanced players.Score: 9/10 ",47,1,1,9,7,0,6

												This game is awesome for anyone just starting out on guitar, or wanting to improve his/her skills on the instrument. So many different songs really help diversify playing and style when playing guitar not in game. So many DLCs to choose from. Lessons that really push your skills forward and make it fun to do so. The tone designer is great for getting ANY kind of sound you want out of your guitar. No more tedious scales or the same boring tone from your amp. The mini-games allow you to level up your skills in bending, string skipping, shifting, tremelo, etc. The session mode has various instruments you can play along with and almost any scale to try out. The game thinks for you and customizes missions and recommended items to help you improve. The Riff Repeater allows you to slow a segment down and really practice those hard solos and riffs. I never get bored with this game, and will often practice for 6 hours in one go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Initially this was alright, but the lag is really bad for playing. I can't stand it. Makes playing tricky fast sections really hard. Also its soo strict with actually playing chords. If you miss a note in a chord (or even play it a little too quiet) - it decides you havn't played it properly, even when it sounded perfectly fine (to my ears). Yet other times i would blatantly make a mistake which sounded terrible and it didn't catch it. It became hard to tell if i actually made a mistake, or the game was flagging false positives. I stopped playing after a while becuase of this.Several months later i was bored one day and decided to checkout session mode and worked through a few more missions. Then i fully comprehended what you can do in session mode. Its the perfect practice tool, i started doing my scales and playing along with the band. Now I just jump in session mode and jam for a while, practicing new and old techniques. As there's no critical timing in session mode, the lag isn't so much of an issue. I am enjoying it way more now.Overall i would recommend this game becuase of session mode. Once you had a bit of fun with score attack and learning a few songs, start using session mode and work through the missions.Note: I would consider myself an intermediate guitar player at the time i bought RS2014			",60,1,0,5,9,0,17

												ive always wanted to play guitar, but could never get it right. the best i could do was string 3 random chords together and make a small rift. i bought this game on steam, and battled for about 2 weeks to get a cable. after doing alot of research, finding the distributors for south africe etc etc etc..... i finally got my cable.upon reading all the reviews and visiting all the forums, i decided to learn bass guitar. went and got my new bass, plug it in, set it up and off we go.....in just 2 hours i was playingsystem of a down areals at 100perc difficulty and 98perc accuracy. i can not stop playing now!this is truely a master piece of software. the note recognition is truely amazing.i recommend this to anyone who does or wants to play guitar!

												This is a great game if you are starting out with guitar or bass, it will teach you basic things like strapping your guitar and your finger tecnique to more avanced things like arpeggios and harmonics, its really worth a try if your looking into learning an instrument, downside in my opinion is that it doesnt teach you the name of the notes nor does it teach you how to read notes but ohther than that I really recommend it both for the advanced player and people just starting out!

												It's just awesome that all I can say.I've always being a rock music fan but never learn to play guitar. It looks so hard to learn and play. Somehow I decided to buy Rocksmith and guitar 3 weeks ago. 3 weeks after, now I can play Breakung The Law, Livin' On A Prayer and some easy songs.  If you are not going to be guitar master like me, Rocksmith can still let you play some songs in a shor time. If you want to be a guitar master, Rocksmith will be a good friend to improve with you.Rocksmith makes guitar so fun and you won't feel like you are practicing guitar. If you really want to learn guitar and don't wait just get Rocksmith!			",90,22,3,22,5,0,7

												Plug in your guitar, learn to play songs. Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.It should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.			",101,27,1,10,2,2,8

												I guess it's the f*ckin' best simulator game ever. Previous version was quite a bit uncomfortable to use, but in 2014 ver. they added some nice features and redesigned interface. The game became much more fun to play. However, IMHO, some music in the game sucks, but it has great hits like Pour Some Sugar On Me, Aces High, Peace of Mind, No More Mr.Nice Guy, The Trooper, Round'n'Round, Losing My Religion, Rock And Roll All Nite, I Believe In The Thing Called Love(that's all, I think).Also, in my country it's such a rare game, so I was so glad to recieve.Okay. Seriously, If you want to play guitar every day for 5-6 hours OR you wanna start the guitar - do not waste time -but it immediately!			",15,1,0,2,2,0,0

I also have a guitar that I have been practicing lead guitar with and the game does a great job of offering technique lessons and working you up to progressively harder songs.  It is a bit of an investment to get into, but the game is amazing fun for any guitar or bass players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like Guitar Hero but with real Guitars. 8/10 (was previosuly 9.5/10Good game until It deletes all your progress and continues to do it every time you open the game it happened to me and my friend,  it really sucks that it does that.Great game to learn and practice Guitar and Bass.Though it says I only have 30 hrs. here I have been playing much longer at my friends house.  It has a lot of good songs and DLC also Custom DLC (which I will get into later). I have been playing Bass for about a year and I really enjoy this game. It has helped me become better at bass. My friend plays Guitar and we enjoy playing Co-op on songs. The only downside is sometimes the game doesn't sense when I hit notes on the 1st and 2nd frets of the E string, and it gets worse when you get to lower tuning. Also, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REALTONE CABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. So I hope you consider picking up that old guitar or bass, or consider getting a guitar or bass and start learning today.*CDLC is Custom DLC made by the community and is free. Just go to Customsforge.com and sign up to get Custom DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very very good. They teach you techniques very well. I played the 1st rocksmith and 2014 is the way to go. The only thing I have trouble with is the pinch harmonics. I also loved how they changed the riff repeater. At first, you had to not miss any notes for 3 rounds then it goes up. In this rocksmith, however, you can choose what section and what difficulty and what speed and you have no consequences. The minigames are good for teaching but are also really fun! 10/10!

												This game is a highly enjoyable highly effective way to learn guitar. The biggest comparison you probably hear is true. It's like Guitar Hero, with an actual guitar. I started playing guitar at the time I got the first Rocksmith. Within a week,  I already had improved in my skill. I highly recommend this game to any aspiring guitarist. This game tracks your progress, how well you play, and adapts the difficulty to your skill level so you are always being pushed to do better, without having to tackle challanges that you can't succed at. You'll improve in skill while learning to play your favorite songs.TL;DRPros:Never have to tackle a challange you can't beatImprove within short amounts of timeLearn to play your favorite songs along the wayA sense of acheivementCons:Pricey cable with reliability issues (so I've heard and mine hardly lasted a year)Game seems to have a hard time detecting bendsHave to pay to import songs from the first RocksmithMy final verdicts? 9/10, highly enjoyable, highly effective, worth while for anyone who loves guitar and music.

												When I started Rocksmith, I played zero guitar.  I could do some air guitar, but that's it.  After sixty some hours, I can play some riffs, and play along to some songs, both bass and electric guitar.  I'm not a musician, but I'm learning and I'm having fun.It's not a substitute for a professional music instructor.  But, it's surprisingly good.  There are technique games for learning chords, slides, bends, etc.  There are a good number of songs included in the game, and they continue to add DLC for a wide variety of tastes and challenges.  Will I ever be a guitar god?  Clearly not.  But it's pretty cool to play something you recognize, and to start learning to play things beyond the songs.The one major downside to the game is that it does not play nice with sound cards.  I had to pull mine out and use onboard sound.  Not ideal, but solved lag and distortion issues.			",83,10,0,11,11,0,17

												As a learning tool, I must say this program has taught me about 25-33% of what I know. The rest was self taught. As muscians, we are always learning. Even if your super distracted by small children or a nagging wife. You will walk away with some kind of skill progression. I have yet to master a song yet. (Although 90% of the notes dissapear on Blitzkreig Bop for me!) Must be my Super-ADD? Squirrel!I can honestly say that I am far from a master guitarist and have a lot to learn/be desired. But for what I do know. I could stop learning right now and create a local band playing my own stuff.  This software/game is not going to turn you into Michael Angelo Batio over night. Nope Thats years of practice. You cannot walk away from this game and NOT progress.(Unless your of M.A.B. or Vai, or Malsteem, or maybe Satriani status) You get my point.Fun, sometimes repetitive, but getting over the learning curve is a very satisfying reward.*Edit:Don't expect to progress by just playing all the notes correctly. The songs move forward when you do the ""Rocksmith suggests"" criteria below each song.Yeah it seems mundane, but it is how the software knows your skill level.Riff repeater is another way to nail those hard to fret areas of a song.I myself struggle to aknowledge what ""Rocksmith suggests"" a lot of times. Once you do those little tasks, Rocksmith makes that song just a tad bit harder by adding more sections and notes/chords; challanging you, and making the songs seem new and fun again.

												The concept of this game is one I had really hoped for a long time ago when Rockband and Guitar Hero came out.  Now that it's out, I'm very happy with it.  The UI to read the music is difficult to pick up and it's not very intuitive.  That being said, it still didn't hinder me from playing it.  I am a tad disappointed in the amount of songs available.  I realize that a big part of their money making machine will be from DLCs, but the price of the DLC versus the amount of songs you get out of it isn't very well balanced.  If you want to practice your technique and learn the guitar while being engaged with music that is applicable to you, this is definitely the game for you.			",147,45,0,21,11,3,21

The tone creator and session mode are EXCELLENT! Wish it had more songs from other genres, such as country and jazz, maybe.			",10,4,0,4,2,0,2

												Wow! It is everything it promises to be. I've tried learning guitar in the past, but got discouraged by the difficulty curve and the tedium of practicing. This software makes all of it enjoyable! From the beginning you're playing along with great songs. The notes are presented on a Guitar Hero-like note highway and the dynamically adjusting difficulty adds or removes notes depending on how well you're doing. Naturally, you can scale the difficulty and speed to your level, either in sections or for the whole song. Each song has its preset guitar sounds -- modeled after the original song -- but the software allows you to customize the sound of your guitar by setting up virtual amplifiers and pedals. You can have jam sessions with a vitual band. The lessons seem to cover pretty much everything you need to know and are well presented. The mini-games for practicing guitar techniques are all fun, excpet for Gone Whaling (which is about controlling the volume of your playing).I first got a cheap guitar just to see if I can remain motivated using this software and after a month -- averaging a bit over an hour a day playing -- upgraded to a much better guitar. I'm also buying a bunch of the DLC songs. Do remember that it takes a lot of time and effort to learn to play an instrument. Maybe this software speeds up the process somewhat, but it most definitely makes it fun!			",16,1,0,0,3,0,0

												Right to start.this is a ubisoft product so there where some issues to get the game to run correctly, I had some pretty bad issues involving audio drivers and two or three days of frustration attempting to correct the problem.However once you deal with all this and get to the ""game"" it is truly a rewarding experience, Ive been a guitarist for a while this game is perfect for really experienced players and people totally new to the instrument. If you want to go hard on yourself you can also crank up the difficulty, its a good way to keep your techniques precise, efficient and satisfying to your ears.Finally there are many song packs which are DLC of course that you purchase, if you owned the previous Rocksmith and DLC for it the DLC carry's over to rocksmith 2014.

												Wanted to learn to play electric guitar for a long years ago, but i allways thought ""it is expensive (guitar and at least guitar combo) and also i fear of music theory"" so i got never started. But RS made my guitar dream come very easily. I recommend it to everyone who is interested to try play electric guitar/bass. Now after two months after my first hitting guitar string for my life i am pretty hooked (learning and jamming for about hour-twoo daily, sometimes less, sometimes more) and i know soon i will feel some urge to buy real guitar equipment or at least some guitar combo :). Another really cool thing is you can use any guitar effect/pedal with RS (i just bought wah-pedal which really broadened my possibilities to play with guitar sound).I love RockSmith! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing guitar a long time. Got this as a birthday present. I did not expect this game to be so huge.Personally I think that it would not be wise to learn guitar through this as there are some pretty important differences in playing real guitar, like the immediate effects that get thrown on there, and the fact that the sound is an usb input which means information of the signal is lost, but the game on itself is really fun to do and gave me motivation to pick up the guitar more often. Also you skip the fact that you don't have to buy a lot of expensive gear to try to immitate the sound on a record.An amazing surprise is how much effort the game put into the learning video's and especially the ""Session Mode"". This mode forces you to learn the complete neck of the guitar and has definetly improved my solo guitar sessions. My muscle  memory and finger speed have both increased because of this mode.Overall, I really enjoy the game and would definetly recommend it to guitar players who have been playing for a year or two and want to play along some great classics without too much effort.

												As for Rocksmith, so far it's done everything I've asked of it, short of giving me a real solid feel of direction. I'm probably going to regret not practicing the basic scales and chords as much, since I've been playing along with some hit songs more during my practice sessions. The fun factor for me is quite high, but I've only found annoyance with the GuitarCade mini games so far. The lessons aren't nearly as in depth and useful as I had hoped. It's also hard to gauge my progression in skill outside of each individual song. I've also noticed it may be a bit too forgiving for timing. I've been singing pseudo-professionally, and feel the timing window might leave too much leeway for folks who aren't particularly good at rhythm to begin with, not giving enough feedback to develop well. 5/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												So far, this is an excellent, robust training tool -- RS2014 provides a guided experience, but gives you tons of options to go your own way if you prefer. I'm very impressed.I got Rock Band 3's Pro Guitar peripheral when that game came out, and the difference here is striking. Rock Band's Pro Mode was an impressive achievement, but the game was organized around casual group play. That was great for the ""normal"" Rock Band instruments, but extremely awkward for anyone playing Pro Guitar or Pro Bass -- learning new songs for those players was time consuming and would hold up the group, while everyone else could jump in or out and play things at a comfortable skill level, as the game intended.RS2014, by contrast, would not be entertaining for a room full of people. And that's good. It assumes there's one person playing, and it watches them, and tries like hell to figure out how to help them learn. It's as fast or (more importantly) as slow as you need it to be, and it understands that learning an instrument is a marathon, not a sprint.I haven't used Rocksmith long enough yet to know how good it is at conferring really advanced skills. But everything I've seen up to this point has been promising -- I'm having a ton of fun, and I know I'm learning. Definitely recommended.			",212,46,3,10,17,2,16

												I honestly LOVE this game. I had tried learning the guitar before and after having the rocksmith experience I sincerely feel that the develpoers of this game came up with a fantastic learning tool for the guitar. Really great job!!! I'd love to see som improvements in terms of the steam site and the DLC. Also, i'm a big fan of the DLC, keep em coming!!! My only problem with the DLC is that the list inside my actual game is not current which is kind of annoying and the DLC page in the actual steam browser never opens up... I've purchased my DLC through the rocksmith page by scrolling down but even that list does not include all the DLC that has come out. Either way fixing it in the game i think would be best because it is easier to sort through. Also would love to see eventually Rocksmith incorporates vocals and keyboards, it's such a great way to learn and at the very least i feel that singing is an integral part of playing guitar. Anyways those are just my thoughts on how to make things a bit better but as i stated previously this is a really efficient and fun way to learn how to play the guitar!!! TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!!

I got rid of my xbox and didn't want to rebuy the game on PC right away due to some lag issues when playing on Xbox but let me tell you, 2014 is such a new experience. I'm blown away and swept back into it. My musician friends have moved away and although there is no substitution to actually playing with a band, the Session mode is quite interesting.

												This is the ultimate game for helping you to learn guitar. From basic lessons such as attaching your strap to advanced lessons such as tapping, this game has you covered. The dynamic dificulty helps you go from a beginer to an intermediate player within the space of playing in a month. It starts off with one note then levels you up accordingly to your skill level at the time. Riff repeater is a fantastic tool for helping you learn and nail that section you just can't get down, allowing you to change speed etc. With a ton of official DLC and forever expanding CDLC, you have a lot of songs to learn till your hearts content. This is the definitive game for any budding guitarist or any seasoned pro. I greatly recommend, 10/10!			",60,2,4,2,7,0,1

Posted: December 2, 2013
												I was originally a bit skeptical but as the first game has been interesitng at the very least I decided to give this one a shot.I have to say, it puts the first game to shame. I had expected them to either focus on improving the ""game"" part or simply make the game more of a digital guitar tutor; which was the primary issue with the first game as it failed to really properly do either. Instead, Rocksmith 2014 does both, and brilliantly at that.As a guitar tutor it eases you in if you are new (as it asks your skill level at the beginning) and is, unlike a human tutor, infinitely patient. As I had previous experience (including the first Rocksmith) I was able to jump right in. The lessons are much more fleshed out; with several of the techniques having several lessons and practice tracks to play to really learn the skill. Most importantly, the Learn a Song section of the game is not only accessable, lets you choose what song you want to play and learn and do it. On top of this they made the Riff Repeater simply part of the Learn a Song, so if you want to go back and retry a part you missed you can do so. Slow it down, make it easier or max it out. You can do it at your pace and really learn what you want. You can even make it mark notes you missed so on th next pass you can be on the look out for them.On the other side of the coin is the game mechanics. The first rocksmith tried to instill game mechanics through a kind of ""path"" but really all it did was restrain gameplay. Instead you have free access to every song and guitarcade game from the first moment you start the game. Not only this but they have added a ""Score Attack"" mode which approximates one of its plastic guitar forebears, but with the real thing. The guitarcade games have gotten a massive facelift as well. Most of the games in the guitarcade are not only solid but assist in developing key skills; and most of them are references to old school games (I was particularly impressed with the ""Rad Racer"" reference game Scale Racer.)  One thing I don't feel goes in game or tutor sides of the fence is the Session mode. Essentially it can be thought of as a virtual band that will jam with you. They don't follow any particular song, and neither do you. You play what you want and they will join in as their AI decided to. You choose whatever instruments you want in your band, how fast, in what scale and go. The game teaches you how to play wiht the digital band (and even how to use this with a real band) and lets you have fun playing whatever you want.It is really interesting in that you spend some time with an AI band and you can adjust your sound to match the band; or just rebuild the band, or tweak it. Granted this doesn't allow you to write songs for the band to play; but instead it is what it says, a jam session. You play what you want and the band does too, they tend to be swayed based on what you are playing but you can even take more of a back role. Turn up the volume on one of the AI members and let them do their thing.Admittedly there are some faults with the game. Firstly and most importantly, a lot of the best and most popular songs are DLC. I understand that the base game is trying to pick and choose a wide selection, but when you put the B or C lister songs from an artist in the game then put out A list songs as DLC it does feel a bit wrong. Granted you can knock this up to the song licensing company having higher costs for popular songs, but it is irritating nontheless. Another thing is that occasonally the fact that the game doesn't catch a note due to the simply the game not catching a note will happen. Occasionally you will play somehting right and the game misses it. While I don't expect the technology to be 100% perfect, it does get irritating, and is especially common on palm muted notes. Overall for the price? This game is amazing. You get a guitar tutor that is infinitely patient, willing to repeat lesson after lesson and tell you when you do things wrong. You get a long list of songs to learn, even longer if you are willing to shell out a few bucks. You get a fully fledged rythym game where you can try to go for high scores. You get a slew of practice minigames that all focus on pumping up your techniques. You get an AI Band that will play along side you.And most importantly of all, you get motivation that may not have been there before. One thing any musician will tell you is that you have to want to get better to get better; and Rocksmith 2014 provides so many reasons to practice just a bit longer that you would have to try hard *not* to get better at guitar from playing it.

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn to play guitar or bass, or also to anyone who already plays but wants a fun way to practice. The best way to advance your skill as a guitarist is to play constantly. Practice, practice, practice - With this game, you can practice all the fun licks while playing a game on Steam. What's not to like?There are a couple issues that I run into though with my guitar - it's an older Ibanez RG100, and the hardware isn't as good as it once was. I think with the lower quality/older pickups and instrument cable jack, my guitar sometimes has issues playing clear enough for the game to pick up. Often times when I try to play around the 9th-14th fret on the D string, it will tell me I miss the note when I know I'm hitting it. That's really my only issue, and it only occurs if you have an older guitar. Simple fix is to upgrade the hardware if you have the cash, or better yet: Buy a new guitar!When all is said and done, like I said at the beginning: If you want to play guitar, or if you want a fun way to practice then you should definitely buy this game. Hit songs, weekly dlc, and fun mini games really sell the game for me. I have this game on PS3 and PC both with a ton of hours between the two. It's easily worth $60.			",312,66,2,44,45,2,29

												In roughly one year I've gone from hardly knowing which end of the guitar to use to actually being able to play some tunes both on my electric guitar and my acoustic one. It probably goes without saying, but Rocksmith 2014 is the best interactive guitar tutorial out there, and I imagine it's a good heap of fun for those who play it more often than myself as well.I have so many superlatives for this game, and I haven't really found any big cons at all. The gameplay modes are both varied and intuitive, and the song library is highly relevant and ever expanding. The tunes they make available lend from all genres, from blues through mainstream rock to metal, and I've found several of my absolute rock favourites among both the included songs and the DLC.If you're looking to get more out of your electric guitar there really is no way around Rocksmith 2014. Be sure to look out for the original Rocksmith as well, it's a cheap way to expand your song library with a decent amount of tunes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome for anyone just starting out on guitar, or wanting to improve his/her skills on the instrument. So many different songs really help diversify playing and style when playing guitar not in game. So many DLCs to choose from. Lessons that really push your skills forward and make it fun to do so. The tone designer is great for getting ANY kind of sound you want out of your guitar. No more tedious scales or the same boring tone from your amp. The mini-games allow you to level up your skills in bending, string skipping, shifting, tremelo, etc. The session mode has various instruments you can play along with and almost any scale to try out. The game thinks for you and customizes missions and recommended items to help you improve. The Riff Repeater allows you to slow a segment down and really practice those hard solos and riffs. I never get bored with this game, and will often practice for 6 hours in one go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game (although more of an education tool than a game) takes the concept of gamification and successfully marries it with a hands-on guitar training program.It's like having a personal guitar teacher chained in your closet, that you can whip out whenever you feel like, for as long as you feel like. It doesn't matter if you have never touched an axe in your entire life. He will sit you down, teach you how to hold the guitar, hold the pick and he will hold your hand through the first note down to the last. He will sit through with you, as you fumble your way through lessons that you are honestly not ready to start and no matter how clumsy or oafish you are, hitting the wrong string or fret time and a time again, he. Will. Never. Lose.

												Awesome game for ""learning"" guitar. Keep in mind, while Rocksmith goes through the basics of holding the guitar, pick, how to strum, etc. you'll definitely want to look to other sources if you're serious about learning the instrument.I can say though, as someone who started never playing guitar before, that you'll at least be able to pick up new songs pretty easily after a couple months. You feel completely comfortable with the instrument, but with some basics practice, you'll get the hang of it in no time.			",204,48,1,20,15,1,6

												My Fingers hurt and I can play Paint it Black by The Rolling Stones so I assume this is working, I really wanted to buy DayZ but no, I bought this instead. I win! Buy this. F*** your DLC prices though. Seriously. I wasted 60 dollars on Boston and CCR songs and you want me to LEARN them? HELL YEAH I will. Thanks Rocksmith for your overpriced songs. I love you. I'm going to go play the DayZ ripoff H1Z1 now because i'm poor. Ripley if you're reading this I miss you. I know you're gay now and all but whenever you said you loved me, I really felt a connection, I MISS YOU. Can we make a song about my profound love? oh wait crap I have another girlfriend now don't I, well, okay, don't make it. Or if you do please make it a DLC because we love your DLC. Anybody wanna play H1Z1 with me? No? okay. Buy this game I guess. Yeah. Do it. 9 sheckles/10.			",29,1,0,1,2,0,0

												I highly recommend this game if you just want something the jam to every once and while, tighten your guitar skills, or possibly learn how to play in general. I used to play guitar in a couple different bands about a decade or so ago, even traveled the west coast playing shows and opening for some decent acts... then I went to film school, left the music behind me (fun while at lasted, lead to a lot of firsts in my life :) but never managed to sell all my old gear. I've hung onto a couple of amps, guitars with various sentimental values and rarity in the market place through several moves, but in all honestly only jamed on them a handful of times, and usually just playing the old stuff form muscle memory. Rocksmith is perfect for me with a variety of progressive difficulties, and challenges to learn new material and get outside my comfort zone. Been working too hard to play recently, but since I bought the game I've plugged in more in the last couple of months then I have in the last several years! The Mavericks bug did suck though, dragging down my ability to use the software for several weeks, took them the better part of a month the fix... guess that's what I get for jumping into a new os that hasn't been properly tested.

												I highly recommend Rocksmith to any age wanna be players. Great selection of songs to play with then of course DLC  downloadable tracks. Ive been playing on and off for years but found it increasingly diffiicult to master any of the songs I was trying to play. Couldnt afford too many lessons basically because of costs. Played with friends in my early days then found it difficult to find local people to jam with.  This ""game"" is perfect with the way it will follow your progress and increase the difficulty as you move on, heaps of reviewable options for studying each part as its brocken down.  Slow it down till you get it right then rehearse in full tempo. I wish this was around when I started It would have taken me to greater heights a whole lot earlier. UNREAL.			",2,0,0,0,3,0,0

												How do you describe a game that's not a game... or even rate it?I am a classical guitarist, but just like with my keyboards, I don't play contemporary very well.  I've tried varying things, but contemporary pieces just don't flow like non-contemporary ones to me.  My fingers just can't seem to adapt.  So I know the  techniques behind playing, and can read music.I tried Rocksmith 2012, and it was much like my other forays.  I did a bit, realized that it wasn't really helping, and dropped it.  I purchased Rocksmith 2014 on a whim on sale.  For the first time, I feel like I am learning, and picking things up.  I can play contemporary songs!  And though I haven't reached master where the fretboard disappears, I'm using it more for reference than a crutch.I think, after analyzing it, it's that the 'game' doesn't treat you like you don't know anything, and it also doesn't treat you like you know everything.  It adapts a lot better than the first.But the big thing is I'm enjoying just playing, and I don't feel incompetent in doing so.Not sure if this would work well for others that don't know anything.  Or are on varying levels of expertise.  But it seems to be working well for me.			",510,56,11,76,49,2,102

												Definitely an awesome tool to help you play, practice, and just enjoy the guitar. I started playing guitar about the same time (almost a year ago as of writing this) that I bought this game, and it's helped me extensively. The song selection is pretty good, there's lots of variety for no matter what you're into. I even discovered a few indie songs I've never heard that I actually enjoy very much. Some of the songs are more difficult, while others are a good match for even beginning players. The dynamic difficulty is a really great feature, as it really teaches you the song slowly so that you can get the hang of the structure of the song before the game unleashes all of it at you. Even if you're playing a really difficult song, you can still enjoy it and not get completely overwhelmed by it because of dynamic difficulty. Something that was useful for me when I bought the Megadeth song pack after only playing guitar for a month...Whether you prefer chords and rhythm guitar, the bass, killer solos and lead guitar, there's for everyone.The gear unlocks and progress meters on tracks really give you something to work towards. Picking up a guitar for the first time and learning the basic mechanics is a grueling process that many give up on, but the game has tutorials for everything, even things as simple as how to hold a pick, to help you through the learning curve.There's even a website with custom songs you can add into the game. I've added over a hundred custom songs I've downloaded. The vast majority of songs I've added (even lesser known ones) include rhythm, bass, and lead as do most of the ones I've seen as well.Ultimately, if you've ever wanted to learn to play the guitar or bass, I recommend this game extensively. Even if you already know how to play, whether exceptionally well, or pretty mediocre, there really is something for everyone here. As a guitarist, this is easily the best game I own, and the most value for my money.			",155,19,0,5,7,1,8

												A superb way to learn your way past the worst part about playing guitar; learning the basics.However, this game doesn't come with all the tools you'll need in order to learn some of the toughest songs it has on offer, including several that are part of the base game (they've got Joe Satriani on here). Be prepared to use other resources to further your learning wherever this game falls short.			",79,15,0,9,15,0,6

												Ive been playing guitar for many years but could never really get much better by reading peoples crappy tabs and watching youtube videos and such. I decided to give rocksmith a try and almost immediately i learned a bunch of new techniques as well as the correct way to play lots of songs. Its almost overwhelming the amount of content there is available. The only complaint i have is having to watch a pile of video lessons that were the basics of guitar playing, stuff i learned long ago.			",2,0,0,2,2,0,0

												9/10 The mechanics of the game are spot on, the way the menu smoothly flows and the game encorages you to keep playing is great. The only downside to the game is that it doesnt teach you the aspects of timing very well, which makes jumping from the game to an actual band difficult.			",73,17,2,8,5,4,5

												If you are just starting out trying to learn guitar, I would definitely recommend this game. I have played it and learned some really fun songs - like Hysteria by Muse - my daughtera nad even my 6 year old nephew have played the skill games and find them fun. HIghly recommed - would like for them to include drums/vocals - allow a real 'Rock Band' experience on the PC.			",5,6,0,4,4,0,6

												This game (although more of an education tool than a game) takes the concept of gamification and successfully marries it with a hands-on guitar training program.It's like having a personal guitar teacher chained in your closet, that you can whip out whenever you feel like, for as long as you feel like. It doesn't matter if you have never touched an axe in your entire life. He will sit you down, teach you how to hold the guitar, hold the pick and he will hold your hand through the first note down to the last. He will sit through with you, as you fumble your way through lessons that you are honestly not ready to start and no matter how clumsy or oafish you are, hitting the wrong string or fret time and a time again, he. Will. Never. Lose. Patience.In one week I have learned more than I honestly believed I could ever learn with a guitar.If you want to learn to play as well and you don't get this game, then you are stupid for it.Get it!

												Definitely an awesome tool to help you play, practice, and just enjoy the guitar. I started playing guitar about the same time (almost a year ago as of writing this) that I bought this game, and it's helped me extensively. The song selection is pretty good, there's lots of variety for no matter what you're into. I even discovered a few indie songs I've never heard that I actually enjoy very much. Some of the songs are more difficult, while others are a good match for even beginning players. The dynamic difficulty is a really great feature, as it really teaches you the song slowly so that you can get the hang of the structure of the song before the game unleashes all of it at you. Even if you're playing a really difficult song, you can still enjoy it and not get completely overwhelmed by it because of dynamic difficulty. Something that was useful for me when I bought the Megadeth song pack after only playing guitar for a month...Whether you prefer chords and rhythm guitar, the bass, killer solos and lead guitar, there's for everyone.The gear unlocks and progress meters on tracks really give you something to work towards. Picking up a guitar for the first time and learning the basic mechanics is a grueling process that many give up on, but the game has tutorials for everything, even things as simple as how to hold a pick, to help you through the learning curve.There's even a website with custom songs you can add into the game. I've added over a hundred custom songs I've downloaded. The vast majority of songs I've added (even lesser known ones) include rhythm, bass, and lead as do most of the ones I've seen as well.Ultimately, if you've ever wanted to learn to play the guitar or bass, I recommend this game extensively. Even if you already know how to play, whether exceptionally well, or pretty mediocre, there really is something for everyone here. As a guitarist, this is easily the best game I own, and the most value for my money.			",155,19,0,5,7,1,8

												You're going to read tons of negative reviews saying ""I've played guitar for x amount of years and (negative remark)"" just because this is a different way to learn. Well I've played guitar for 10 years with 5 years lessons and I can tell you that this game can teach you everything an instructor can teach you as long as you're dedicated to it. The one thing it doesn't teach you is how to read tabs, but that is super easy and rocksmith kind of prepares you for that. Scales, chords, bends, harmonics, vibrato; all the techniques are in here and they have lessons on how to properly use them and give you feedback on if you are doing them right.  The riff repeater is extremely useful as well and much less annoying than the original rocksmith repeater that would restart you ever time you missed one note.Overall I think Ubisoft actually did something really cool for once, (the cable is a little BS since you can buy a generic one at a music store for like 10 bucks but still cant use it because I guess cable drm is a thing now), I really hope this game inspires novice guitar players to continue working towards their goals.

												I've been playing Rocksmith for 3 years now. I went into the game having given up on ever learning to play the guitar after failing miserably years before. When I saw Rocksmith for the first time I thought “Hey, I like Guitar Hero. And always thought it would be cool if you could play it with an actual guitar; might as well give it a try"". I was hooked from the start. The lessons made it easy for me to get the basics, and the wide selection of great songs made it hard for me to stop even when my fingers were so tired and sore I could hardly play. The biggest surprise for me was seeing how much improvement I made without really trying to. I seems like I just play around, not taking anything too seriously, and I just get better and better. After 3 years I've by no means master the guitar, but I can definitely play it, with or without Rocksmith.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you can get it on sale, please do because downloads can start adding up fast.   But all worth it.  This game gets incredibly difficult after a while, so you need to keep practicing (lot of work).

												Plug in your guitar, learn to play songs. Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.It should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.			",101,27,1,10,2,2,8

However, IMHO, some music in the game sucks, but it has great hits like Pour Some Sugar On Me, Aces High, Peace of Mind, No More Mr.Nice Guy, The Trooper, Round'n'Round, Losing My Religion, Rock And Roll All Nite, I Believe In The Thing Called Love(that's all, I think).Also, in my country it's such a rare game, so I was so glad to recieve.Okay.

												This game is excellent. I have been self-taught and playing guitar by tab for years. I could usually select any tab and make my way through it. This game finally introduced me to the theory side of music. **However, this game introduced me to theory by showing me new chords and new progressions/scales - I still had to take the time and learn a good chunk of the theory on the side. The difference... this game finally inspired me to do so!! I knew I had to understand these things to be a successful guitar player and Rocksmith ENCOURAGES you!!The layout/interface of the game and the options it gives you are phenomenal. Sometimes I find it annoying playing one note every 5 seconds in ""Learn a Song"" but Rocksmith quickly realizes you can handle it and adds more. Just wishing there was an option to get more notes/chords right away without having to use riff repeater to cheat the system.Overall, this game is great for any level of guitar player (simply learning a song - beginner/intermediate, to playing session mode for hours trying new lead licks or creating new music - advanced).

												Okay...review in progress. Also: first-time ever guitar player (using nothing but this and a cheap guitar called fazley). Learning guitar is obviously not easy and my guitar hero skills don't apply (alas :P ), so...Now I'm at 70 hours. This went straight up to my most played steam game, and no sign of stopping (I haven't even played all songs or lessons yet). Played for about 60 days, more or less every day. Have I improved? Obviously. Do I have fun? Pretty much the entire time. Have I learned to play the guitar? Of course not. Playing an instrument isn't a ""you can or you can't"" thing. It's about practice, practice and more practice. The thing is not to have it become a chore or hitting a wall. Without testing other means of learning to play it's hard to guess, but I think this does a great job of keeping things fresh and always having something for you to work on that's within your grasp. That, perhaps more than anything else, makes this something worth getting even for non-gamers.(older review)At this point (40 hours in), I can't but agree with all the other reviewers that it's a solid must buy (at least for absolute beginners). It may require some searching and tinkering, but there is always something to improve that isn't outside your (limited) expertise. Be it repeating that riff from Hey ya or paint it black, or just trying songs or guitarcade games or even practicing the tracks from the lessons.I'm not sure about other guitar learning software, but at least this does a great job of making your guitar skills measurable.Becoming good at guitar is still FAR outside my grasp, and that ""60 days to learn guitar"" seems awfully optimistic to me (I'm about halfway in days), but I'm still having at least as fun as the first hours (just kidding: it's actually far more fun).(even older review):I'm about 14 hours in, and still loving it. And that's rather amazing, as I just keep repeating the few lessons and guitarcade games I'm somewhat familiar with in order to not screw up. At this pace, it'll be 100'000 hours before I mastered all lessons, minigames and songs, but I'm having fun while doing it.Obviously, I'm not very far and anything involving bending or above is still way above me (I'm currently focussing on finding the right frets and strumming correctly). But at this time, I can say that the game certainly doesn't make you feel dumb when you're busy attempting things.Thus far no criticism. It's still way too early to tell if this guitar will end up collecting dust or that it'll sill be touching the thing two months from now. But I SERIOUSLY doubt that'll be because of Rocksmith 2014. :-)			",378,123,7,30,42,4,64

												I personally have a difficult time learning music others have written from sheets of paper.  I don't always understand the speed I need to play at, the way it is strummed, etc.  Having started appreciating guitar more from back when Rock Band was new, and countless hours with friends playing that and Guitar Hero 3, I was excited for Rocksmith.  But this is Rocksmith 2014, so I'll talk about it.This game improves on its initial release.  You have access to all the old songs, but now they are less simplified, closer to the actual song.  There is more variety for playing chords, again, closer to the actual songs (probably spot-on).  I can now play REAL music and still have little colored shapes going across the screen.  The game has improved my ability to spot-read, and because I'm using a real guitar and don't just have to get it ""close-enough,"" it encourages me to actually practice the songs slowly so I KNOW what I'm actually playing.  I find myself actually playing bits of my favorite songs, even without the game, making it far more useful than my hours of Rock Band playing.  ^_^With the wide selection of DLC, I can still play many of those old songs for real now.  If I have any issues, they are relatively small.  First, playing Bass on here is terrible.  The system has the hardest time in the world registering that I have played notes in normal tuning.  It's far worse in Drop D, and  I have yet to find the ""sweet spot"" I need to have my finger in to get it to understand I'm playing F instead of .847E#/F...  I have a bass guitar and still feel like I have to practice it without Rocksmith because it's just no fun if you're hitting all the notes and it tells you contrary.  Equally, the game has trouble registering notes on regular guitar the lower I tune.  Drop D is tough sometimes, but it seems if I put my finger closer to the fret, it registers fine.  Eb has been alright.  But going into Drop C territory for Skillet and A Day to Remember has been the worst.  Most of the time I end up frustrated that I sound fine on the actual instrument, but it's not good enough for the game.  Last time I tried to play, I played very soft...the opposite of how heavy, deep, metal songs are supposed to be played, I thought, and it registered just fine.  Maybe I just need control.So for anyone wanting to learn how to play guitar for real and still have fun (yes, there are fun arcade games, though a very different lineup from the original Rocksmith...how I miss baseball...) this is the ""game"" for you.  At first, your fingers are going to have to get used to this because it IS work, and it is playing Real guitar, but after you build up callouses, you're on your way to sheetless rocking!  I have no regrets.			",172,58,2,56,18,2,9

												This is an amazing way to learn the guitar, it's taken me from not knowing how to properly hold a guitar to being able to play the basic chords, play parts of leads and hold down sections involving multiple strings. Let me just list down stuff that other reviews might have missed, especially the ones that someone just starting out would want to know1. No need to get an expensive electric guitar, i've been using a signature guitar (Rs 3500) and a humbucker type pickup (Rs. 650) to play this. It's not the best way but it'll still get you started 2. Constant updates: Team Rocksmith (RS) is continually rolling out improvements and new songs for this. At about Rs. 180 per song it might seem steep but compare that against taking proper guitar classes. 3. Broad range of stuff: Formal guitar classes mostly focused on getting me to learn a particular song. If you follow the RS missions they'll take you from songs, to learning scales, to learning techniques like bends (each of which has its own game that you can play while training your fingers) to various tuning styles of the guitar. It's more holistic than just being able to repeat a bunch of songs 4. Takes the boredom out of practicing: the point at which most people leave the guitar is the long hours spent training your fingers to move on the frets. It tedious, repetitive and there seems to be no improvement taking place. Rocksmith makes that fun by giving crazy arcade games, easy versions of songs, score challenges etc. You'll play it for the fun and sense of accomplishment while learning all the key skills 5. It's not a perfect solution: You'll still need to visit websites/youtube etc to get more info on the basics. It won't teach you to read tablature (tabs) that real guitarists use to learn songs. People will tell you to learn the basic chords first (A, E, D, B, C) but Rocksmith seems to favor power chords. But it'll help you learn, it'll help you stick to the guitar when you would've grown bored and left it, and then one day you'll be a guitarist my son			",22,7,2,4,4,0,0

Guitar Hero but with a real guitar!Rocksmith 2014 is an excellent piece of software that I really love. This easily goes on my favorite games list. It is the second installment of the Rocksmith series; the first game released in 2012. The new 2014 version has improved a lot from it's previous game.I picked this up with 0% skills and barely touched a guitar before. By the time of writing this I have 140 hours on records and without a doubt improved a lot. I remember when I downloaded ""Take It Or Leave It"" by The Strokes and tried to play I barely could keep up with the song and eventually miss a lot of notes, but now I can get above 90% accuracy in it. There are countless of DLC for R14 mostly for about €2,99. A must have is Cherub Rock by The Smashing Pumpkins because that allows you to download free custom DLC made by other people. Customsforge[customsforge.com] is the main website where you can get your favorite songs for free.Aside from the game you need a guitar obviously and Ubisoft's Rocksmith Real Tone Cable which works with all consoles, both R14 and it's predecessor. It is basically a 1/4 jack plug[i.imgur.com] to USB. The cable was pretty hard for me to get because I don't live in the USA so the store I bought it from had to wait for a new batch to arrive which took approximately one month.Happy shredding!

												EDITED: Updated the review to account for the new 'Remastered' versionThis is a fantastic game to get if you are looking for something to suppliment your practice routine with. I would still recommend using lessons from elsewhere too since there are aspects of playing that Rocksmith does not address. However, if used as part of a practice routine it is just fantastic. Personally I use this most evenings, having a quick 30 min playing session to random songs for a warm up, and then spending another 30 or so mins working on a particular song that I would like to memorise. It's just a really great way to add some fun stuff to your practice routine, and given the variety of music on offer, chances are you'll be playing stuff you might not otherwise look at. Just this evening I went from playing My Chemical Romance, to some classic blues, onto a couple of disco songs including ""Good Times"" and then finished my session with a quick crack at Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold. Pros:+ Gets you playing along with music from the start which is THE way to learn to play+ Has a very good range of tracks in the base pack, with loads of more on offer via the first game and DLC+ The tracks have a good range of difficulties - even a total beginner will find stuff that is manageable+ The Riff Repeater is great for practicing the tricky sections of songs+ Very little lag when used with a proper set-up (i.e. dedicated A/V rather than HDMI)+ Nice range of basic lessons to help beginning players get a feel for their instrument+ Now has very good search options making it easy to find tracks even if you have lots of DLC+ New interface in song-mode is much easier to use+ Riff Repeater now feels super-slick with mouse-based interface.Cons- Guitarcadce games are a gimmic best avoided- The note-recognition is a bit sloppy - you can play quite poorly and still get 100% on a song- Some of the menu design is a bit of a messAll in all, I really recommend this game to anyone interested in playing guitar or bass. Speaking from the bass side of things, we get the full deal too. Bass is offered for every track in the game, and there are some really interesting parts there. This is great since I had feared that bass would be somewhat of an afterthought. Kudos to the devs for making it a full featured part of the game.			",230,38,3,32,35,5,64

												Before I bought this game, I was already a good guitar player. Not great, but I certainly knew how to play. At first, I struggle with the game because of the layout of the tabs. These are vertical instead of horizontal, but after a couple of plays I managed to memorize the colors of the strings. The lessons are very good. They are very clear on how they teach and they are totally optional.The Soundtrack for the game is solid. I think there were some better songs that would have fit in the game instead of others. I wish there were more, but the dlc seems to take care of that. I wish the develepors wouldn't just have over $1000 worth of dlc and instead offer more songs at the start.The customization of amps, effects, pedals, etc. is amazing. I have spent plenty of time just messing around with various effects trying to get one that sounds kickass! If you aren't looking for that deep of an experience, Rocksmith gives you the option to choose a songs effect instead of making your own from scratch.The games are fun for a little bit, but I found myself going back to songs.Overall: 9/10The only problems I had with the game were problems with bends during songs as they would not count.LESS DLC... MORE STARTING SONGS!			",96,10,5,20,22,2,9

												As someone who's been playing guitar for almost 20 years, I was excited to get my hands on Rocksmith. I've got plenty of good things to say and one very bad thing, so here goes: If you're a beginner who's never even held a guitar and just want to get a solid basis for building skills and having fun at playing, this is an awesome tool. If you're more seasoned like myself, this is a great way to get consistent practice and improve on techniquest that may have needed work or have gone sloppy over the years. I LOVE the Guitarcade. And the songs in this game are all pretty good (Muse--f*ck yeah!)The bad? If you're used to playing from tablature, the way that Rocksmith wants you to play is infuriating. Instead of common tab view, which is looking down at a fretboard, Rocksmith has you looking THROUGH the fretboard, which turns out to be counter-intuitive when you consider that almost all tab and instructional books/DVDs have it the traditional top-down method. Not only that, but RS refers to the thinnest string as ""the sixth string"", and goes up from there, calling the bass string the ""first"". Again, counter-intuitive if you've ever opened a pack of strings and read what they actually call them. Hint: The ""first"" is not the bass.Despite that glaring issue, this game is an awesome value and great tool. With the amount of actual instruction RS has to offer as well as good gameplay and great music, you really can't go wrong. Get us some cheaper DLCs and we'll be all set. :)			",138,51,4,10,22,0,8

												Okay...review in progress. Also: first-time ever guitar player (using nothing but this and a cheap guitar called fazley). Learning guitar is obviously not easy and my guitar hero skills don't apply (alas :P ), so...Now I'm at 70 hours. This went straight up to my most played steam game, and no sign of stopping (I haven't even played all songs or lessons yet). Played for about 60 days, more or less every day. Have I improved? Obviously. Do I have fun? Pretty much the entire time. Have I learned to play the guitar? Of course not. Playing an instrument isn't a ""you can or you can't"" thing. It's about practice, practice and more practice. The thing is not to have it become a chore or hitting a wall. Without testing other means of learning to play it's hard to guess, but I think this does a great job of keeping things fresh and always having something for you to work on that's within your grasp. That, perhaps more than anything else, makes this something worth getting even for non-gamers.(older review)At this point (40 hours in), I can't but agree with all the other reviewers that it's a solid must buy (at least for absolute beginners). It may require some searching and tinkering, but there is always something to improve that isn't outside your (limited) expertise. Be it repeating that riff from Hey ya or paint it black, or just trying songs or guitarcade games or even practicing the tracks from the lessons.I'm not sure about other guitar learning software, but at least this does a great job of making your guitar skills measurable.Becoming good at guitar is still FAR outside my grasp, and that ""60 days to learn guitar"" seems awfully optimistic to me (I'm about halfway in days), but I'm still having at least as fun as the first hours (just kidding: it's actually far more fun).(even older review):I'm about 14 hours in, and still loving it. And that's rather amazing, as I just keep repeating the few lessons and guitarcade games I'm somewhat familiar with in order to not screw up. At this pace, it'll be 100'000 hours before I mastered all lessons, minigames and songs, but I'm having fun while doing it.Obviously, I'm not very far and anything involving bending or above is still way above me (I'm currently focussing on finding the right frets and strumming correctly).

												More than a game - can be classed as a teaching tool as well. Huge, HUGE improvement over the first Rocksmith game in just about every way possible. This is the best way for beginners to learn guitar with its many lessons while keeping it fun at the same time - also great for intermediate to advanced guitarists looking to improve or touch up on their skills. The mini games are also a huge plus. They are basically lessons for scales, chords, slides and bends disguised as little arcade games. What other games make you say you played a beat 'em up with your guitar while learning scales at the same time? Exactly. Session mode is a lot of fun as well. Pick your AI band's instruments, the complexity of the jam, a genre, hell, faff around with pretty much anything, and start shredding. The band plays along with you. You'll feel like a rockstar in no time! Fantastic way of learning how to improvise as well - especially when you feel confident enough to add mini solos for the hell of it. Great feeling!That's not to say there's a couple of (minor) cons with this game. Sometimes the game crashes when picking a song or going to riff repeater, but it happens very rarely now. Also, the note detection, especially for power chords (for me, anyway) can be a little iffy. Also the in-game tuner is a little... whack. Get yourself a chromatic tuner, go with what the game says and then retune it yourself. Don't let this deter you from an absolutely amazing experience though. These are just the small problems I personally have with the game.All in all... worth it. So worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty fun. I haven't been plagued by the technical issues some people seem to have so for me technically it all work well.As someone who used to play guitar , I think its a great addition to your practice routine. When you feel tired and want to put your guitar down this game will make you feel like going on a bit and play just a little longer.  I am not sure about the claims of fastest way to learn guitar. If they wanted to make it a learning tool they would have to beef up the learning section with more exercise games. They have these arcade games which are supposed to help you improve your technique BH it I cant stand them i would rather have more straight up exercises like they have in the lessons but with more depth.

												Insanely good game (can you really call it a game, it is more like a personal trainer) for learning the guitar and having fun while doing so.If you supplement this game with youtube videos explaining basics and proper technique, you are really getting the entire package.The songs are great, and you can buy DLC with all of your favourite bands (mostly).All in all a huge thumbs up from me.

												I've been using Rocksmith since the first version came out for the PC. This is definitely the best way to build your ""chops"" without paying for weekly guitar lessons. The ONLY negative I can think of regarding Rocksmith is that it doesn't teach anything about musical notation or reading sheet music, but how many rock musicians do you see on stage with a music stand and sheet music? :D			",29,5,0,10,3,0,4

												I've been playing these games since 2014 and I am STILL buying new songs. Highly recommend. SO much fun and an easy way to always be practicing bass/guitar.Recent updates have made recognizing non-E standard songs even easier. I used to have a major problem with my bass being recognized as playing the proper notes but it's become much easier to play these songs after the remastered version has been released. Ubisoft is incredible for improving Rocksmith 2014 and instead of releasing a new game, they released the improvements for FREE to everyone that already had 2014.			",108,21,1,4,7,0,5

												This game/learning tool is amazing. I had played guitar for years prior to purchasing this, but have always had difficulty learning full songs. This game with the riff repeater option has changed all that. prosI play on a mac and it works flawlessly with no lag during complex songs.You can change speed at which to play along withchoose your own path of lead or backup you can focus on one section of a song or lead or a few sections at your own pace in the riff repeateryou can change the difficulty and have less notes to start out with and ease your way in (caution though, as sometimes you will want to put the difficulty up higher than you can play in order to understand the best finger positioning for a certain chord or riff)intuitive on screen display allows you to play without reading music or tablatureyour gaming addiction will now actually give you a tangeable skill! DLC is forward compatible from the original version, so the song list is pretty robust. Just try to remember the game is called ROCKsmith, so there is lots of rock songs and metal songs, but not a lot of country or jazz.consthe steam version does not come with the rocksmith cable, which is required, proprietary, and costly. Any old midi cable will not do. Even if you have an electric or an electric acoustic guitar or bass...you will not be able to just buy this game from steam and be able to play. YOU MUST ALSO BUY THE CABLE!!! so I bought the game on sale for 10 bucks but still had to pay $30 for the cable, which took my broke♥♥♥♥♥months to actually buy. My advice is to wait for a sale on amazon or something and buy the game and cable together.other thoughtsThe mini games are hit and miss, with some being enjoyable and others not so much.some of these games have a hard time if your guitar's intonation is off, so yu may need to have it adjusted. My guitar has some intonation that is pretty bad, but for the most part in songs it still works perfectly....one or two of the minigames are unplayable...but that is my gear and not the games fault.there is a ""session mode"" which allows you to use preset jams to practice scales over, with a difficulty setting to even allow playing over changes and improvising. Buy the Ronda alla turca DLC from Mozart....it is so fun and if you ever get it down including the solo...you will feel great pride!I honestly wish this game was available 20 years ago. I strongly urge you to get this game for yourself...or anyone in your life who wants to learn or improve their guitar skills.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great, and from it, I have actually learned to play the guitar! There is a huge community out there where people have developed thousands of songs (check customsforge) to play. I think having that community has made the game even more fun, given I can play artist I like, along with the 50 or so songs that came with the game. It will show you technique and stuff, and although its not as good as a real teacher, it sure is pretty good!			",56,6,12,12,37,0,10

												Absolutely love this game and the possibility's it opens for future musicians as they learn from today's great hit to those classics from yesteryear. 100% must have if your child is interested in bass or guitar. It will keep them more interested than that book, and or the instructor can at times by just making it plain old fun to play with no pressure whenever you want. I was nothing more than a vocalist and songwriter with very little ability when I got this and now I am a musician as well able to get the music out of my head instead of relying on another musician entirely like in the past. I still have a long road ahead in learning to flow live with seasoned musicians but I am branching out to do so and without Rocksmith I would have never got this far in such a short time due to my busy life and mass hobbies/study's. Hoping to release a few songs I am creating later this year and that in itself feels simply amazing.I need them to make a Drumsmith & Keysmith or Midismith as well for my other beginning study's I have taken up in the past few years.100% my favorite game			",90,10,6,2,12,0,7

Product received for free
												I obtained this game on Christmas, and I can truly say that it has helped me learn guitar a lot more than i could ever imagine. I already have around 25-30% mastery score on most songs. This game is extremely fun, and i very much recommend this game. I dont feel like i'm struggling and slowly learning, it just feels like im having fun playing guitar. Even though I am absolutely HORRENDOUS at guitar, I somehow still feel awesome while trying to play. XD although i sometimes get frustrated at trying to play songs, its still incredibly fun.The only problem i have with this game is... the DLC. oh man, the DLC song prices... For some song packs with 3-5 songs, they charge 7-10$ for it. And for specific single songs that you know and love and would like to play, They cost 3$ to buy. In my opinion, this is a bit pricy. Around $1 or maybe $1.50 would be sufficient. For some people, this may not be a problem, but for me it is.Pros:Good Song ListGood TutorialsNice, non-confusing Note TrackTeaches how to play guitar fast (at least for me)Incredibly easy to set up (need Real Tone Cable)Anything else that i cant think ofCons:DLC PricesCouldnt (yet) figure out how to get CDLC (customs)P.S yeah i know i have to get Cherub Rock, did that, and the customs appear in game, but they wont run8.5/10			",50,12,0,3,6,0,2

												Have played guitar a long time. Gotta say this could be very good for a beginner if they use their ears and refuse to cheat. This wont teach you how to sound good but it will teach you what notes to hit when and give you the tools to play crisply. What it won't do is give you the skills to either listen to a song on your own and learn to play it or to read tab - but then thats not its goal. Its to get you functional at playing covers of the songs in the library - which really isnt extensive - however it does this REALLY well. Its obvious that a ton of work has been put into breaking these songs into meaningful increments of difficulty. There is a hack on github to get a usb DAC working so cable isnt required. The songs that are broken down on here seem to be done well though - just a shame there arn't more. Wish i had this 12 years ago ;)			",73,11,0,6,6,0,13

												Makes playing guitar alone A LOT more fun. Weekly DLC is a big plus. Dynamic difficulty works fine most of the time but can be a bit easy on tracks you haven't played before. Multiplayer is awesome when it works, but audio lag just keeps stacking until it becomes unplayable. Not being able to download a profile from a friend is a huge bummer, and creating a profile for them to be able to join multiplayer is a hassle.Recomended if you can play a little guitar or bass and what to make playing alone fun.

Well, this game isn't quite the same kind of arcade-y fun as guitar hero, but you're actually learning to play real songs on a real guitar which is amazing.Like I said, I haven't gotten a whole lot of time in the game yet, but I can already see that a lot of care went into setting up the songs so that the difficulty could gradually increase while the work done on ""easy"" mode could still provide benefit as the difficulty increases. It's not perfect, sometimes it'll count notes as ""missed"" that I'm sure I hit properly, but not really give any feedback as to why they counted as a miss.  But, I'm working through that stuff.Song selection is pretty broad and it seems like there's lots of options for all levels of ability.So if you liked guitar hero but wish it was helping you play your actual guitar, then buy this game.  Note that you gotta buy the cable- it turned out that the cheapest way for me to get the cable was to buy a bundle for a console... so instead of buying the cable by itself, I saved a few bucks by buying the xbox 360 bundle on sale on Amazon.  So be on the lookout for those kinds of deals, I think it'll be nice to be able to play at home on my console but also on the go on my laptop.			",72,11,0,8,9,0,23

												A fun and decent learning tool for any beginning electric guitarist. The game has a lot of potential for customisation of the sound of your guitar, a bunch of different modes that focus on training particular guitar techniques, and there are a ton of songs available to play along to (including the ability to import custom songs people have made).The only downside I found to this game was trying to find a real tone cable available for sale. I got fairly lucky and found one one a trading site rather cheap, but depending on where you live this may be quite a difficult item to come by.			",195,6,8,20,9,0,11

It makes learning to play effortless. On top of its more responsive tones, it has a extrodinary line up of songs for every kind of genre of music.

												If you used to play Rockband / Guitar Hero Like I did, and you wonder if you could play a real guitar or bass, buy this game/ learning tool. For me Rocksmith has a dual purpose: 1) Use it to learn Guitar and have a lot of fun doing it. I don't feel that RS can turn you into an amazing guitarist because it really doesn't teach much music theory or much technique, but it is a lot of fun and will encourage you to improve your skills in and out of the game. 2) This can also become a great party game since you can hook up a mic and even have 2 ppl on instruments simultaneously. I usually kick back a few beers while playing, and I have a blast doing it. If you treat this game only as a party game, you probably won't see much improvement in your skills, because you really need to practice daily if possible.If you've been kicking around the idea of buying RS, I would recommend you do so, just be sure to get the real tone cable   before you buy the steam version.

												Amazing game for learning to play guitar if you don't feel like taking lessons. For the best experience do combine this game with actual lessons so you don't teach yourself bad habits/techniques. This game made me learn to play guitar from scratch. I'm still somewhat a beginner but that's because of the little amount of time I put into improving my guitarplay. Getting good with an instrument that requires precision takes much more time than your avarage videogame. Keep in mind that you'll have to buy a rocksmith realtone cable to play this game. It really sucks to buy one individually so I recommend you buy the game+cable edition online (not on steam). Great game, minimal lag (still noticable though, but waaaaaaaaaay better than rocksmith 1), buy it if you don't want to end up in your fifties thinking ""I should have learned to play the guitar""			",52,3,1,1,3,0,3

												If you're doing your first steps on playing a guitar or if you are already a player, this can make you good in a very short time, by allowing an ever evolving interaction that drives you forward and tests your limits. In about six months I went from zero until being able to play the most known riff from rolling stones ""I can't get no satisfaction"" without many hick-ups. That along with 23 other songs I play regularly. I cannot recommend this game enough, if you want to learn guitar, become good fast, or even practice your skills, this game is most definitelly for you!			",5,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Alright, after 600 hours of play time I think that it's time I endorse this program.  I love this.  It is the epitomy of an ideal ""game-ification"" of an often times tedious chore of practicing an instrument.  With that said, this isn't a product for everyone.  If you are looking for the fun silly party game that was Rock Band or Guitar hero you will be seriously dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you sat down and mastered expert mode and played guitar hero for countless hours on your own so that you could say you beat Reverend Horton Heat's song with 5 stars then you will find Rocksmith to be an utter joy.  What Rocksmith is: The perfect practice tool.  Guitarists of all skill levels will find satisfaction in either the freestyle session mode where you can have a band back you up while you jam, learning to master lynard skynard's grueling runs or expanding your skill set in the guitarcade.  The DLC offers an genuinely insane amount of songs and there is enough there to sample virtually all styles of rock. What Rocksmith isn't: Something that anyone can pick up and enjoy in 10 minutes.  The guitar interface isn't entirely intuitive and just like learning to read music and tabs you have to learn how to read the guitar promts as well.  It works wonderfully, but honestly there is a pretty substantial learning curve.  It also isn't really something that you are going to enjoy with many other people.  If you shell out and get a second cord then you and a buddy can play, but still this is generally a solitary experience.  There is no online mode.So you think you're in? Buy the game and pick up the cord from amazon. Good luck and have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing guitar for about 9, maybe 10 years now and the biggest problem I've had is finding motivation to practise and learning tricky songs. Rocksmith manages to get rid of both problems for me. I've not had this much fun playing guitar since I started, it's 'note progression' system makes learning difficult or tricky songs incredibly easy and it progresses at your level, and even if you can't keep up you can simply pull it back a few stages to a level you can keep up with. It's helped me to learn songs I've loved for a very long time and failed to learn such as Electric Eye by Judas Priest (DLC song), Fear of the Dark by Iron Maiden (DLC song), Knights of Cydonia by Muse and Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard. It also gives you the option to learn the bass, lead or rhythm sections of each song allowing you to choose what you want to focus more on per song.To sum up, whether you're new to playing guitar, or you've been playing for years or even if you're looking for your first lesson, Rocksmith can definitely help you out, and I'd reccomend this to anyone with an interest in playing guitar.

												Was a christmas gift with the cable.  It makes understanding and learning everything about a guitar, bass, drums etc FUN!  I used to goof around with a bass many moons ago. When I picked this up and played for a little over an hour, I had learned so much it was very enjoyable and suprising.  I was doing basic and had completed two songs with over 90%.  Also a bunch of ""side"" games to learn more about the guitar and techniques.  Couldn't do it on your own or just get frustrated?

												TL;DR a 5/5.  DO NOT WAIT.Yes it will be on sale for the winter and summer sales - for @ $10,  I regret every season I didn't purchase.  I would be so much farther along in my lessons by now.  The $30 I saved, is nothing compared to the comprehension of music that I could have absorbed by now...Disclaimer:  I am 'musically challenged'.  I am just being introduced to most of these concepts for the first time.That being said - this program is NOT just 'I wann learn a Nirvana song...'  This program teaches you basic music theory, session jamming, structured lessons, a chord reference, and some really top-notch games.The games are REALLY impressive.  Not just rote tools for muscle memory.  Each game is extracted from a classic genre, and really brings a great flavor to the practice you need.As you progress, the game gifts you with more songs, virtual tones, virtual equipment, the list is almost endless.  Additionally, the community is excellent - there is an official live stream STILL on every Thursday.  Plus additional songs come out all the time.If you have ANY interest in learning guitar - BUY THIS NOW.(Oct 2016 - ReMastered just hit, it is even BETTER - Just DO IT)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for learning to play the Guitar. I would recommend that you also get lessons at the same time as this will speed up your learning. Also having a tutor has taught me a lot about the bad habits I had picked up which isn't some think I could have learnt from this game such as proper thumb and hand placement, how to improve switching between chords and more. I have played this game now with three different guitars and not had an issue.The riff repeater is a wonderful tool which helps you to conquer the parts of a song where you get stuck and another great feature is the guitar arcade with games such as star chords which have been fun, challenging and helped me progress my chrod switching and has taught me some more chords. I can't think of anything negative to say about this game. The only thing is before buying this game you have to know that you won't be instantly good and you have to practice in order to get good.

												Overall it's a great way to have some fun playing with a guitar, even if you have no prior experiences.  You will want to look into CDLC or else you might get bored with the limited selection.Also, they don't really update these games aside from releasing more songs you can buy, so when you run into something that annoys you you're stuck with it until they make the next version of Rocksmith. Feels more like a console game than a PC game in that way.EDIT: see comments for a link about RockSmith2014 Remastered edition. Sounds like they are giving us a 'core game' update. But with that said there isnt really any competition making this the best of its kind. My only complaints are things like not enough minigames, not enough options for sorting songs and making playlists, and just some general interfacing issues.  The core gameplay itself is still really solid.			",108,6,2,1,5,0,15

												I've been playing guitar for about 9, maybe 10 years now and the biggest problem I've had is finding motivation to practise and learning tricky songs. Rocksmith manages to get rid of both problems for me. I've not had this much fun playing guitar since I started, it's 'note progression' system makes learning difficult or tricky songs incredibly easy and it progresses at your level, and even if you can't keep up you can simply pull it back a few stages to a level you can keep up with. It's helped me to learn songs I've loved for a very long time and failed to learn such as Electric Eye by Judas Priest (DLC song), Fear of the Dark by Iron Maiden (DLC song), Knights of Cydonia by Muse and Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard. It also gives you the option to learn the bass, lead or rhythm sections of each song allowing you to choose what you want to focus more on per song.To sum up, whether you're new to playing guitar, or you've been playing for years or even if you're looking for your first lesson, Rocksmith can definitely help you out, and I'd reccomend this to anyone with an interest in playing guitar.

Product received for free
												Was a christmas gift with the cable.  It makes understanding and learning everything about a guitar, bass, drums etc FUN!  I used to goof around with a bass many moons ago. When I picked this up and played for a little over an hour, I had learned so much it was very enjoyable and suprising.  I was doing basic and had completed two songs with over 90%.  Also a bunch of ""side"" games to learn more about the guitar and techniques.  Couldn't do it on your own or just get frustrated?  Give this a try!Now I just need to get a chair to play in, a office chair is very annoying to play in lol!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR a 5/5.  DO NOT WAIT.Yes it will be on sale for the winter and summer sales - for @ $10,  I regret every season I didn't purchase.  I would be so much farther along in my lessons by now.  The $30 I saved, is nothing compared to the comprehension of music that I could have absorbed by now...Disclaimer:  I am 'musically challenged'.  I am just being introduced to most of these concepts for the first time.That being said - this program is NOT just 'I wann learn a Nirvana song...'  This program teaches you basic music theory, session jamming, structured lessons, a chord reference, and some really top-notch games.The games are REALLY impressive.  Not just rote tools for muscle memory.  Each game is extracted from a classic genre, and really brings a great flavor to the practice you need.As you progress, the game gifts you with more songs, virtual tones, virtual equipment, the list is almost endless.  Additionally, the community is excellent - there is an official live stream STILL on every Thursday.  Plus additional songs come out all the time.If you have ANY interest in learning guitar - BUY THIS NOW.(Oct 2016 - ReMastered just hit, it is even BETTER - Just DO IT)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for learning to play the Guitar. I would recommend that you also get lessons at the same time as this will speed up your learning. Also having a tutor has taught me a lot about the bad habits I had picked up which isn't some think I could have learnt from this game such as proper thumb and hand placement, how to improve switching between chords and more. I have played this game now with three different guitars and not had an issue.The riff repeater is a wonderful tool which helps you to conquer the parts of a song where you get stuck and another great feature is the guitar arcade with games such as star chords which have been fun, challenging and helped me progress my chrod switching and has taught me some more chords. I can't think of anything negative to say about this game. The only thing is before buying this game you have to know that you won't be instantly good and you have to practice in order to get good.

												Overall it's a great way to have some fun playing with a guitar, even if you have no prior experiences.  You will want to look into CDLC or else you might get bored with the limited selection.Also, they don't really update these games aside from releasing more songs you can buy, so when you run into something that annoys you you're stuck with it until they make the next version of Rocksmith. Feels more like a console game than a PC game in that way.EDIT: see comments for a link about RockSmith2014 Remastered edition. Sounds like they are giving us a 'core game' update. But with that said there isnt really any competition making this the best of its kind. My only complaints are things like not enough minigames, not enough options for sorting songs and making playlists, and just some general interfacing issues.  The core gameplay itself is still really solid.			",108,6,2,1,5,0,15

												I just started playing this yesterday and I LOVE it.  I am one of those people who's owned a guitar for years and could kinda play it okay, but also who played tons of guitar hero and rock band.  Well, this game isn't quite the same kind of arcade-y fun as guitar hero, but you're actually learning to play real songs on a real guitar which is amazing.Like I said, I haven't gotten a whole lot of time in the game yet, but I can already see that a lot of care went into setting up the songs so that the difficulty could gradually increase while the work done on ""easy"" mode could still provide benefit as the difficulty increases. It's not perfect, sometimes it'll count notes as ""missed"" that I'm sure I hit properly, but not really give any feedback as to why they counted as a miss.  But, I'm working through that stuff.Song selection is pretty broad and it seems like there's lots of options for all levels of ability.So if you liked guitar hero but wish it was helping you play your actual guitar, then buy this game.  Note that you gotta buy the cable- it turned out that the cheapest way for me to get the cable was to buy a bundle for a console... so instead of buying the cable by itself, I saved a few bucks by buying the xbox 360 bundle on sale on Amazon.  So be on the lookout for those kinds of deals, I think it'll be nice to be able to play at home on my console but also on the go on my laptop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun and decent learning tool for any beginning electric guitarist. The game has a lot of potential for customisation of the sound of your guitar, a bunch of different modes that focus on training particular guitar techniques, and there are a ton of songs available to play along to (including the ability to import custom songs people have made).The only downside I found to this game was trying to find a real tone cable available for sale. I got fairly lucky and found one one a trading site rather cheap, but depending on where you live this may be quite a difficult item to come by.			",195,6,8,20,9,0,11

												I have never written any review on steam so right away by me writing this should tell you how incredible this game is. It seems that this game already has really positive reviews and I will simply add to it. I only have 11 hours logged so far and already I can see massive inprovments in my guitar playing (I had no previous experience with guitars). Moving up and down the fretboard is beginning to get smoother and more fluent and I find myself struggling to put my guitar down in order to do other things. It's addicting, the songs are great, and you don't even realize how much practice your getting at the same time. It's essentially guitar hero on steroids. This was perhaps the best purchase i have made on the steam store. Only The Witcher 3 beat it but just narrowly. If you're on the fence like I am with just about everything I buy, I say this.....DON'T. If you have the slightest drive to want to play guitar there is no cheaper way to get amazing practice than with this game.ps: I got this on the steam summer sale for what I believe was $7.99 (or something close to that). Keep in mind that you need to order the guitar cable seperately online which will cost you $30.00 as well. So when all is said and done, this cost me about $40.00 total but I dont regret even 1 penny of that. GET IT.			",21,3,0,8,1,0,1

												After attempting to teach myself guitar for about 3 months, I realized I was hardly making any progress. This could be because I wasn't doing it correctly or well, but I wanted to find some way to actually learn guitar and learn it well. Rocksmith 2014 did more for me in 1 month than I learned by myself in 3.For those who are new to guitar, I recommend buying ""Seven Nation Army"" by the White Stripes, as it is both a simple yet fun song to play and learn.One problem I had with the game is while I do try to do at least an hour of practice a day, I never knew exactly how much I practiced that day (the current session time on Steam includes time where you are in menus and whatnot) unless I did nonstop play for an hour straight, which is difficult to do when you want to do other stuff. This has led to me practicing for around a few minutes less than 60 and not getting a day on the 60-day challenge that you can connect your account to. This could be easily fixed by an ingame timer that basically could record how much time you spent practicing that day or that session, excluding menu and afk time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game for learning to play guitar if you don't feel like taking lessons. For the best experience do combine this game with actual lessons so you don't teach yourself bad habits/techniques. This game made me learn to play guitar from scratch. I'm still somewhat a beginner but that's because of the little amount of time I put into improving my guitarplay. Getting good with an instrument that requires precision takes much more time than your avarage videogame. Keep in mind that you'll have to buy a rocksmith realtone cable to play this game. It really sucks to buy one individually so I recommend you buy the game+cable edition online (not on steam). Great game, minimal lag (still noticable though, but waaaaaaaaaay better than rocksmith 1), buy it if you don't want to end up in your fifties thinking ""I should have learned to play the guitar""			",52,3,1,1,3,0,3

												Have played guitar a long time. Gotta say this could be very good for a beginner if they use their ears and refuse to cheat. This wont teach you how to sound good but it will teach you what notes to hit when and give you the tools to play crisply. What it won't do is give you the skills to either listen to a song on your own and learn to play it or to read tab - but then thats not its goal. Its to get you functional at playing covers of the songs in the library - which really isnt extensive - however it does this REALLY well. Its obvious that a ton of work has been put into breaking these songs into meaningful increments of difficulty. There is a hack on github to get a usb DAC working so cable isnt required. The songs that are broken down on here seem to be done well though - just a shame there arn't more. Wish i had this 12 years ago ;)			",73,11,0,6,6,0,13

												Alright, after 600 hours of play time I think that it's time I endorse this program.  I love this.  It is the epitomy of an ideal ""game-ification"" of an often times tedious chore of practicing an instrument.  With that said, this isn't a product for everyone.  If you are looking for the fun silly party game that was Rock Band or Guitar hero you will be seriously dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you sat down and mastered expert mode and played guitar hero for countless hours on your own so that you could say you beat Reverend Horton Heat's song with 5 stars then you will find Rocksmith to be an utter joy.  What Rocksmith is: The perfect practice tool.  Guitarists of all skill levels will find satisfaction in either the freestyle session mode where you can have a band back you up while you jam, learning to master lynard skynard's grueling runs or expanding your skill set in the guitarcade.  The DLC offers an genuinely insane amount of songs and there is enough there to sample virtually all styles of rock. What Rocksmith isn't: Something that anyone can pick up and enjoy in 10 minutes.  The guitar interface isn't entirely intuitive and just like learning to read music and tabs you have to learn how to read the guitar promts as well.  It works wonderfully, but honestly there is a pretty substantial learning curve.  It also isn't really something that you are going to enjoy with many other people.  If you shell out and get a second cord then you and a buddy can play, but still this is generally a solitary experience.  There is no online mode.So you think you're in? Buy the game and pick up the cord from amazon. Good luck and have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not being able to download a profile from a friend is a huge bummer, and creating a profile for them to be able to join multiplayer is a hassle.Recomended if you can play a little guitar or bass and what to make playing alone fun.

Guitar Hero but with a real guitar!Rocksmith 2014 is an excellent piece of software that I really love. This easily goes on my favorite games list. It is the second installment of the Rocksmith series; the first game released in 2012. The new 2014 version has improved a lot from it's previous game.I picked this up with 0% skills and barely touched a guitar before. By the time of writing this I have 140 hours on records and without a doubt improved a lot. I remember when I downloaded ""Take It Or Leave It"" by The Strokes and tried to play I barely could keep up with the song and eventually miss a lot of notes, but now I can get above 90% accuracy in it. There are countless of DLC for R14 mostly for about €2,99. A must have is Cherub Rock by The Smashing Pumpkins because that allows you to download free custom DLC made by other people. Customsforge[customsforge.com] is the main website where you can get your favorite songs for free.Aside from the game you need a guitar obviously and Ubisoft's Rocksmith Real Tone Cable which works with all consoles, both R14 and it's predecessor. It is basically a 1/4 jack plug[i.imgur.com] to USB. The cable was pretty hard for me to get because I don't live in the USA so the store I bought it from had to wait for a new batch to arrive which took approximately one month.Happy shredding!

												As someone who's been playing guitar for almost 20 years, I was excited to get my hands on Rocksmith. I've got plenty of good things to say and one very bad thing, so here goes: If you're a beginner who's never even held a guitar and just want to get a solid basis for building skills and having fun at playing, this is an awesome tool. If you're more seasoned like myself, this is a great way to get consistent practice and improve on techniquest that may have needed work or have gone sloppy over the years. I LOVE the Guitarcade. And the songs in this game are all pretty good (Muse--f*ck yeah!)The bad? If you're used to playing from tablature, the way that Rocksmith wants you to play is infuriating. Instead of common tab view, which is looking down at a fretboard, Rocksmith has you looking THROUGH the fretboard, which turns out to be counter-intuitive when you consider that almost all tab and instructional books/DVDs have it the traditional top-down method. Not only that, but RS refers to the thinnest string as ""the sixth string"", and goes up from there, calling the bass string the ""first"". Again, counter-intuitive if you've ever opened a pack of strings and read what they actually call them. Hint: The ""first"" is not the bass.Despite that glaring issue, this game is an awesome value and great tool. With the amount of actual instruction RS has to offer as well as good gameplay and great music, you really can't go wrong. Get us some cheaper DLCs and we'll be all set. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I bought this game, I was already a good guitar player. Not great, but I certainly knew how to play. At first, I struggle with the game because of the layout of the tabs. These are vertical instead of horizontal, but after a couple of plays I managed to memorize the colors of the strings. The lessons are very good. They are very clear on how they teach and they are totally optional.The Soundtrack for the game is solid. I think there were some better songs that would have fit in the game instead of others. I wish there were more, but the dlc seems to take care of that. I wish the develepors wouldn't just have over $1000 worth of dlc and instead offer more songs at the start.The customization of amps, effects, pedals, etc. is amazing. I have spent plenty of time just messing around with various effects trying to get one that sounds kickass! If you aren't looking for that deep of an experience, Rocksmith gives you the option to choose a songs effect instead of making your own from scratch.The games are fun for a little bit, but I found myself going back to songs.Overall: 9/10The only problems I had with the game were problems with bends during songs as they would not count.LESS DLC... MORE STARTING SONGS!			",96,10,5,20,22,2,9

												This game is great, and from it, I have actually learned to play the guitar! There is a huge community out there where people have developed thousands of songs (check customsforge) to play. I think having that community has made the game even more fun, given I can play artist I like, along with the 50 or so songs that came with the game. It will show you technique and stuff, and although its not as good as a real teacher, it sure is pretty good!			",56,6,12,12,37,0,10

												This game/learning tool is amazing. I had played guitar for years prior to purchasing this, but have always had difficulty learning full songs. This game with the riff repeater option has changed all that. prosI play on a mac and it works flawlessly with no lag during complex songs.You can change speed at which to play along withchoose your own path of lead or backup you can focus on one section of a song or lead or a few sections at your own pace in the riff repeateryou can change the difficulty and have less notes to start out with and ease your way in (caution though, as sometimes you will want to put the difficulty up higher than you can play in order to understand the best finger positioning for a certain chord or riff)intuitive on screen display allows you to play without reading music or tablatureyour gaming addiction will now actually give you a tangeable skill! DLC is forward compatible from the original version, so the song list is pretty robust. Just try to remember the game is called ROCKsmith, so there is lots of rock songs and metal songs, but not a lot of country or jazz.consthe steam version does not come with the rocksmith cable, which is required, proprietary, and costly. Any old midi cable will not do. Even if you have an electric or an electric acoustic guitar or bass...you will not be able to just buy this game from steam and be able to play. YOU MUST ALSO BUY THE CABLE!!! so I bought the game on sale for 10 bucks but still had to pay $30 for the cable, which took my broke♥♥♥♥♥months to actually buy. My advice is to wait for a sale on amazon or something and buy the game and cable together.other thoughtsThe mini games are hit and miss, with some being enjoyable and others not so much.some of these games have a hard time if your guitar's intonation is off, so yu may need to have it adjusted. My guitar has some intonation that is pretty bad, but for the most part in songs it still works perfectly....one or two of the minigames are unplayable...but that is my gear and not the games fault.there is a ""session mode"" which allows you to use preset jams to practice scales over, with a difficulty setting to even allow playing over changes and improvising. Buy the Ronda alla turca DLC from Mozart....it is so fun and if you ever get it down including the solo...you will feel great pride!I honestly wish this game was available 20 years ago. I strongly urge you to get this game for yourself...or anyone in your life who wants to learn or improve their guitar skills.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome, awesome game.  I've been playing guitar on and off for about 7 years now.  Rocksmith is amazing for helping to focus my practice efforts.  At times when I want to just sit down for 30 minutes and play, Rocksmith is there waiting for me.I think it is dangerous to use Rocksmith as a sole teaching device, as some of the more subtle aspects of playing, such as proper position, picking technique, fingering technique, etc, will be overlooked in Rocksmith.With that caveat, this is an awesome, awesome game.

												Rocksmith 2014 is essentially an improved version of the earlier installment in the series, and I have to say that Ubisoft really nailed it with this one.The game provides a simple, good-looking and smooth experience for people to learn and play the guitar, regardless of skill level.With this game you can learn to play along to your favourite songs, practice your slides, harmonics, chords, play minigames in the Guitarcade, test yourself to reach higher and higher scores in the Score Attack mode and much much more.Being an intermediate guitar player that just picked up the electric, I have to admit that playing this game has been a blessing. Within the first five hours of playing I had already learnt more than I had after 3 years of lessons. The game is easy to use and gives you plenty of time learn the songs you love, allowing you to increase and decrease the difficulty and speed of specific segments with the Riff Repeater.The game starts off with a generous amount of songs for you to play, and allows you to purchase hundreds of other songs for a relatively cheap price with new DLC being brought out weekly. If there's a song that you want to play that isn't in the main game or any of the DLC, there's also a great chance that you can find and download a Custom DLC from any of the many community websites.The only bad things I can say is that the game might not recognize you playing some power chords if there's a lot of distortion going on, and that you have to go to a store and buy a Real Tone Cable before you can play.Buying this game is probably one of the best decisions I've made recently, and  if you are a beginner and want to improve your guitar playing skills, or if you're a master and just want to have som fun challenging yourself to clear Fury of the Storm with 100% accuracy. I suggest that you spend the around 50€ for the game and the cable, and go have some fun! ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cons are that to buy more songs you have to pay $2.99 for each and the Real Tone cable (which is used to connect your guitar to the computer) is sold separately so you have to order it if you buy the game from Steam. Otherwise fantastic game. Would recommend to all aspiring guitarists.			",82,5,2,12,6,0,6

												This game will teach you how to play guitar. Should you also look up lessons online and watch videos on YouTube? Absolutely, but honestly this game is one of the most amazing purchases in regards to learning I've ever made, and I already sort of knew how to play in the first place. The game will adapt to how accurate you play, but if its still too hard or fast there is a built in system that will let you change the speed or difficulty. There are also tons of fun minigames to help you practice getting used to watching notes fly at you quickly, so don't be afraid of that. There is a reason this is my favorite steam game, learning music and playing a video game at the same time is one of the most amazing things I could think of. The only thing that I don't like about this game is that they took out a couple features from the original that I enjoyed, which was the ability to select different guitars and have their tones digitalized. However, they more than made up for it with the crazy in-depth amp customization and super cool session mode that can quickly teach you an entire scale and how to jam with it. Overall I'd say this game deserves a 9.5/10, and I am seriously in need of a Rocksmith 2017 or whatever the next one will be called.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Useful InfoI bought the ""Pantera 3-Song Pack"" from the first Rocksmith game and it worked in Rocksmith 2014 Remastered Edition without me owning the first Rocksmith game or the ""Rocksmith 2014 Disc Import Tool"" this originally was not possible do to the way in which steam handles DLC for one game seperate from DLC for another game but this has since been fixed (this info is hard to find online and old forum posts discuss how people were unable to even purchase the Rocksmith 1 dlc when they didn't own RS1 but instead owned RS2014)If you purchase DLC from the Rocksmith 1 store page it wont show up in your steam library when you click on Rocksmith 2014 Remastered Edition, however it will show up in the game under ""Learn A Song"" and the realtones will show up under ""Load Tone"" where you can just mess around with that tone.You can get Custom DLC (CDLC) that's not sold on steam for free at customsforge (google it)you must buy ""Cherub Rock"" by ""The Smashing Pumpkins"" to play any of that free DLCThe reason for this is that most CDLC pretends to be that song and rocksmith will only play DLC that you have purchasedThe song that your CDLC pretends to be (Cherub Rock) can be changed to another song DLC that you have purchased if you know how to do it (using a program from customsforge, once for every song you download... it's easier to just buy ""Cherub Rock"".)Downloading from customsforge requires you to signup on their forum.The reason they program CDLC to pretend to be ""Cherub Rock"" is because that was a pre-order bonus for the game when it was new so early adopters of the game typically had that DLC on day one.

												This is my favorite all-time ""game"", hands down.No, you won't learn to actually play bass with this. What you will get is better practice time - especially if you are not in a band. You'll learn to react fast and play without looking at the fretboard.To actually learn to play bass, you need to follow a course - with the help of a teacher, or by yourself, with online courses. It's the only way to actually figure out what you are playing, and why. But to get quick reflexes and learn to play songs like a jukebox (and also have a lot of fun!), Rocksmith is unbeatable.

												I started playing guitar when I was 19, in 2003. Recently, I hadn't played in about 3 years because I felt like I'd plateaued, being mostly self taught with no time or money in conjunction with each other to be able to take lessons. I played the original Rocksmith some on the PS3 but it was a hassle bringing the guitar down whenever I wanted to play and I just didn't feel like I was getting it.Then back at the end of April (2016) I broke my leg. I was off of work for 6 weeks and decided to start playing again. I worked on a few things myself again, but then I picked up Rocksmith 2014, this time for PC which is in the same room I keep my guitars. I have been practicing an average of 1-2 hours every day since and can already tell I've been getting better and been able to tweak a few issues in my playing that I didn't even know I had. This is a great tool to help you master songs in your preferred genre, as well as step outside your comfort zone and test your chops on something new. I have been able to identify areas I know I need to work on and begin the work to get better in those areas as well. So many of the songs are fun to learn and it feels great when you finally master one and gain the confidence to be able to play it note for note at the intended speed and make it sound good. I really enjoy this game and see it being a helpful tool even as I plan to move into lessons at some point down the road.			",28,2,0,4,4,0,17

												I have been messing around with guitars since I was a kid. I'm self taught (I read sheet music) mainly I played acoustic guitar and mostly chords. After purchasing Rocksmith my ability and play has improved like never before. As others have said I wish this was around years ago. Tabs seem to be the thing these days for learning new songs. I still think one needs to learn the fret board to really be proficient for any guitar, that being said I would recommend and have recommended this program to anyone that either wants to learn or that wants to hone there present skills. The DLC songs for the most part great from what I have downloaded. I'm 59 years old and still learning new tricks. My confidence has risen to an all time high level. Kudos to Steam and Ubisoft for another great program.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Since I used to love playing Guitar Hero, I thought it would be awesome to play a game like it while learning how to play the guitar. I like most of the variety of songs on Rocksmith and even if you don't like many, you always have the option to buy more. I believe that this game can be a lot of fun once you begin to get the hang of moving your finger up and down the fret board. After you play the game for a while you begin to realize that the game is a bit repetitive. I wouldn't recommend this being your only source of learning the guitar since it only teaches you the basics of playing the guitar. Though, I do love this game and I feel like I can play a little bit of the guitar now even though I haven't played it that much.			",45,4,1,11,3,0,1

												Rocksmith to me is the successor to guitar hero, the song selection is pretty great also. However for people looking for a virtual AMP rocksmith does tones pretty well, but once you throw in extremely disorted/clean tones that when it shows it's flaws. You will hear alot of unwanted noise, but for practicing songs or learning guitar this is most likely going to be your bible into playing guitar fast. It gives you great tip and trick into playing guitar. I played guitar for a while, when I first got this game I had trouble at first with hitting the right notes but after I got used to it. It became quite simple and easy, I highly recommend this to anyone who plays guitar or plans on playing guitar.			",218,23,7,20,24,3,23

												Excellent tool for guitarists to learn songs and improve on their technique through numerous different exercises and Rocksmith includes a good amount of free songs to get you started. I've been playing guitar for three years now and I've noticed a great improvement in my overall playing after I began to use Rocksmith.However, I find myself quietly cursing at the very poorly designed UI, and the fact that Ubisoft has its fingers in it -- Not to mention the ridiculously priced cable, but that's irrelevant.Overall, I would recommend.

 Read bottom of review for a condensed review I bought Rocksmith when I had 5 days experience of playing guitar, so I was a complete beginner. To cut a long story short, 6 months down the line I can actually call myself a guitar player, but there are other factors which you may be interested in. Rocksmith is a great way to convert from playing guitar hero to a real set of strings, and the UI was one hell of a way to go about it. It's easy to understand and ushers you on your journey from pleb to rock god, so what about the game itself?Well, if I am to be completely and utterly honest, all Rocksmith has done is teach me a few techniques, and how to play certain songs, sure it makes it more fun and attempts to immerse you in the song you're trying to master, but to be blunt, it is just music tablature, but with a more 'arcade' feel to it, and then of course there's a few minigames to try keep you from getting bored.The cons? The song list seems particularly limited, which reduces the lifespan of the game. The only way around this is by 2 ways, 1) You purchase the DLC, which I personally believe is rather expensive, I'd prefer to see them go down to about £1.50 per track, but hey, you're learning an entire song right? So on that ground I'm not complaining too much. 2) Use custom DLC, which basically lets you import whatever song you wish into the game, provided the community has made the track for it. This is modding the game of course, and because it's ubisoft, it's probably against their terms, but it didn't stop me. Besides the song list, after using rocksmith for quite a while you begin to discover that all you are doing is learning songs, not so much guitar, so don't expect to be learning musical theory on this game. Conclusion Definitely not a subsitute for a real guitar teacher, but something that might assist a guitar student. If you just want to learn songs then this is for you, but don't disregard youtube or normal music tablature (which is mostly free). After 6 months, I find more use in the cable so I can use guitar rig instead of rocksmith. 6/10  ",214,15,13,18,23,4,31

												This is not a game, this is a learning tool.And this is a very good one but you will not magically become the next Jimi Hendrix in 5 months, and you sometime need to practice outside RocksmithPros :The guitarcade games are really well designed to make you work certain skills and techniquesThe lessons are okay, but it will not replace a real teacher or a friend with a good guitar level as the game cannot tell if you are doing any mistake beside playing a note wrongThe learn a song mode is where you are going to spend most of your time. And it feels very satisfactory to play along a song and it forces you to have the right tempo. The dynamic difficulty works generaly well, sometimes the gap between 2 difficulty levels is a bit strong but you can get use to it if you are practicing a single part of a song in the riff repeater modeThe session mode seems very interesting but my guitar level is way too bad to do anything interesting with itCons :Playing along a song on the tempo can be satisfactory, but I tend to sometime rush or play approximataly some parts and the game still count it as played well and you can't really hear how bad you are. So sometime trying to play a song you practice outside rocksmith can really tell you if you are really good or bad at that songThe tone designer and tone switches doesnt sound really good imo, I have a Lag Imperator 66 (costed me 200€) and when I tested it on a real amp I found that the sound was more than correct for the price but on rocksmith I find it either oversaturated or really lowTo conclude : Rocksmith is definetly a good investement if you are struggling with traditional methods and it is worth the price if you consider picking it during sales (as you'll need to buy the realtone cable on your own + a real guitar if you dont own one) But it is not the ultimate and perfect learning tool. You'll still need to be motivated and work regulary if you want to progress. But after now a bit more than a month I realised how much progress I made. Before rocksmith I could barely play Between the bars by Elioth Smith and I tried recently playing it again (I need to tune my guitar to a standard D, and you will learn to hate tuning you guitar in something else than Standard E or Drop D) and I had much more ease playing it.

												9.4/10 - This is VAST improvement over Rocksmith 1. A complete overhaul.The greatest feature of Rocksmith 2014 is one thats not even included. The modding community. In a heartbeat, you can download hundreds and hundreds of custom songs. That alone is worth the $60.YOU CAN SET DIFFICULTY TO ANYTHING AT ANY TIME. The worst part of Rocksmith 1 was lack of difficulty control. Rocksmith 2014 so effortlessly integrates riff repeater, that in learn a song mode (most peoples favorite mode), you can start and exit a song 5x faster than Rocksmith 1, and riff repeater is available anytime before or DURING the song. My favorite mode, in the guitarcade, score attack, lets you choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard, with Hard being all phrases at 100%. Not sure what set percentage it is for Easy and Medium, but its constant. And i like this mode because it keeps track of scores more effectively and uniformly.Session mode: You pick you backing track, drums, basses, guitars, pianos, percussion, you pick you scale and your key, it shows you a fret board with every note of that scale. And highlights the ones to land on according to the current chord playing. This is just mindblowingly helpful for people just started out in the improv and jamming department, such as myself.As a metal fan, I'm liking the song and DLC selection quite a bit more in this game than the first Rocksmith, though again, with the customs, that doesn't matter too much. Anyways...If you bought Rocksmith 1 and thought it didn't live up to its potential, GET ROCKSMITH 2014. It fixes all of Rocksmith 1's caveats. Ubisoft really hit a homerun on this game. I've already recommended this to 3 friends who went out and bought it because they're trying to learn guitar. The only reason you should not have this game is if you have absolutely no interest in guitar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												great game!imo, everything that could been featured a lot better in the first Rocksmith has been improved to a whole new level. (eg. interface - tabsfeatures - quickly switch to practice mode & free select of repeats to practice)I do like the first rocksmith very much, it's so lovely to play along with songs you like!But this one beats it all and certainly the new Session Mode feature; there's no better gaming than jamming on a real guitar with a virtual band. Unless jamming with irl friends ofc!for people who don't play the guitar yet and are in doubt after reading the same kind of bad reviews, I would like to add something.A great deal of the not recommendations comes from people who didn't play the guitar and are impatient, maybe naive.If you didn't play the guitar before, you don't just acquire skill by just launching the game. However, you will if you check the short lessons that actually do explain all the basics you need to know. Just check a lesson, then apply this in a song you like to play, check the next lesson and repeat. Doing this, you will be able to play songs a lot faster than normally. certainly the songs you like! Ofc this takes some time, but afterall and again, it's a real instrument; like a violin, piano, drums, ... And if you aren't convinced still that it is the real deal, then see it as a controller with  21~24 x 6 buttons.for new players this is probably quite a hard in te beginning, but you do like a challenge, don't you?

												Review applies to both iterations of Rocksmith.Buy if you:1) Have an electric guitar/bass that you never learned to play (or enough disposable income to purchase an electric guitar/bass)2) Always wanted to learn to play guitar/bass3) Believe in the concept of ""Edutainment""4) Promise yourself you'll use the tutorials, work on various techniques, and actually practice chords (rather than merely playing songs and practicing riffs, which is way more fun) Don't buy if you hate:1) Learning chords2) Most of the songs available on the playlist (and DLC)3) Calluses on your fingertips4) Realizing that, if you really want to learn to play a musical instrument, you're probably going to need to spring for real instruction.Final assessment: 8/10 (compelled me to buy an amplifier, but no effects pedals just yet)			",12,3,0,0,3,0,0

												I don't really think most games need to be reviewed, but Rocksmith is a weird exception because it advertises itself as (kind-of) a way to learn guitar or bass. It's not that, but it's not bad either. The best word for Rocksmith is ""neat"".It can't teach you guitar. It can show you some tabs for fun riffs and it can teach you a couple chords, but there's no hint of music theory, not even a good explanation of scales. If you want to learn an instrunment, this is a great thing to use on the side. If you already know an instrunment, this is a neat game. The best part  is probably the fact that you get to have a cable that goes straight from your instrunment to your pc and you get a big effects library to play with.Rocksmith is great to play around with, just don't expect too much from it.EDIT: If you have an integrated and a dedicated graphics card, make sure to set the dedicated graphics card to work for Rocksmith. It seems to want to use the integrated card, which makes it look like♥♥♥♥♥♥			",120,23,3,7,8,2,19

												Review applies to both iterations of Rocksmith.Buy if you:1) Have an electric guitar/bass that you never learned to play (or enough disposable income to purchase an electric guitar/bass)2) Always wanted to learn to play guitar/bass3) Believe in the concept of ""Edutainment""4) Promise yourself you'll use the tutorials, work on various techniques, and actually practice chords (rather than merely playing songs and practicing riffs, which is way more fun) Don't buy if you hate:1) Learning chords2) Most of the songs available on the playlist (and DLC)3) Calluses on your fingertips4) Realizing that, if you really want to learn to play a musical instrument, you're probably going to need to spring for real instruction.Final assessment: 8/10 (compelled me to buy an amplifier, but no effects pedals just yet)			",12,3,0,0,3,0,0

												This is what Guitar Hero was meant to be. I have so much fun playing this game.It's very difficult for me to call this a game. Yes, you perform actions and get scored on them, and yes, that is sort of the definition of a game. As a modest guitar player though, this platform has taught me several songs and playing techniques, and has made the entire process approachable. Eventually you'll get to the point where there are no notes on screen, but you'll still be playing the song. That's when it hits you, and that's when you realize you really are learning these songs. The game even has you adjust your guitar tunings, which leads me to believe that I could match these tracks up against the recorded version and play along without the game, and really, that's pretty awesome.

												At the beginning I play guitar for 4 years and I'm pretty good at playing guitar.After 50h of playing this game I'm rather happy to play this game:+ It's good for beginners+ Learns to not to look at the fretboard while playing+ My favourite Session Mode- It doesn't have so much songs to play- No compatible DLC's- Sometimes it doesn't read the notes especially in chords ( that's why i dont have 100% in REM :/ ) The game is not very bad. As always Rocksmith 2014 has some worse things but these are not very important.My rate 7,5/10			",18,0,1,0,1,1,0

												A solid upgrade over the previous version. Definetly great for begginer players like myself. It helped me build my hand dexterity and endurance in addition to being great fun. It's really great to be learning an instrument (in my case bass guitar) while actually playing music with it. If you are more of a technical person this does offer rather good technique guides and exercises. One thing that is a bit dissapointing for me personally is the session mode. I cannot claim this to be true for regular guitar but for bass it just feels unnatural and sounds like some out of sync backing tracks. Sometimes it does sound good enough and I can't really fault them for trying but I mostly used it to practise scales. Also had a small issue at launch with the instrument playback being way too silent. However the issue has been adressed and is solvable by a simple windows options tweak.Overall a great learning tool (as I don't really feel like calling this a game per se) and lots of fun. Vastly superior to the original Rocksmith which I got few months before release of the 2014 version in order to get the cable and now I have basically doubled the songs available for me. By suplementing the game (which provides a great practise environment) with musical theory and technique guides available online (shoutout to http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/ for some superb free bass guitar content) I feel like I'm really developing my playing skills faster than I otherwise would have just with theory alone.

												This game is absolutely amazing.  If you have any interestin learning guitar I can't recommend it enough.  I have played guitar (mostly self-taught) on and off for about 10 years but I have barely touched it in the last 5.  I kept hitting plateaus and getting frustrated with the feeling that I couldn't improve as much as I wanted so pretty much left my guitar to collect dust.  Then this game came along and I basically can't put my guitar down and am not touching any other the other 10 games I have bought off steam in the last few months.  My guitar playing far surpassed the level I was playing at years ago when I was pretty active.  I think there is a great variety of songs to play with a great range of difficulties.  Plus, session mode is really quite impressive and I didn't realize I could have so much fun practicing scales when there was a band playing in the background to make it fun.  For beginners there are a ton of lessons that are really quite solid and would help you learn all the basics if you had never played a guitar before.  My single complaint about the game is the cost of the DLC.  Three dollars for a song seems pretty steep to me, but I guess it takes a bit of effort to map out all the notes and get the licensing rights.  On the other hand, the game is so good (though I hesitate to call it a game, it is so much more than that... it is more of a personal guitar instructor), I want the developer to really succeed so they can be rewarded for their work so I guess the DLC cost could be justified.In short, this program is going to revoltionize the way people learn to play guitar.  Get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Rocksmith that hasn't already been said... In short, this software is absolutely amazing.I have a hard time calling Rocksmith 2014 a ""game"". It's more of an absolutely massive software package featuring many of both learning tools and games in a beautifully intertwined and perfectly balanced format. Everything within this software is meant to help you both learn and improve your skills on guitar and bass, and have fun doing it.Let's say you're a complete novice. You've picked up a guitar once or twice in your life, strummed some strings, and probably thought maybe this is too hard, as all the neighborhood household pets scream in terror/anguish and attack you on sight. But fret not my poor mangled friend, for Rocksmith 2014 will pick you up off the ground, show you how to hold the instrument upside right, and guide your dainty fingers heavenly across the strings and make you feel like you're a rock god(dess).I say dainty, because as a warning, if you don't play guitar or practice any other highly strenuous fingering activity (okay, calm down kiddos) you will be fighting both your learning mentally, and physically as your fingers will need to bulk up quite a bit to get these skills under your belt. So don't feel discouraged if the skills feel impossible or out of your grasp. Keep practicing, and keep playing mini games (especially with chords). You'll get there :) Oh, and that stinging/burning/flamesfromhell feeling you are having on your finger tips, that goes away after about a week. As with all feeling at all, so enjoy that.Anyways, back on track. Rocksmith does this by first asking you how skilled you feel you are with guitar. It'll then ask you a few more questions to get an idea of what kind of guitar player you are. If you go with novice, it'll show you everything from how to attach your guitar strap, hold your guitar/pick, etc to how to actually pluck strings and play notes. (You can obviously skip the super basic stuff by picking one of the 3 higher experience levels)It then throws you into a song at a super basic level, and from that point on (through almost everything you do) it guides you through everything you need to know/do/practice to get better at guitar. It adapts itself and the difficulty of the songs you play so it's constantly pushing you to do better. It provides you with a lot of things to help you along the way as well. 2 primary things:1) The Lessons portion of the software actually teaches you, in a very interactive manner, things you need to know to play guitar, as well as own them and take care of them. Want to know how to string a guitar? It has you covered. Want to learn how to play scales, chords, notes, slides, bends, harmonics, and much much more? It'll teach you what you need to know, and coach you through it with advice such as ""It sounds like you have a finger touching the G string..."" (again, kiddos, lets keep it PG, eh?) ""... try it again, being sure your second finger is only touching the string(s) it should be."" 2) The Guitarcade. This section of the software is a whole suite full of very well made arcade style mini games that allow you to practice almost everything learned in the Lessons section of the software in a fun, score centric environment. There are arcade games that allow you to shoot a target by picking the designated string at the fret shown on screen, games that give you a chord that you must form and strum to shoot down an enemy space ship, ""String Skip"" which is pretty self explanatory, and lots lots more.All along the way, Rocksmith is going to be giving you multiple suggestions for what you should do next so you don't get lost, however you still remain free to do as you please. Between the lessons and mini games, and the actual main portion of the software which is the Guitar Hero meets Guitar style gameplay (which is of course very fun and productive) you're going to learn and/or improve your guitar and bass playing abilities.One last thing. The Session Mode. It's hard for me to put my excitement concerning this feature into words, so I'll keep this short. Try it out, you'll absolutely love it and will spend a lot of time there as you grow your articulation skills. It shows you a scale based on your settings (of which there are many) and allows you to play along a fully dynamic band that plays to your music. The band is entirely customizable, or you can pick from dozens of preset bands that include drums, bass, rhythm guitar, lead guitar, and piano/other instruments. If you stick to the scale, it'll sound really good to you, pretty much regardless of your skill which encourages you to really work at it and keep coming back for a couple hours a day. This is a great learning tool for scales, and also wonderful for your motivation. I recommend playing 30 minutes at least of Session Mode at the end of every time you play.TL;DR: Buy this. You'll love it. It's going to blow your expectations away. This is an incredibly valuable tool for any present/future guitarist.-No\m/\m/y			",189,34,3,34,28,1,31

******WARNING!******DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!This game has cost me a fortune!  If you are poor, have no personal income, or have to ask anyone for money, stay FAR away from this game!Now that's out of the way - onto the game that I do really recommend.It is a good place to start learning guitar/bass on a reasonable budget, and considering the hours I have put in, it is well worth it compared to paid tuition (at least for starting out and keeping things fun for a while).  I would also highly recommend Guitar Pro 6[www.guitar-pro.com] (or similar tab-software) and using RocksmithToTab[www.rocksmithtotab.de] in the future, as well as getting DECENT tabs from reputable sources, like mySongBook[www.mysongbook.com]; because 66,000+ tabs in a single download or any from Ultimate-Guitar[www.ultimate-guitar.com] for example, does sound like a good idea at the time, but I wish you the best of luck trying to find and short-list the decent ones...Rocksmith 2014 is fantastic at what it does, it adds an aspect of fun to practicing the guitar/bass that can't really be matched.  However, learning correct technique and procedures are not really a strong point of Rocksmith 2014 and unlearning bad technique may be counter-intuitive in the long-run; but you can find tutorials on Google/Youtube, JustinGuitar[www.justinguitar.com], or through the use of tutored lessons to make up for this.

												I ""only"" have  about 11h of playtime on this program when writing this review. But I just wanted to tell everyone how pleased I am with this piece of software.I'm somewhat an experienced ""musician"" but not on guitar- it's been always my dream to play it though but I think my parents were in shock seeing LED Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix or KISS in the 70s and never wanted me to be a guitar stomping maniac \m/(~.~)\m/Anyways, I picked up a guitar a few years ago but never really got me more than strumming a few chords. My problem certainly was playing not daily as I used to on my other instrument.Note: It's not just about talent or a teacher- even the best teacher can't practice for you! You need to play and practice regularly with a certain amount of devotion and variety.And this is exactly what this ""game"" does. You pick a song you'd like to learn und play guitar hero like by first just plucking a few notes; the program recognizes your failures or your skills and advances the next time and/or recommends to practice the riffs you've been bad at.I can't tell how much fun it is to learn a song step by step.  It's highly motivating. I never played the guitar as much as now. One of my friends is a professional guitar player and he told me that he skipped 3(!) teachers until he found the one that finally taught him with devotion. In contrast to his earlier teachers- this guy said.. Ok, now take the guitar and let's play Smoke on the Water! Just like Jack Black.. xDI mean ..come on- didn't you ever want to play a song for yourself when hearing that? ""Airguitaring"" it when you're alone? xDAlso, there is a huge arsenal of guitar technique videos- holding the guitar, chords, arpergios, slides... basics but also very advanced techniques just to name a few.And these are not just show off videos- you'll be shown the technique and then you'll have to play it and the computer analyzes your progress.If you're really into really into learning guitar... then get Rocksmith 2014 and the cable! You'll never regret.ROCK ON!			",103,30,7,12,23,2,11

												Seeing as I have 200+ hours on this game and only 13 achievements you probably think I've been idling and probably haven't played all of the game. The second part of that sentence is true as I have spent the majority of those 200 hours playing songs that have been modded in by the extensive, constantly growing community.  When people think of modding normally they may think of reinstallling skyrim countless times due to corrupt files and installing loads of pointless software off dodgy websites. Rocksmith isn't like this. All you have to do is 1. own a DLC off the game (they cost a pound it isn't bad) 2. download a song of your choice off about 700 pages of songs 3. Change the DLCs ID so the game thinks it's the DLC you own. Thats briefly what you need to do theres tutorials all over the internet on what to do. I've installed 360 different songs onto this game and I've never had an issue.  When I bought this game I wasn't a noob to the games. I had played the original game which was alright and I had been playing guitar for years anyway. I've used this game to practice songs for performing and it has been very successful. The design of the game is simple to use and easy to play along to. This game is one of the few good ubisoft games (other great titles being king kong the video game and Howrse.)   In summary this game is perf if you want to learn or become better at guitar. Once you've played the base game theres a hell of a lot of CDLC for you to chose from.Only bad thing is you have to pay for ""Smoke on the water"" and thats just down right offensive.

												I've been playing this game pretty steadily since mid-February of this year, and there are things I really like, and things I really don't like about it. Rocksmith gets you playing, and it has a lot of good technique games to make learning fun. And the Riff Repeater is basically ♥♥♥♥ing magic. But ultimately, its strength is also its weakness; the game format encourages rapid improvement at the expense of proper technique. This isn't an explicit thing, but rather a side effect of the edutainment approach. Naturally, one would want to improve their mastery score, or go for high scores in the Guitarcade games. But since the game is very forgiving about note inputs and only cares about the input frequency, it's easy for a player to develop bad habits and techniques that become obstacles as they become more advanced players. You can nail a song at 110% mastery, but if you play with the backing track off, you may notice that your technique may not sound as good as you thought. The game has some basic technique videos, but again, they don't actually go into any sort of detail or explain any kind of nuance. As a result, one can easily fill in the blanks with improper technique and develop bad habits that they would need to unlearn.Another thing I don't like is that it doesn't go far enough into the theory concepts. I like that it focuses on scales and modes so strongly, but it doesn't go far enough in my opinion. It doesn't explain anything about intervals, how the scales are created from them, how the modes are formed from the different keys, or any of that fun theory stuff. And it completely falls flat (har har) when it comes to chords. I appreciate that it shows the chord names in-game, but it doesn't even go into how the chords are constructed? Seems like a pretty glaring omission to me. Like, why is this set of notes called G#Maj7(add9)? Ultimately, I have to echo a statement I read about the game elsewhere: it gets you playing guitar, but it doesn't really make you a better musician (although I will say that session mode and practicing scales is a great start).Don't get me wrong--I love the game to death. Got me playing my bass again after all these years. But Rocksmith shouldn't be your only learning tool; you need to go beyond the game and seek out technique videos or one-on-one instruction if you really want to get your playing to the next level.

												Seeing as I have 200+ hours on this game and only 13 achievements you probably think I've been idling and probably haven't played all of the game. The second part of that sentence is true as I have spent the majority of those 200 hours playing songs that have been modded in by the extensive, constantly growing community.  When people think of modding normally they may think of reinstallling skyrim countless times due to corrupt files and installing loads of pointless software off dodgy websites. Rocksmith isn't like this. All you have to do is 1. own a DLC off the game (they cost a pound it isn't bad) 2. download a song of your choice off about 700 pages of songs 3. Change the DLCs ID so the game thinks it's the DLC you own. Thats briefly what you need to do theres tutorials all over the internet on what to do. I've installed 360 different songs onto this game and I've never had an issue.  When I bought this game I wasn't a noob to the games. I had played the original game which was alright and I had been playing guitar for years anyway. I've used this game to practice songs for performing and it has been very successful. The design of the game is simple to use and easy to play along to. This game is one of the few good ubisoft games (other great titles being king kong the video game and Howrse.)   In summary this game is perf if you want to learn or become better at guitar. Once you've played the base game theres a hell of a lot of CDLC for you to chose from.Only bad thing is you have to pay for ""Smoke on the water"" and thats just down right offensive.

												Remastered update:[fanboy mode]So, massive shoutout to the Rocksmith team at Ubisoft SF. No one was expecting an update like this, much less a free one. IMO, they should have charged for it. So many complaints from long time and first time users are corrected in this update. From something as simple as skipping the tuner, to a total redo of the Non-Stop Play mode. Now more than ever this is a ""game"" worth getting.[/fanboy mode]Awesome, uh, game? I'm not so sure this should be considered a game. To me, a reasonably experienced guitar player, this is a tool to direct practice. Anyone new to guitar will find it great, and those who've been struggling to find not just the time, but quality practice will find it endlessly useful. In short, this ""game"" will teach you how to warm up, practice, and shred.Currently, there are some issues with the 60-day challenge tracking progress for many users, and Ubisoft is apparently on vacation for like six months. Who does that? But don't let that hold you back, this is a great piece of software.One of the problems of the self taught guitarist is finding things to practice. Finding new scales, new chords, new progressions, jam tracks, and keeping them interesting. Well, this has all of it, and it is a ton of fun! So easy to use.The mini games have a cool 8-bit charm, and you interact by using techniques like bends, harmonics, and chords. They're fun ways to teach you all the technical parts of the games.There are tons of lessons with practice tracks. It has really too many features to cover. A huge amp sim, automatic jam tracks, tips for what to practice to ace a particular song. There is nothing you could ask for that isn't included.It plays a bit like Rockband, but with your actual guitar. Maybe a bit like Guitar Hero but looks more like Rockband, for those familiar with both. The coolest feature of the game is that it scales the difficulty as you get better, and it features a Riff Repeater that gradually lets you learn a song chorus by chorus and verse by verse. Tough solo? The software will ease you into it, gradually speeding up and adding more notes until you ace it.The song selections are fairly limited and DLC is $3 a song which could easily turn an initial $200 investment into $400, depending on your musical taste. I would like to see a broader variety of styles of music. Its heavy on the rock, nothing wrong with that, but they could have landed some (more) country, surf, even classical arrangements for guitar, like Fur Elise, or flamenco. Want a challenge, learn some♥♥♥♥♥♥Dale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: May 20, 2015
												Before I begin to discuss Rocksmith or Rocksmith 2014, I first feel the need to clarify that I wouldn't personally classify this as a video game. I only say this to help understand the points I'm making. I consider Rocksmith/Rocksmith 2014 more of a learning tool(s) than an actual game. However, if you enjoy playing guitar as I do, then it certainly feels like a fun game at times. There are a lot of changes from the original Rocksmith to the 2014 version. I would highly recommend the 2014 version over the original format, just because there are far more tools available, more music, more capability for learning. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this to those that do not have experience playing a guitar. My advise would be to seek a teacher or you may find Rocksmith to be a bit frustrating. Also, if you're wondering if this tool/game will be good as a replacement for a good guitar/music teacher...then I will say NO. It's a great tool, but it's one of many tools that you need to be a solid rhythm, lead, or bass guitarist. It's not going to teach you how to read music as it's tab only, (kinda in it's own tab format, but if you can read tab you'll understand. If you can't read tab, Rocksmith's way isn't that hard to understand, but some notations will take some getting used to). For new guitar players, there's a bit of a learning curve that the developers assumed that you already have. By this I mean, understanding how to make a chord and some hand positions or having bends down.  You'll be given a video demonstration and you'll be told if you played the chord/bend/or technique correctly or not. You won't be told what you're doing wrong, or if you're fretting too hard or have some incorrect positioning. Getting bends to be recognized can also be a real pain if you're new to guitar and aren't certain what is wrong, be it you or calibration of your instrument, (or possibly other issues resulting in your bends not being counted as correct). There are arcade games, (called Guitarcade within Rocksmith 2014), that are mean't to help you practice specific techniques. However, there is not a ""no fail"" mode so that you can just keep strumming and/or trying without having your game ended for incorrect patterns/chords/notes. I personally feel that due to this, the game is better suited to intermediate to advanced players rather than new players. I warn about this as I would hate for someone to give up on learning guitar after becoming frustrated from the game. Learning music and/or an instrument is hard. Having a teacher to give you advice prevents you from learning bad habits that you may have to unlearn later, (thus increasing how long it takes you to get better with your instrument).If you try to save money, or time by using rocksmith instead of investing the time & money into a ""good"" guitar teacher as well as books or the internet to read about learning music, music theory, composition, etc... then most people may instead frustrate themselves from what they are not learning. If you're only goal is to learn how to play a song you love, one paticular way, then yes this will be perfect. I say one paticular way since there are many different ways to play the same note or chord, depending on pitch, range or your own expression rather than who wrote that piece of music.So if you're funds are limited like many of us, and you're wondering if you should invest that money into Rocksmith 2014 or pay monthly for a teacher...I would advise you to take the instructor and learn. You can always get Rocksmith 2014 later or some even newer version of it down the line. What you'll gain from a teacher will benefit your playing for the rest of your life. Rocksmith, while great and fun, will only benefit you're understanding of individual songs, but you may not understand how they were written and other fundamentals.If you want to understand music and be able to express ""yourself"" and the way you interprete that song and how it makes you feel as well as any piece of music, definately use Rocksmith 2014 as well as practicing without Rocksmith 2014, and read all about music and learn from a tutor/teacher that is good at teaching the style of music you're interested in. Feel free to search the internet on tips to find a good music/guitar teacher as well. -----------------------------------------For those that have decided to use Rocksmith 2014, my advice would be to find a song you like and keep working on getting down a section at a time. Using Riff Repeater and selecting small sections to practice at a low speed, perhaps 50% or lower if you need. Give yourself plenty of time to get comfortable with it and don't get frustrated if you have bad days. The muscles in your hand build over time just as they do in the rest of your body. Your muscle memory of remembering where each note and chord is takes time to develop too. Give yourself a few months to get the entire song down, (longer if needed). If you feel that you can't get past a certain speed, try speeding it up 5% higher and take a few mintues at the higher speed. Then go back down to the lower speed you were already having trouble with before. That sometimes helps with those sticky points.  Feel free to use guitar forums and other internet sources if you find trouble with a paticular technique, chord, or even a song phrase. You may even wish to read how other musicians divide their practice time since many people become frustrated because they try to practice too much. If you find a section of a song giving you trouble, watch how another person plays that song and see their hand position(s), which could help with your own progres.  Keep in mind that missions can help with your overall progress. Don't forget to work on them as well.The best advice that was given to me about learning guitars was, ""If playing guitar was easy, then all the pawn shops in town wouldn't be filled with guitars.""Best of luck with your music endeavors. I hope this review has helped you.			",44,0,0,7,5,0,9

												Some people who are familiar with me might remember me talking on launch day about my excitement at finally getting to learn guitar and my plans to post all kinds of updates as I got better and stuff. Those same people might realise that I never did that. (Good old college finals wrecking everything...) So now that I'm finally on break, I decided to start putting some serious time into Rocksmith 2014 starting with the new year, and make learning a thing or two about guitar my new year's resolution, so to speak. Well I've managed to keep with that promise to myself fairly well, and have been playing quite a bit this year, making sure to spend time practicing and doing finger workouts (Yes! Finger workouts!) every sing day. From my time spent right after buying Rocksmith 2014, I'd learned a few things about playing, but hadn't put much serious work in till the start of this year, so in effect the 4 days of 2014 I've had prior to this post are the only real time I've spent actually trying to learn and improve and not just screw around.(TL;DR I've been practicing for 4 days)Now that we've got that little bit of exposition out of the way...Wow.Rocksmith works. It seriously works. It brings all the tools to the table for you to use, and then just simply shows and helps you use them to improve, and improve fast. After 4 days of Rocksmith and a few youtube videos, I'm comfortable enough with the fretboard to play through a handful of the lower difficulty songs with solid hit rates, able to figure out spots I'm having trouble with and practice them until I feel comfortable, and challenge myself to get better all while having fun and actually feeling like I'm making progress.In fact, the feeling of making progress is my favorite part of this game/tool. Every single time I stand up to play it, I feel like I'm moving forward, becoming just a little bit quicker with my fingers, more consistent with my strumming, and more accurate with my timing. This software manages to perfectly blend combine a learning environment with the entertainment and approachabiality of a game in a way that's convinced me that I want to learn, I want to keep hammering away at Blitzkrieg Bop and Next Girl, that I want to struggle with the weird way Smoke on the Water is played, and that I want to spend time learning guitar rather than playing other games.(TL;DR After 4 days I feel like I've made real progress, and I'm motivated to keep progressing)The game won't teach you guitar yourself, you've got to bring your own motivation to the game to get anything out of it, but if you're willing to work, the game helps you in ways that make your work feel rewarding. I finally brought my motivation into Rocksmith, and I'm starting to get skills out of it that I find absolutely amazing, and I can't wait to see how much more progress I can make the next time I stand up and play.(TL;DR If you're motivated, like I am now, this game will help you turn your motivation into real guitar playing skills.)Absolutely reccomended.Edit: Just as an FYI, I bought this with the Epiphone Les Paul Junior through Amazon for $200, and I'm extremely happy with guitar as well.

												This game, after about a total of 150 hours with both games, has taught me to play guitar better than any teacher could. When I first got the original game, I had never picked up a guitar before and had only played Rock Band and Guitar Hero. By the end of the night (after about four hours of playing), I had managed to master Song 2 by Blur. After that, I was basically sold that Rocksmith was the greatest thing ever, but the 2014 version is miles better than the original. Way more lessons, session mode, more techniques, etc. than the original game. This has to be the best purchase I have made in a very long time and I recommend it to absolutely anyone wanting to pick up a guitar and be able to play it after some minimal practice.

												YOU CANNOT USE USB HEADPHONES OR SOUNDCARD WITH THIS.----------------------------------------------------------------------That being out of the way (I fought it for a while, trying to figure out why it wouldn't work.) It's a pretty neat product. The dynamic difficulty level works really well, but I didn't expect it to throw single string notes per beat for someone who chose 'average' as their skill level. I've played guitar for slightly over 10 years now, and those simplified tracks got me off guard, making me miss notes on songs I've played for years. It did pick up on my performance quite fast, though, and I started having a blast learning songs I probably wouldn't have picked up otherwise. Make sure you set your skill level high enough.Instrument used: Schecter Diamond series Omen 7 Extreme			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An awesomefuly fun game even if you never picked up a guitar in your life.Getting into Rocksmith, I never touched a guitar before.  Those instructional DVD's out there don't help you learn at all, really.  Neither do YouTube videos.  How does the video know if you're doing it right or not?  It's such a passive experience.  And paying for lessons requires scheduling stuff, paying somebody, etc.So that's where Rocksmith comes in.  Starting out, it assumes you know nothing about guitars at all, which I really liked.  Which I liked, because I didn't.  So I went out and bought a cheap beginners guitar.  Starting out, you are going to be your own limitation, not your guitar.  So spending big bucks doesn't make sense if you're just learning the strings like I was.I got myself a $100 Dean Vendetta XM, it has pretty good reviews on Amazon and people on YouTube seem to really rock out with them using proper amps and stuff.  To play Rocksmith though, you need the Rocksmith 2014 Real Tone Cable (avail on Amazon) to connect your guitar to your PC which costs about $47, on top of the price of the game on Steam.  So if you already have a guitar, this game is about a $80 investment @ full price.I know, the price of this game is really starting to add up if you don't already own any of this stuff.  But on the upside, the Rocksmith Cable also works in other applications for PC, and works on console too.  So if you're like me and you don't even have an amp yet... between this app and other software like Guitar Rig (the Rammfire plugin is pretty awesome!) you can have alot of fun learning and playing electric guitar at the fraction of the price of paying for a Guitar, Lessons, and an amp.  But hey, hobbies in general... whether it's automotive, homebrewing, whatever... are never cheap.When you first start out in Rocksmith 2014, it will show you graphically how to tune your guitar for the specific song you're playing, and test string to verify it's good to go.  It'll have you play the easiest song on the lowest difficulty... which is usually 1 note at a time all played on one string, typically the fat one at the top since it's easiest to hit.  As you play, if you don't make mistakes, it'll gradually increase the difficulty of the song until you start to screw up.  Then it knows where to start with you.For each song, it has a ""Riff Repeater"" which is basically a feature where it selects a small portion of the song, and slows it down for you so you can get used to moving around on the fretboard and hitting the right notes.  Once you start getting it right, it speeds up, and as you get better at that... it adds extra notes, then extra strings and chords and stuff.  Then it starts getting into harmonics, bends, etc.But what's really cool about Rocksmith 2014 on PC in particular is that you can download custom songs called CDLC (Custom DLC) from CustomsForge.com.  These are user-made songs that you can add to the game for free.  Don't get the wrong idea though... this isn't a way of pirating the extensive DLC library this game has on Steam.  You won't find the official DLC songs on that website, it just has a huge library of songs that aren't in the game.  So if you're like me and you're a huge Rammstein fan, but you're disappointed that they aren't in this game even as a DLC option, that's where you go if you want to rock out with their songs.

												Much better than the original, this is a must have for anyone interested in guitar.I've been playing guitar on and off for over 25 years, since buying my first guitar in high school. For various reasons, I never took formal lessons on guitar; although, I have taken formal lessons on quite a few other instruments (clarinet, saxophone, piano, chello, violin).I've successfully taught myself how to play many songs in fingerstyle guitar on acoustics, but could never progress very well with electrics. So, I could never really crank out the rock tunes that I grew up loving.When the original Rocksmith came out, I immediately purchased it and played for a week or two, but couldn't get used to the notation, and stopped playing for months. Then, when Rocksmith was released on PC, I thought I'd give it another chance. At the same time, I was starting to play rhythm guitar in a band (badly), so any method that might help me learn was welcome.I decided to give the original Rocksmith more patience, and after a few weeks, was noticing that I could play things with a pick, on my electrics that I had never been able to play before. I was also building up the ability to play chords and progressions that I'd never pulled off successfully.However, the original Rocksmith had a long list of flaws that made the experience often frustrating: poor note detection, stability issues, performance problems, long loading times between menus, interesting, but poorly implemented ""games"" for guitarcade; the list goes on.Rocksmith 2014 has fixed all of those issues. Assuming your machine meets the minimum requirements, and you configure things correctly, Rocksmith 2014 is a pleasure. With improved notation capabilities, in the last 3 months, my bends have gotten significantly more accurate, I can palm mute and frethand mute in ways that I've never done before. Are there still some issues? Yes. Is Rocksmith 2014 worth it? Absolutely.However, Rocksmith 2014 will not teach you everything you need to know. Youtube videos or some commercial online guitar teaching sites can augment Rocksmith very well. And, of course, a live guitar instructor will be able to provide feedback that will help you advance all that much faster.			",26,6,0,5,6,0,12

												Recaptures a lot of the rockstar feel of the classic Guitar Hero and Rock Band games. Dynamically adapts the difficulty midsong if you're doing well, so you're always being challenged and always improving. Makes learning the guitar a really fun experience, and it's nice that what you pick up in the game can transition so seamlessly to the outside world.			",185,28,11,16,23,3,31

An awesomefuly fun game even if you never picked up a guitar in your life.Getting into Rocksmith, I never touched a guitar before.  Those instructional DVD's out there don't help you learn at all, really.  Neither do YouTube videos.  How does the video know if you're doing it right or not?  It's such a passive experience.  And paying for lessons requires scheduling stuff, paying somebody, etc.So that's where Rocksmith comes in.  Starting out, it assumes you know nothing about guitars at all, which I really liked.  Which I liked, because I didn't.  So I went out and bought a cheap beginners guitar.  Starting out, you are going to be your own limitation, not your guitar.  So spending big bucks doesn't make sense if you're just learning the strings like I was.I got myself a $100 Dean Vendetta XM, it has pretty good reviews on Amazon and people on YouTube seem to really rock out with them using proper amps and stuff.  To play Rocksmith though, you need the Rocksmith 2014 Real Tone Cable (avail on Amazon) to connect your guitar to your PC which costs about $47, on top of the price of the game on Steam.  So if you already have a guitar, this game is about a $80 investment @ full price.I know, the price of this game is really starting to add up if you don't already own any of this stuff.  But on the upside, the Rocksmith Cable also works in other applications for PC, and works on console too.  So if you're like me and you don't even have an amp yet... between this app and other software like Guitar Rig (the Rammfire plugin is pretty awesome!) you can have alot of fun learning and playing electric guitar at the fraction of the price of paying for a Guitar, Lessons, and an amp.  But hey, hobbies in general... whether it's automotive, homebrewing, whatever... are never cheap.When you first start out in Rocksmith 2014, it will show you graphically how to tune your guitar for the specific song you're playing, and test string to verify it's good to go.  It'll have you play the easiest song on the lowest difficulty... which is usually 1 note at a time all played on one string, typically the fat one at the top since it's easiest to hit.  As you play, if you don't make mistakes, it'll gradually increase the difficulty of the song until you start to screw up.  Then it knows where to start with you.For each song, it has a ""Riff Repeater"" which is basically a feature where it selects a small portion of the song, and slows it down for you so you can get used to moving around on the fretboard and hitting the right notes.  Once you start getting it right, it speeds up, and as you get better at that... it adds extra notes, then extra strings and chords and stuff.  Then it starts getting into harmonics, bends, etc.But what's really cool about Rocksmith 2014 on PC in particular is that you can download custom songs called CDLC (Custom DLC) from CustomsForge.com.  These are user-made songs that you can add to the game for free.  Don't get the wrong idea though... this isn't a way of pirating the extensive DLC library this game has on Steam.  You won't find the official DLC songs on that website, it just has a huge library of songs that aren't in the game.  So if you're like me and you're a huge Rammstein fan, but you're disappointed that they aren't in this game even as a DLC option, that's where you go if you want to rock out with their songs.  Just be careful setting off pyro in your living room.tl;drHobbies, regardless of what they are... aren't cheap.  But this is the cheapest and most fun way of learning how to play the electric guitar, even though it is more expensive than your typical videogame ($80 assuming you have a guitar already).

												This game, after about a total of 150 hours with both games, has taught me to play guitar better than any teacher could. When I first got the original game, I had never picked up a guitar before and had only played Rock Band and Guitar Hero. By the end of the night (after about four hours of playing), I had managed to master Song 2 by Blur. After that, I was basically sold that Rocksmith was the greatest thing ever, but the 2014 version is miles better than the original. Way more lessons, session mode, more techniques, etc. than the original game. This has to be the best purchase I have made in a very long time and I recommend it to absolutely anyone wanting to pick up a guitar and be able to play it after some minimal practice.

												The concept behind Rocksmith is fantastic, with the general idea being that you plug in a real instrument, and learn songs that are played on the screen, similar to Guitar Hero. You will actually be learning the real song though. I have found that as a fairly reasonable musician, I don't actually really learn the songs, so much as read them as they scroll. Trying to remember how a part in a song went 10 minutes after I played it can be very difficult, which I believe would be common in others who become competent at reading the songs. Regardless of whether you remember the song or not, you will be practicing your chosen instrument, which is great for a number of reasons.There is a noticable latency between hitting the note on your instrument, and the sound playing in game. With a bit more attention  from the developers on the software, this really should be avoidable. As of late, I have been unable to tolerate how out of sync it is, and have stopped playing. Every now and then I will feel like playing a song, but quickly switch it back off after being reminded how frustrating this issue is. I would recommend this game for beginners, as it is a great tool to keep people motivated in those early stages where progress can feel very slow. Seeing the progress that can be made with a few hours is really quite amazing, so that aspect of the game is invaluable. For more advanced users, it can be a fun way to use your instrument in a new manner. The mini games are interesting, and the score attack can be a nice arcade-style way of playing a song.The intial song selection is actually pretty varied in style. Some songs are really poor choicers however, as there is barely anything musically happening in them. On the other side of things, there are some fantastic difficult tracks that can entertain even experienced musicians (generally solos). The Custom DLC is where the real fun is though, with some really obscure bands having songs featured. Apparently this was broken in the ""remaster"" however, so that can be removed from the postivies column until it is addressed, if they choose to fix it. If it is fixed, consider this a reason to buy the game, regardless of your skill. There were literally thousands of songs available from all genres I can imagine, and probably some I can't. There is also the genuine DLC that is produced by the developers, but if you are rich enough to get many of the tracks, chances are you don't need to add music to your repetoire.Pretty typical of Ubisoft, the game does not seem to be receiving any patches to fix the issues that others and myself have described. I would avoid an expensive mistake if you are running Windows 10, or any other systems that people have outlined as being problematic.			",164,7,6,8,8,1,23

												This game is really quite amazing, I have played guitar for over 10 years on and off, and often I would get stuck for things to learn or progress in skill. With Rocksmith, you will be playing a variety of music you wouldn't normally have chosen to, and to my surprise is actually really quite fun! My favourite feature is the mini-games and Score Attack mode, it reminds me of Rock Band 3's Pro Guitar mode, as you can battle online against your friends to get the highest score on your favourite songs, it adds an element of competitiveness and motivation to get better at those songs in your spare time.I'll give you a pro tip. Set audio gain to 0.1dB and roll off your volume pot to 8 to 8.5/10 on your guitar (just enough to take the bite off), calibrate in the options, now once calibrated roll your volume pot to maximum. This will give you both optimal hit registration, superior tone and better sustain in the game itself. If you calibrate with volume at max, the game will give you a very diluted, zero sustain and poor tone, so trust me, that small tip is very helpful for those who care what they sound like!

												Pro's:- Great tool for complete beginners, provides access to a large enough library of songs for some variaty.- Lessons feature makes you aware of certain techniques.Con's:- Hit detection is sometimes off (although this has improved recently).- Does not give you the same feedback an instructor will, which can lead to bad habits.- Peculiar learning style (learn base notes, then chords?)- Doesn't let you see an original tab for a song (which can be solved with third party software), this can make learning more intricate phrases harder and can make it harder to spot phrase patterns on songs.My personal experience with Rocksmith is great - I picked it up in my early days of playing, and it helped a lot with the basics. However, at a point, the majority of players will hit a wall. When I hit this wall, I started getting professional lessons, and the rate at which I learned went up dramatically. Further to this, my instructor was able to point out many bad habits I had developed, which actually stemmed from not having that feedback from Rocksmith. There was also a lot of basic principles I had missed, which he was able to correct.			",148,8,3,10,20,1,18

												Rocksmith 2014 improves on the original in significant ways.  It's obvious the developers really care about Rocksmith and getting people into the joy of playing music.  I'm playing on a midrange laptop with headphones and the experience is smooth as silk.  The teaching aspects are encouraging and never leave you feeling overwhelmed.  The mini games are really fun and challenging such that you're getting more skills practice without really being aware of it.  The setlist included is diverse enough to cover most tastes and the additional songs coming out will help keep everything fresh for the long run.  Several people have complained about the tuner, but I didn't really have any trouble with it.  I'm sure there will be patches that wil fine tune the package over time.  Overall, I'm extremely impressed.  You can't beat the feeling you get when it all comes together and you're nailing it.  If you want to get started playing a guitar or bass, or you enjoyed the first Rocksmith, you need to pick this up.Update - Holy crap, 3 years later & still going strong with Remastered!

												I wish I could give a neutral rating.  I really don't want to give it a not recommended, but I feel I have to.  The base game is pretty incredible.  It's got me almost playing bass like I know what I'm doing in a few months.  The reason for the downvote is all the rest of the crap Ubi shoehorned in there.  Except for some technical improvements to the engine and performance, it's inferior in almost every way to the original.  All of the complaints of the original that they claim were ""fixed"" were more ""changed"" to something bad in a different way.  The interface is still a disorganized cluster♥♥♥♥.  Despite adding some extra fret numbering, the note highway is harder to read IMO.  And dear GOD the Uplay integration!  Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥off!  I don't care the slightest bit about these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""rewards"" and having to unlock content that should just be there by completing asinine ""missions"".  SO MANY popups and annoyances.  Just let me play my damn bass!All in all, it feels like they took the original Rocksmith, and did their best to turn it into a money milker.  DLC shows up in the song list begging me to buy it.  Banner ads in game for the newest content.  Uplay integration.  If the old Rocksmith was still supported, it would be the best choice hands down.  But if you want new songs moving forward and the technical improvements like eliminated input lag, you're stuck with this one.			",63,4,0,3,8,0,5

												There isn't much to actually say about this game. It's basically Rock Band (or Guitar Hero) with an ACTUAL guitar! Your six strings are color coded so you can easily find the string to strum (for example, the red string is the thickest string on the guitar, yellow is next, blue after that and so on). Next is the fretboard in the game, it shows numbers on the interface (3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and the other dot places). It also comes with an in game tuner for many different setups (unlike the original 2). Also something I chose this game over the original was the official songs (songs that come with the game, not DLC), it has AWESOME tracks, not just stuff by bands that got famous by these games (with a few exceptions), it's got Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold, Say It Ain't So by Weezer (side note, I've spent the most time here because it's good practice for chords), My Own Summer by Deftones and many more!There is one BIG downside to this game though, the way the game's programmed, you need a pretty good guitar with brand new strings, and not too many pickups and stuff. I don't know why but, sometimes the game reads your tuning as right in the tuner then says you're tuning is completely off during a song. Here's a good example, you tune your guitar as close to the 0 mark as you can get (in this one, that's near impossible to do), then you strum the right note at the right time, and it says you either didn't hit it or you hit it late. All because of the way it's programmed. If you don't have a $5,000 guitar, I recommend you get the original Rocksmith as it isn't as picky with your tuning...			",50,7,4,0,11,0,1

												I've been playing guitar for 6 years now and only picked up Rocksmith last year. And, gotta say, it was a worthy investment. This game helped me big time with stuff like bar chords, it taught me new chords, new techniques and new sounds.Pros:- Teaches you guitar or bass- Just fun- Play your favorite songs- Learn at your own pace- Has its own games, lessons, etc- A ton of tone customization- Local multiplayer is greatCons:- No online multiplayer- The cable is way to ♥♥♥♥ing expensive- For me, I just can't memorize the notes by Rocksmith like I can using tabs- Often it says you got something wrong even though you didn't (saying you are too high or low on fretboard, or have the wrong note)- Can't upload custom music or anything like that, which you could do in Guitar Hero 'n♥♥♥♥♥♥br>			",203,30,3,34,18,2,11

												By far the best way I have found to learning guitar. After taking lessons, watching numbers of videos, reading tabs and books, and just teaching myself by ear, this is by far the easiest and fastest way I have found to learning, relearning, and strengthening my guitar playing.EDIT: Ive now played 110 more hours since I first posted this review and im still learning more and more each time I play this game. The CDLC (Custom DLC) that is made by the community allows for infinite replayablilty and is the reason I still play this game. I hardly ever play session mode and almost never play the mini games. I only play ""Learn a Song"". Ive also spent majority of those 110 hours in Learn a Song mode. I HIGHLY recommend Rocksmith 2014 and I highly recommend the CDLC.still a great game			",233,36,7,20,16,4,15

												I need to start by saying that this is not my first time playing a musical instrument by any means.  However it is my first real attempt at learning to play guitar.  After 2 weeks of using Rocksmith 2014 I can say that I've seen a major improvement!Rocksmith 2014 starts you out easy, playing maybe 1 out of 10 notes through easy passages, and maybe 1 out of 20 through the more challenging parts.  As you improve Rocksmith throws more at you, and if its too much at first it backs it down a notch.  After each time playing through a song the program will show you your longest streak and your accuracy, along with song mastery and a few exercises that Rocksmith 2014 believes will help you improve the next time.  Pros:  1) Simple, effective and user friendly set up (note highway, similar to Guitar Hero) 2) The riff repeater is very helpful allowing you to repeat a section over and over until you get it, and will let you increase or decrease difficulty (awesome for learning solos) 3) 50+ songs ranging in styleCon:The in game tuner is off, and its finnicky.  On day two I broke my high e string because the in game tuner insisted I was flat and told me to tighten the string until it broke.All in all Rocksmith 2014 is an excellent practice tool, and you will get what you put into it.  Like all other musical instruments the key to proficiency is consistent practice.  It will not make you a rock god over night, but if you practice you will build skill.			",32,1,1,8,2,0,1

All the lessons and scale practice make it a legitimate learning tool as well. Also it has always run great for me, no tech issues... except for the deleting of my profile 3x times (may of been my fault alt f4ing while auto saving etc).da TLDR: Anyway, from beginner to pro, theres something in it for every guitar player.

												Definately more of an improvement over original rocksmith, though it doesn't suck you in as much as the original.I think the original Rocksmith is more game like but you progress less as a guitarist. Whereas RS14 feels more like a tool and makes you go to riff repeater to learn sections. Definately advise anyone interested in learning a guitar/bass to pick this up as you find yourself learning songs way quicker than from a teacher/youtube. As a tool for learning songs I thinks its second to none though for music theory it is a bit stunted, certain things like theory and strumming patterns etc need to be taught by a teacher or youtube/videos/books.But pretty amazing software, I 've played more guitar in the last few weeks than I had in the previous couple of years.

												Rocksmith really delivers on its promise. I have tried learning to play the guitar before and though it started sounding nice enough to make out what I was playing at some point, invariable I'd quit within a month or two. After my guitar had been gathering dust for a couple of years a friend of mine recommended Rocksmith and I decided to invest in learning this skill one final time. This time around I've been playing much longer than ever before, trying to put in an hour each day if I find the time. I can actually play along with some classics pretty nicely now, something I was never able to do before to this degree, not to mention I'm now mostly able to play without watching the frets all the time.Pros:Does a very decent job at recognizing what you play.You can set it up to automatically increase the difficulty and/or speed.Small mini games teach you essential skills and help you practice them in a much less boring way than if you would practice them normally.The Guitar Hero-like interface helps making the learning experience feel more like a game.Cons:The songs in RS2014 are somewhat harder than the ones in the first Rocksmith. You'd need to splurge some more to get those songs by first buying the original software and then spending some more on the import tool required to get those songs into RS2014.Some of the DLC that you haven't bought yet clutters up your song list, obviously urging you to buy it.The guitar tuner is a bit wacky. Sometimes the precision tuner tells you the string is tuned correctly, but the double-check it does afterwards will not pass. Getting past this point is difficult and skipping the tuning process because of it doesn't help either because the same string will give you trouble during the song causing you to ""miss"" notes.2 dollars per song (DLC) is quite a lot of money if you want to build a nice library.Despite my list of cons being longer than my list of pros I'm still very happy with what Rocksmith has done for me and I will definitely continue to use it to hone my new skills.

												If you want to benefit from Rocksmith and get better at Guitar or Bass, it WILL superceed your expectations, you just need to commit to it as a learning tool, because it takes time, a bit of pain on the fingertips for a few weeks and some genuine will to actually get better.  I wish I had this 15 years ago when I first picked up a guitar because I know for a fact I'd be twice the guitarist I am today if this was available, and learning as much fun back then.Dont buy it unless you're going to commit, its well worth every penny.

												I chose to begin and learn electric guitar on Rocksmith 2014 and it's been ~10 days since i bough the game and I can already say it's veeeeery helpful.You can learn musics you like, there are good tutorials, and the arcade mode is very useful and fun. In ~10 days i progressed a lot with this game, so if you want to learn guitar and you can't have a teacher to help you learn guitar, just buy this game ^^PS : yes the game helps a lot, but in my opinion, if you really wanna progress and be good at guitar one day, you'll have to watch tuto videos, and work on your own with exercices you can find on internet.PS² : A real teacher will be way better than the game if you can have one, because he will tell you if you take bad habits, and the game won't obviously, so becareful with that. And if you can have both the game and the teacher, well you'll be a pro in 2 days haha			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic ""game"".  I started playing without any previous music skills at all.  After a few months I'm enjoying playing a wide variety of songs.  It's very helpful for learning more complex songs as it's a quick and intuitive for providing how-to-play instructions and giving feedback about how to hammer on, pull off, and bend strings to get the notes you should.  The cable is fine quality, the software does pretty good at recognizing when you're hitting notes right (sometimes it doesn't ""hear"" certain notes - I've noticed this particularly in the opening of Disturbed's ""Voices"" for some reason it just refuses to work right for anybody at my place).  Every song comes with ""Authentic Tones"" to make your electric guitar or bass sound like it does during the songs via software rather than purchasing hardware to do it.  No, it's not 100% accurate - but for a few bucks per song, it's really pretty neat. Once I started getting familiar with the guitar, I preferred to use the ""riff repeater"" to crank the difficulty up to full, slow down the section I wanted to learn, then slowly speed it up.  Two players can be a lot of fun.  Of course, you need two cables.  It helps to play a bit easier of songs on two player.  Knights of Cydonia has yielded blisters from my friend's bass strings surprisingly quickly.  The ""announcer"" can be a prick.  Got a mere 75% accuracy on a difficult song your first time playing?  Well, that's a smarmy-toned comment for you about basically sucking.  F you, announcer guy.  This is the second time I've sat down to play this song.  God forbid if you get a 60%, it sounds like he thinks you should just kill yourself.  I wish there was an option to just turn his voice off.  He's even worse in the Lessons portion.  When you're first learning and trying to get a few notes right, he says the exact phrase over and over and over.  ""Announcer On/Off"" should be a single option.  You can turn off ALL the menu sounds and interface sounds, but that is just a work around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having a guitar sitting around for a year or so now, I decided to pick this game up to actually learn it. I was surprised at how much I actually learned just in the first day. In fact, you learn almost everything you need to know about guitar in Rocksmith that you need in order to play. The problem arises in the ways in which you are able to practice. As I suspected, the game is riddled with connectivity issues between the game and the guitar you are using between the Real Tone cable. Being a former 'professional' Guitar Hero player myself, I was afraid that the mini-games would be pretty much unplayable, and I was right. Sometimes strumming the correct note will result in a miss, and if strummed hard enough, you can actually strum any note, and the game will classify it as the correct note. Overall, I would still highly recommend picking up Rocksmith if you want to learn guitar. But I would advise staying away from it if you want to use it to practice.			",176,32,8,18,16,3,29

												I never knew how to play the guitar until the first Rocksmith came out. After buying the game and a cheap guitar i found myself spending contless hours and had to buy  RS2014 as soon as it came out!! Continuing my journey to master the guitar (i hope i'll master it soon, although i've pogressed massively in the last 5 years).  I played through pretty much most of the songs and spent around £40 on dlc on the PS4. (Back when i was a console peasant, still occasionally play it) I bought my pc and noticed it was on sale here on steam and could not resist buying it again for the CDLC's which has been an absolute joy to play along to. I've ALMOST mastered Bury Tomorrow's; Man on fire with a few more notes to learn on the guitar solo and then i would have completed my goal in 2 weeks. (I did not set myself a deadline). If you just stick at it for even 30 minutes a day, you'll find yourself playing the guitar much quicker than a session here or there. You need to be determined and accept that you'll make 100's, 1,000's of mistakes to make any progress otherwise you might as well not bother. If it had not been for Rocksmith, i don't think i would have ever thought about playing the guitar. I know you can't communicate to your fellow members on discord while playing Rocksmith, but i'm not bothered as i make much more progress just concentrating on learning new songs on the guitar. One of the best purchases i have ever made was buying Rocksmith/Rocksmith2014.			",4,0,1,0,2,0,0

												I've been playing guitar on and off for some years now and what I find the most disheartening after a long break is returning to the instrument and experiencing skill decay from the lack of practise. This is where Rocksmith 2014 comes in! If it were not for my puny callus-less fingers, I'd probably spend all day practising riffs, revising chords and working on general technique. The game keeps track of my progress and keeps throwing new stuff to do in my face. And before you know it a couple of hours have passed. Always new goals and song specific advice. I get to start out softly with a new song and I have different tools for learning the full versions at my own pace. I simply don't notice how much I am flubbing around because the game keeps me focused on progress and goals.There's also a bunch of the mini games I haven't tried yet, but I can see many nice additions since the first edition of Rocksmith. The session mode is also a decent addition, in that you get to use all your hard earned skills more freely with backing instruments.I find that the main draw of RS2014 is the motivational aspect, it gets you playing, it gets you practising. The game is not a replacement for a music teacher, since it cannot correct bad finger placement or perfectly detect the notes you play each time. It also lacks things in the music theory department, but you can find supplemental resources online easily these days. Maybe in ten years time, when the technology is there, we'll have a perfect artificial guitar teacher in RS. The current RS2014 is one of the better education games out there, I'd say.

												This game used to be great. USED TO. Ever since the remastered update, custom forge dlc is not working. Since Ubi wants to charge stupid high prices for the dlc, and the main roster sucks, I would not recommed picking up this game until CDLC is fixed, if ever. Actual dlc is very pricey, and in 2 years of watching every steam sale i have never seen it any lower than 40% off, which still adds up really fast. The main song roster gets very stale very fast. Lessons are meh, mini games are very simple and also get stale fast. The bread and butter is the learn a song section and the session mode. Learn a song is great, and scales difficulty to you so you learn more of a song by getting more notes as you get better. Session mode lets you jam out with background instruments and tempo that you select, works well. Both good, except now with remastered update my 400 song roster is only 35 songs. Thanks Ubi, I sincerely hope whoever was responsible for that gets herpes. So unless the community comes up with a workaround for cdlc, or you have over 2,000$ laying around for dlc, pass on this. What a shame, broke a great game, just so they could try to gouge us with more overpriced dlc. If/when the community finds a fix for cdlc, then by all means, this is a great guitar learning aid and a ton of fun, buy it. 0/10, feel like a kid who had his toys set on fire in the driveway on christmas and had to watch them burn. Edit- since a fix is out, and my cdlc works now, I can recommend the game again! Seriously though, if you pick this up go to custom forge and download the songs you want. Link for cdlc fix with new dll file is in this review's comments. 10/4/16			",76,8,1,14,9,2,11

												What do I say about Rocksmith 2014?  First, can you learn to play guitar or bass from Rocksmith.  I cannot say whether or not you can learn to play guitar from this software.  I have been playing guitar for about 20 years.  Second, can you learn songs for rhythm, lead and bass guitar?  So as a tool to learn songs for performing and recording guitar and bass, its here.  I have learned and recorded several songs from Rocksmith with rhythm, lead and bass guitar.  Could I have learned these songs without Rocksmith?  Probably!  It would not have been near as fun or intuitive as it is with Rocksmith.  New songs continue to be released each week.  Some I buy and some I don't.  Plenty of choice for me.  Rocksmith 2014 is a no brainer must buy too me.  Just don't forget to buy the cable first.  Waiting for the cord to arrive was torture.			",67,0,0,2,3,0,0

												Rocksmith is the best way to practice guitar. period. It's revolutionary and fun! It's the best way to learn how to play a song, and the session mode is genius and a fun way to jam and to play scales. Without Rocksmith being a beginner can be frustrating and downright boring (repeating scales, etc), but Rocksmith changes all that. If you own a guitar, or want to learn, and you like video games...then it's a no brainer. you must own Rocksmith!			",36,4,0,5,5,0,7

It is a great starting point, and if you keep at it you can learn some songs plus the various techniques.Performance is much better than the original Rocksmith, and the arcade games are better. Plus, it adds session mode to jam and practice scales along with a backing band. If you have the original you can unlock the content in the new game as well, including the older DLC.

												Having never picked up a guitar before, this was a bit of a difficult one for me to justify.  However, having messed with it for coming up on 20 hours at the moment, I can say that it's well worth it.  The lessons are simple (though you may hve to grab some outside material for everything to click), and the games are exceptionally fun, if occasionally frustrating.  I'm not 13 anymore, so I don't expect to get anywhere near good as quick as the young'uns will, but this game is able to keep guitar fun and interesting, a tall order for an instrument with such a steep learning curve.As for the DLC, I'm pretty sure the older Rocksmith stuff is compatible with the newer, and once you see how much work goes into every single song offered (the riff breakdowns, the practice modes, etc.), the price is understandable.  If I can eventually get to Satriani level, ultimate success for all!Also, don't forget to get the tone cable.  Game won't work otherwise.			",568,217,6,54,31,6,39

Even though I don't want to play all the songs, with the old songs in the mix too I can play for 2 hours or more and always play songs I like. It does take a bit of setup and for some reason it only recognizes the onboard sound card so any other sound cards/devices it wont use. Thats ok though... apparently my speakers still work!

												The Ubisoft guys did a nice job on this version.  I previously had the Xbox version, and I hated playing on my console through a TV.  The HDMI lag was not great.  With Rocksmith 2014, I bought the Steam version, installed in on the Mac i use for music work, and have it running through my studio setup.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Zero lag, great sound.Improvements this version include a session mode, where you pick a key and some band members, and they just sort of follow along with you.  While they arent the best backing band, it does give you an opportunity to practice scales and riffs with a rythm section behind you.  Another improvement is that it seems to more accurately catch what you are playing, shift difficulty at more appropriate times and the riff repeater is superb for really learning a part.  You get a ton of control over when it ups the difficulty (or whether it does) and speed.I've been playing guitar, rythm, lead and bass, for over 30 years now, and I can honestly say that while I thought this was going to be a toy, ala rockband, I have definitely increased my skill by playing it.  At first I dismissed the guitarcade as a gimmick, but it definitely has made my scales faster, and my accuracy and fretboard position awareness significantly better.The only complaints I have are:  1. I wish riff repeater was slightly more controllable as to when it starts and stop instead of being such large sections.  There have been a couple times where I was trying to learn a tough little flourish that occurs at the end of an easy section, and had to play the easy section over and over to get to the short riff because i couldnt shorten the RR selection enough.  That said, I got really good at it :)2. The instructions for getting the Rocksmith 1 content should have been clearer.  I did finally get it to work, but I shouldn't have had to go to the forums for answers, that should have been a simple step by step process with rock solid documentation.Overall I give it a 9/10.  Great tool for learning, and even for those of us with lots of experience there is a lot of learning to do.  It still amazes me when you spend 10 minutes on it, and suddenly pick up a tricky section as they throw it at you seemingly out of the blue at times.			",156,24,1,19,26,0,22

												Excellent software for practicing guitar and bass (pronounced /bās/), it's like having your very own practice coach in your computer!It's more of a tool for honing your guitar skills than an actual game, though the original Rocksmith was more of a game than this version is. It needs to be coupled with other material to give you music theory, but it does try to cover some of this itself. If you are just interested in playing with little care towards learning to play outside of Rocksmith, then it's certainly completely capable of providing an experience like that without having to learn anything more than what Rocksmith 2014 can teach you.But if you treat Rocksmith 2014 as a practice coach and find yourself a good theory coach, then you can fully expect at some point to be playing music outside of the game with relative ease. I've found a good place to start in getting that theory coaching is the Hal Leonard FastTrack Guitar (or Bass)  Method Starter Pack that includes a book, CD & DVD. It can be had for under $15 and covers the basics fairly succinctly.But like in the old joke ""How do you get to Carnegy Hall?"", the answer is ""practice!"", and that's what Rocksmith 2014 really brings to the table. It coaches you on new techniques and ramps up the difficulty as you get better at playing, but it provides an interactive environment that stimulates you and challenges you WHILE you get in that all so important practice time. It deals with the single biggest barrier to becoming musically adept, namely the 'grind'. You may never get to Carnegy Hall, but with Rocksmith 2014 practicing is no longer a drudge!If you intend to play songs outside of Rocksmith then you may want to invert the view of the strings on the screen, putting the low E on the bottom to match the way tab is written. Once you are used to this orientation, then downloading guitar songs that are notated in tab will afford you the ability to play them without having to mentally flip what you see on the paper because you avoided instilling bad habits while using Rocksmith by orienting the display to match the way tab is written from the start. Of course, if you never intend to play music outside of Rocksmith then it shouldn't matter...Multiplayer is pretty fun, though very basic in how it's done in Rocksmith. You can play any combination of guitar and bass, including emulated bass in multiplayer. If you haven't given this a try, you should! Multiplayer uses two separate profiles under the same account, we played at my friend's house so I had to start a profile under his account to do this. While I could also use this profile in single player, it's under his account and not mine so I can only use it when he's the one logged in. There doesn't seem to be a way to use my main profile under my account while we are logged in on his system, so any progress I make under the profile I use on his account is lost except when I'm playing multiplayer. Playing emulated bass is pretty fun by itself, but doesn't hold a candle to playing with a real 4-string bass! It's worth the money to go to the local pawn shop and buy a used Ibanez GSR100 or Dean Edge 9 bass for under $100. Like the BC Rich Bronze Series Warlock, most pawn shops have these around and usually for less than $100, though any Silvertone, Jay Turser, SX, Gregg Bennett, Squier, etc.  guitar or bass can be had at a pawn shop for less than $100 are all well worth the cost and enhances the Rocksmith experience.

												I've only dinked around with a few guitars over the years. I ultimately have very little idea what I'm actually doing with the guitar (save a few chords and memorized riffs here and there). Pure noob.When I first heard about the concept of Rocksmith years ago I was very interested in the idea of a Guitar Hero or Rock Band type game that you actually played a real guitar. (I was a huge fan of those games.) The problem...I didn't know how to actually play a real guitar. Could it be possible that a game like Rocksmith could teach me to really play? The verdict went out, most reviews and videos I watched came back ecstatic about Rocksmith being not only a game, but a fantasic teaching tool as well. The only downsides I caught wind of were a horribly designed interface, some sound interface and gain issues. Alas I decided to hold off and moved on never purchasing the 'original Rocksmith' game.Then came Rocksmith 2014. The same excitement bubbled up within me about a life long desire to teach myself guitar and play some of my favorite rock songs I've been listening to over the years. But would the game have fixed it minor short comings from the prior release? The reviews came in ....fantastic, 10/10, 5 stars, 9.5/10 etc.etc. Wow. They got it right and what's more they seemed to have greatly improved not only the interface, but the whole game experience itself. From the in game arcade where you can hone your guitar techniques that many guitar instructors teach in their lessons. To a great lesson section in which all the techniques and terminologies are carefully and skillfully delivered to those who need them, along with a practice session that increases the difficulty as you perform the lesson better. Then (of coarse) the actual learning of a song. Wow. Super fun. The problem with the real guitar lessons that my friends and other took is that they plateaued and grew bored with their slow progress and lame nursery songs for beginners. Rocksmith masterfully throws that old paradigm out the window and allows the player to learn their favorite songs, but at the level it detects the user can handle. Then it slowly increases the skill level as you master more perfectly the notes/chords that are launched your way. It is fun, motivational, and very progressive. Your skill will increase in just the first few weeks alone.The game also includes and virtual band called Session Mode where you can play with your own band that you define and calibrate then play with. They adjust to your key/chord progession, tempo, style...etc.  Just another of many wows within the game. This game is a gem and has found it's place in my heart.Ubisoft it seems has fully embraced the notion that a game like Rocksmith is equally used as a learning tool to learn from scratch how to play the electric/rythem/bass guitars, or the hone your skills even if your a guitar shredding vet. Both types seem to be happy with what Ubisoft has delivered this run.Their are of coarse a good selection of tracks included with the game itself. Or they are always adding to the growing library of DLC songs or song packs to more greatly expand your library of favorite guitar songs/licks/riffs etc.I haven't played a game where I was actually learning something that truly had a place and meaning outside of the gaming world. What a breathe of fresh air. They are trailblazing a new type of genre in effect. Not just the guitar playing genre, but the learning a real skill game genre. (lame name, but you get it.  :P  )Very excited about this one. It's just different in all the right ways from anything else out there. Try it, find out for yourself.-GooseSwan			",54,4,3,3,13,1,11

												Rocksmith is the best way to practice guitar. period. It's revolutionary and fun! It's the best way to learn how to play a song, and the session mode is genius and a fun way to jam and to play scales. Without Rocksmith being a beginner can be frustrating and downright boring (repeating scales, etc), but Rocksmith changes all that. If you own a guitar, or want to learn, and you like video games...then it's a no brainer. you must own Rocksmith!			",36,4,0,5,5,0,7

												Thanks to this game I have been playing more guitar than I have in a decade. It is a great starting point, and if you keep at it you can learn some songs plus the various techniques.Performance is much better than the original Rocksmith, and the arcade games are better. Plus, it adds session mode to jam and practice scales along with a backing band. If you have the original you can unlock the content in the new game as well, including the older DLC.

												This game is perfect for those that are just starting to learn how to play the guitar. It starts out at a very low level so you can learn some of the basic techniques and slow progress your way to the top of the charts. Anyone can pick up a guitar and learn how to play with Rocksmith 2014. I would seriously reccommend buying this game if you are interested in learning guitar and having a good time listening and most importantly, playing some of your favorite songs.

												I'm a complete novice.  Been using Rocksmith 2014 to learn bass.  Its been a blast.  Seems to be a really solid teachng tool.  It's only been about a week, but I've learned a ton and am noticeably better.  You take it at your own pace.  Do some lessons, hop over and try playing a song (which you level up, meaning it gets harder, based on how well you play it). Want to work on technique, try some of their arcade style video games that help re-inforce what you're learning.  And there's so much more, but if you are looking to learn to play or improve, this ""game"" is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent software for practicing guitar and bass (pronounced /bās/), it's like having your very own practice coach in your computer!It's more of a tool for honing your guitar skills than an actual game, though the original Rocksmith was more of a game than this version is. It needs to be coupled with other material to give you music theory, but it does try to cover some of this itself. If you are just interested in playing with little care towards learning to play outside of Rocksmith, then it's certainly completely capable of providing an experience like that without having to learn anything more than what Rocksmith 2014 can teach you.But if you treat Rocksmith 2014 as a practice coach and find yourself a good theory coach, then you can fully expect at some point to be playing music outside of the game with relative ease. I've found a good place to start in getting that theory coaching is the Hal Leonard FastTrack Guitar (or Bass)  Method Starter Pack that includes a book, CD & DVD. It can be had for under $15 and covers the basics fairly succinctly.But like in the old joke ""How do you get to Carnegy Hall?"", the answer is ""practice!"", and that's what Rocksmith 2014 really brings to the table. It coaches you on new techniques and ramps up the difficulty as you get better at playing, but it provides an interactive environment that stimulates you and challenges you WHILE you get in that all so important practice time. It deals with the single biggest barrier to becoming musically adept, namely the 'grind'. You may never get to Carnegy Hall, but with Rocksmith 2014 practicing is no longer a drudge!If you intend to play songs outside of Rocksmith then you may want to invert the view of the strings on the screen, putting the low E on the bottom to match the way tab is written. Once you are used to this orientation, then downloading guitar songs that are notated in tab will afford you the ability to play them without having to mentally flip what you see on the paper because you avoided instilling bad habits while using Rocksmith by orienting the display to match the way tab is written from the start. Of course, if you never intend to play music outside of Rocksmith then it shouldn't matter...Multiplayer is pretty fun, though very basic in how it's done in Rocksmith. You can play any combination of guitar and bass, including emulated bass in multiplayer. If you haven't given this a try, you should! Multiplayer uses two separate profiles under the same account, we played at my friend's house so I had to start a profile under his account to do this. While I could also use this profile in single player, it's under his account and not mine so I can only use it when he's the one logged in. There doesn't seem to be a way to use my main profile under my account while we are logged in on his system, so any progress I make under the profile I use on his account is lost except when I'm playing multiplayer. Playing emulated bass is pretty fun by itself, but doesn't hold a candle to playing with a real 4-string bass! It's worth the money to go to the local pawn shop and buy a used Ibanez GSR100 or Dean Edge 9 bass for under $100. Like the BC Rich Bronze Series Warlock, most pawn shops have these around and usually for less than $100, though any Silvertone, Jay Turser, SX, Gregg Bennett, Squier, etc.  guitar or bass can be had at a pawn shop for less than $100 are all well worth the cost and enhances the Rocksmith experience.

												Having a guitar sitting around for a year or so now, I decided to pick this game up to actually learn it. I was surprised at how much I actually learned just in the first day. In fact, you learn almost everything you need to know about guitar in Rocksmith that you need in order to play. The problem arises in the ways in which you are able to practice. As I suspected, the game is riddled with connectivity issues between the game and the guitar you are using between the Real Tone cable. Being a former 'professional' Guitar Hero player myself, I was afraid that the mini-games would be pretty much unplayable, and I was right. Sometimes strumming the correct note will result in a miss, and if strummed hard enough, you can actually strum any note, and the game will classify it as the correct note. Overall, I would still highly recommend picking up Rocksmith if you want to learn guitar. But I would advise staying away from it if you want to use it to practice.			",176,32,8,18,16,3,29

												This game is absoluetely wonderful, even for intermediate players to advanced. I play bass and this is not only an amazing way to learn songs but a phenominal way to achieve the bass tone you've been trying to, without having to buy expensive pedals. The custimization is surreal, Im able to listen to my self play on thousands of dollars worth of equitment, while only having a 500 dollar bass. Its wonderful because one day when I do decide to buy the expensive amps and pedals ill be very well prepared on what sound im wanting to achieve to help me with my future purchases. Tone Desiginer is worth the 17 bucks I spent on this game. And CDLC is fantastic for importing songs that Rocksmith otherwise cant get. Even if you dont have the real tone cable, you buy this program when its on sale, and purchase the cable later, its worth every penny.			",33,3,0,3,9,0,1

												A lot of people are probably going to be confused at why i have so many hours logged in this game yet im giving it a not reccomended rating, the main reason for that is because i have more been using this game as a makeshift amplifier, rather than the way it was intended. This game is a great way to learn how to play to an extent.  and this review is based on my personal experiences. this is not my reccomendation for your primary go to way of learning how to play Here is why:1. the game is designed around a notes or tablature style of learning and when you are playing individual notes, it doesnt tell you what the name of the note actually is, this is really troublesome if you are planning to use this program to learn to play the bass guitar. you really should learn at least a few scales before you start to just play songs.2. you get so used to playing the songs that you do learn to the backing tracks provided. i will explain why this is a problem after point number three.3. the game actually makes it sound like you are playing than you actually are, and often times you can just hit random notes during a guitar solo of a song and at least get a good enough portion of it recognized as right that the game still gives you a good rating on that section.  the reason that these two are a problem is that when you go to play a song that you think you learned and think that you can play outside the game, be it showing off your newfound skill to friends or just jamming at a guitar store, you will instantly realize that you have no idea what you are doing and that you have been learning the wrong thing the whole time.that said, the game is good i would say for those that already have some prior knowledge of how to play a guitar as it does give you a real time look at what notes are played where if you know your fretboard well enough already.  if you actually are looking to learn to play the guitar or bass, i suggest your best option is to invest in an actual music tutor.  that way you learn the right way first.  it may be more expensive that way, but it puts you better off in the long run.

It starts out at a very low level so you can learn some of the basic techniques and slow progress your way to the top of the charts. Anyone can pick up a guitar and learn how to play with Rocksmith 2014. I would seriously reccommend buying this game if you are interested in learning guitar and having a good time listening and most importantly, playing some of your favorite songs.

												One of the very best games I have ever played. It teaches so much while being fun at the same time. Amazing songs that you can learn as well. Cemetary Gates, Bat Country, some of my favorite songs. This game is a steal at any amount.			",36,0,0,8,5,0,3

												Rocksmith is the best way to practice guitar. period. It's revolutionary and fun! It's the best way to learn how to play a song, and the session mode is genius and a fun way to jam and to play scales. Without Rocksmith being a beginner can be frustrating and downright boring (repeating scales, etc), but Rocksmith changes all that. If you own a guitar, or want to learn, and you like video games...then it's a no brainer. you must own Rocksmith!			",36,4,0,5,5,0,7

												If you are looking to pick up guitar and have some spare time this is a great way to save money on lessons. I had already been playing for a while but I cannot express how much this has made me improve, and with great songs constantly coming out and classics already in game it's a great deal.

												Rocksmith 2014 neatly combines Game aspects along with Teaching aspects. Viewed as a game, it's solid--there are achievements, a very smooth difficulty curve with the game adjusting to your abilities on the fly, feedback, and a proper sense of progress.  Viewed as a guitar (and bass) tutor, it's excellent. The UI is well done, with intuitive controls.  There is no noticeable lag, and the hardware (a usb to 1/4inch jack dongle) is solid.  My guitar is a junk fender strat clone, but works well with the game.There is a large amount of DLC too. Pity it's never on sale!			",303,99,2,58,28,8,65

												The Ubisoft guys did a nice job on this version.  I previously had the Xbox version, and I hated playing on my console through a TV.  The HDMI lag was not great.  With Rocksmith 2014, I bought the Steam version, installed in on the Mac i use for music work, and have it running through my studio setup.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Zero lag, great sound.Improvements this version include a session mode, where you pick a key and some band members, and they just sort of follow along with you.  While they arent the best backing band, it does give you an opportunity to practice scales and riffs with a rythm section behind you.  Another improvement is that it seems to more accurately catch what you are playing, shift difficulty at more appropriate times and the riff repeater is superb for really learning a part.  You get a ton of control over when it ups the difficulty (or whether it does) and speed.I've been playing guitar, rythm, lead and bass, for over 30 years now, and I can honestly say that while I thought this was going to be a toy, ala rockband, I have definitely increased my skill by playing it.  At first I dismissed the guitarcade as a gimmick, but it definitely has made my scales faster, and my accuracy and fretboard position awareness significantly better.The only complaints I have are:  1. I wish riff repeater was slightly more controllable as to when it starts and stop instead of being such large sections.  There have been a couple times where I was trying to learn a tough little flourish that occurs at the end of an easy section, and had to play the easy section over and over to get to the short riff because i couldnt shorten the RR selection enough.  That said, I got really good at it :)2. The instructions for getting the Rocksmith 1 content should have been clearer.  I did finally get it to work, but I shouldn't have had to go to the forums for answers, that should have been a simple step by step process with rock solid documentation.Overall I give it a 9/10.  Great tool for learning, and even for those of us with lots of experience there is a lot of learning to do.  It still amazes me when you spend 10 minutes on it, and suddenly pick up a tricky section as they throw it at you seemingly out of the blue at times.			",156,24,1,19,26,0,22

												Excellent software for practicing guitar and bass (pronounced /bās/), it's like having your very own practice coach in your computer!It's more of a tool for honing your guitar skills than an actual game, though the original Rocksmith was more of a game than this version is. It needs to be coupled with other material to give you music theory, but it does try to cover some of this itself. If you are just interested in playing with little care towards learning to play outside of Rocksmith, then it's certainly completely capable of providing an experience like that without having to learn anything more than what Rocksmith 2014 can teach you.But if you treat Rocksmith 2014 as a practice coach and find yourself a good theory coach, then you can fully expect at some point to be playing music outside of the game with relative ease. I've found a good place to start in getting that theory coaching is the Hal Leonard FastTrack Guitar (or Bass)  Method Starter Pack that includes a book, CD & DVD. It can be had for under $15 and covers the basics fairly succinctly.But like in the old joke ""How do you get to Carnegy Hall?"", the answer is ""practice!"", and that's what Rocksmith 2014 really brings to the table. It coaches you on new techniques and ramps up the difficulty as you get better at playing, but it provides an interactive environment that stimulates you and challenges you WHILE you get in that all so important practice time. It deals with the single biggest barrier to becoming musically adept, namely the 'grind'. You may never get to Carnegy Hall, but with Rocksmith 2014 practicing is no longer a drudge!If you intend to play songs outside of Rocksmith then you may want to invert the view of the strings on the screen, putting the low E on the bottom to match the way tab is written. Once you are used to this orientation, then downloading guitar songs that are notated in tab will afford you the ability to play them without having to mentally flip what you see on the paper because you avoided instilling bad habits while using Rocksmith by orienting the display to match the way tab is written from the start. Of course, if you never intend to play music outside of Rocksmith then it shouldn't matter...Multiplayer is pretty fun, though very basic in how it's done in Rocksmith. You can play any combination of guitar and bass, including emulated bass in multiplayer. If you haven't given this a try, you should! Multiplayer uses two separate profiles under the same account, we played at my friend's house so I had to start a profile under his account to do this. While I could also use this profile in single player, it's under his account and not mine so I can only use it when he's the one logged in. There doesn't seem to be a way to use my main profile under my account while we are logged in on his system, so any progress I make under the profile I use on his account is lost except when I'm playing multiplayer. Playing emulated bass is pretty fun by itself, but doesn't hold a candle to playing with a real 4-string bass! It's worth the money to go to the local pawn shop and buy a used Ibanez GSR100 or Dean Edge 9 bass for under $100. Like the BC Rich Bronze Series Warlock, most pawn shops have these around and usually for less than $100, though any Silvertone, Jay Turser, SX, Gregg Bennett, Squier, etc.  guitar or bass can be had at a pawn shop for less than $100 are all well worth the cost and enhances the Rocksmith experience.

												I've been playing guitar on and off for some years now and what I find the most disheartening after a long break is returning to the instrument and experiencing skill decay from the lack of practise. This is where Rocksmith 2014 comes in! If it were not for my puny callus-less fingers, I'd probably spend all day practising riffs, revising chords and working on general technique. The game keeps track of my progress and keeps throwing new stuff to do in my face. And before you know it a couple of hours have passed. Always new goals and song specific advice. I get to start out softly with a new song and I have different tools for learning the full versions at my own pace. I simply don't notice how much I am flubbing around because the game keeps me focused on progress and goals.There's also a bunch of the mini games I haven't tried yet, but I can see many nice additions since the first edition of Rocksmith. The session mode is also a decent addition, in that you get to use all your hard earned skills more freely with backing instruments.I find that the main draw of RS2014 is the motivational aspect, it gets you playing, it gets you practising. The game is not a replacement for a music teacher, since it cannot correct bad finger placement or perfectly detect the notes you play each time. It also lacks things in the music theory department, but you can find supplemental resources online easily these days. Maybe in ten years time, when the technology is there, we'll have a perfect artificial guitar teacher in RS. The current RS2014 is one of the better education games out there, I'd say.

												This game used to be great. USED TO. Ever since the remastered update, custom forge dlc is not working. Since Ubi wants to charge stupid high prices for the dlc, and the main roster sucks, I would not recommed picking up this game until CDLC is fixed, if ever. Actual dlc is very pricey, and in 2 years of watching every steam sale i have never seen it any lower than 40% off, which still adds up really fast. The main song roster gets very stale very fast. Lessons are meh, mini games are very simple and also get stale fast. The bread and butter is the learn a song section and the session mode. Learn a song is great, and scales difficulty to you so you learn more of a song by getting more notes as you get better. Session mode lets you jam out with background instruments and tempo that you select, works well. Both good, except now with remastered update my 400 song roster is only 35 songs. Thanks Ubi, I sincerely hope whoever was responsible for that gets herpes. So unless the community comes up with a workaround for cdlc, or you have over 2,000$ laying around for dlc, pass on this. What a shame, broke a great game, just so they could try to gouge us with more overpriced dlc. If/when the community finds a fix for cdlc, then by all means, this is a great guitar learning aid and a ton of fun, buy it. 0/10, feel like a kid who had his toys set on fire in the driveway on christmas and had to watch them burn. Edit- since a fix is out, and my cdlc works now, I can recommend the game again! Seriously though, if you pick this up go to custom forge and download the songs you want. Link for cdlc fix with new dll file is in this review's comments. 10/4/16			",76,8,1,14,9,2,11

												I never knew how to play the guitar until the first Rocksmith came out. After buying the game and a cheap guitar i found myself spending contless hours and had to buy  RS2014 as soon as it came out!! Continuing my journey to master the guitar (i hope i'll master it soon, although i've pogressed massively in the last 5 years).  I played through pretty much most of the songs and spent around £40 on dlc on the PS4. (Back when i was a console peasant, still occasionally play it) I bought my pc and noticed it was on sale here on steam and could not resist buying it again for the CDLC's which has been an absolute joy to play along to. I've ALMOST mastered Bury Tomorrow's; Man on fire with a few more notes to learn on the guitar solo and then i would have completed my goal in 2 weeks. (I did not set myself a deadline). If you just stick at it for even 30 minutes a day, you'll find yourself playing the guitar much quicker than a session here or there. You need to be determined and accept that you'll make 100's, 1,000's of mistakes to make any progress otherwise you might as well not bother. If it had not been for Rocksmith, i don't think i would have ever thought about playing the guitar. I know you can't communicate to your fellow members on discord while playing Rocksmith, but i'm not bothered as i make much more progress just concentrating on learning new songs on the guitar. One of the best purchases i have ever made was buying Rocksmith/Rocksmith2014.			",4,0,1,0,2,0,0

												Short version: Yes you should buy it, yes it's worth it over Rocksmith 1. Rocksmith 2014 makes Rocksmith 1 look like an alpha. It's like they took all the small things that were bad in Rocksmith 1 (algorithm could ramp difficulty incorrectly, practice mode was outside of the song, ""story mode"" was dumb as all hell, visually sort of so-so, not very exciting) and irons them all out.You can play all your Rocksmith 1 DLC on 2014. All Rocksmith 1 DLC is available on 2014, with some arrangement changes to take advantage of some of the different techniques in 2014.The difficulty ramping algorithm is a hell of a lot better now, so it doesn't suddenly throw chords at you in the middle of nowhere like Rocksmith 1. You can hit the riff repeater INSIDE the song now to just practice a certain phrase, without having to go into a separate area. When you're done with it, you can hop back into the song where you left off. It's also got a breakdown of a song and the game detects areas you're struggling and suggests different lessons or games specific to the track you're working on. Missions guide you along to areas you need to work on, which gives you some direction if you're looking to improve. The game basically figures out which things you're good at at which you suck at, and recommends tracks that utilize those techniques to make you better.The game looks better visually and the frets are labelled as well as the fingers, making it easier to use. Purely visual, but when you practice now, you're basically inside a concrete practice room but as you improve your phrases a sort of ""portal"" appears on the wall where the notes are coming from which slowly widens to reveal a stage with a crowd. Nice effect--as you improve a song, more and more of the audience, lighting, and effects are revealed until you're basically on stage at 100%If you never played Rocksmith 1 but want to learn to play--you won't develop this really deep understanding of musical theory or anything from it, but you'll know enough to be able to pick up a guitar and play some tracks, as well as casually jam with people (if you remember your chords). Plus, lessons from a person are like $20 a pop, so this will pay for itself easily.			",172,59,4,24,26,2,40

												As a guitar player of quite a few years I got this mostly to just have some tracks to jam to along with a scoring system to make practicing more fun.  Even with a super fast pc, there is still lag, enough to throw a real guitarist off.  But by far the worst thing about this game is the horrid tab system it uses.  NO guitarist uses tab like this whether you reverse it or not it's still crap and too 'guitar hero'y.  If they woudl have just used standard tablature with a bouncing ball or highlighter it would have been infinitely better and easier to use.  The way it scrolls is a pain as well as it's hard to see what's coming.  Would be much easier to have a couple lines of music on screen at a time. I get the need to make it look like a game but that design choice makes it a poor music application and teaches bad habits as a guitar player.			",36,7,1,6,9,1,1

												I wouldn't call this this a game, it's far to deep into music to be that.Technique, chord and  scale lessons nicely back up around learning the songs themself, you even get suggestions on which part of the song or technique you should practice more on.At the end you play the songs completely without any tabs shown, but only when Rocksmith figures you can master it.It does not teach you theory, but that is always something people can study by googling it's different parts up.The only downside for someone who played guitar for years is that you only get single notes instead of the full chords when you start on a new song.There should have been an option labeled ""show me everything"".Quartermine's suggestion below fixes that to some extend.With that I mean, when you play loose notes over chord you usually have the chord written as well as the loose notes in pick order, Rocksmith misses out on the chord part.I usually just have to see the chord, then I know how to place my fingers and can easy hear in which order I have to pick them notes, RS kind of dumps it down to just being notes :DThe game misses out a few notes when it comest to solos and some loose notes in between riffs.Quite easy to hear and find them as a musician, but I guess that if your hearing isn't trained it can probably be of some annoiance.I did read some negative reviews regarding the game, and want to address a few of the things that people write in them.1. The guitar sound that you hear does require that you have at least a descent guitar, that does not mean expensive though.My cheapest guitar which is an Epiphone LP AFR does sound fine on mainly all songs.None of the videos that I heard on Youtube sound like that they are edited.I use mainly guitars with Humbuckers, some songs sound better with Single Coil pickups though.You might want to switch pickup positions and adjust on the volume and tone knob, a guitar is not something that you plug in and play by having everything at max.2. The USB cable is available trough Amazon, so it's not hard to find, although, I found it easyer to buy the game as a boxed version and then register it on Steam.3. There are no issues with buying songs and songpacks when you registred the game on Steam.4. If you bought Rocksmith 2014 and thought that it is just a game.... maybe check up a bit around what you buy before buying.5. You can probably cheat your way through some of the easy songs, but try to cheat your way through to a song like Pantera's Domination while playing as lead, good luck with that.6. Latency issues, there are no such issues, it works like any other ASIO USB driven sound interface, you do need to adjust for latency via Rocksmiths Audio menu.Also make sure to align the USB input with your soundcards output, 16bit and  either 44100 or 48000 Hz on both.If you still have issues, sorry to say so but something on your computer sucks in such case.

												While the game itself is a wonderful learning tool and fantastically fun for beginners and experienced guitarists, I cannot recommend the pc version of this game due to the windows drivers issues that many people including myself have. The USB cord for the guitar should a simple process of plugging it in to a USB port and once the drivers are downloaded, they will be saved and remembered the next time you plug and play. Instead the drivers are reinstalled everytime you reinsert the USB cable. Sometimes the driver downloads as it's suppose to as ""Rocksmith USB device"" but more often than not it downloads ""USB Audio Device"" which will not work, or even worse just ""hocksmit"" which does not work. I purchased a ton of the DLC songs hoping to add some songs I can learn to only find that the game has become unplayable after hours of trying to reconnect the device to get the correct usb driver. PLEASE create a driver which we can downloaded instead of the automatic driver detection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I relize that it is probably Windows at fault on this issue but if that's the case, cut them out and provide an easy solution to all those who have purchase your game for PC.			",100,13,0,13,6,0,19

												I'v had Rocksmith for a year or two now, and before the recent ""remasterd"" patch I enjoyed and would have recomended it.The recent ""remaster"" appears to be a cheap cash grab by UBIsoft, as all that really changed was streamlining the way DLC is purchased, while slaping the ""remasterd lable brought Rocksmith to the front page. The DLC update is all well and good I've purchased DLC in the past, but what killed this game for me with the recent patch, was UBIsoft removed the ability to play custom DLC, which is the reason I play. The majority of what I play is metal, songs not offerd as DLC and without access to those custom songs I have no intrest. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sometimes the game will pickup your notes, sometimes it won't.  I usually go through a single selection on a new song to learn it a bit before going on, and the difficulty will be on easy...so a single note...and it will still show it missing.  It's pointless to invest the money in the game, the cable, and in my case a guitar, and then not be able to reliably use the game to determine if you are playing correctly.  I'm still excited to learn and use the guitar, but this isn't reliable enough to do that.  It's a damn shame, too, because I've heard great things and was really looking forward to it.That said, when it works, it's awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a game, but a tool. An AMAZING tool, but don't go in expecting this to be a game experience. If you've never played a guitar, your fingers will hurt. You will also learn to play things. If you do already play guitar and want something to motivate you to practise more or just learn some new songs in a fun way, it's great fun. The Guitarcade games are a really well-disguised drill program that actually makes you better at techniques in a fun way, and there are little tutorials for all kinds of things that you my have never tried before even if you are experienced. This game solved the problem I'd always had with tremolos (I was holding the pick wrong. Simple fix, but the tutorial videos showed me what's up) and taught me some new techs too. If you have an interest in guitar, enough that you've already bought the instrument but have no idea where to go next, this is a no brainer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever have you thought to yourself while watching or listening to your favourite band & thought to yourself ""i would love to play a guitar just like them"", Well with a game like this you can. Rocksmith gives you one of the best learning experience  i've ever played. For me learning a guitar was pretty hard, having to read everything from books & practice. But with rocksmith it teaches you everything you need to know, from bending to slides to pull off & such. With other games though it does have its problems.Good things:You do actually learn how to play.Easy tutorials - The tutorials in the game teach you everything you need to know at a slow pace.Advancing difficulty - As you play a song it will gradually get harder & harder the better you do & will get easier if your'e doing bad.Song list - There are quite alot of songs to pick from but at the same time, for an extra £7.99 you can import all of the first rocksmiths songs.Built in Tunner - Its nice to have a tunner built into the game but it has its problems.Mini Games - There are quite alot of mini games to play which will improve your skills. There fun too.Bad things:I haven't really come across that many bad things about thins game, but i have seen a few.Tunner - The tunner in the game is a challenge, it will tell you what note to tune your string to but when you play it back the game says its wrong. An easy fix is to turn your speakers off when your'e tunning, it really helps.Precision - The game will not give you a free pass, which sounds good but sometimes the game picks up notes i'm not even playing & bending has to be perfect or else the game won't allow it.More modern music - My type of music might be different from others (Metal of course) but i wold like to see more up to date music. Dont get me wrong, some of the songs in game are fun to plat & listen too but i would like to see more modern music.Thats all i can basically say about this game, it is so much fun & will get you playing a guitar in no time. It is definitionally worth the asking price & if your'e serious about wanting to play a guitar i would get it.			",154,16,1,26,21,1,11

												This is the perfect companion for learning to play! You learn the fundamentals the fun way, (something that can't be said about many instructional alternatives). And as for learning the songs, this Rocksmith surpasses the former by making sure you learn and recall sections by heart before you haphazardly continue, they even ocassionaly remove note annotations when they are certain you can play without further instruction (aka Master Mode). The menu can be tricky at times and one might find that editing particular functions can take a little bit longer and can be a tad confusing, but that shouldn't be an issue for most users. All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone, whether the person is already familiar with their instrument or simply starting out.			",804,249,7,98,60,9,100

												About an hour in and I can see that this is a vast improvement over Rocksmith, which I poured over on 360 and then dabbled on PC.  The menus are snappy, and you can infinitely practice a song section however you like.    One of the reasons why I dropped off the first game was that it did a pour job of teaching you the chords for a song.  You couldn't practice chords easily, and as someone who knows nothing about playing the guitar, I was just completely lost and a bit frustrated.  It felt like I hit a ceiling and there didn't seem to be a way to improve.In Rocksmith 2014, the adaptive teaching system in the game gives you a set of tasks for each song to help you incrementally learn how to play it in real life.  It tells you what sections you want to practice, what chords you should learn, and just feels more like a teaching tool and less like a game.  The greatest improvement is that the riff-repeater is much like Rockband's riff-repeater, just infinitely looping a section and letting you adjust speed and difficulty on the fly.  No more loading, no more ""do it five times to beat your score"" gimmicks, just the ability to practice how you want, whenever you want.Yes, there are still goals and objectives, and the carrot on the stick is the various unlocks that the game will dole out to you as you meet these objectives, but if you're just here to learn how to play guitar (or more importantly, have fun playing some classic rocks songs), then Rocksmith 2014 is made for you.  I know I'm definitely looking forward to learning some of my favourite songs in the game.As an aside, the cable itself should be easy to find, especially if you can find a bargain bin copy of Rocksmith for one of the consoles.  I'd also recommend waiting for a sale on the first game and purchasing the disc import tool to give you instant access to 50 or so more songs to play - considering the price of the DLC, that's a very cheap way to bulk up your song library.

												Good game, got extremley better at guitar due to this game. BUTRedownloaded this game today because I felt like playing some guitar. Decided I wanted to buy a couple new songs to play. Went to the shop, found freebird and was ready to send them my money. But wait?! What is this?! I need to purchase the original rocksmith to buy this 3 dollar ♥♥♥♥ing song?This has been braught to their attention multiple times and they haven't done anything about it. Why should I buy a game that I will never play just so I can buy a ♥♥♥♥ing 3 dollar song?PLEASE ♥♥♥♥ing fix this			",55,6,1,4,14,0,5

												Ok a little back ground.  I've been playing guitar for a while and figured this would be fun.Here is why I am disappointed though:1.  You have to buy thier ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cable.  I have some studio gear that more than likely produces less latency than a dumb USB to 1/4"" patch cable yet I can't use it unless:2.  In microphone mode I can select my audio gear, however Rocksmith WILL NOT accept a noise floor of zero.  I had to rub the strings while ""muting"" in calibration mode just to tell rocksmith that the noise floor isn't as high as they want it.  This parameter should be ajustable IMO.3.  When you do you mic mode you can't monitor your input.  I know they probably don't want a bunch of people complaining of feedback though so I guess I get it but again annoying.4.  There doesn't seem to be any way to bypass all the beginer stuff if you just want to play around and see how on point you are.IDK I get what they were going with here, and I do plan on snagging the cable to see if it's any better but the PC version should (in my opinion) take input from stuff other than the crappy cable they sell for this game.

												NOTE: I'm only reviewing the Bass part of RocksmithGood- Cool selection of songs- Good lessons (some times)- Challenging in a good and bad way- This game has genuinely helped improve my bas playing and i would reccomend it to people if they had the money.Bad- Can't skip the start up screen.- I though any cable was compatable with it but turns out not. Trying to get the cable is hard enough but the price of it is way too high just to even start playing the game.- Unless you're tuning above E standard forget it. The way the game picks up the tone is absolutely terrible, especially the E string. I can barely play most of the E flat or lower tunes- Sometimes notes just don't appear for me when playing (Eg. X-Kid)- Some lessons just don't work. I'm trying to do the slides lesson and it can't even pick up me doing the slides (My bass is in tune, and my sound seems pretty clear) leaving me to try and attempt the other lessons.Even though im giving a negative review I'm still going to play the game none of the less, because even though it costs a lot to play, its better than the other crappy ""lesson"" Websites/Games.

												This game is f**king great! I love it to the max, The first day I got it I played it for 11 hours. Though I do not recommend  this to new players unless you are going to stick to the few really easy songs on it. I also think if you want to learn a song use tabs like http://www.songsterr.com/ . it is easy to remember then flashing notes coming at your screen. I think Rocksmith  is more for playing songs you have already learned, it is really fun. I don't play the arcade games much because I get enough practice with the fret board on my own, but some are cool like the zombie game thats like ""The Typing Of The Dead"" but with chords instead. There is few songs that I enjoy though, such as; The trooper - Iron Maiden, War Ensemble - Slayer, Heart Shaped Box - Nirvana, Pour Some Suger On Me - Def Leppard, Peace Of Mind - Boston, Knockin On Heavens door, Spirit Of The Radio - Rush, and Thuder Kiss '65 - White Zombie. there is also a lot of good DLC songs, like Iron Maiden songs, Megadeth songs, Pantera songs, etc. You also need a Rocksmith Real Tone Cable, which I have had mine from my Xbox Version. you can buy a Cable at a Gamestop/EB games I believe. Anyways, I think this is one of the greatest games I have ever played and I suggest getting it to the average guitar player, or skilled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply amazing.  If you are looking for a quick way to learn the guitar, or if you are already skilled but want something to test you, or just want to make practice fun this game is for you.  The detailed system really gives you that one on one feeling of going to lessons, and the learn a song mode breakes down into segments and lets you learn it at your own pace by starting off slow and getting more difficult as you do better in the song, or if you are feeling really confident you can ramp the difficulty up to max from the very begging.  Also you can now use your computer as an amplafier and add any type of effect to make all kinds of different sounds.  As if all of these awsome features were not enough they have added the all new session mode making it easy to just jam out with a band that changes with you and pushes you to solo.  This game is a great buy for anyone with a guitar with any amount of skill.			",143,11,1,7,7,1,3

												This is a great idea, performed only adeqately, with very limited diversity in song choices. They had the chance to make this game completely top notch but they settled for much less IMO and are really grubbing of the money about it too. I'm very disappointed that you cannot purchase all of the DLC at the advertised prices. Only the DLC specific to Rocksmith 2014. Otherwise you have to purchase the original Rocksmith ($29.99 right now on Steam and Amazon) and then another $10 tool to import the songs into Rocksmith 2014. Then you have to pay for the $3.00 song that you wanted in the first place. They are just sticking it in and twisting it, coming and going. They should have had some finger-picking and classical rock songs included but nothing like that. No rockabilly or hot rod sounding rock (like Commander Cody, Junior Brown, Johnny Cash). No real good blues rock either (Gary Moore, Seasick Steve and the like). I mean what artist wouldn't want millions of people learning their songs the correct way? How hard is it to sign up these artists? Well those are the main bad points about the game IMO. The good? Well it does a pretty good job of recognizing my guitar's notes for the most part although I have to repeat notes sometimes in the arcade games. Many of the songs are also very good and seem to be complete including multiple (dual) leads. There are tons of great sounds and effects for the guitar and lots made up specifically for the featured songs. You can slow the song without changing pitch with the riff repeater, allowing you to really zone in on tough licks. I also really like Session mode which really made me think a lot more about chord tones. There should have been some lessons for recognizing and utilizing them more effectively.I like the game. It's really more of a practice tool and its pretty effective as that. I have recommended it to friends and other musicians I know. Its just that I believe they could have done the game better and they probably will in the future ( I hope anyways)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you never played Rocksmith games before - get Rocksmith 2014. If you have played Rocksmith 2011 - get RS2014 and Disk Import Tool to transfer old default songs to new versions (DLC from RS2011 will be transfered for free without Disk Import tool).Rocksmith 2014 features greatly faster menus and UI in more responsive, better and more detailed lessons and more techniques impemented to be used in songs. Especially repeater function has been drastically improved as you can turn it on with mere press of one button during the song. I'd call it a superior to RS2011 in every way, however I didn't like style of some of new mini-games and bright, sterile looks of the backgrounds. Also, Rocksmith Path feature from the older game is gone and replaced by plain missions. I miss playing gig's sometimes.But, other than than, RS2014 is a good step forward.			",326,65,8,31,41,2,36

												this is a good game but it is very hard to start if u already know how to play the notes on guitar. sadly this game is like guitar hero in the way that u are not actualy learning the notes just learning where they are on your guitar. this game is good for the new player who just wants to learn some riffs and songs but not for the common guitar player that is looking to learn how to play songs. i have played guitar for 12 years now so i now where the notes are and how to read them on music. this ""guitar hero"" method of learning the notes starts u back at square one except for positioning and posture things. so if you already know how to play the guitar i would not get this.

												If you own an electric guitar or bass, own any of the supported systems, enjoy playing rock music, you MUST own this ""game"".  It is everything that Guitar Hero and Rock Band want to be, for those who can handle a real fretboard.  I do have just a few complaints... but I list them more as motivation for improvement (hopefully in patches, but at least in future versions)...A few interface navigation issues.  Generally ""back"" should return you to where you were.  That's not true 100% of the time.  Generally crossing between ""Learn a Song"" and ""Score Attack"" needs to have more attention devoted to it.  I think it works correctly if you access ""Learn a Song"" for a song from the Score Attack menu (IE, if I'm on ""Some Song: Score Attack"", select ""Learn a Song"", then use ""Back"", I'm at ""Some Song: Score Attack""), but the inverse isn't true.  If I'm at ""Some Song: Learn a Song"", then select ""Score Attack"" and use ""Back"", I'm in the list of songs for Score Attack.Fine-tuning could be a hair easier.  I noticed on some songs when I got into Drop-D on my bass that I needed to tune the open D down a hair for the first three frets to be closer... don't know why... but I was failing hard on the 2nd-4th frets of the low string until I did. It may be different in other modes, but at least in Score attack, once it decides your string is in tune, it moves on, and there is either no way, or no easy way to keep measuring the one string before moving on.Lack of desktop UI optimization.  This is incredibly frustrating...  the game was obviously designed for a least-common-demoninator interface... so we have a UI that was meant for a simplistic game pad, even when using superior interface devices on a Windows or Mac PC. I think the best illustration is in sorting songs.  If you're on a device with a mouse (or touch for that matter), why not have drop-downs?  I tend to try to sort by tuning to see what to play next (I want to play them all, and don't want to retune between each song).  Tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, ""Crap, passed it"", tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.....    WHY??  A search box would be great too...  we can certainly type a name if we're using console buttons remapped to a keyboard.  Oh... mission to do a particular song.... tab, tab, tab, tab, ""crap, passed it"", tab, tab, tab, tab, ""Starts with 'B'? Great, I'm in the 'W's... "", up-arrow... hold.... hold.... hold...........    Search box...   click (search box entry), b, possibly a second letter in the title, click.  Done.   Even better.... if the mission is very specific, hyperlink the objective.  Actually, in most of the missions I can think of, you could give a button to go for it... or at least get closer (and that'd be even better for the consolers).  Next Mission: ""Achieve 5% Mastery in Some Song"", Press [whatever] to go to Learn a Song: Some Song.  Even with ""play a new song"" or ""play x new songs"", you could use that button to either randomly go to a new song, or open a list, filtered to unplayed songs.I could go one all day, but perhaps one more: Learn a Song, Riff Repeater, setting difficulty.  It'd be really helpul to have an easy way to tune the song's difficulty to matching the score attack levels (easy, medium, hard).  I figured out pretty quick that I need to try to get Platinum on Easy and Medium before using learn a song, because if I'm pretty good at the full studio arrangement, seeing the simpler arrangements screw me up.... but sometimes I'd like to use riff-repeater to nail the medium-level version (and on a few rare songs, the ""easy"" version).I've heard Zeppelin and Metallica are out because the record companies won't get on board. I'm guessing AC/DC is in the same boat. Here's some great DLC that may be easier to license:  Cake, lots of Cake...  SUPER bass lines, decent guitar riffs... I think that'd be fun stuff good starter pack may include ""Hem of Your Garment"" (awesome bass throughout, good rhythm through most of it... don't think there's a lead 6-string part in this one), ""Sheep Go to Heaven"" (something for everyone), and ""Arco Arena"" could be a really fun, short instrumental.  Ok... now here's something you're REALLY missing out on.  Music software for gamer geeks...    and NO JOCO?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played for several hours straight.Much callouses on fretting fingers.Went airsofting shortly after playing.Took a shot to one of my fretting fingers - felt nothing.10/10 Would numb fingers again.In all seriousness, if you wanna learn to play Guitar or Bass and have no idea where to start - Grab this.

Also, it's a really nice way to let off some steam and rock out to some really well picked and awesome tunes!

												I asked around about this before even thinking of buying as I didn't want to get some Guitar Hero type game. The word from most everone from beginner players to folks that have been playing for years was, it's worth it, so I bought it. I have to agree with what people said. I've been playing guitar for a few decades and RS14 is not only a great practice tool but even has a few things to show seasoned players. The program itself is worth buying, no question about that, but, the inability to import DLC songs from RS1 is a drag. I would like to get a bunch of DLC songs from RS1 but can't, I guess it's a fix Steam needs to correct, I hope they do it soon. I say buy RS14 and you should like it and if your a new player it will help you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros ----- Using a real guitar.- Fun and educational.Cons ------ You need a proprietary cable to play. Ubisoft seem to have prevented third parties from providing cables.- Ubisoft have tied the game to Uplay accounts, trying to get you to have Steam AND Uplay accounts and DRM software installed (on top of the game!). It's confusing as to how much need it – some people imply you have to have a Uplay account, some that there are problems if you don’t sign in, others that you don’t need it at all. A good example of how confusing extra DRM makes playing a game. I don't know if they have eased off on this, but on my latest install I was able to skip the Uplay login with Esc and get in to the game, though you have to do this every time and ignore the server error messages. I don't agree with Ubisoft asking for personal data such as email addresses, and wanting you to set up more accounts and passwords.- Adverts; it slips songs to buy into songlists; opens browser tabs without permission, trying to sell stuff. It seems to be trying to milk you for money and data from the moment you click to play it. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Other ------- Some songs use different tunings, so if you don't want to regularly retune your guitar then the number of songs you'll play are far fewer than the listed number.- US accents in the game (narrator/helpguides).

												I have only one problem with this game: Dynamic Difficulty.If you are a beginner, TURN THIS OFF, IT WILL MAKE YOU HATE YOURSELF.What Dynamic Difficulty does is, once you reach a certain level, it immediately bumps you up. For example, if you do OK on a 30% difficulty setting, even though you only played through it once and were decent,  the very next time it will be bumped to 50%, and I had no idea dynamic difficulty was on. I kept thinking to myself, ""I've been practicing for weeks, why the ♥♥♥♥ am I getting worse and worse and worse?""And then I realized it's because the game was trying to bump me up to 100% difficulty within minutes. It will not wait for you no. I kept getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and discouraged because of this stupid, pointless feature. I never wanted to play guitar again until I finally learned what this poinltess, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feature was. I love the game, and now that I can actually move at my own speed it's a lot more fun  and easy. In short, dynamic difficulty is like an AP class, it will not wait for you to be caught up. If you can only play 20%, you'll do that once, get an okay performance, and then immediately the next time you play it will be changed to 40% difficulty, and if anyone here is like me, I can't learn 100% mastery in guitar in 3 hours from ground zero. Horrible pacing and just a god awful feature to be automatically turned on, especially for beginners.It'd be like after you beat a song on easy in guitar hero, the next song is medium, and then after that it's immediately switched to hard right afterwards. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Grade A game though, 9/10.			",23,15,0,3,2,0,0

												First thing first - this is a game. If you are wondering if this game going to make you a guitarist, the short answer is no. I used to play drums, and tried to learn guitars and basses from friends before, this game helped me to learn bass to somewhat extent, but guitars - not so much. From my experiene, if you are experienced guitarist, this game will teach you the proper chords for some songs. For players with with some experience, you'll learn some more things. For noobs, well you'll learn some things, but learn from a real person to pick up things first, then come back to play this. This is a good ""game"" and fun to play. But don't expect to be something in 60 days.			",4,0,2,2,5,0,0

												Its aight..Okay on a serious note, i've been playing bass for over 10 years and even then I still felt like I was always learning something new. I never thought I would ever attempt to slap/pop, until I loaded up Higher Ground by RHCP. First run through almost impossible, but I kept at it and kept playing. Now I have such a basic concept that I can play through the song with no problems. Keep in mind, this game WILL NOT make you a God at guitar/bass your determination and willing to learn/practice will make you become a God. Switching it up now, i've actually used this game to learn guitar. I started a year ago and I can already tell a huge improvement which in theory keeps me pushing to become even better. This game CAN teach you to play if you've never picked up a guitar before, the amount of teaching videos and techniques are great for a beginner. I used to play around with tabs on Ultimate Guitar, but this game makes me enjoy playing bass even more than I already do!! If you'ce had any doubt in your mind, push that away and tell yourself you want to learn...then buy this game and keep at it. I believe in you :D			",190,36,11,12,13,3,8

												Pros ----- Using a real guitar.- Fun and educational.Cons ------ You need a proprietary cable to play. Ubisoft seem to have prevented third parties from providing cables.- Ubisoft have tied the game to Uplay accounts, trying to get you to have Steam AND Uplay accounts and DRM software installed (on top of the game!). It's confusing as to how much need it – some people imply you have to have a Uplay account, some that there are problems if you don’t sign in, others that you don’t need it at all. A good example of how confusing extra DRM makes playing a game. I don't know if they have eased off on this, but on my latest install I was able to skip the Uplay login with Esc and get in to the game, though you have to do this every time and ignore the server error messages. I don't agree with Ubisoft asking for personal data such as email addresses, and wanting you to set up more accounts and passwords.- Adverts; it slips songs to buy into songlists; opens browser tabs without permission, trying to sell stuff. It seems to be trying to milk you for money and data from the moment you click to play it. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Other ------- Some songs use different tunings, so if you don't want to regularly retune your guitar then the number of songs you'll play are far fewer than the listed number.- US accents in the game (narrator/helpguides).

												YOU HAVE TO GET THISits an awesome game that takes songs, techniques and lessons to any level you choose making it as easy or as hard as you choose. learning songs is the best part of it, because of the riff repeater. If you're struggling with a solo or a verse or even the whole song it lowers the difficulty for you or you can choose how much you want the difficulty to be. The other reason that learning songs on Rocksmith is the fact that it feels like you are playing in a band with all the music while you play. The percentage at the end just makes you want to get to 100%. Yes it does have some flaws like it doesnt always pick up notes unless the volume is at max (might just be my guitar) and the difficulty can go from easy to quite difficult on certain songs, but you can't do anything about that. But overall I love this game and have learnt more in a month of playing this than i  have over the past 3 months of youtube and guitar tabs. A MUST BUY FOR ANY GUITARIST!!			",74,6,2,6,9,0,14

												Well I've played this game on my friends PC. Basicly, this was a good game the intrface, gameplay, etc everything was good. Except you must consider a few things before you can play. I downloaded Rocksmith 2014 from Steam online actualy, which comes some troubles. First, you will not get any real tone cable from it and secondly the real tone cable was the only thing that makes this game work legally. I found it hard to get the real tone cable in my country. Some cables are sold with the orginial DVD-rom installer. So what's the point of intalled it online after all? Some options said that I could buy the cable online, but it costs too much for shipping load. So I really recomend you guys to play this game because it's awesome game, but i sugest that you buy this game with real tone cable included			",2,1,0,2,1,0,0

Posted: April 4
SummaryRocksmith 2014 is the absolute best way to learn to play guitar (and/or bass guitar). In my opinion, that makes it the best game ever!Background7 years of drums/percussion in middle and high school. 2 years of ""ukelele band"" in elementary school. Zero knowledge of guitar-playing -- I didn't even know if I was holding the pick right when I started Rocksmith. I've now logged ~300 hours between original Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014. And I'm still loving it (just played multiplayer with a buddy for 2 hours tonight).Full ReviewOriginal Rocksmith was buggy and lacked a real ""Riff Repeater"", but I liked the focus on points and leveling -- it kept you trying to improve on specific sets of songs until you could perform them (at a certain level of skill).What sets Rocksmith 2014 apart is 1) the Riff Repeater, and 2) Session Mode.The ""Riff Repeater"" lets you pause a song, increase or decrease the difficulty and speed of sections of the song whenever/however you want. When you successfully play those parts on the speed/difficulty you chose, it can increase the difficulty and/or speed up automatically. This is perfect for learning new songs or working out the kinks in those tricky solos.Now, ""Session Mode"" could be sold as a $20 game in and of itself: you pick the key, tempo, chord progressions, and backing instruments and start jamming away. The notes in your key and current chord are highlighted; the backing instruments (and there's a wide selection to choose from) will accompany your play style/syncopation. It's great for working on solos, rhythms, etc. (I wish the beginner guitar player in the high school jazz band had access to this!)And Rocksmith 2014 keeps getting better! The ""remastered"" edition released recently includes tweaks to improve sorting and organizing your songs and favourites.How I recommend using it* Borrow your friend's electric guitar -- at least until you realize that you adore guitars. Then buy one on Craigslist.* Commit to ""60 days of rocksmith"": play at least 15 minutes every day for 60 days. Take videos of your progress!* After a few weeks, use your standard guitar to play ""emulated bass"", realize you adore bass, then buy one on Craigslist.* Buy amps, pedals, and mics to build your own music studio.* Get your friends to try Rocksmith, get hooked, buy their own guitars, and play multiplayer Rocksmith with them.* Find a decent drummer and -- presto! -- you've got a cover band. :D* World peace ensues.Tips* When I first tried to memorize a song above my skill level (Carry on my Wayward Son), I realized that my technique was counter-productive. Instead of memorizing, try to work on ""sight reading"" in Rocksmith first. (After completing my first ""60 days of rocksmith"", I set the ""Level Up"" difficulty to ""faster"".)* Once you've built your chops a little bit, you can more easily return and pick up those awesome songs you love!* To help with sight reading and chop-building, I usually choose ""Nonstop play"" mode, set to 20-30 minutes (often set to my faves).* Keep a few of the Rocksmith DLC in your Steam wishlist so that you can get alerted/emailed whenever there's a sale (which happens several times a year for about 40% off each song DLC). I usually pick up a few more DLC songs/song packs whenever there's a sale.* Setting a milestone (like a song you want to master) is a great way to stay committed. Also, doing the ""60 days"" with someone else can help you stay committed.* Lastly, I recommend picking up both original Rocksmith and the ""Disc Import tool"" because they let you play *most* of the original song selection and any original Rocksmith DLC you own inside Rocksmith 2014 (which gives you the better Riff Repeater).What I think they could do better* More Muse!!! (I need all the Muse!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the perspective of an experienced guitarist (i.e. me), this is a great game (although it's only loosely a game. It definitely has some heavy software-type elements). Playing songs is literally like Guitar Hero for actual guitar (as should be quite obvious from screenshots and such), the Guitarcade is great fun, and probably helps new players learn things in an enjoyable fashion, and the session mode is a fantastic way to practise and improve soloing (it helped me learn quite a lot about scales).Basically, if you play guitar or want to play guitar, get this.

												This is easily my GOTY. I've been playing guitar on and off for over 15 years, and I could have only dreamed to have this when I first started out. Part of the on/off nature of my playing through the years is just getting bored - picking up the guitar, noodling around with the same old riffs, looking up some tabs here and there, but otherwise doing the same old thing each time. With Rocksmith, there's so much to do and with the riff repeater it's so easy to practice those trouble spots that I normally would have just skipped over before. It's got a great song selection and even though I may not necessarily like the style of some of the songs, I still enjoy playing them as they each bring something new and different to the table.

												This game is absolutely amazing. It is the best way to practice the guitar I've ever seen. It's so fun you will forget you're practicing and might not even realize just how much you are improving. If you like playing the guitar and would like to learn how to play some popular songs this is the game for you. Playing an actual guitar can be intimidating for those without experience, but this game will adjust itself for people of all skill levels.However, even though the game has several new features that were added since the last instalment, I'm not sure they warrant an entirely new game with a higher price tag. Also, I would like to see more songs available for DLC and idealy at a lower price.			",82,25,0,8,6,0,5

												It is a great improvement on the previous iteration, faster load times, more intuitive e fluid tabs, session mode its a great and fun way to pratice scales e harmonies, and the little arcade games offer a good fun way to pratice a few aspects of guitar playing. Unlike the previous Rocksmith which had a game mode, this one does not, so its more of a learning tool than a game. It's a great way for beginners to learn guitar, if you are a intermediate or advance player not so much, altough you can still have lots of fun with it. I would love to see added a feature to allow you to control individual instrument tracks in 'Learn a Song' mode, or at least the ability to solo the guitar tracks, also the ability to control the master level of the song while playing because sometimes it is a little boring having to play the same song a few times in the lower easier levels in order to get to a level that will challenge you.

												This game is a big improvement on the original and fixes nearly all of the really annoying problems it had. I highly recommend this if you are into guitar or bass at all, beginner or advanced. The good:* Session mode is a huge addition that lets you improvise over a customizable band that reacts to what you are playing. This alone is worth the purchase price.* The tracklist and DLC so far is great and if you own Rocksmith you can import the 50 songs from that for $10* Large video library with lessons working from the very basics to more advanced techniques* Master mode will now gradually fade out notes from sections you do well in rather than throwing the entire song at you with no notes.* Riff repeater makes it easy to stop in the middle of a song and practice a section at any diffulty or speed you want. This is a HUGE improvement.* The new score attack with leaderboards is a lot of fun once you have a song down pretty well* The interface is, for the most part, much better.The bad:* The game seems much more forgiving on single notes now but can be very difficult to get chords to register completely throughout an entire song. Bends work fine on guitar but the game seems to have trouble recognizing them consistently on bass.* While the guitarcade games are better than the original's, they suffer from a lack of options and too much downtime after a loss to really be a great tool.* Still no way to just just study the tabs without playing the song* Career mode is gone and the game no longer plays back your performance after you've finished.

												So far im really impressed by this product. The lessons are very well produced, the mini games are fun and absolutely useful for basic skills, and the song selection is nice and diverse, with the game increasing the difficulty at a very organic pace. Having never played a bass before, i feel like im learning at a good speed, and if i spent more time practicing i could really ramp it up. My only complaint is that occasionally if i hit an incorrect note while playing a song, the game detects it as the right note, which makes the game think im better than i am, which doesnt help me learn.

												Pros- Excellent music tool- Heaps of up to date songs... Even I found stuff I love, and my taste is... interesting!- Teaches you stuff you otherwise wouldn't want to study (I hate practising scales... normally)- Teaches you stuff you think is too hard (like scales) and makes it 'easy'- Easy to setup and use- Will help you if you know nothing about guitars- Will make you a good intermediary guitar player than any other tool- Really cool 'solo jamming' functionality providing you with improv practise- The multiplayer is really cool, just get another cable and have a great Jam without dragging an amp along :)Cons- Will make an hour go in 10 minutes, so you'll be late for work/school a lot- UPlay!!!!!!! update Steam... update Uplay.... update the game!!!!- Sometimes chords aren't picked up right, can be a bit fussy that way (that's being picky though, it's usually fine if you strum the chord right)- I'd like more feedback while I'm playing without going into score attack- The recommendations/goals... not sure I love them, but hey its' there to encourage.- the dynamic difficutly can sometimes be a bit annoying. I understand it's purpose, but I'd rather play the song right and slower than playing a note every 10 seconds sometimes (R U mine... I'm looking at you!!) :)- The lead arrangement for 'knocking on heavens door' is stupid :) Thoughts:- Even more seasoned players will get use out of this (I've played over 20 years)- There is no better guitar tool than this- I'm betting that the play list of cover bands will change because of this :)- Soon most songs from this game will become titles you aren't allowed to play when testing guitars at shops as they will all be played too much :)- Cover bands will have a more critical crowd as everyone will know every single note they're stuffing up :)- You can use the supplied cable for recording in other music programs; so get something a tool like Guitar Rig 5 (currently) and Sonar and start making music!!- Playing guitar will make you more attractive to women of the other sex :)- Don't blame me if you suck anyway after this :) ",43,1,1,7,10,0,21

												Very useful to learn to play a guitar or bass, this helps learn different techniques, from palm mute, shifting, artificial harmonics to two-hands tapping and arpeggios.			",50,4,2,8,9,0,13

												First there was Guitar Hero. It was cool. Then there was Rock Band. It was cooler. Then we got Rocksmith. It was awesome. Now we have Rocksmith 2014 - it's just perfect. Finally something you can really use to improve your skills on playing guitar or bass. Setlist is on pretty wide spectrum and there should be something for everyone. If not, there's always DLCs of some of the most popular artsists songs to learn and play.Very good for learning guitar/bass no matter if you're just a beginner or even a bit more advanced player.

												I put some hours down in the first rocksmith and really enjoyed it. After reading a IGN review i brought it as i'd been holding off thinking it was just the same thing released again as a way for them too make money but boy was i wrong! The songs, the smoothness and no long as loading screen crowd gimics or tuning your guitar over and over (unless the song needs it)			",204,64,9,20,30,6,33

The interface is much more readable and far easier to navigate than in the previous edition and the goals are more concise than ever.

												Expectations: Learn to play the guitarFirst impression: I think I will be able to play the guitar!Enjoyed every second of it so far. Had some set backs: broke 2 guitar strings and audio would not work from startup. Solved both problems by first stockpile of 6 packs of guitar strings and closing all other apps until I found another that was taking control over my audio.This game takes you by the hand in the tutorial and has a very supportive teaching system. If you are struggling it slows down to a crawl and let's you repeat specific sections until you get it right then it increases gradually to full speed. Also tried the miniarcade. Games are full, comeplling and for the most part so evocative I could not help myself to smile or laugh.My advice, buy some guitar strings along with the first purchase (3-6 packs is fine) don't worry wich type just pick electric guitar strings and find one according to your budget. Also get a guitar winder and a decent pair of wirecutters (dont use a nail clipper).TL;DR: BUY! BUY! BUY!			",64,5,1,5,4,0,5

Posted: April 4
SummaryRocksmith 2014 is the absolute best way to learn to play guitar (and/or bass guitar). In my opinion, that makes it the best game ever!Background7 years of drums/percussion in middle and high school. 2 years of ""ukelele band"" in elementary school. Zero knowledge of guitar-playing -- I didn't even know if I was holding the pick right when I started Rocksmith. I've now logged ~300 hours between original Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014. And I'm still loving it (just played multiplayer with a buddy for 2 hours tonight).Full ReviewOriginal Rocksmith was buggy and lacked a real ""Riff Repeater"", but I liked the focus on points and leveling -- it kept you trying to improve on specific sets of songs until you could perform them (at a certain level of skill).What sets Rocksmith 2014 apart is 1) the Riff Repeater, and 2) Session Mode.The ""Riff Repeater"" lets you pause a song, increase or decrease the difficulty and speed of sections of the song whenever/however you want. When you successfully play those parts on the speed/difficulty you chose, it can increase the difficulty and/or speed up automatically. This is perfect for learning new songs or working out the kinks in those tricky solos.Now, ""Session Mode"" could be sold as a $20 game in and of itself: you pick the key, tempo, chord progressions, and backing instruments and start jamming away. The notes in your key and current chord are highlighted; the backing instruments (and there's a wide selection to choose from) will accompany your play style/syncopation. It's great for working on solos, rhythms, etc. (I wish the beginner guitar player in the high school jazz band had access to this!)And Rocksmith 2014 keeps getting better! The ""remastered"" edition released recently includes tweaks to improve sorting and organizing your songs and favourites.How I recommend using it* Borrow your friend's electric guitar -- at least until you realize that you adore guitars. Then buy one on Craigslist.* Commit to ""60 days of rocksmith"": play at least 15 minutes every day for 60 days. Take videos of your progress!* After a few weeks, use your standard guitar to play ""emulated bass"", realize you adore bass, then buy one on Craigslist.* Buy amps, pedals, and mics to build your own music studio.* Get your friends to try Rocksmith, get hooked, buy their own guitars, and play multiplayer Rocksmith with them.* Find a decent drummer and -- presto! -- you've got a cover band. :D* World peace ensues.Tips* When I first tried to memorize a song above my skill level (Carry on my Wayward Son), I realized that my technique was counter-productive. Instead of memorizing, try to work on ""sight reading"" in Rocksmith first. (After completing my first ""60 days of rocksmith"", I set the ""Level Up"" difficulty to ""faster"".)* Once you've built your chops a little bit, you can more easily return and pick up those awesome songs you love!* To help with sight reading and chop-building, I usually choose ""Nonstop play"" mode, set to 20-30 minutes (often set to my faves).* Keep a few of the Rocksmith DLC in your Steam wishlist so that you can get alerted/emailed whenever there's a sale (which happens several times a year for about 40% off each song DLC). I usually pick up a few more DLC songs/song packs whenever there's a sale.* Setting a milestone (like a song you want to master) is a great way to stay committed. Also, doing the ""60 days"" with someone else can help you stay committed.* Lastly, I recommend picking up both original Rocksmith and the ""Disc Import tool"" because they let you play *most* of the original song selection and any original Rocksmith DLC you own inside Rocksmith 2014 (which gives you the better Riff Repeater).What I think they could do better* More Muse!!! (I need all the Muse!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 makes for mostly good times jamming on the guitar (there are some frustrating moments found due to a few poorly executed features and what seems to me a lack of several obvious features that should be included in the game). Many good ideas are implemented as practice games (in the style of classic arcade) to develop coordination and technique. While it is a much better game than the previous Rocksmith, it still leaves a lot to be desired in order to become an excellent practice helper and song tutor. Rocksmith 2014, while generally good, is currently just a good, not great, game for jamming on guitar and most likely improving one's guitar playing. However, it could become a great game with further development. Rocksmith 2014 is good, but hopefully there are better things to come in a future release such as having the game automatically adjusting your E standard tuned guitar to sound like it's in alternate tunings rather than having to manually tune your guitar for dropped or open or raised tunings in songs, being able to play technique games in alternate tunings rather than just E standard, menu navigation by playing certain notes such as little or big E strings to navigate up and down, an option that allows us to listen to the songs like a jukebox without playing along on guitar would be much appreciated, and I could go on and on with more suggestions!). With all of the talented people that worked on or consulted for this game it's a shame that there is so much more that could be done that is simply lacking from Rocksmith 2014. Could the plan perhaps be to hold out on features thus ensuring the purchase of a future installment? I would love to have a better iteration of this game, but please provide more features that seem obvious as much-needed inclusions!Rocksmith 2014 won't replace what you get in lessons from a great teacher. With the need for improvements and further development notwithstanding, this game is still worth picking up as it is the best thing available when it comes to a game that you can play with your own real guitar and most likely improving your guitar playing. It's mostly a good time (aside from frustrations encountered due to poorly thought-out features that need to be improved) especially considering that it will only set you back the cost of a couple lessons.

												Potentially a lot of fun, but for an experiencecd guitarist the non-standard notation feels bogus and simply frustrating. When you need to grind and learn a song that you could easily play prima vista on standard guitar tab, it takes away most of the fun, of which there definitely there would be a lot of. Other gripes include latency issues, though less bad as in the first game and some note detection troubles especially on lower chords.Beginners shouldn't be bothered as much by the tab problem (although why not just have the normal tab as option, as it is a beneficial thing to learn in itself?) and the session room can be fun for all levels. So recommended, but not for everyone.			",113,41,7,23,11,0,17

												Rocksmith 2014, Where to start. THe game is excatly as advertised, a Guitar hero style game with a real guitar. Which dont get me wrong is a very good thing. It will definatly help take you from a begginer to a star. But the only thing wrong with it is that it does not realy teach you any way to read sheet music/tab. This pretty much means that if you wanted to play something that was not in the game ie: video game music, you have to learn a whole new system. The only other problem is that the tuner is very finicy even after calibrating it. I recommend geting a book alfreds and a tuner before purchase. One last thing, I encoutered a problem with the cable not being heard, plug it in and go into your settings and turn it up. It should be a mic.Overall it is a good game ",194,36,4,23,28,6,42

												Yes - Buy this game. I had never played guitar or bass before, and spent about 200 hours in Rocksmith (1), loved it, but the improvements that have been made to Rocksmith 2014 are amazing! Everyone is talking about SESSION MODE, and Yes... it's awesome, but the best improvement in my opinion is the new way the game handles MASTER MODE. In the old game, if you learned to play the song correctly it unlocked MASTER MODE where you could then play the whole song without any visual cues. The problem is... I wasn't learning the song by memory - I was learning the song by watching the visual cues, and typically failed miserably during a MASTER MODE performance. In RS2014, MASTER MODE happens seemlessly while you play the song. As you do better at a certain section of music, the visual cues fade until they disappear, and reappear as you make mistakes. This method makes the jump from playing by visual to playing by memory so much easier. Also... multiplayer... good times aplenty. And a ton of DLC (new songs every Tuesday!)			",158,31,3,16,9,2,15

												This is easily my GOTY. I've been playing guitar on and off for over 15 years, and I could have only dreamed to have this when I first started out. Part of the on/off nature of my playing through the years is just getting bored - picking up the guitar, noodling around with the same old riffs, looking up some tabs here and there, but otherwise doing the same old thing each time. With Rocksmith, there's so much to do and with the riff repeater it's so easy to practice those trouble spots that I normally would have just skipped over before. It's got a great song selection and even though I may not necessarily like the style of some of the songs, I still enjoy playing them as they each bring something new and different to the table.

												So far im really impressed by this product. The lessons are very well produced, the mini games are fun and absolutely useful for basic skills, and the song selection is nice and diverse, with the game increasing the difficulty at a very organic pace. Having never played a bass before, i feel like im learning at a good speed, and if i spent more time practicing i could really ramp it up. My only complaint is that occasionally if i hit an incorrect note while playing a song, the game detects it as the right note, which makes the game think im better than i am, which doesnt help me learn.

												Pros- Excellent music tool- Heaps of up to date songs... Even I found stuff I love, and my taste is... interesting!- Teaches you stuff you otherwise wouldn't want to study (I hate practising scales... normally)- Teaches you stuff you think is too hard (like scales) and makes it 'easy'- Easy to setup and use- Will help you if you know nothing about guitars- Will make you a good intermediary guitar player than any other tool- Really cool 'solo jamming' functionality providing you with improv practise- The multiplayer is really cool, just get another cable and have a great Jam without dragging an amp along :)Cons- Will make an hour go in 10 minutes, so you'll be late for work/school a lot- UPlay!!!!!!! update Steam... update Uplay.... update the game!!!!- Sometimes chords aren't picked up right, can be a bit fussy that way (that's being picky though, it's usually fine if you strum the chord right)- I'd like more feedback while I'm playing without going into score attack- The recommendations/goals... not sure I love them, but hey its' there to encourage.- the dynamic difficutly can sometimes be a bit annoying. I understand it's purpose, but I'd rather play the song right and slower than playing a note every 10 seconds sometimes (R U mine... I'm looking at you!!) :)- The lead arrangement for 'knocking on heavens door' is stupid :) Thoughts:- Even more seasoned players will get use out of this (I've played over 20 years)- There is no better guitar tool than this- I'm betting that the play list of cover bands will change because of this :)- Soon most songs from this game will become titles you aren't allowed to play when testing guitars at shops as they will all be played too much :)- Cover bands will have a more critical crowd as everyone will know every single note they're stuffing up :)- You can use the supplied cable for recording in other music programs; so get something a tool like Guitar Rig 5 (currently) and Sonar and start making music!!- Playing guitar will make you more attractive to women of the other sex :)- Don't blame me if you suck anyway after this :) ",43,1,1,7,10,0,21

I could go on for hours about how amazing this game, or tool as it should be called, is but you really should just buy it for yourself. You won't be dissappointed!			",93,30,1,40,14,1,25

												After playing this on consoles I picked it up on Steam for one reason.The Guitarcade.RS'14, as much as it wants you to believe it, is not a teacher, is not a replacement for a teacher, and will never be a teacher, while it's Lessons can be informative to the freshest of beginners the examples given in the lessons (placement of notes, what strings to play said note) can be very damaging to someone forming ""new habits"".What it is to me is a practice tool, if you have the basics of holding your guitar, fretting a few notes, or even a few chords, then Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool to help refine and poilish those a bit more, in an environment you are %100 comfortable in (IE; your own home!).Want to get the hang of shifting along the board? Fire up the Duck shooting minigame for 10-20 minutes a day.Want to speed up your Tremolo? Jump into the Hurdles event!Want to polish up your chords a little? Storm the castle and kill zombies, or fly through space blasting ships into oblivion!Bends? Temple of Bends will get you practicing your half-step and whole-step bends on a way you can see!Wanna run some Scales? Scale Racer has you covered there as you weave through traffic in an addictive way to remember scale patterns!It's not all rosey however!While this software can be a very, very useful tool, it gives no insight into ""Music"".There is absolutely no theory to learn from here, if you want to know what makes a chord, a chord... Rocksmith isn't gonna help you there.Want to learn notation? there's none to be had here which I think is this softwares biggest crime.This is for someone who owns/has owned a Guitar for a while, and is comfortable enough to use it, for the absolute beginner there are some pretty big pitfalls and chances to develop bad/hurtful habits if using RS and RS alone as a teaching aid.My biggest gripe is it's community, the UBI forums are filled by 3-5 people farming post counts, being down right rude, and giving bad/lazy information to people asking for it.This is a community of Gamers who own Guitars, not Guitarists who play Games.The DLC can be a touchy subject.Be it via pricing differences between platforms/Regions being seemingly random. to DLC plain out not showing.You will be also advertised original Rocksmith DLC inside the in-game store, (As it IS compatible with RS'14) yet Steam will not let you access it without owning the first game, this is apparently being looked at, but don't hold your breath it seems as they are focused only on the new consoles and their own store problems, The other formats don't even seem to be on the radar anymore.While I do recommend this product entirely, I do not recommend it as a Teaching aide, I recommend it as a Practice aide and urge anyone wanting it to check out reviews and videos from Users before running out to buy a new Guitar.

												This is a a really fun game, and a really useful learning tool using real instruments. The genre has come a long way since the days of plastic Wii guitars, and despite a few hiccups in the interface, I think Rocksmith 2014 is the best thing in its class to date.The 2014 edition represents a large improvement over the first iteration, and I can only recommend it to guitarists and bassists of any level. Of course, Rocksmith alone won't make you a graet guitarist, it's only another tool in the belt and it can never replace you going out and jamming with other folks. That's all I have to say for now. 9/10			",60,15,0,15,24,0,23

												This is great but not as a way to learn guitar. If a beginner plays this game in hopes of learning guitar, they will fall flat on their faces. There is little to no theory involved and you will end up ""learning"" how to use a guitar as a video game controller rather than an instrument. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game to play if you can already play guitar as it is basically Guitar Hero, but that's all it is. If you really want to learn guitar, start with some Youtube tutorials. Learn some scales and fingering techniques first and most important, do not learn using the guitar hero method. You will be unable to play guitar without the help from the game and you'll sound like garbage outside of it. I really wish this game had more theory and exercises included; as the Guitarcade is not a proper way to learn.FInal Verdict: It's a game and you really won't learn much. 7.5/10			",293,62,13,20,33,3,25

												Rocksmith 2014 is a game where you learn how to play guitar through mini games, lessons, and more. The game was entirely built to be a learning tool. Here is my review of it.Positives:Within 3 days of owning the game, I learned the Penatomic Minor and Blues scales, and also how to play a song or two.Its lessons teach you how to play!You can learn songs such as Cemetary Gates, Thunderkiss '65, and even We are the Champions.If you buy the Physical copy from Amazon, you can get the game and the cable for $30.Session mode allows you to play on your own, and improvise your playing, letting you learn a bit without help.Negatives:Rocksmith 2014 was built entirely out of tablature, and not sheet music, so you won't learn how to play sheet music almost at all.If you buy the digital code, you'll most likely need to purchase the Realtone cable also, which is $30 on its own.The DLCs seem over priced to me, costing $3 for just ONE song!It's creator is Ubisoft, which isn't promising to most things (*cough cough* Assassin's Creed *cough cough*)Final Thoughts: If you have a guitar, and want to learn how to play, buy this, but know about the Negatives. This game does work as long as you want to learn tablature. This works, and I've been enjoying it so far.			",95,12,1,19,4,0,15

												Rocksmith 2014 is a learning tool/guitar hero-ish game where the main purpose is to give the user a better understanding on how to play el-guitar/bass while having fun. I've been playing el-guitar for a while now and I found it hard to understand tabs. I then tried out Rocksmith 2014 which have the guitar hero gameplay but you play with a real guitar. You get notes coming towards you with numbers on them which corresponds the frets and strings on your guitar. It's a bit hard to understand in the beginning, but you get used to it really fast. The game is really helpful and you can learn new techniques. You have to buy a real tone cable with the game which you plug into your PC and guitar. The gameplay works great and it's really relaxing and fun to play different rock and metal songs. There are a good amount of songs in the base game with different tuning, but have in mind that you can buy more songs as DLC. The game offers ""learn a song"" which is pick and play a song, session (you get to play on your own with a virtual band/ jamming) and arcade mode (different mini games you play with the guitar).I recommend this game to ppl who are new to guitar and ppl who just wanna relax and play songs without having trouble with tabs etc. A great game which offers a lot of fun!

												 For the money, what you get is the best tool on the market to learn to play guitar. I got a guitar for Xmas and get into this as a total newb. 6.4 hours in, i am still a newb but i can do simple things now and working my way up. Never knew this instrument was such a challenge but i am enjoying every step and with this highly varied and well made tool it makes it very fun. No mater if you pay full price or, like me, got it in a winter sale, it's worth every penny. I don't have the real tone cable, i am using the mic. It generally does a great job but i've been witness to a few wrong here and there. Still highly maneagable but if you can get the cable, get it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is pretty cool and well made, but if you already have experience on playing guitar and you just want to improve then I dont think this is a good way. You can learn songs with the game but its harder, I've spent a lot of money (the game doesnt come with a lot of music, so you have to buy as dlcs and it is kinda expensive, also you have to buy a cable which is not cheap either) and time and I dont see a big improvement, getting tabs on internet or in a book its a lot easier, I find confusing the way they tried to fit everything on the screen and you have no idea what the tablature looks like so the notes keep coming and you dont know what to do.Although, if you like guitar hero ( like me) its really fun to play but takes time to get used to it.For me its a 4/10			",34,2,1,6,10,0,6

												Seriously just another game by 'Ubisoft'. Half completed as usual. TL;DR: Go buy yourself a guitar, and an amp and a cable. Teach yourself.Great game, great gameplay, teaches you things and does it all while you have fun.Only thing is... It is like EVERY other Ubisoft game. Full of bugs! You can learn and teach yourself with the internet in probably half the time, the only advantages this game has is that it keeps track of song completion, hit percentages and has mini games that are meant to teach you where strings/frets are, chords and so on. If you are new to guitar or have played it very little, this game might be alright for you, but if you have even learned half a song by yourself, STAY AWAY! The 'intuitive' scaling difficulty is annoying as hell, if you screw up just one little part, it could set the difficulty lower, even if you already know the song and attempt to continue playing normally. I am only writing this review (I had never intended to review this game) because today was the first time I have played the remaster. Before the game was okay, noticable bugs and such, but it was passable. After the remaster, sound randomly switches off, songs might or might not load, CTD's, everything that was there before is still there, only worse. Take it from me, you learn a lot more sitting in your chair with an acoustic and Ultimate Guitar pulled up on your browser than loading this trash up and restarting every 5 mins because you can no longer hear yourself strum. The only difference between this game and Assassins Creed is that Rocksmith has the very low potential of teaching you something. It taught me not to buy Ubisoft again.EDIT: After some thinking, I realised that if you are truely going to learn guitar, don't let this be your only method of learning. Using other methods in conjunction with this game may yeild okay results ;)			",147,30,1,22,29,2,31

At first, the game would freeze after tuning and I would have to force close the window.  I found what was supposed to be a fix for that, but now the game does not recognize the RealTone cable even though my computer does.

It feels like more effort is being put into learning how to read music a la guitar hero than being put into learning the songs themselves, and for what? Sure, if you're a complete beginner and like how easy it is to get into then maybe, but otherwise just buy a book and learn.			",145,10,3,12,13,0,30

												This game is a nightmare to get to work with Windows 8.1. I just spent 3 hours uninstalling/reinstalling/updating drivers, restarting my computer, etc, and it still doesn't work. I tested the cables on a friends Windows 7 pc and they work perfect. Google turns up that Windows 8/10 are very hit and miss with this one, so I would recommend you stay away from this. I went through the same problems two years ago when I bought this game and got it working then, but after the hours spent troubleshooting was frustrated enough that I no longer had any interest in playing. The solutions I found then don't work anymore, so I'd say this game is garbage.			",35,0,13,12,33,1,21

												Really fun ""game"" if you could call it that. Great motivator for practising and getting better with the guitar. It's like a guitar teacher who is always ready for you and never gives up on you. Price is a bit steep, considering you will probably want to add some DLC songs, and also have to get a cable somewhere since the steam version obviously can't come with a cable, but on the other hand you would probably pay a guitar teacher much more money to get you where Rocksmith can get you.

												The original Rocksmith was completely stellar in terms of its feature set, song selection, techniques for teaching, and even going so far as to make teaching playing an instrument genuinely an enjoyable experience. It was pretty much the perfect guitar teaching game and offered a lot of fun new ways to enjoy playing music or developing skills for experienced guitaristsSomehow, Rocksmith 2014 managed to refine things that no one even realized were broken in the original title, then adds a whole slew of new features that makes this a esential purchase for anyone even remotely interested in the product. It DOES require the Rocksmith Real Tone Cable, which you can purchase on Amazon or in a lot of major retailers as a standalone device for a decent price. The Disc Import tool means you can also enjoy the songs from the old game in this new title, and there's already a lot of really solid and varied DLC. Definitely worth a purchase if you've already read through this much. I'd give this game more thumbs up if it was physically possible. All you need is a guitar with an output jack, and one of these http://www.amazon.com/Ubisoft-Rocksmith-Not-Machine-Specific-630570063043006306200/dp/B005OSFUZI ",658,103,20,47,53,8,68

												Don't know how to play guitar? HA! Sucks to be you. But luckly, someone was thinking about you. Improving upon their last RockSmith game, Ubisoft went all out on the car polish! I love the variety of song choices and hopefully you'll find something you like too. Their session mode helps you find your own guitar sound that you like by messing around with their pedals and gauges etc, and you get to practise improvising with a virtual band that follows how you play and the notes you play, really cool stuff honestly. If you're already a pro you should still get it, especially if you're tired of reading tabs. Back in the day when you'd have to get the youtube video to play with the tune and you'd have the tabs somewhere near by to follow along. This game slaps them together like the oreo cookie and the cream, ya fell? Check this game out, honestly. NOTE: Don't forget to get a real tone cable. I personally perfer it because it has higher quality. Don't be a cheapy mc food stamps. Also, this game teaches you to play the bass, if that's your thing.So all in all, a great game...or educational software...I agree after seeing many play this, RockSmith is the fastest way to learn guitar. Still gotta have passion though ;D			",153,7,4,15,18,1,21

												If you think learning how to play a guitar would be fun, this game is worth it.  However, you have to be prepare to learn how to play guitar, not how to play Rocksmith.  This is not easy, but if you are at all compelled to pick up the guitar, pick up Rocksmith.Giving this game a 'star' rating would be really tough.  What Ubisoft has managed to do with Rocksmith is amazing.  The ability to get the timing right between the guitar, the song, and the noteway is remarkable.  This technology has more potential than I can even begin to imagine.  I hope this continues to grow.In that respect, it's 5 stars all the way.  However, Rocksmith 2014 is not without some issues.First of all, the elephant in the room: UPlay.  I like the idea of a global leaderboard and the other community things that come with UPlay, but man, does UPlay suck.  Rocksmith is good enough, I'll forgive them, but I wouldn't buy another product that required UPlay.Somewhere between Rocksmith 1 and Rocksmith 2014 they messed up the tuner.  This is a really important part of the game.  Especially now with so many different tunings in the songlist.  The worst part about this is the lack of any real response from Ubisoft about this issue.  This literally drops 2 stars from the product.  I have to believe it's fixable though, if only Ubisoft would communicate what their plans are around this known bug.The UI is still poor.  Rocksmith 2014 has a much UI than it's predecessor, but it also couldn't have been worse.   Even really simple things like not properly doing key repeating in the riff repeater.  It still feels like a console UI ported to the PC, which generally means the UI sucks.Minus 1 more star for the poor UI, and we're down to 2/5 stars.  I really think both of these things can be fixed.   If you're in doubt, maybe wait to see if Ubisoft fixes the known issues.Keep Rockin! ",83,20,0,30,18,0,19

												The bends do not properly register, I have tried several guitars and on several different computers along with several different players. I do not recommend this game due to it's rather crappy input. There were lots of times where I played a note correctly and it would just not register, I even replaced my real tone cable to no avail. This game really needs a better input, otherwise, it is perfect. Even though I stated above that I will not reccomend this for it's crappy input, I do recommend it for the intuitiveness and how pleasant it was to use this software (except for *cough cough*, the user input),			",18,2,0,9,3,0,1

I had to route my sound card to the line-in on my USB speakers in order to get it to work- The game automatically reduces the level of the rocksmith usb cable to 17. You have to boost it back up after you are in-game to get the tuner to work correctly.Preferred peripheral: N/A (just use any electric or acoustic/electric guitar)Personal Notes:I am learning a lot when playing this game and the guitarcade mini-games also provide entertaining ways to practice your scales and other techniques. It's a great motivator to be able to play along with your favorite songs.If you own Rocksmith 2012 you can buy the disk transfer tool so that you can play the on-disc songs and the DLC songs you've purchased from the first game in this latest entry.Verdict: BUY!

												Rocksmith 2014 does what the first one couldn't: be a useable tool to learn or improve your skills. The game has one of the best on disc soundtracks in a music game since the original Rock Band. Beginners will find this to be a fun supplement to other learning materials. Intermediate players will find introductions and tutorials to more advanced techniques. In terms of teaching, the game has very little to offer advanced players outside of the fun warmups/technique practice of guitarcade, the tabs that are the included songs and session mode. Still, session mode alone is can easily justify $15 of the price tag.Really what I enjoy the most about this is session mode, where you can put in a backup band that's quite customizable and have it adapt (to and extent) to what you play. It's the closest you'll get to jamming with a real band. My one gripe is that you can't record what you play without an external device, as Rocksmith overrides the computer's microphone to take input from the guitar.			",162,25,1,7,20,6,35

												It is hard to call Rocksmith 2014 a game. I guess it technically runs just like most games, has achievements and features like most games and even has it's own mini-games. But you don't play it like a game; oddly enough you play it like an instrument. - Rocksmith 2014 has some fantastic lessons that explain in great detail what needs to be done to perform certain techniques. The videos and descriptions are great and the challenges are accurate to helping practise the technique. - Learn a song is great for doing just that. The games mastery system works well most of the time and is quite responsive to your own ability. Although, when it comes to DLC the game puts it down to 0 for some reason, even when you have high mastery of multiple other songs. I was also disappointed to find that you can't create your own playlists. I mean there is non stop play where you can choose the songs that will come up, just no decisions on specific order. - Session mode is definitely a highlight. As a musician myself studying Jazz, I found that a lot of what it teaches you is valuable improvising information. The band responds well and there are a decent amount of various alterations you can use to create what you want. The big downside here is that there is no recording mode, something that would be a big help to the game. Especially some kind of community system where players could rate each others riff or even song ideas. - Guitarcade is really fun while also great practise. Almost every learnable technique has it's own mini game that makes practising the technique fun. Each game also has it's own challenges that push you to better along with leaderboards so you can prove how good you are at each technique. Guitarcade also features score attack. Score attack is a mode somewhat similar to games like 'Rock Band' or 'Guitar Hero'. You choose a difficulty that gives you a specific amount of notes for the song and you get ranked on each phrase. If you miss too many notes in a phrase you get a strike. Three of those and you fail the song, and if you perfect every phrase, you get a gleaming 'Platinum'. Score attack also features leaderboards so you can attempt to be the top of your favourite songs.Overall Rocksmith 2014 is a fantastic learning experience. It has many features that can help you learn to play guitar or bass, just not completely. As any musician can tell you, you end up learning a lot just by practising, on your own and with others. While Rocksmith registers the notes you're playing, and teaches you about different techniques and concepts of playing, it can't recognize if you're really performing these techniques correctly. While you may be hitting every note accurately, there is a chance you could be doing yourself some serious harm just because the game can't see if you're doing it right. So, I recommend that anyone that is serious about learning guitar or bass should also seek out lessons from a professional along with learning from Rocksmith 2014.Score: 8.5Pros: - Session mode is great for teaching improvisation. - Leaderboards are a great motivator. - Guitarcade Mini-games are a fantastic way to practise techniques.Cons: - No recording in Session mode - Mastery for DLC gets reverted back to 0 - No creating your own playlists.

												So i've been playing guitar for a few years, mindlessly strumming chords and feeling like i was getting nowhere. I couldn't do anything impressive and only played to back up my singing. I got this game in the hope I could learn how to play guitar properly and play songs how they were meant to be played, strumming, picking and all. I was NOT dissappointed! The game is great! It really eases you into songs, starting with the most simple chords and riffs and building it up in a way that lets you feel comfortable but learn loads. Further more the % completed really makes you want to perfect a song and the suggested tasks is a great way to reach that 100%. For those that dont know once youve played a song through it suggests ways to improve, such as repeating specific riffs you didnt quite master, playing mini games to improve technique and suggesting lessons that might be useful. For me, playing along with the song playing is really useful too, helping you keep with the rhythm and the feel of the song. The part i've found difficult is the strumming, it tells you when to strum and which ones to accent but not really how, like up down up down sort of thing. However in the end you kind of just pick it up from listening to the song while playing. Since playing the game I have learnt a load new songs and feel im on the way to becoming a good guitarist, even if i am yet to 100% master a song. Cheers,Cal			",55,5,3,7,6,0,10

I am glad I purchased this game for the aspect of making learning from a video game quite fun. I do however feel there are some lacking aspects of truely teaching someone from the ground up. I study other teaching websites and videos on the internet so its not a huge deal. What I would like to see is a software that can completely replace the need for an instructor. From what I have gathered it is a huge improvement over the previous title. I can only hope that eventually it will be the best teaching tool out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best purchase among all the games I have on steam. I self-learn on acoustic guitar so I only know the basic chords. I consider myself new to the electric guitar. RS2014 is a revolutionary product that is more than a game, its a tool that makes you want to learn the guitar. Great UI, songs and love the multiplayer as well. Overall its an awesome product to own and like every other game, it does have room for improvement but nothing game breaking.			",74,7,5,6,6,2,5

												First, I love Rocksmith 2014. I am certain that in large part because of it, I will not be one of the 74 out of 75 that give up guitar. I'm advancing rapidly (in my opinion) in just three weeks. RS14 has excellent feedback mechanisms to point out what is right and wrong about my playing. Riff Repeater allows me to focus on the first part of a song, 100% difficulty and 1% speed, until I get it (I wish to learn it right the first time through, not add bits and pieces here and there). While it has a scale game, I find it not very good for learning scales (maybe just me), so I augment my studies with the book ""Fretboard Logic"" in order to learn the logic of the fretboard. I recommend it. So I'd like to see much more done in the area of scale training. Yes, it can be picked up in Session Mode, but it will take a lot longer instead of having a focused scale training programming. Session Mode: I like this part of the program perhaps the best, because it's like having a band that can tolerate me at my current low level of playing. Very impressive. Riff Repeater: could use one improvement: the ability to control the transparency of the readout would be fantastic, as I often pause it to see what to do next with the finger placement, and sometimes the readout interferes with the process. I'm sure this will be fixed at some point. Once the Riff Repeater is set, it's function is somewhat unneeded until the next time one wishes to reset it. Right? Also, if paused, RR should be able to pick it up right from the point it was paused... it is very frustrating to have to wait for the music to pick up again, and learning could proceed much faster if this were implemented. I realized I'll never make the 60 day challenge. Everyone there has an Epiphone, and I don't plan on purchasing one. I purchased a few junk guitars so as to learn the mechanical/electrical aspects of guitar without ruining a nice Epiphone. :)  So I'm posting my weekly progress and insights on YouTube: ""A guitar path using Rocksmith 2014: Week 1 of 52"". Yeah, I'm sure it will sell a lot of copies of RS14 without the Epiphone. :) Overall, if you want to keep playing guitar without a major amount of frustration, get Rocksmith 2014. You'll be glad you did. ",45,1,0,4,1,0,3

												""I play the guitar, I taught myself how to play the guitar, which was a bad decision, because I didn't know how to play it.""-Mitch HedburgWhile half of the joy in teaching yourself how to play is in overcoming obstacles, along the way bad habits are formed and a narrow focus begins to form. For something as varied and complex as music, this is a fault. However, with Rocksmith, I've had great fun in playing songs I already knew, learning new songs I've liked, and even getting an appreciation for songs outside my usual tastes. The mini-games (Guitarcade) are great for daily exercises in building muscle memory and picking up good habits in terms of bends, chord formations, slides and picking.  You have to treat it like a 'learning tool' to get the most out of it, but if you already have a guitar on hand and forked over the cash for the 'Real-Tone' cable, then you're obviously aware of what you're getting into.

												While this game won't completly teach you how to play the guitar, it is a fantastic tool to aid in your mastery of those sweet steel strings.  This game has frustrated me to no end with its dynamic difficulty, but at the same time it's fantastic. For example: You'll be banging along knocking out notes, until NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHING! All of the sudden it'll throw a chord your way. You may never have seen this particular one before and at the speed you were at, it messed you all up and throws you totally off your groove. Well this thing isn't guitar hero and if you aren't already skilled at the guitar, can't be played as such. But if you slow down, use the Rift Repeater tool all day long and practice the fundementals more than you play, you'll be sitting pretty. TL;DR: This is a fantastic tool to motivate and gamify the learning of guitar. But it will not teach you all everything you need to know to be a master.			",203,43,1,38,14,3,20

												I love my guitar, and sometimes I get bored. So one day I bought Rocksmith 2014. Ive spent over 100 hrs on Rocksmith (Original) and used it mainly because it gives you access to great effects to throw on your guitar. The game is great for learning as a begginner and moderate player. If you are just starting this game will try your patience. It's not a magical program that gives you techniques from the likes of Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Dimebag Darrel, Dave Mustaine, Dan Donegan, Synyster Gates, and Andy James, HOWEVER....................... If you stick with it, and do the fundamental drill over and over again, you will progress at a decent pace. I recommend it if you are willing to put time into it. This is the only game where I can say I really didn't waste money, because it has a real life affect on the real world. ENJOY!			",58,1,0,10,10,0,21

												If you don't have the time to take regular guitar classes from a real teacher , then Rocksmith is as close to getting a real taecher from the comfort of your home. Although i'm not a beginner I think RS2014 is great for anyone wanting to pick up and learn the guitar.As a slighlty experienced guitar player Rocksmith has helped me look closely at many techniques that I though I knew but turns out I was not exactly using them correctly. There are also more advanced techniques that I have learned and I actually like learning those riffs more than learning any of the songs ( Not that I wouldn't love to Master the Joe Sat song!)Session mode isn't that close to real jam session but it does really well in backing you up , and trying out new things is great when you have a feel of what the other instruments might be playing and where you fit in your adjistments.Overall RS 2014 is a must buy for any guitar player , new or experienced.

												Rocksmith 2014 does what the first one couldn't: be a useable tool to learn or improve your skills. The game has one of the best on disc soundtracks in a music game since the original Rock Band. Beginners will find this to be a fun supplement to other learning materials. Intermediate players will find introductions and tutorials to more advanced techniques. In terms of teaching, the game has very little to offer advanced players outside of the fun warmups/technique practice of guitarcade, the tabs that are the included songs and session mode. Still, session mode alone is can easily justify $15 of the price tag.Really what I enjoy the most about this is session mode, where you can put in a backup band that's quite customizable and have it adapt (to and extent) to what you play. It's the closest you'll get to jamming with a real band. My one gripe is that you can't record what you play without an external device, as Rocksmith overrides the computer's microphone to take input from the guitar.			",162,25,1,7,20,6,35

												So i've been playing guitar for a few years, mindlessly strumming chords and feeling like i was getting nowhere. I couldn't do anything impressive and only played to back up my singing. I got this game in the hope I could learn how to play guitar properly and play songs how they were meant to be played, strumming, picking and all. I was NOT dissappointed! The game is great! It really eases you into songs, starting with the most simple chords and riffs and building it up in a way that lets you feel comfortable but learn loads. Further more the % completed really makes you want to perfect a song and the suggested tasks is a great way to reach that 100%. For those that dont know once youve played a song through it suggests ways to improve, such as repeating specific riffs you didnt quite master, playing mini games to improve technique and suggesting lessons that might be useful. For me, playing along with the song playing is really useful too, helping you keep with the rhythm and the feel of the song. The part i've found difficult is the strumming, it tells you when to strum and which ones to accent but not really how, like up down up down sort of thing. However in the end you kind of just pick it up from listening to the song while playing. Since playing the game I have learnt a load new songs and feel im on the way to becoming a good guitarist, even if i am yet to 100% master a song. Cheers,Cal			",55,5,3,7,6,0,10

												The best way to learn guitar, as well as the most fun you can have in a music game. No one can come close to what Ubisoft has created here, which is saying a lot since ubisoft tend to suck major♥♥♥♥♥♥at most of the things they do.			",152,10,1,23,13,0,42

												If you want to learn guitar, this is the way to do it. Cheaper than lessons and easier than self teaching. Check it out and pick it up. Make sure you order a package deal with the cable.			",208,47,3,37,21,3,31

												If you don't have the time to take regular guitar classes from a real teacher , then Rocksmith is as close to getting a real taecher from the comfort of your home. Although i'm not a beginner I think RS2014 is great for anyone wanting to pick up and learn the guitar.As a slighlty experienced guitar player Rocksmith has helped me look closely at many techniques that I though I knew but turns out I was not exactly using them correctly. There are also more advanced techniques that I have learned and I actually like learning those riffs more than learning any of the songs ( Not that I wouldn't love to Master the Joe Sat song!)Session mode isn't that close to real jam session but it does really well in backing you up , and trying out new things is great when you have a feel of what the other instruments might be playing and where you fit in your adjistments.Overall RS 2014 is a must buy for any guitar player , new or experienced.

												Music has been an important part of my life and at age 31 I am now deciding to learn an instrument. I chose the guitar. I am glad I purchased this game for the aspect of making learning from a video game quite fun. I do however feel there are some lacking aspects of truely teaching someone from the ground up. I study other teaching websites and videos on the internet so its not a huge deal. What I would like to see is a software that can completely replace the need for an instructor. From what I have gathered it is a huge improvement over the previous title. I can only hope that eventually it will be the best teaching tool out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 does what the first one couldn't: be a useable tool to learn or improve your skills. The game has one of the best on disc soundtracks in a music game since the original Rock Band. Beginners will find this to be a fun supplement to other learning materials. Intermediate players will find introductions and tutorials to more advanced techniques. In terms of teaching, the game has very little to offer advanced players outside of the fun warmups/technique practice of guitarcade, the tabs that are the included songs and session mode. Still, session mode alone is can easily justify $15 of the price tag.Really what I enjoy the most about this is session mode, where you can put in a backup band that's quite customizable and have it adapt (to and extent) to what you play. It's the closest you'll get to jamming with a real band. My one gripe is that you can't record what you play without an external device, as Rocksmith overrides the computer's microphone to take input from the guitar.			",162,25,1,7,20,6,35

												Love the concept.  Love the game.  Don't love the fact that it was so difficult to load on my Mac or that I've never really been able to connect to the ubisoft server to get new songs.  This is a great game with lots of learning potential, but there is still some work to do to make it seamless for the average customer.  Recommend for PC not Mac.			",4,0,0,0,2,0,0

												This is the best purchase among all the games I have on steam. I self-learn on acoustic guitar so I only know the basic chords. I consider myself new to the electric guitar. RS2014 is a revolutionary product that is more than a game, its a tool that makes you want to learn the guitar. Great UI, songs and love the multiplayer as well. Overall its an awesome product to own and like every other game, it does have room for improvement but nothing game breaking.			",74,7,5,6,6,2,5

												Pros:+ Great selection of songs (very subjective)+ Much improved note detection and latency reduction+ Session mode is very awesome! You play scales and an AI band backs you up dynamically. Lots of customization options for your virtual band!Cons:- Does not work with USB speakers. I had to route my sound card to the line-in on my USB speakers in order to get it to work- The game automatically reduces the level of the rocksmith usb cable to 17. You have to boost it back up after you are in-game to get the tuner to work correctly.Preferred peripheral: N/A (just use any electric or acoustic/electric guitar)Personal Notes:I am learning a lot when playing this game and the guitarcade mini-games also provide entertaining ways to practice your scales and other techniques. It's a great motivator to be able to play along with your favorite songs.If you own Rocksmith 2012 you can buy the disk transfer tool so that you can play the on-disc songs and the DLC songs you've purchased from the first game in this latest entry.Verdict: BUY!

												It is hard to call Rocksmith 2014 a game. I guess it technically runs just like most games, has achievements and features like most games and even has it's own mini-games. But you don't play it like a game; oddly enough you play it like an instrument. - Rocksmith 2014 has some fantastic lessons that explain in great detail what needs to be done to perform certain techniques. The videos and descriptions are great and the challenges are accurate to helping practise the technique. - Learn a song is great for doing just that. The games mastery system works well most of the time and is quite responsive to your own ability. Although, when it comes to DLC the game puts it down to 0 for some reason, even when you have high mastery of multiple other songs. I was also disappointed to find that you can't create your own playlists. I mean there is non stop play where you can choose the songs that will come up, just no decisions on specific order. - Session mode is definitely a highlight. As a musician myself studying Jazz, I found that a lot of what it teaches you is valuable improvising information. The band responds well and there are a decent amount of various alterations you can use to create what you want. The big downside here is that there is no recording mode, something that would be a big help to the game. Especially some kind of community system where players could rate each others riff or even song ideas. - Guitarcade is really fun while also great practise. Almost every learnable technique has it's own mini game that makes practising the technique fun. Each game also has it's own challenges that push you to better along with leaderboards so you can prove how good you are at each technique. Guitarcade also features score attack. Score attack is a mode somewhat similar to games like 'Rock Band' or 'Guitar Hero'. You choose a difficulty that gives you a specific amount of notes for the song and you get ranked on each phrase. If you miss too many notes in a phrase you get a strike. Three of those and you fail the song, and if you perfect every phrase, you get a gleaming 'Platinum'. Score attack also features leaderboards so you can attempt to be the top of your favourite songs.Overall Rocksmith 2014 is a fantastic learning experience. It has many features that can help you learn to play guitar or bass, just not completely. As any musician can tell you, you end up learning a lot just by practising, on your own and with others. While Rocksmith registers the notes you're playing, and teaches you about different techniques and concepts of playing, it can't recognize if you're really performing these techniques correctly. While you may be hitting every note accurately, there is a chance you could be doing yourself some serious harm just because the game can't see if you're doing it right. So, I recommend that anyone that is serious about learning guitar or bass should also seek out lessons from a professional along with learning from Rocksmith 2014.Score: 8.5Pros: - Session mode is great for teaching improvisation. - Leaderboards are a great motivator. - Guitarcade Mini-games are a fantastic way to practise techniques.Cons: - No recording in Session mode - Mastery for DLC gets reverted back to 0 - No creating your own playlists.

												learned to play guiatr in under a year...who said you can't teach a old dog new Tricks?Rocksmith 2014 takes the tricks to a new level, fanastic details, the minigames  are much more enjoyable than in the first game.9/10UPDATE - 700+ hours down over a 2 year period, and this game is still holding its own, teaching me a thing or two each time i play it, and most importantly still gives me a sense of acheivment when you go play a song I haven't played for months, because it originally was kicking my butt, and then you get to see an instant 5-10% improvment from all the skills you have picked up along the way playing other songs.this game is legendary, an acheivment in self learning tools, and will only get old if DLC ever stops being released.10/10			",90,13,4,10,10,0,38

There are times it will drive you crazy because it adapts to your level, and is always pushing the make you better. Sometimes the tasks seem unattainable, but hang in there. You do achieve the levels that they set for you. Most importantly, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, and then PRACTICE some more.			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												So i've been playing guitar for a few years, mindlessly strumming chords and feeling like i was getting nowhere. I couldn't do anything impressive and only played to back up my singing. I got this game in the hope I could learn how to play guitar properly and play songs how they were meant to be played, strumming, picking and all. I was NOT dissappointed! The game is great! It really eases you into songs, starting with the most simple chords and riffs and building it up in a way that lets you feel comfortable but learn loads. Further more the % completed really makes you want to perfect a song and the suggested tasks is a great way to reach that 100%. For those that dont know once youve played a song through it suggests ways to improve, such as repeating specific riffs you didnt quite master, playing mini games to improve technique and suggesting lessons that might be useful. For me, playing along with the song playing is really useful too, helping you keep with the rhythm and the feel of the song. The part i've found difficult is the strumming, it tells you when to strum and which ones to accent but not really how, like up down up down sort of thing. However in the end you kind of just pick it up from listening to the song while playing. Since playing the game I have learnt a load new songs and feel im on the way to becoming a good guitarist, even if i am yet to 100% master a song. Cheers,Cal			",55,5,3,7,6,0,10

												Fixes pretty much every small issue with the last. If you play guitar currently, you'll have fun learning new songs. If you played guitar but don't anymore, this will motivate you to pick it up. If you've never touched a guitar in your life, this will start you out and get you playing. Very much worth checking out if you have any interest in playing guitar or bass, because it will get you playing the instrument even if you have no idea what you're doing.			",175,28,8,18,22,3,35

												A decent game that can run on just about any computer. It has lots of customization options and can help you learn new stuff really fast. The Riff Repeater function is really helpful as the game can vary in difficulty from a couple notes to the entire song 100% as if you were playing from a tab book. A good song selection is nice as are the minigames that test specific skills. However, the USB chord is pretty flimsy, so take care of it. Also you have to deal with the calibrating all the time. Furthermore--and most importantly--be sure to use a regular electric guitar with this. Acoustic-electrics don't work well in my experience, and regular acoustics require extra gear. Also changing the tuning for different songs can be frustrating if you have an electric guitar with a floating bridge (of course that's always true). So I say again: **Use a regular no-frills electric guitar to get the best experience.**			",83,14,0,5,5,1,5

												Not as good as I expected.I think it might teach you the basics but overall if you want to learn to play guitar and play it well, it will take more than muscle memory contrary to what they advertise.While the game does set a good pace and teaches you playing techniques in a progressive manner, overall it might teach you bad habits.  You often won't be playing by ear and this is bad especially since the feedback is bad on certain occassion. There were times when just slapping on the strings would get you a pass and this is true especially when playing with chords. Bends, tremolo and hammer ons often do not register and it can become frustrating and you wind up doing more than you should. Overall, I think it's a nice introduction to complete beginners but I liken it to learning how to dance by using Dance Dance Revolution. I learned more from using Guitar Pro 6 rather than this product. Get a good guitar and amp. $60 for this software is too expensive especially when you will outgrow it a couple of months.

Which takes away from the gaming experience. Other times, the tone stops working entirely. I am constantly having to restart the game in order to play it. Lately, the graphics are lagging and I can't play along with the song unless I play by ear only. Which kind of defeats the entire purpose of the game. Too bad.

Which takes away from the gaming experience. Other times, the tone stops working entirely. I am constantly having to restart the game in order to play it. Lately, the graphics are lagging and I can't play along with the song unless I play by ear only. Which kind of defeats the entire purpose of the game. Too bad. It could have been so much more than it really is.			",4,1,0,0,2,0,0

												*Sigh*This game is such a huge dissapointment everytime I try to give it a chanse.The audio lag is the biggest flaw in this game, which sucks because the game revolves around sound !Speaking of audio, my main audio device is connected with USB. For some reason this game refuses to work with anything else a speaker connected my audio card (jack connection on motherboard). On every forum topic related to audio lag, they say; 'use analog audio !'1. It should work fine with any audio card2. IT STILL GIVES AUDIO LAGAnd to make things worse, when you adjust the lag settings in-game, you have to restart the game.You have to adjust the settings, close the game, open the game, wait for EVERY INTRO TO FINISH PLAYING, log in, and adjust the lag again because there is no setting that makes it work without any lag. It does mess up your sound completely though if you adjust it just right !Even if you CAN look past the lag, the game is still terrible.The guitar arcade could be kinda fun, the arcade games that let's you play scales are really usefull. Again, problem is, it doesn't work 100%, which really sucks if you want to try and get a high score (or just play at high speed).I guess people could learn a few basics using this, however it doesn't work for me. I started playing guitar (after playing guitar hero, which is why i want to like this game) 7 years ago, I learned song by learning tabs and using a tool called 'Guitar Pro' and watching youtube videos explaining the basics. I think it's way more logic to learn a song by learning to play it like it should be played, not on 'easy' mode playing 1/20 notes to get a 'feel' for the song. It just doesn't work for me. If you like playing guitar, don't learn it from this..If you like playing guitar games, play guitar hero.You're better of buying a guitar and a descent small amp for the same price AND guitar pro than this game.2/10 would not recommend.

												This game is a steaming pile of garbage when it comes to user friendliness. You can have the adequate level of hardware and still this game is darn near unplayable out of the box. Instead of just patching this piece of crap to fix the issues, Ubisoft posts guides on how to go edit the rocksmith.ini file. That is absolutely absurd; as a software company you should be utterly ashamed that you would have to instruct a customer to do that. I forgot how I initially fixed the 90% distorted sound way back when I first bought this crap software. So I started having trouble with the RealCrap cable picking up my guitar during calibration for a second profile I was setting up for lead guitar. I reinstall the game, and now the sound distortion issue is back. Don't buy anything from this joke of a company. Their glory days are long passed.			",60,2,0,9,3,0,6

												Significant differences to the original game, fretboard is much more easier to work with now and the notes are a lot more accurate. Just a shame the RS1 Disc Pack doesn't come with Sunshine Of Your Love. Effect pedals aren't usable from a third party from what I've experienced. All in all, the game seems a lot smoother and accurate in forms of note hitting and gameplay.			",441,71,19,29,41,11,29

												Buggy! Always something not working.  It's either a cable issue, or some other sound issue.  It does not play well with anything!  only supports 16bit audio and if you have your devices set to 24 bit, it wont work.  It won't share.  Does not play well with others.  I suppose the app is OK if you can keep it running long enough to use it.			",38,1,0,0,4,0,0

												Most of the hours I have in game are from trying to get the Real Tone Cable to work. After  a lot of work, I got this game to run a few months ago and quite enjoyed it, but I've just spent over a half hour trying the adapter cable in every usb port I have, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, and fiddling with recording device settings, and the fruit of my efforts was that it worked for a moment, until I adjusted an in-game graphics setting, after which I've gotten nothing but static. When it does work it's a pretty good tool for learning songs, and best of all, has all the amp settings right so you don't need to mess with effects panels and amp settings to get your guitar to sound right for the song. So despite how convenient it can be, I simply can't recommend paying money for something that probably won't work most of the time.			",398,98,6,49,38,4,34

												This is a fantastic tool to learn songs with, or to mess around in Session mode with a very customizable backing band. I'm less crazy about the ""lessons"" or minigames, but the core gameplay is extremely solid and tons of fun. Lessons from an outside source are necessary to really learn. The game does introduce techniques to you and has lesson videos, but they're somewhat shallow and don't really explain the ""why"" of things, nor can it critique your technique or correct bad habits. I highly recommend it for learning songs and as a practice aid, as long as you're coupling it with at least online tutorials, though actual lessons are always preferable. Yes, it requires Uplay, but it's pretty transparent. Once the new song format is figured out, community-built custom songs will make their way in again and unofficially expand the song library by a large amount.			",316,73,10,100,36,1,79

												The best way to learn Guitar period!I do prefer the original game's career mode and ""concerts"" but they have really streamlined the learnig process in this one.  Session mode is awesome, just jam with your ""band"".  It is definitely more of a learning tool than a game, but then again that's a good thing.UPDATEHaving bought this game over 3 years ago, I may not play as often as I used to but its definitely a game I always come back to from time to time. The fact that the devs have kept updating the game and releasing new songs show how well the game has been received. As I write this I should found another song I wanna buy :)			",94,20,6,10,14,2,17

												Hundreds of songs. Tons of fun. Dozens of bugs. (:It's a great game! And probably the best of its kind (there are not many alternatives though). Ubisoft did a great job! But did not quite polish it.I own a copy for PS4 and a copy for Mac/PC. Each one has it's own glitches. No profile synchronization (that is no progress synchronization), but I can stand it. No content/DLC synchronization!.. but yeah, everybody knows it. However, the most annoying are some regular issues that completely break gameplay. For instance, sometimes ejecting headphones leads to constant noise and you have to restart the game. Sometimes the game won't find your connected Real Tone Cable and you have to restart the game. From other point, some songs don't sound good. For example, The Rolling Stones' ""Paint it, black"" pedal effects seems almost muting the sound of my guitar (not always, though!). Of course, all that problems may be due to my OS (OS X 10.11.6, troubles on Mac? Seriously? What should I do? Re-install DirextX? oh wait, there is no DirectX! nor soundcard driver!), or my guitar (everybody knows that Rocksmith is very picky about it, btw I use Traveler Guitar ultra light electric to play the game).TLDR; It's a great game, but it feels like Ubisoft doesn't really strive for quality, but for profit. And the game really lacks of quality and ruins my game experience.			",49,2,1,2,2,0,2

												I have been trying to get Rocksmith 2014 to actually play for a number of days. I originally purchased the DVD and cable from Rarewaves-US and waited 3 weeks to receive it. Every attempt to install it resulted in an invalid key error. The only Technical help I could get from Rarewaves was an authorization to return the product for a refund.So, I decided to buy the product from the Steam store, and try that. It would have to work .....right!..........wrong!! I downloaded the product from the Steam store, and they gave me a product key............same result.........invalid product key.I can honestly say I have never seen anything so convoluted in my life. In order to run this game you must have a Steam account and a Uplay account, and Uplay is where everything comes to a grinding halt.I am an aspiring guitar player and would really like to try it out to see if it's as good as they say, which is why I devoted many hours trying to get it to run.My advice is BUYER BEWARE. I have since read many similar accounts online, and unfortunately there is virtually no tech support to provide any help.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: Just as I don't feel my guitar playing experience translates into this game environment, I find it unlikely that the game skills built up here can be translated back into the real world in any meaningful and sustained way while playing with other real musicians.  This might be a decent game, but if you want to learn to play guitar, start a band.  Be loud, anger your neighbors.  Go forth and melt faces.….If you've never picked up a guitar, then Rocksmith might be an interesting exercise in using a novel control scheme to interact with a game.  If you've spent any appreciable time with an actual guitar, this may very well be a frustrating experience.  So far it has been for me (an admittedly short time.)I imagine it to be similar to going through physical therapy and having to re-learn how to write or ride a bike after losing motor functions for some time.  None of my natural instinct for playing translates in this context.  Three minutes into playing, I felt as if i’d never picked up a guitar before and my close to 20 years of guitar playing might as well have been spent learning sign language.The issue was primarily with the small amount of lag between striking a note and hearing it.  This created uncertainty as to when *exactly* the computer was registering my playing and how that related to what I was seeing on screen.  Sometimes it is obvious, but in more complex passages this can create a very frustrating situation.  The visual interface inherits much of its design language from the video game world and while it looks visually interesting in a video or screenshot, the task of actually reading the interface while playing is overly complex and distracts from the task if you look at it from a teaching software perspective.  The camera movements are especially egregious.A few general nitpicks: There aren’t many songs included but of course you can augment your library with paid DLC.  The Ubisoft Uplay integration is as horrible and intrusive as it always is, so no surprises there.  The tuner software works with generous margins in order to work with the game, so you’ll have to re-tune every time you plug back into your amp.  After installation it crashed steam twice, but seems to have stabilized after the second reboot.If you're picking Rocksmith up to have a different take on a gaming challenge based around the archetypes set up by rock band and guitar hero, then you may just love it.  If you are looking for a way to learn how to actually play music, then I think you'd be better served finding an instructor or just starting a garage band and learning some songs.  (Hey, it worked for all of the bands who are getting paid to license their music in this game right?) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I want anyone reading this to know that I am nearing my 5th year of taking guitar tutoring, so I'm not a beginner at all (also, spelling might be off on the terms since I learn in French). The review is also for guitar, not bass. Now, onto the review.In a nutshell, this game horrible for experienced guitarists, but good for beginners.If you are a beginner, then this game is probably worth it if you can get it on sale and get the cable from somewhere else, but 60 euros for only the software is too expensive for me. The color coded chords are good for beginners since it helps them remember which chords to play. But for an experienced guitarist, the colored chords will only get in the way and mess up your technique.The accuracy of the chords played is... pretty bad to say the least. You can play 4th fret A chord when asked to play 5th fret B lol (and I know it's not my guitar, it's either the cable or the game). When playing 1st fret on any chord, it rarely registers my strum.The software is advertised as a learning program, but as a game it's very fun. I've seen someone on YouTube with ridiculous scores and flawless sequences, but then again that was their only learning tool since 4 fours of playing guitar (!!!! yes I know it's pretty crazy).In the end, this software is not a learning program, it is a game for inexperienced beginners who don't want to learn seriously. I do not reccomend this game, as a tutor (or self tutoring if you really want to commit) will teach you far more in a manner that will let you use his methods OUTSIDE OF HIS LESSONS, unlike Rocksmith in which you will be relying on the screen to play.And of course, you can do both if you want to. I'm not your mum.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had an excellent experience with the game in the past two years. Recently I wasn't playing anymore but last week I log'd in to play one of my favorite songs and there it was...

There are magical solution on the internet but extracting a third party folder into my system is just too naive thinking that crackers wouldn't have some access of my data. Well.... What can I say.... was a good game. Now it's not even playable.

												I taught myself how to play and consider myself an intermediate player.  The display of the fretting on-screen is upside down from actual tablature which makes it very difficult to understand if you already have experience.  As the  song shifts up and down the fretboard, the display animates the shift in a very disorienting way which I cannot follow even when playing songs I already know.  I used two different guitars and could not find a setup that worked nicely with the software.  I tried all sorts of combinations of pick-up selections and tone adjustments and still had a difficult time making it through the tutorials.  When playing certain games, it will show you what it thinks you're playing.  With a perfect tune, certain notes would be fine and others would be one to two steps off.  I spent too much time trying to circumvent the quirks in this game and no time learning anything about playing a guitar.			",23,2,1,9,4,0,14

												Game sold without mention of 'Rocksmith cable' requirement.  Couldn't get past calibration.  I bought a generic, but basically identical guitar-to-USB cable (branded cable is 3-4x more expensive); still can't get past calibration.  Program may be great, but forced purchase of a branded cable just to learn is a rip-off.  Do not buy, there are other options.			",14,1,0,1,3,0,4

												it's funny how this game tells you to play relaxed but then frustrates the hell out of me by not counting 30% of the notes that i play right. it was great at first and i was improving quickly. i have had the shifting lesson go from 100% on 45 notes down to getting 70% or less on 33 notes. i set the practice track to play all 51 notes and have the lesson at 94% complete but my accuracy keeps getting lower and lower. the last time i did it today i had 64% despite knowing that i'm hitting all of right notes. yesterday i was in the 80% up and down. most of the wrong notes keep coming from the 12th, 11th, and 10th fret notes. i just went through the lesson video and at the part where you're supposed to hit 12, 11, 10, 9, 3, 4, 5 it counted the 3, 4, 5 as right but i played 4, 5, 6. at the part that it says to play the 7th fret i was on the 6th and the game said i'm on the 8th. i've been playing about 8 days, more than 1 hour the first few days and less than that the other days because this is annoying the crap out of me. i'm scared i'm going to break my strings because the game is making me think i'm not strumming loud enough for the notes to properly register. i honestly do not see how i can ever recommend this to anyone.

												This game has been out for a while but is still full of bugs.  Starting from the very first screen the main account selection screen there are visual bugs when you select between accounts.  It requires an internet connection to some main server for a single player game.  The usb device itself is buggy.  Booting my computer with the device plugged in makes my mouse and keyboard so laggy I can't get past the login screen.  Fine, so I have to keep it unplugged during a reboot.  When it isn't dragging down my whole system, it is often not detected and you have to restart the game.  The loading screens are not able to be skipped so being forced to restart the game over and over and not skip those screens is infuriating.  Even when the usb device does work it is not good at detecting what notes you hit.  You can play nothing and it will count slightly vibrating strings as a perfect score. This entire game is a fraud.  Having this game on steam makes steam less credible.			",22,1,0,3,2,0,1

												Terrible game. If you plan on using this to learn guitar dont bother, its frustrating in the extreme, the progression for lessons is non existant and there is no real structure within it to help you learn.Also a terrible port of a badly designed game. A multitude of unskippable intros, an interface that lags on any menu change and said menu is confusing and not thought through at all eg the options menu is under tools for some reason. Latency between instrument and game has a slider to adjust but no information as to what the slider actually does. Just a terrible game. Wish I had installed and tried it out much sooner after I purchased it so I could get a refund.Oh yeah and if you dont have your sound set to 48khz then you dont have an output device. Thats it, no options, straight up no ability to change this at all anywhere in the game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can't continue  you can't exit the game. You have to force-quit the whole thing and re-launch it for it to work. I contacted Ubisoft support a year ago and they told me that it was not something that they knew about and that I'd have to wait for an update. Well It's 2016, still no update.  Maybe you need to have a controller. I don't know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is by Ubisoft so there are plenty of bugs and crashes to be found. The technology isint quite good enough for me to recomend this. Plenty of time I am strumming the chords they are telling me to but the game cant quite tell what fret I am on. I tried fixing the intonation on my cheap squire strat, but it doesnt help on every song. The game will change difficulty within the same song so one chorus may be played with 2 fingers, but when it comes around again, the game is asking you to play 3. Its inconsistent and can be frustrating. Also its Ubisoft. The game has crashed on me about 4 times since I've played and thats about 10 hours at the time of this review.			",109,10,0,15,18,2,16

												I have been playing electric guitar for about four years now and I thought that this would be a fun way to spice up my practive routine. and it is very fun but it caters more to the guitar hero fans than musicians. Their approach to learning also encourages mistakes as the note imput is sloppy. The game starts you at full speed and minimal notes instead of starting you at a lower speed with all of the notes and chords. I know that beginners may be intimidated by all the information of a full song, but some of these songs are very beginner friendly for this type of learning. I know that in riff mode you can slow it down to half speed but it should be done at the first attempt in order to really learn a song. also for those looking to learn guitar beware, you can have very very sloppy technique and still get a 100 %. you are better off finding a good teacher. Note I used an MIA standard Telecaster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you do not already own a RockSmith cable then dont purchase this game.

And no you cant use an offbrand version either, if its not the Ubisoft version it will not read it. I even had the cable, the actual Ubisoft version, but it had been awhile since i had used it and apparently it is ""faulty"" and to replace it would still cost $25 plus shipping because i have to send my cable to them.

												DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE THE USB ROCKSMITH REAL TONE CABLE - otherwiae you will pay almost double the amount to get the bloody thing to work. Instead buy the software and cable package as a single unit at a real store/reputible online retailer and save at least $30. I tried plugging my guitar in using my regular patch cord with an adapter for my PC mic jack and of course no dice. So I have a choice to buy the software/cable package at $79 (lowest price I found online) and eat the $60 I just wasted on steam or try to find the standalone cable (good luck, very hard to find) for another $45. I am thoroughly unimpressed trhat Valve/Ubisoft do not mention this in any of the promotional material in an obvious way. Total ripoff and ubisoft in particular have lost a customer for life.

If i know is like this I will stay away from Uplay product.  The cable really only cost $ 8-20 max.  I got my 25 foot long high quality cable for $ 20, and usb adapter for $12 and it work great with anything except Uplay-Rocksmith.Stay away from Uplay - you want us to play your games and this is what you do for us?

I already played guitar, so it came pretty easy. But I would say this is more geared for newbies. However the songs go well into very advanced.  What's nice is they start at newbie level and as you progress they increase in difficulty.  I don't use it as ""a game"" I use it to learn some of my fav songs.  The interpretations really appear to sound SPOT ON.  It's a lot more fun practicing (even beginner levels) when you have the actual band playing with you.  So you sound good no matter what.  I have a hard time practicing every day and this really makes that happen and fun.  I find I'm playing for hours a day rather than occationally every couple weeks or months.   Once you get use to steam, and uplay and this program it all is pretty well designed. (just confusing at first with how they interrelate.  Execution, load time and logistics are quite well done. WIth a few exceptions.  There needs to be a  PAUSE and STEP FORWARD AND BACK in the riff tracker. You can pause. But then the menu covers the display. And when you unpause the area of the song you have selected restarts from the beginning.  (Doesn't continue on).  I often have to pause and try and look at what is coming and finger through it a few times before tackingly it at even the slowest speed.  At present, it doesn't allow this easily.  Next in Jam Session mode which is over all very nice... the chord changes need to be displayed. The band can make changes in the more advanced settings, but they don't show you when or what the band has changed to.  It just displays the initial ""KEY"" like ""A"".I display of what bar we're on would also be nice. So if playing the 12 bar blues progression we can see what bar the band is on. This is such a great and powerful feature (Session mode) but is lacking in things that would be really simple to add. The program already knows, it only needs to display that info to the player.   Last recommendation is the ""arcade games"" are a bit lame. They seem more random note rather than combinations of 3-4 note licks that would be more musical.  I find the arcade the least helpful part of the package. (I no longer use it).  The scales display is nice with the notes of the scale and the chord notes signified as solids.  Also - I didn't pay attention to their MISSIONS at first.  I later found if you do the missions it helps ""teach"" you your way around the program and how to use the features.  This rather manditory since the program comes with no real documentation of any value.  The holiday sale (going on as I type this) is on target... I've been waiting and I just spent around 115.00 in extra DLC.  (all the songs I like).  Of course I had to also buy RS1 on sale and the disc import tool.  I bought them on Mac (when they were never available for Mac) and I didn't have to download RS1 (why I won't want it) just the songs.  I then downloaded the disc import tool. (found on the RS2014 promo and buy page) 9.95.  It took about 30 minutes to download.  I then didn't know how to run it.  And found you don't!  Once you have it and RS1 on steam the songs just APPEARED IN MY LIBRARY!    All (well almost all) the RS1 songs (no clapton about 5 aren't included) and all the content I buy now appears in my library.  I have 175.00 invested so far. (software and DLC) I feel it's well worth it. I use to pay 30.00 per hour for guitar lessons.  Once I left I'd often forget what I was suppose to work on.  So I video taped my lessons. Still 3 lessons were 90.00. 6 lessons cost more than what I have invested in this program and I can GO BACK and see the lessons over and over again.  I'm using this on my Imac and LOVE IT.  I recommend it highly.  Ron in MI.			",197,38,12,5,37,3,2

												Vast issues with Windows 10 - tread lightly.I enjoyed the hell out of this game when I first got it on an older laptop. At some point after upgrading to Windows 10 however, I lost all my progress and had issues with audio. Now, after building a brand new computer, I was excited to get back into playing and to crank everything up for max settings. Despite trying everything on the forums, I cannot get Windows 10 to install the drivers on the cable without an error, something about I/O request denied.I am very dissapointed that nothing seems to work, that there isn't a specific driver I can download to resolve this issue, nor that there's any hope of another rocksmith sequel or updated cable to resolve this issue.If you can get this game to work, it's worth it, but I am crushed that I have to put my guitar practice on pause indefinitely, because nothing else offers me the experience of learning these notes live amongst my favorite songs.

												Taking lessons is somewhat out of the question for me, as I work 3rd shift and, most shops open about an hour before I go to bed. I enjoyed the first 10 of 15 hours of it, thought it was interesting and had fun trying to learn some songs I enjoy. But let me say something no one really brings up. The song selection has a few good songs on the stock playlist and, will get you learning how to play. However, you'll get bored of them, then the rest of the songs fall into one of these categories:-Overplayed and I now hate it. (I'm looking at you Aerosmith)-A monkey could play this.-Who the hell is this band/person?-Are these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s deaf, this is♥♥♥♥♥♥A good quarter or so of the music is Indie crap, and the good music is DLC, which at $2.99usd for a single song or $11.99usd for 5 songs, it is expensive as hell. Do you want Pirates? Because that's how you get Pirates.Honestly Rocksmith can work, but you either gotta really like the stock list, or you have spare money to toss at it (which I dont) otherwise avoid it and try to bribe someone to teach you or use youtube.

												The good:  Rocksmith 2014 is a good way to get started and if you don't have the money to get an amp right away, this is a  great alternative with all the profiling they have done it's actually fun to design and play a custom tone.  The guitarcade makes drills fun by adding a game element to it.The bad:  learning a song via flying notes that don't pause for you is not a good way to learn.  This is guitar hero with a real guitar, but you can't really learn a cover song at your own pace.  Honestly, sites like songsterr and ultimate guitar are far superior for learning a cover tune.  If you already know a cover, playing along with Rocksmith is kinda fun.  Also, just make a shortcut to Rocksmith.ini on your desktop; you're going to be in and out of that file a lot if you discover the signal from your guitar to the computer doesn't work right away.  Overall: 2/5			",14,0,0,3,1,0,6

												I have no idea what the Playstation or Xbox versions of this simulator are like, but I paid a total of £70 for the pc version, and I feel utterly cheated. The game itself is very well set out and sets things out in a very simple, easy-to-use manner (although the idiotic Californian narrator is highly irritating, but that's personal perferance) and Rocksmith should be a good tool for budding guitarists, even ones as musically inept as myself.    The reason I do not recommend this simulator however is due to the game-destroying glitches that Ubisoft still haven't tackled. Chiefly, the tone of my guitar tends to disappear after half an hour of playing, leaving a dull, dry sound in its wake. This cannot be remedied by anything other than restarting the whole thing, only for it to happen again. That hardly matters though, as typically the game will freeze shortly after this occurance.  I'd like to say this was a wise investment for any aspiring musicians, but frankly I'm going for the traditional way to learn guitar; the only thing to worry about with actual teachers are mental breakdowns, not handing them 70 quid and have them freeze and have to be restarted.

Posted: October 6, 2014
												Firstly - unlike a lot of reviewers, I have not had any experience playing guitar before.  Seems people get much more benefit if they have already have lessons / experience, and use Rocksmith to hone / improve skills.At this point I really don't know if I would recommend it or not (stupid Steam forcing one or the other).... Im still slogging through it, but I think the whole game is just schitzophrenic - trying to be a game and a teacher, and getting neither right.  IF YOU HAVE AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR - DO NOT BOTHER.... THE GAME IS NEARLY UNPLAYABLE!!!!!!  Feedback problems, poor pickup of chords and notes, constant re-tuning means this game SUCKS.  YOU NEED HEADPHONES .... Dont bother trying an acoustic without them.The game needs a ""Getting Started"" guide or some sort of walk through to help people work out how to best use the software.  When you start the game up you just randomly pick from a menu of stuff to do with some guitar picks to try and suggest what areas you should work on.  NOTHING in the way of guidance beyond that.  Getting set up was a BIG hassle (and it still isnt 100% or even 90%) with my acoustic guitar with a piezo pickup .... Lag issues and getting my guitar to even work with it was a pain, but once that was sorted, it started out being a fun way to learn.  I tried the lessons, which quickly became frustrating because the software wont always pick up notes correctly, and the lag means I had to adjust when to strum.  The ""suggested"" lessons are all over the place in order... going from some basic stuff straight to slides and stuff, before even teaching a single chord, scale, or even picking any string other than bottom E.  In other words, the ""difficulty"" ordering of the software is TERRIBLY inconsistent.  Once you do get some basics right, it jumps in difficulty to something stupidly hard (compared to the last run through) with symbols that arent explained, progressions that you arent prepared for, to name a few issues.The songs are the same.  Sure - each song says what lessons you should have covered, but even with that done, their suggested difficulty path was all over the place, adding in symbols that just arent covered.  As a song's difficulty ramps up, it does so in ridiculous amounts, and it doesnt adjust well to the problems you may be having until you suffer through the song, then it starts to figure what strings and notes you have trouble with.  The arcade games SUCK.  They obviously spent too much time on the ""arcade"" aspect of making them look like 8bit games with a lot of unnecessary, unskipable screens, and not enough on note detection, learning aspects, and difficulty streamlining.  When it says my bottom E string is in tune, the games will consistently miss detect a fret and tell me Im on the wrong one.  I had to DE TUNE the string lower than the true note in order to make it half playable.  Then once you bomb out of a game, you have to put up with screens you cant skip through before you are able to start the game again.  You spend more time in those screens than actually playing.Overall I can see some potential in the idea, but they have a lot of room for improvement.  If you think this program will teach you to play from scratch, then be prepared for a long, slow, frustrating experience as you jump from area to area trying to figure out what you are supposed to be doing, and in what order.  Once you start getting used to the game, search around for stuff, click on things, it starts to become clearer as to how it works.  A very different approach to what friends have suggested in the past for learning guitar (learning chords, tabs, etc).  I definitely wouldnt say better though.Pros:+ um.... it sorta teaches you to play guitar+ gives you something to do when you are really bored+ a fair list of songs (see the Cons)Cons:- PITA to set up, especially with an acoustic.  You have to keep the game volume right down, or use headphones cause the body of the guitar picks up sound from the speakers- Lag issues / timing is off- Note detection sucks (at least with my acoustic) and is hit and miss, meaning lessons are hard(er) to complete- No ""How to Get Started"" guide or tour- Most songs are crap and not popular, which makes playing them much harder if you dont know them at all (I had to buy a couple I knew just so I had something familiar to work with, and funny enough, I do much better with them)- The lessons are terrible and just repeat over and over, except maybe to slow down the speed, they give you no guidance as to what you are doing wrong beyone the basics (wrong fret / string)- The lessons are all over the shop - why the HELL would beginner lessons be looking to do bends, slides, hammers, etc when they cant even play all the strings and pick the right frets properly- I have a special HATE for the bends... I just about have to snap my strings for the game to recognise them.  Not to mention that a beginner probably wouldnt have the finger strength to do them (I put my hand over the top of the fretboard and managed to get a couple of bends to register because I have better strength with a squeezing motion rather than a pushing motion)- Even though the game knows what you have covered and (theoretically) what you have struggled with, it still just throws you right in the deep end with a song, forgetting all that ""learning"" it supposedly does.  It doesnt filter out stuff you havent tackled well, until you let it fail repeatedly- Arcade games with unskipable and unnecessary screens is just stupid- When repeating a lesson it doesnt even give you enough pause to get ready inbetween.  Can be probably changed in settings, but something so basic shouldnt have to be done manually when it should figure you are struggling- After each session with Rocksmith, Im left feeling frustrated and dissapointed with my (lack of) progress.   Oh, they give you a token ""pat on the back"" for a decent run, but after awhile its just so much hot air- With not detection issues it is impossible to complete some lessonsI give it a 5 out of 10.... borderline.  Im still trying to hold my frustration in check and slog through it, but it is NOT FUN.  I dont expect learning guitar to be a blast, but this game does little to make it feel more enjoyable.

												A game like ""Rocksmith"" is truly a difficult thing to review. There are so many different concepts to music and to how people want to evolve their talent that no one opinion will do justice to this game. It functions and provides a great distraction to rote training, but it honestly is not the best tool around.For starters, ""Rocksmith 2014"" does not have the best tutorial around. I guess with the rise of the YouTube era, everything is taught to you by a quick video. You are then tasked with plucking strings and holding frets without any knowledge of why. The game neglects to go farther into music theory, as well. I suppose a quick lesson on tremolos will do, but that honestly isn't going to elevate your skills farther.The next musical sin comes from the explanation of notes. If you play bass, you might as well skip this game. The game constantly badgers you to check the note book, but then only includes that option for lead guitar. Even then, there is no further elaboration on how to properly place your fingers or what the root of each note stems from.There are no detailed looks into intervals, timing, self-tuning or note patterns. You simply are told to place your finger on fret 5 and play it on the first string. It would be nice to know that is an A Note, but I suppose that little detail is irrelevant.If your only interest in music is learning how to play a very select assortment of songs, then sure; ""Rocksmith 2014"" will allow you to play those songs. You will more than likely sound sloppy and have no form, but man can you rock out to 'You Really Got Me'.In the end, I haven't spent eons with the game. The only reason I got it was because I figured it would be a good supplement to my regular music lessons. It hasn't failed in getting me more interested in playing, but it definitely has held me back from growing as a musician.I suppose this game is really only intended for those who are bored with their instrument or want to augment their playing into a really standard and unskilled manner. You will be better served calling up a good teacher and getting yourself taught the basics of music theory.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played in many bands and with different instruments. And I own this and the first rocksmith game on xbox. And the main consern is lag! LAG LAG LAG! None of these two are playable, I regret buying both! I have an exellent computer and I use it to reherse and record alot of music, and I can play the best games on it.  But this game has a serious latency problem! From the time you play a chord or tone, to the time it is registered is ridiculous... I also own every rockband and guitar hero game made, and when these also have their latency problems. When you push a button you get a more instant result, and you can play to the music. The rocksmith games does simply not work yet... I hope to play a game like this 5 years into the future when latency is no longer an issue. If you play a chord you want a reaction. What if you had this kind of lag in f.ex Ducktales, you would push jump, and fall into the pit before the duck would know to jump... Bad, bad... :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tedious! ...is how I would describe this game in one word. Only reason to buy this game is because it's one of a kind, it's the only game where you can plug in your acctual guitar to your PC/console and play.Even though the first Rocksmith was really difficult and awkward to use they managed to make this one even more aggravating.  How the settings are so minimal that unless you have the exact same likes and preferences as the developers you are not going to be happy with this game. I managed to stay in their first Rocksmith because I really enjoy playing music and also that I knew they were working on a new one, which I obviously assumed would be better, but I was wrong.

												In short I'd say this game is a poor tool for learning to play but worth picking up if you can get in on sale and can also get an inpuit without purchasing the unneccasary cable.I picked Rocksmith up from Humble just to try it out of curiosity, I've played for about 10 years or so with various bands but I struggle with the game. I find the layout so needlessly confusing I spend 99% of my effort trying to figure out what it wants me to play. Honestly a decent tab is so much easier to follow for me personally.Also the audio quality isn't great and the calibration can be hit and miss. At times it lags like hell and just ignores input which makes it unpolayble at times. The menus are fiddly and non skippable intro bugs me. I'd reccomend a tutor > various youtube channels > online resources > rocksmith in that order for someone looking to learn, but for the right person I'm sure it could be a decent supplement to other lessons.

												Alright, SO, recently I made a review for Rocksmith when I was fuming and incoherent. I now figured out what happened to my game. Also note I have spent about 400$ on Ubisoft products (Rocksmith Guitar, 2 Cables, Software, and bought DLC) **I bought DLC as recently as 3 months ago.So I've been playing for 1-2 years now and have been downloading CDLC over that time, at random. Whenever I wanted a different song I would just go and pick it up. I developed quite the list of songs and was happy with what I had for probably the past 4-5 months without getting more cdlc. Recently, October 14th 2016 to be exact, I start up rocksmith remastered with the patcher; note this had worked fine for the past 2 weeks (with the updated patcher). Hitting enter to get into the accounts screen I immediately notice there is only one account, it says ""F U C KYOU"" instead of any of my account names. I logged into the account (at first I thought I might have been hacked or something) and none of the dlc that I had bought were there or my cldc; I launched with the patcher. After a repeated attpemt, I figured UBISOFT had done this to make sure people were buying their DLC instead of downloading CDLC. I really don't care (even though it's unprofessional at best) because if you delete the game (which deletes all the cdlc and reinstall) it gives you the game back and your dlc. Which I've done, and probably will still continue to play, but this is really cheap because most of the cdlc I downloaded was USER content. Why should USER content have the same copyright problems as your specific DLC content? Any way I don't care but I thought people should know about this before buying the game. It's an incredible tool but this is not fair to a repeat customer like myself.My last review was really bad, just swearing and incoherent. I needed to fix that so I deleted the last one lol. It's best to wait a few days when your mad at a game. ANNNDDD all I'm saying is this could've been handled a THOUSAND different ways, but they chose to put ""F U C KYOU"" without a warning.This is ANNECDOTAL at this point I didn't screen cap because I was fuming mad, the game works fine now and I'm not about to try it again.

												Would be a great game if it actuall worked, I purchased it to teach my son guitar and it runs over steam streaming, but get no audio and doesn't pick up the USB input. It would have been good to know before buying it, as I don't want to have to spend $300 on another videocard for my media centre just to run a game when every other game works on steam streaming.Why can't the make it work without all these issues?

												This game looks fantastic, but if you're like me, and considering on using a different audio interface (not the Real Tone Cable), Unisoft doesn't support external devices. Yes I know there is a disclaimer before purchasing this game, but why wouldn't they support guitar/bass enthusiasts who just want to download the game and plug into their own rig (worth 10x more than some cheap official cable). Looks great, I'd love to play it but this lack of support is disappointing to me. Now I'm off to go find some workaround/crack for the next few hours that allows me to use my own interface.

												Be warned: This game is finicky as hell. Not sure if it is a bug, but with two different electric guitars I can never get past the ""tuning"" portion of the intro. The damn thing is so sensitive it is next to impossible. Both of my guitars are in tune already off of a hand held tuner, and both play fine with my amp. Sadly, you cannot skip the tuning section in the game so there is no way for me to actually try the game out.I got the game on sale, but I still spent money on the cable that is obviously not included in a digital purchase. Grr... :(Do not buy. Waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocksmith 2014 is great - that, is, if you can stand it freezing and crashing every 10 minutes.  It freezes when I try to access any lesson, it sometimes freezes at the home screen, it crashes for no reason, and sometimes, I can't even get it to start without rebooting my computer, sometimes twice.It's unfortunate, considering how improved the format and game play is from the original Rocksmith.  I was really disappointed that the freezes and crashes still occur in the upgrade.The developers really need to come up with a patch or some sort of fix for all these bugs.  Right now I'm feeling rather ripped off.  I thought I was buying an improved version which meant not having to reboot my computer 6 times an hour just to play the game.  Pretty sad - I'd like to play it more but often don't have the patience or tolerance for frustration that you must have to play Rocksmith 2014.			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Really good for learning guitar. Be sure to get the cable first or you won't be able to play it. Oh, and be warned, the game goes through Ubisofts software ""UPlay"" and i had trouble getting it to work (2 months of customer support suggesting it was user error until they finally listened to me and dealt with it them selves... Seriously, they kept telling me to ""Make sure i'm typing the activation key correctly""... I had tried it 20+ times before and sent images of proof every single time... good game,♥♥♥♥♥♥customer support.)Take this as a Yes and No rather than a flat out Yes or No for recomending it. By all means, this is the best way to learn guitar at the moment (IMO) but you have to have patience with Ubisoft possibly if you require any customer support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like the available selection of songs, then yes it is a great learning tool and fun to play. For me, there were less than a dozen songs I even recognize and only 3-4 that I actually want to learn. They should expand their repertoire to include some U2, Van Halen, B52's, RHCP, Cars, British new wave, recent pop hits and maybe even some other genres besides loud rock music. I couldn't get the program to work at all on my laptop (2007 HP, Vista) and was about to return it to the store. I installed it on my new Windows 8 machine and it worked very well and sounds great. I really hope they do something about the song selection.			",3,2,0,1,1,0,0

Is there a way to get an older version that works with XP since RS2014 is not compatible. Seems I should be able to download a version that works for my OS considering what I got doesn't.

												Rocksmith is very glitchy and has virtually no tech support. They've givin up on it like, last year. Not worth buying now. Not to mention the overly priced DLC they ♥♥♥♥♥ themselves to sell. One star.			",44,4,0,7,2,0,4
