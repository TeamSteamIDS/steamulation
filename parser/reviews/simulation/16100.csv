												A fun simulation game for those that enjoy simulation games and have some patients as this game has tasks that need to be fulfilled. The graphics aren't great but it's still fun.			",56,6,0,8,33,1,14

												I swear to god, I left this game off for two days and when I came back there was a pile of skeletons in the middle of town and an abandoned child playing in the dirt near the harvest fields.Virtual Villagers DOES NOT ♥♥♥♥ AROUND.			",1060,382,26,186,112,12,150

												I thought I’d be nice and let a 72 year old villager retire, so instead of constantly working he could do what he wanted. Here's me thinking he'll relax, go swimming and admire the flower beds like all the other villagers do between work.I took a break from the game for a bit and came back to check the villagers before I went to sleep......HE IMPREGNANTED TWELVE OF THE WOMEN, THREE OF WHICH HAD TWINS.I came back onto the game and caught him trying to ""embrace"" yet another woman.NOW THERE'LL BE A FOOD SHORTAGE, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, SOLE? YOU GINGER DEMON.This is my first attempt at this game and it was going pretty well until Sole went and ♥♥♥♥ed up everything. Literally.For some reason I just had a real urge to play some kind of sim game recently. I didn't want anything overly complicated and I remembered these games. I used to watch my sister play them when I was a bit younger and always thought they looked fun. It's a little nostalgic playing this myself now, I'm hoping I can solve all the puzzles, get all the upgrades and build up a fairly good village before I lose.I think it’s pretty fun for something to check on every now and then and try and figure out all the puzzles. The Puzzles and survival element being the majority of the game. You raise a village by giving villagers jobs, making them breed and using your newly trained villagers to make discoveries. There are 16 puzzles to solve, all of which are discoveries you can lead your villagers to. The game is made a bit harder by “random events” that happen, which usually gives you a choice and you can either benefit from it or something bad can happen. It’s possible to gain/lose part of your food supply, your research and even be hit by disease.I’ve been playing this in-between the main games I’m trying to complete and once I have done everything here, there are a few sequels I can move onto for more puzzles and such!I look forward to trying the others out as well. All in all it’s a fun little game/franchise. It’s nothing amazing but it kills time in a fun way I would say.TL;DR : A fun little sim game. It’s not the best game in the world but it’s a good time killer between other things.  ",421,281,31,20,33,5,36

												It's a great casual game. You watch over your little survivors, guide them to make the right choices, and choose in various random events what to do. It's real time, meaning if you forget about your survivors you might find your tribe wiped after half a week (although you can pause the game), it doesn't take much time at once, but it's surprsingly addictive gameplay makes you return again and again. Try the Demo. Now.			",399,55,8,45,54,4,63

												Epic game,you get annoyed by the ""no"" and ""uh uh""from the characters when you want them to do something and they won't but I already spent a good 50 hours per game in this franchize before I baught this.I've beaten the 4th game (which Steam should add *hint**hint*) and gotten close to beating the other 3.

												I bought this game out of pure nostalgia. I remember how much I used to love it when I was younger. I've been wanting to play it for a while so I finally gave the ten dollars necessary to do so. I now somewhat regret my decision because the countless hours I used to have fun with this game no longer hold up. Sure it's nice to have a real-time game that you can check on periodically like you do with Facebook or a virtual pet. This game however lacks the certain fun qualities of a real-time game. Your villagers randomly die while you're not playing and it doesn't clue you in on why it happened so that you can prevent it in the future. Overall, I would say this game is worth three dollars max. I regret paying so much for it, but now I know what seemed fun when I was younger may not be the case in present day.			",40,15,1,5,10,0,8

												Virtual Villagers is a fun game when you some time to kill. Basically, you have some shipwrecked people and you have to figure out 16 puzzles and level up 6 skills (techs) to help your villagers prosper.  You can set individual villagers to do different tasks like forage, build, heal, research, and breed, The villagers will grow old or can sick so watch out for that.  It's a real time game, which means the game continues on when you're not playing. Be warned, this game does not ♥♥♥♥ around about the real time aspect. Last night I had 13 villagers (mostly females) and I set one male to be a breeder. I woke up to find I had 63 villagers ( 5 scientist adults and everyone else was a child), almost  no food and a pile of skeletons. The real time can make losing easy.			",195,136,2,50,62,3,19

												anoyingly fun considering the game is just a bunch of simple sprites moving about a basic map.it is surprisingly in depth and addictive in the pursuit of carrying on the generations of your beloved sprites and remarkbly very few bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is pretty fun. A good game to kill some time. You can just leave it and check back from time to time.... however if you go for a long time, make sure to pause it or.... everyone dies.. it's so sad :(			",292,91,6,90,45,2,75

												A couple of days late, but regardless:After years since I first received the game, I finally managed to finish all the puzzles. I'd say it is a pretty good game from ""Last Day of Work"" studios.My only complaint would be that one quest is more luck-based because you cannot lead the villagers to work on it.
