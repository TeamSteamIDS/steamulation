												Like all DASH games, the formula is the same but the toppings are different. If you like these kinds of games then this one is a no-brainer! Great for soon to be Weds!			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												I love this game but was disappointed when playing it. I don't think it was worth $10. The game itself is a little glitchy and is constantly quitting unexpectedly on me.			",0,0,0,0,5,0,0
