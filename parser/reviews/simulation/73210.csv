												A lot of players have called Sengoku a not-quite-Crusader Kings II: something Paradox released when they didn't quite have CKII's system down, but wanted to make money with something they had thus far. People had told me it was mediocre, and so I wasn't interested in spending too much money on it. Recently it went on sale for $2.70, which is about the same amount of money spent on a few Mountain Dew Kickstarts at 7-11, so I decided to try it out, being a lover of strategy games in general and especially the Sengoku Jidai time period.So is it true that it's like a poor man's CK2? Actually, there's a LOT of truth in this. Sengoku is basically somewhere between CKI and CKII, with elements from both games in the interface and gameplay. You have your nobles, you marry them, have heirs, interact with nobles above and below you (depending on who you play), and improve the desmense you control directly. Unlike in CKII and later Paradox games, you can't go to war with specific regions as a war goal, but you can capture provinces in a war and keep them as soon as peace is made (a bit like how wars of religion happened in CK1).Warfare is like any other Paradox game, with individual armies battling it out and battles won/lost depending on a combination of numbers and morale. How the morale is decided, I don't know - sometimes I just throw armies at my enemies and hope the little green bar stops going up and down until I win. The AI does that annoying thing that the AI often did in older Paradox games - namely, refusing to try to stop your armies and just meandering around taking empty provinces, leaving their home country wide open or permitting their armies to be surrounded. In the end, I sometimes fought wars like I was dealing with modern armies - ie., lining up several columns of soldiers and charging into my enemy's territory with a line of forces. If you're looking for a Sengoku Jidai game with detailed individual battles, or campaigns that operate like real campaigns do, you would probably do best to invest in the far superior Shogun 2 Total War (or even its predecessor, which is still one of the best TW games in my opinion).One of the major hang ups with Sengoku is that, because the war aspect is so limited, you rely heavily on court and political gameplay for entertainment - but this is incredibly lacking. Unlike in CK2 (or even CK1, for that matter), where you could spend half the game wheeling and dealing to work your way up the ranks of medieval royalty and politics, and plenty of events permitted you to interact and make use of your character's personal traits, there is not much of that in Sengoku. Generally, the only interaction I had was having to turn down nobles who kept asking for land and funding my kid's education. I'm sure there are some mods out there that add way more events and make court life as interesting as it was in medieval Japan, but as far as the vanilla game goes, it feels almost unfinished. In the end, it comes across more as a CK2 mod someone made, rather than an actual game created and published onto the market.Do I recommend this game? This is where I wish Steam had a ""maybe"" option. I put down ""Yes"" because the game is fun every now and then, or if you want something CK-ish that is set in medieval Japan...but I would not spend too much money on it. Get it when it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw only negative reviews so let me bring some variation to the mix. If you have an interest in grand strategy games, and are willing to do a bit of homework (don't worry, just a YouTube search) this game will become really addictive.The game is a strategy game, but you could also describe it as a role-playing game in the same sense as dungeons and dragons is a role-playing game. It's all about your chosen dynasty and how you develop it. So instead of a character you'll be playing a line of characters. That is if you're lucky enough to survive the onslaught going on in 15th-16th century Japan, and your family head manages to produce offspring. If you lose all your lands, or your dynasty ends it is game over.This happens often, and that's a good thing. Not achieving the ingame goals doesn't really feel like a loss, just like the death of a character in a good book doesn't feel like a failure of the author. I just lost a game where I managed to conquer 50% of Japan (one of the in game goals) but I didn't manage to be shogun for 3 years (the other goal). So technically I lost, but I donâ€™t remember it that way.When early on I found out my character, the second clanleader of the Nanbu clan, had became infertile, with no male heir, I realized time had become an important factor in my strategy. Thankfully the father of the clanleader had already managed to conquer the complete northern tip of Japan by scheming with other small clans, and now the clan controlled about 20% of the map. I launched a frantic military attack on my most powerful neighbor, the Togashi, who had grown from a small region to the biggest force on the map, about 35%. With some help of another clan, the Amago, I managed to conquer most of his land, which also made his military strength weaken. There was not much the Togashi could do, being battered from the east by the Nanbu (me) and later on from the west by the Amago, who were about as powerful as I was. I started to divide my newly conquered lands under my vassals, who sadly were not my sons but other members of my court. I pressed on unrelenting, I had to achieve my goals with only little time left, as my clan leader started to grow older and older with no male heir. When the Togashi were wiped of the map and hadn't provided me with the right amount of land, I backstabbed the Amago with whom I had conspired before and took a lot of their land as well.Because the clan leader of the Nanbu had become infertile at a young age he didn't produce any offspring. He finally became shogun at age 71. He was so close to victory he, and I, could almost taste it. And then he died at age 72, only two years short of achieving our goals. Every playthrough becomes a short story like that. Never does the playthrough feel like you played it already, not even if you decide to pick the same clan for a second time. The thing is that you need some imagination to fill in the gaps that this simulator leaves you with. I guess that if you can't add to it with your own imagination this game is a dull list of stats. But if you can imagine the stats and the simple  portrait of your character and other characters as being real, and manage to connect the dots, this game is an endless story generator. To summarize; this game is more like a book than a movie, where for most games it is the other way around. For me every playthrough feels like an unique interactive story. I can imagine that to others it might seem like a glorified spreadsheet.			",60,12,0,12,2,0,5

												In Sengoku you control a Japanese noble in the Sengoku Jidai period. You develop provinces, hire and direct armies, conduct diplomacy, and once your noble inevitably dies, you continue playing as his heir. This continues until someone manages to unite half of Japan for 3 years, thereby becoming shogun.The game is very similar to the next game by Paradox Development, Crusader Kings 2, The main difference besides the setting being that whereas CK2 is (arguably) primarily about the relations and personalities of characters, Sengoku is primarily about waging war.Declaring war in Sengoku is as simple as spending some honor. (You need no casus belli.) However, you don't want your honor to fall too much, or your subordinates will cause you trouble, so you need to replenish honor by making gifts of money and land, acquiring titles at the imperial court, build temples, etc.Unfortunately, while this honor mechanic is fun, it doesn't really keep you occupied very much, and unlike CK2, it's the only non-war element of the game with any real substance to it. There's very little depth to diplomacy, plotting, dynasty-building, or ambition-chasing; the economic model is very simple; and there is no tech-tree. At any time that I wasn't at war, I set the game to maximum speed until I had enough resources to start another war. There simply wasn't much of anything to do.Unfortunately, combat isn't any better than in CK2 either. It's mostly a matter of creating a big stack with a decent leader and sending it to the enemy. You get to decide where the armies go, but once you meet the enemy and combat starts, it's all purely abstract with some numbers going down over time. It's more fun than it probably sounds, but not a lot more. And again, CK2 does it better, since there you can at least divide your troops over the flanks and center, assign leaders, and utilize a greater variety of troop types.In conclusion, while I can't say that Sengoku is a bad game, I simply cannot recommend it, since it's been so thoroughly obsoleted by CK2.

												If you are looking for an alternative to Total War Shogun, this is the best game for you.  If you got dat dopeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥swag, this is the best game for you.  If you like committing ritual suicide to maintain your honor, this is the best game for you.  If you like marrying off your 10 year old daughters to your neighboring clan leader whose land holdings are a bajillion times larger than yours to make sure they don't kill you, this is the best game for you.If you enjoy the sweet taste of victory after you have just slaughtered an entire clan, this is the best game for you.If you like samurai, this is the best game for you.If you like staring out your window while planning world domination, this is the best game for you.If you like tea ceremonies, this is the best game for you.If you like having to take a break from the game so you can figure out what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just happened and how you are all of a sudden fighting a war against all of your neighbors except that one guy Steve because he married your 10 year old daughter, this is the best game for you. This game is amazing.  It is a grand strategy game set in the Sengoku Jidai period of Japan.  It is totally unfair how this game is considered ""mixed"" simply because everyone is comparing it to Crusader Kings.  I call bull on that.  11/10 Would appease larger clans until enough people want to stab them in the back, then kill that entire family			",70,3,0,15,14,0,22

												This game... oh man this game. It's basically CKII lite set in Japan. That's not necessarily bad, but you will not enjoy this game if you keep comparing it to CKII. Aside from that, it's pretty fun. There are a couple of unique features not found in CKII, such as the Religious Factions system and the goal in this game is pretty clear - Become Shogun of Japan. There aren't flexible starts like in most of Paradox's grand strategy games. Another unique thing about this game is that sieged provinces automatically become yours. That means expansion is quick in this game. That also means that you can lose all of your land pretty easily. This game, although inferior to CKII, is still very fun and interesting. Rewrite history, and unite Japan!			",37,7,0,4,12,0,10

												Surprisingly entertaining and substantially less complicated than I thought it would be, CRUSADER KINGS II: JAPAN EDITION (Sengoku) is a grand strategy game that puts you in charge of uniting the clans of Japan under your rule as Shogun. Of course, there's nearly a hundred other different clans with that very same objective, so you'll have to play your cards right using diplomacy, might and sabotage to earn the respect of the emperor and conquer the nation.You can HIRE NINJAS to COUNTER OTHER NINJAS, assemble armies of RONIN and even stab other leaders in the back! Also, GUNS. IF you happen to be visited by western traders.Also, since it's Ancient Japan we're talking about, HONOR is a very important currency, with a decisive hand in negociations and your internal political stability: be an honored leader and the other clans and your people will respect you and your decisions. Screw up and you might as well commit sepukku to guarantee your lineage (yes, you can do that and, yes, if your son fails to become the next ruler when you die, it's GG).RECOMMEND. Just beware that matches can (and wil) last FOREVER (as in, more than half a dozen hours forever), so you better be patient. Also, do yourself a favor and play at maximum speed - you can pause to issue orders anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A interesting strategy game based in the lands of Japan. This game spans the period of time when lords were constantly fighting for territory. Considering that I'm writing this review without having played any of the other games made by the developer I can say that this game is good from my understanding of it. There are some pros and cons I feel that need to be brought up, though take into account I'm not a expert at evaluting games.Pros:-Somewhat addictive, possible to play this for hours. I keep finding myself returning to it.-Quite fast-paced and fun depending on who you play-An interesting take on Japan, relevant for those with some interest for that country-Satisfies military and management minded peopleCons:-Difficult. One moment you could have a lot of territory, the next thing you know half your nation is in civil war, which is tricky to manage (Though this could just be my skill!)-A little hard to get into. I found it quite difficult to really understand what I was doing at the start.-Unbiased starting positions. It is part of the game to choose who you want to be but sometimes it just seems impossible to play some nations. -Those damn Ikko-ikki. Stop invading my territory goddamit!			",56,7,0,16,40,0,26

												First off I'd like to say that Sengoku is a very good game. It focuses heavily on the internal affairs of a clan and the political relationships with the other clans in Japan. It also brings about an interesting land management system that must be used carefully. One must be careful not to promote undeserving vassals who are likely to rebel against their master. However, the combat does leave a bit to be desired as it is nothing more then really a number game. Having a general with high martial skill and a large number of troops guarantees your victory. Primarily, the game focuses on an even pacing between combat and diplomacy so as to advance your clans influence throughout the realm and not angering those within and around you by acting dishonorably or becoming too threatening. Over all, I would give the game an 8.5/10.			",36,0,0,3,3,1,13

												There is no tutorial I have found for this game, sides comments from various forums, I've googled.But if you like a almost 'Game of Thrones' style deception, diplomacy, backstabbing, plotting, assasination styled game with the end goal being a Shogun of Japan then this is the strategy game for you. Forget watching epic armies clash it out, that's more like Shogun 2, no this game is built on the decisions you make and your handling of the pressure.I've not heard of any more support for this game, but overall I have still thoroughly enjoyed this game nonetheless.Therefore I reccomend it. I'd give it 7.5/10			",9,0,0,2,3,0,1

												Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.If you are interested in Japanese history, you probably already know that the Sengoku Jidai or Warring States (C.E. 1467-1573) is a defining part of it, culminating in the Tokugawa Shogunate. This game places you in control of any one of a large number of clans in this era. From there, your strategy skills decide if it will be your clan that rises to unify Japan, or fade into obscurity. It is impossible not to compare this to Crusader Kings though, with which it has a lot in common. You can call this a ""proto-Crusader Kings"", as some of the systems are the same, but it still lacks a lot of the things that made CK2 so brilliant! Even so, it has a charm all its own.Through diplomacy, assassination, warfare and alliances, you can change history, which is always fun, right?Pro: *A fairly deep strategy game from the masters of the genre, Paradox.*A setting that will have you hooked if you love the period. *Frequently on sale for hardly more than a CK2 or EU4 unit pack.Con:*Falls short of its brilliant sibling, Crusader Kings II.*Takes some effort to understand the mechanics, which can be complex.*Battles aren't really that involved, the conquest is where the fun lies.Summary:The game is similar to the excellent Crusader Kings II, though it lacks some of the brilliance and fun of CK2, not to mention the scope. Nevertheless, it succeeds in being a very detailed and interesting strategy game set in a defining moment of Japan's history. 6/10 -Recommended.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sengoku is yet another of the mods for a Paradox game turned into a full fledged retail release. This one in particular was a mod for Europa Universalis 3 intended to add dept to an otherwise neglected Japan. And it succeeded quite well, both then as a mod and now as a full game.Where most of the other mod made retail releases from Paradox never seem to move beyond their mother game Sengoku manages to introduce several new concept and in many ways drastically change the gameplay from what was present in regular Europa Universalis 3.The setting is Japan with all the diplomacy and politics that entails. Several concepts from the Crusader Kings series are brought over with spies, marriage and character sheets now taking up a good portion of your time. Warfare is less emphasized which is unusual for a Paradox game but for my part there is a good amount of satisfaction in finally being able to play as a political entity rather than a warmongering horde without having to handicap your advancement in the game.Honor is introduced as an important new resource that determines many of the possibilities available to you, most notably if you can safely declare war on your neighbors. With the introduction of character sheets also comes the vassal system from Crusader Kings and all the turmoil that brings.Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of Sengoku is also it's greatest weakness. It's location. Feudal Japan is a fascinating place full of both familiar and foreign concepts. But it is also a place few people know about and while that may be enticing to some, many others will be put off by not being able to play as a faction they know. Going into a grand strategy game is daunting enough as it is, doing it when the game is set in a world you don't fully understand with factions and people you have never heard about only makes it all that more overwhelming.And that leads us to the flaw that all Paradox Grand Strategy games seem to suffer from. Figuring out what to do and how to do it is purely trial and error. Sengoku has little in the way of hints and tutorials and it's incredibly frustrating to have to play multiple sessions just to learn the very basics of how the game functions. In particular new players will find it a difficult game to like.All in all Sengoku is a game with many flaws but it is also a game that manages to do what Paradox tried and failed with when they made Europa Universalis Rome.Sengoku combines the grand leadership and empire building of the Europa Universalis series with the character development and personal politics of the Crusader kings series and once you get into it, that is one great combo.

												Having recently reviewed and rubbished the over-paced Total War: Shogun 2, I move on to another game set in that extremely popular period, Sengoku Jidai, this time it is the aptly named Sengoku.This is a much easier game to stomach. It was something of a warmup for Crusder Kings 2, I believe, and it feels thus: a lightweight, pared back real time grand strategy game with some pacific art and music working together with simple but effective gameplay.Like Shogun 2, brinkmanship and vicious attacks are rewarded in Sengoku. Again like Shogun 2, your opponents can be cold as stone or grudingly warm. Unlike Shogun 2, none of this is shoved down your throat, and the pacing is largely in your own hands. Sure, when you get close to the borders of giant factions like the Uesugi you will have to think quick if you are going to avoid anihilation, but the pace of the game never seems subjugated by the gameplay in the same way that it is in Shogun. A bit more attention is paid to the civil affairs of the time, too, with marriages and the like a key part or the gameplay - not the mention the all important Honour currency, which is great fun to build, and even greater fun to spend.This game is a calm, patient exercise in faction building and subtle, largely representative intrigue - you fill in the blanks with your own imagination in various instances - and it is a really nice thing to try to get your teeth into over a weekend or on a long flight.

												Become Shogun of Japan in Paradox Interactive's Sengoku!There is a huge amount of clans in the game, where the player can start out as the leader of a clan, or just a vassal of a clan's family. This allows different playstyles, such as starting out as the head of a clan and immediately going to war, or breaking free from your leige and forming your own clan and forcing your leige to commit seppuku (ritualistic suicide). The game also puts the aspect of religion, as upsetting a religious group will cause rebellions to spawn near a temple, shrine, or church of that particular group; having good relations will grant the player bonuses. Although the teminology and mechanics of the game are hard to learn at first, it's easy to understand.The soundtrack is amazing, as well.Would recommend Sengoku to a friend.			",92,4,0,15,11,1,9

												A small game, but very complete nonetheless. Set during the Sengoku era, ""Sengoku"" (yes, no sh*t) allows you to play as a daimyo, or a lord if you prefer. Treaties, treasons, assassinations, wars, religions: choose your way to become the Shogun. With a gameplay similar to Crusader Kings II, decent graphics (but that's not the point when you play a wargame) and an historical accuracy that can be perfected with mods (oh, yeah, mod-friendly), Sengoku is a game worth the money. The replay value is theorically infinite -theorically because one can easily be bored to see the same map again, and again. If you love wargames, or Japan: go ahead, you filthy weeaboo.

												Decent introduction to Paradox strategy games.  I think this game had a lot of potential, but I think Crusader Kings II came out not long after it and stole all of its support, forcing it to receive minimal updates and no DLC. For that reason, the game feels a tad unpolished, and really could have benefited from some patches. The play style is similar to CKII, just less in-depth.  If you are intimidated by the level of commitment a Paradox game demands, but have really wanted to check out their games, this is a great one to start with if you see it on sale.  If you are a seasoned player, however, I would skip it unless you are really into the setting.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sengoku is very similar to Crusader Kings (I've not played CK, but am familar with it). There are characters and lines of succession to worry about. Creating or getting vassals is important as there are about 100 factions in the Japan of this time era. In order to win, you need to control 50% of Japan. This really can't be done as outright conquest. For one thing, your provincial leaders will get angry if you have too many provinces. So, diplomacy and some warfare is what the game is all about.This is a complicated game. There are hint boxes, but only the most diehard of turn based strategy fans will stick with this game. Dealing with all the various characters and factions is overwhelming. Oh, you can also build some structures in provinces, but they take years to finish. There is also religion involved.Anyway, I am sure it is fun, but very complicated and involved.			",36,24,0,42,19,0,59

 ClarificationLet me start by saying that it wasn't my cup of tea. I liked some aspects of the game and while I would avoid Sengoku, it has more positive reviews than negative. That's a statement on it's own. No one can argue that it's the best game ever made, but it sure has character.Then why the negative review? Let me list some pros & cons.CONS: * Clunky Interface* AI is below average at best with several examples, from the diplomacy screen to army movements.* Shallow gameplay. In Sengoku you mostly wage war, and when you don't aside from honor there's really not much else going on from what I experienced.PROS:* Engine wise, it's playable on older rigs.* Found it's map to be way more interesting than both Crusader King games* Music. One of it's high points.* Immersion. It still manages to suck you in.TL;DRThe unpolished cousin of Crusader King. Nice ideas, poor implementation.BUTIf you can overlook some of it's flaws, then this game could be a diamond in the rough.RecommendationsEuropa Universalis or Crusader Kings. Apart from those you can try Total War's Shogun.Edited for Formatting ",205,42,9,32,23,5,32

												I love the idea of this game, a strategic game based in the sengoku period. However, this game has some issues... It has very, very, very limited tooltips and it's interface isn't the easiest to understand, especially if you aren't used to these types of games.It's learning curve is quite steep so be mindful of that. I would like to recomend this game because I quite enjoy it but like I said, it has some issues I wish could get fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great start for the Sengoku era, it could be even bigger with some kind of DLC or a SENGOKU 2. For those who are familiar with Paradox games like CKII would feel like this is a interesting but a easy game. I like the theme and that it differs from the usual games, what is also expected taking the cultural differencies in factor. I recomend for everyone to try this game and let's hope, that Paradox will work on it to make additional tasks aviable for this game in the future. Althoug I just started this game I quickly came into understanding what is what. Also achievements whould be nice.

												A lot of people play Crusader Kings II, get hooked and immediately want another fix. They then see Sengoku, play it and compare it to CKII which is rather unfair to the game. As a person who loves these type of games and is interested in Japanese culture and history, Sengoku charmed me. It doesn't have all the trims and whistles like CKII (even compared to the base game), but the basic ideas are still there - become a mighty lord and live to pass your empire to the next generation. It can get repetative it you let it, but I have found that things can get very hairy very quickly, both as a smaller lord and as you get closer to finishing your objective. It is well worth the price and if you go in without expecting a Japanese  CKII, the game will both charm and frustrate you (the amount of lords that have died childless..! *shakes fist*).

												The AI can be frustrating at times. For a game that practically forces you to delegate most of your possessions to the AI, it's not nice losing because your ""allies"" are running around doing their own thing and recklessly getting more provinces than they can handle, instead of trying to help defend against the behemoth of a magically united enemy army pummelling your core.And even if you're not dead, trying to reorganise the leadership for your provinces so that everybody will shut up about getting a daimyo title even though they're the ones preventing you from giving them one is a nightmare. In anything short of a perfect game, which probably includes giving provinces only to your own lineage because they are less noisy, you will have some person harassing you for a new province every 2 turns. They also whine and get angry at you if you refuse their ridiculous, incessant request.Paradox, with their great hindsight and playtesting, decided to use dialog popups for this mechanic, along with other minor events. Far more important events, like diplomacy, are delegated to minimised icons that can easily and accidentally be automatically declined because you had the game at maximum speed. It really should be the other way around.These kinds of nuisances, which are slowly being solved by the community through mods, are the kinds of things that Paradox should've noticed and fixed after playing merely 8 rounds or so of their own game.With that aside, if you're not a topkek n00b like me and can get a hang of all the games mechanics, including ninjas, ronin recruitment, terrain modifiers, and access to nearly every character in Japan, then you can find this game enjoyable. The game mechanics are also a bit unique compared to other games, even to CK II.I know it seems contradictory to my other game reviews that I recommend a game that I review so harshly, but this game can actually be great if you're the right player. I just assume that I'm not the right player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is lovely thematically. very much in demand from the depth of Japanese culture/history, and has the unique system of 'honour', but the aesthetics are undermined by the beauty of Shogun: Total 2's interface and the mechanics are far inferior to CKII: it's a shallow, weak counterpart to alternatives. I'd highly recommend waiting for Sengoku 2, which is plausible from the popularity of Japan's turbulent military past, it'll likely have higher artistic merit honouring Japanese traditions and CKII's (or III) depth.

Captains Log, 09.11.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Sengoku. There are as many pieces to a mosaic as there are people and strategies to meet and learn in Sengoku. A really  different approach to the usual strategy game, in many ways! First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv] Sengoku is a strategy game in a very sincere interpretation of the word. It is not a real time unit construction and management simulation with samurai set in Japan. It is a real-time (with pause option) and historically precise, very deep strategy game that also features large amounts of diplomacy and family / clan management next to the economic and military parts of it [A large chunk to bite of for my short look/review into it. But here is what I can tell]: You choose a relevant starting point in the history of ancient Japan (1400-1600) and take control of a daimyo, a vassal or another part of a Clans history in one of the many provinces of medieval Japan. Depending on your choice the game gives you an estimate of the difficulty you will have to reach the games goal: To control at least halve of Japan and become Shogun! A fair warning at this point: The game has layers of tactical options: economy, warfare, and diplomacy, family, tradition vs. western influence, religion, honor and politics are all part of those options. Including hiring Ninjas, arranging weddings, exchange of hostages and seppuku of the clan leaders to uphold family / clan honor and forward the next generation to leading the clan to victory! It really is a deep tough as nails strategy game.It is because of the aforementioned, that I fear and love what the game presents to a first time player. It is a game that is as overwhelmingly complex as it promises to be intriguing and challenging in a very good way. All the while, just to maybe rub it in: It is a very nice and absolutely not overused setting for such a game. That may sell it for one or two professional Strategy Game Players. It does not contain Orcs or Aliens!So you are looking at a challenging strategy game, where you choose the path to victory! You have to consider a lot of things before you make your move, thatâ€™s when you unpause the game, and then you watch your plans and plots unfold and hopefully achieve victory over your rivals! And of course, a lot of times you will see your plans unmade, your plots failing or even backfiring. You will struggle. Always.Look and feel and sound: The game looks as massively complex as its mechanics suggest. You have tons of menus, information pages, map filters to show clan, family or religious belief in the many provinces of ancient Japan. The music is very nicely done, fits the era and setting very well as far as I can tell. The controls work perfectly for what they should achieve. Only the camera setting is a bitâ€¦off. It feels clunky to me. Overall a good looking game in all the important aspects: Text is readable, colors distinguishable (a real achievement due to there being 250 different ones used to show the different families, provinces etc.) and the pictures of People look believable and true to a depiction of the time. Units on the map are really more like figures on a gameboard, but still, they are animated. I cannot say anything about combat. It took me about 2 hours to understand what the game does and where I find which information.Captains Orders:Enthusiast Strategists who can enjoy a fresh setting and have an interest in ancient Japan find a real treasure here. Other players should maybe watch some more gameplay / tutorials of the game before buying it. My review and gameplay is really a bit to short for the games size. I say: Go get more information before you buy! Verdict: Cargo!  A game that bursts through my Uncharted Waters format, because of its sheer complexity and large obstacle course of rules and information that you need to get through before actually playing it. Sengoku still is a very interesting game that I will check out â€“ when I can find the time. Maybe I will even write an extended review then. It deserves it.For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] ",478,173,4,108,32,2,78

												I am not sure that i have spent enough time in Sengoku to be able to properly judge it but it was very hard not to compare the game to Crusader Kings II. The setting is interesting, the map is lovely to look at and the game do have a honour system but outside of that most features in the game do seem to be more properly developed in Crusader Kings II.That does not mean that the game is bad and for some the setting will be enough to compensate for what it lacks in terms of features, ui improvements and general content. What i will say though is that just as in CKII the combat is very basic and i did personally find that this games diplomacy, roleplaying, politics options were not fleshed out enough to hold my interest for a long time.This game is cheap and if a friend would ask me if it is worth a try then i would say that it is if you have played crusader kings II and/or are interested in the setting.

												When I got Sengoku, I thought that this would be very much like crusader kings 2 but set in feudal Japan I was partly right. but the fact that this game came a whole year before CK2 is very apperent.  A lot of the mechanics and style of game play are very similar to what would eventually become CK2 however, there are a lot of design desicions that make the game in some ways almost make you instantly lose everytime. If you want to play a smaller clan, forget about it. virtually any clan that is larger than yours will imediatly move in and take all your land the moment you press play. Diplomacy is bad to none existant, as marriages pretty much mean nothing except for baby making. many if not all of these issues are fixed in crusader kings 2, which is clear that at least Paradox had learned from their mistakes.  In short, if you are looking if you are looking to play a game about being a Warlord in feudal Japan just get Shogun Total War. If you want a game that focuses on politics and intrigue just get Crusader kings 2.			",43,7,0,22,19,0,27

												A lot of people say it's just JapaneseCrusader Kings 2 and they are kind of right; Sengoku operates on a slightly older, slightly more broken version of CK2's engine. That being said, if you like CK2 you'll probabyl like it for what it is. It is more intimate, as the game only deals with the island of Japan. It is horribly fractured in this time period so there is plenty to do, whether you simply want your dynasty to live, usurp your leige's title, or unite all of Japan. It isn't that expensive as is and frequently goes on sale, so if you are 100's of hours into CK2 and sick of looking at a Karling blob or Mongol hordes, pick this up.			",81,14,0,28,12,1,15

I don't understand what kind of Ruler they were since everything is playable from a great big clan with tons of wars... to a minor vassal in a peaceful nation. Forge alliances, intrigues making plots, if you are a low standing individual in a big clan.Gain honor and then lose it due to wars.... siege castles with big armies or just attack them losing a lot of soldies with 10,000 attack a force of 1,000 and win over provinces!

												Paradox Interactive games have either been a hit or miss for me. Some players get easily bored of these type of games. Although sometimes I do too, I will give Paradox Interactive credit for Sengoku. Despite the approach of the game, Sengoku failed to achieve anything like its predecessors or successors. The game is focus on war and how Japanese Feudal lords were aiming for their own supremacy. Sadly, this is where the games fail to give the player any incentive to continue playing. I felt that Sengoku was a test for Paradox Interactive to create even better games. Compared to other great titles like Crusader Kings 2 or Victoria II, Sengoku is such a letdown. Overall, Sengoku is a game that is not on par with Paradox Interactive's standard. Despite my disinterest in Sengoku, I have to applaud Paradox Interactive for their future games. Sengoku was a test for Paradox Interactive and the game studio found their luck with their successors.Rating: 3.5/10 (35%)No Achievements.Game Done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you enjoy Civ or other empire building games, you'll enjoy this game!it does have a few shortcomings - requires lots of reading, like any empire building game.

												Okay, where do I begin. This is my first review, and I'm really excited to write up one about it. Gotta warn though, I won't address its features as much as the question, `is it worth to buy this?`Sure is. Read on, gonna be a long one.For a start, I'd like to ask everyone not to discard this review for the minimal amount of hours put into the game. At this very point, it's about 10 minutes. Might seem hilarious, considering you can't really fully explore the game in such a short interval, thence, you don't really have a say about its worth. Well, you might be right. Then again, I'll just try to use it to my advantage.I'm fairly experienced in the Paradox Grand Strategies, and for one, just a brief peek was enough to forge an opinion. The game seems not only to stun the player with the array of mapmodes, parameters and alike factors simulating the whole process of governing a state of sorts (being this abstract here as I'm referring to the general features shared by all Paradox Strats), let alone the countless pop-up windows that fan out before you -- a bit confusing to distinguish the relevant from the useless ones, isn't it? -- Yeah, don't be confused. The initial size of the map you may see on the screenshot might give you an impression, `Isn't there so little to it?` It's spacious.And on a side note, if you happen to be in love with the Japanese (or generally asian) culture, much like me here, then you'll definitely enjoy the abundance of terminology and design just out there to help you with immersion.Aside that, it comes for a ridiculously low price, so if you happen to be brand new to Paradoxians' products in this field, a shot at this will help you figure out if their strategies are, `cut out` for you.Oh and, did I mention the 75% discount?

												Another excellent Strategy game by Paradox Interactive. Although not on a Grand Strategy scale like EU or HoI whom needs plenty of attention to manage your Empire, Sengoku even though a specific strategy game based on 16th Japan - requires on-the-fly managing to ensure you're clan doesn't wipe out, provinces are safe and relations are intact etc. This fast paced game is harsh on those not aware overall on what their clan is up to so make sure you learn how to play!

												I have to say, I was quite disapponted with this one. I normally really like Paradox games, but this one really falls short. There is only one objective: War. To conquer at least half of Japan and hold it for three years. There are very few random events, none of which were interesting. Starting as a tiny nation and trying to grow from there is very difficult. You are doing great if you can just manage to survive. You will probably spend the first decade just building your castle and village. It is likely, though, that you will be complely outgunned. I could be a little more patient and play this game some more, but everything that I do depends on the enemy not attacking me first, which is completely random.There are almost no economics to this game. No trade deals or anything like that. Diplomacy is a joke. If you are looking for a good grand strategy experience, you should try ANY other Paradox strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this in the Paradox Humble Bundle, so for the price of the package, I can't complain. But if you're buying this and it's not under $3 then I wouldn't suggest wasting your time.It's like a watered-down Crusader Kings II. The only objective is total domination of Japan, and you can't sneak your way into inheriting land or anything because matrilineal marriage is a no-go. Plots have been replaced with ninjas that you just pay to do the deeds, you can declare war whenever you want as long as you have the honor to do it (so you don't need claims to wage war), laws aren't existent, when adding buildings to your demesne you get a tax modifier of -70% and one of your council has to be there in order for it to happen, you have absolutely no control over your vassals, and some other junk I won't get into. If you want a game that removes everything in CKII except a few character traits, a big map, and war, then please buy this game.TLDR; Just go buy Crusader Kings II, it's better than this and has more options. The only way I could recommend this game is if you wanted to buy a sort-of-tutorial for CKII.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Could gain significant territory in short time as well as losing it.-Suits people who loves management game.Cons:-Lacks of troops variants and technologies (which i think should be one of the deciding factors in a war).-Getting a son could be a trouble.This game does not focus on the war/battle aspect.

I want to conquer the whole Asia.There also aren't really much console commands to goof around.Occasional crashing is another nuisance.And very little mods to compensate. And if there are any, they require you to register to Paradox Forums.But it's fun for a while. If you like CK2, you'll like Sengoku. If for no other reason, but for the change of scenery.

However as I have invested hundreds if not thousands of hours into each of those games (mostly offline mode) this game feels like a lite version. Ths UI is very similiar and the traits you can gain even use the same icons as CK2 but there just doesn't seem to be as much meat as either of the other games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly, paradox really missed the mark on this title, and I feel almost ripped off. Its a dumbed down, re-skinned version of thier earlier titles. This game has limited diplomatic options, and usually the strongest clan will win. I dont see any options available for a weaker clan to have any possible chance at success. I put 4 hours into this game, and sensed it was going nowhere. Very sad.When a game like shogun: total war has more options and its 3D , you know thier is a problem. No in depth strategy here.

												A weaker, earlier version of Crusader Kings 2, set in Japan instead of Europe. It's not a bad game in itself, but why play it when there's better? C			",93,57,2,29,6,2,25

												For once I was a bit disappointed by a Paradox game, but in this case I can clearly write that upon my own fault: I expsected something in the style of Total War: Shogun, but technically this is a 'prequel' of Crusader Kings II. And as such, I couldn't get myself far into this game, because every 15 seconds I found a design flaw bothering me, which was 'fixed' in CK II (and I'm a pretty lengthy CK II player).So if you consider buying this... don't. Just get Crusader Kings II instead, it beats this game by an absurdely large span.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awful the primise is basically pick the biggest clan in order to have fun because you can't rise up as a small power and a lot of the menus in this game are pointless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
