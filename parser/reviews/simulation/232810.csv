Early Access Review
GODUS 2.0 - The Regenesis of the Regenesis of the God Game?Godus 2.0 was supposed to be that big patch [that took them half a year to deliver] that would change and improve everything. But what has really changed? Is Godus now the God Game we all thought it would be when Peter asked for our money on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access or is it still something you should avoid if you haven't bought it yet?The short answer is: Godus is way better now but still not worth your money, maybe at a 75% discount but not if you have to pay 19€ for it. Do you want to know why? Keep on reading.2014-05-27: Review is still accurate, Godus is still not a real (PC) game.Core GameplayThe land in Godus consists of different layers which you can push, pull or completely remove, but not add. This so-called sculpting it the main mechanic of the game, you will spent most of your time flattening the land so that your followers have enough room to build new abodes and spread. Compared to the previous versions you can now sculpt more land before you have to click again, which is a real improvement but the mechanic still doesn't feel quite right. It's more enjoyable but only if done in small peaces, if you try to sculpt larger areas it gets really annoying especially cos stuff like digging down or moving multiple layers doesn't unlock till way later in the game. In addition to sculpting you have some god powers like beautifying land, plant trees or conjuring rain to aid your farmers. These powers look neat but you won't use them very often, they just don't add anything noticeable to the gameplay. BeliefIn order to sculpt land and to fuel your god powers you need belief, the main resource in Godus. Belief is generate by your people while they are breeding and appears in form of bubbles over their abodes which you than have to collect manually. Granted, the mechanic has been vastly improved compared to 1.3.1 cos you can now click & hold the mouse button and then drag the cursor over as many bubbles as you want to collect them instead of clicking each one individually, but it still is unnecessarily complicated and makes the game feel like a mobile game. This is especially annoying - and concerning - cos pretty much every alpha and later beta player complained about this from the very beginning. People basically begged 22Cans to automate the collection of belief but they just didn't listen. Timeline, Stickers and ChestsYour civilization's progression is represented by a timeline (former scrap book) which consists of technology cards that unlock once you reached a certain number of followers, crops, ore and so on. To activate cards some of them have to be assigned a certain amount of stickers (starting at one but raising up to above 20 very soon). These stickers come in different categories like social, tools or industry and are obtained by either playing Voyages of Discovery missions (see below) or by finding them in chests which you have to dig up by sculpting land.This ""resource"" system is probably the most flawed system in Godus. First of all digging up chests to get random stickers is not fun. Secondly it hurts the sandbox element of the game cos chests (or missions), and therefore stickers, are extremely limited. And finally it's just a shallow and uninspired substitute for a real resource system.SettlementsOnce you have unlocked and activated the respective cards you can place different kinds of settlements (regular, farming, mining, ...) on plots. When you do that a settlement is create that contains the plots or abodes in it's close proximity. Compared to the previous versions settlements now no longer just gather belief of all the abodes in their area of influence they now allow you to customize your civilization a little bit. The people in a settlement can have one of three jobs. Breeders create new people (as long as their are abodes for them) and belief, Buffers increase the belief generated by your Breeders and Worker do the job specific to the settlement. In a regular Settlement Workers are just common builders (your regular people), in a farming settlement your Workers are Farmers that can create Farms on free plots and harvest crops and so on. The new settlements really add to the game and most definitively are the feature I like most about 2.0. Granted, assigning people jobs is still a little bit clunky and I can't for the love of god figure out how to deal with that stupid unemployed people that just waste valuable space in my settlements, but it is still a great idea.Voyages of DiscoveryVoyages replaced the rather lackluster PvP Battles and story missions in the former versions. Voyages basically play like a light version of Lemmings, you have a small group of followers that have to reach a shrine. Your job is to make sure that there not just is a path that allows them to do so in time - there is a timer ticking down - but also that they avoid hazards that try to kill them on the way. On a successful run you get stickers, if you fail you lose all the people you send and you to use belief to get a new group. As simplistic as this might be it also is kinda fun, it's the type of mini game you might wanna play during lunch break. However, it also is incredibly annoying that you have to do all these mission to get the stickers in order to advance. If you don't grind Voyages you will run out of stickers rather soon and won't be able to play the game anymore.Follower AIOne 2.0's big features was supposed to be the follower AI. Your people would not longer hide inside their abodes and only come out if you had a job for them. Instead they would stroll around and to interesting stuff. Well, that's true and false at the same time. Your followers now actually do stuff but it's a) basically always the same (resting beneath trees, gathering around camp fires, standing next to each other and talking), b) only very few of your people actually do that stuff (maybe 10-15%?) and c) it has no affect whatsoever on the gameplay nor does it reassemble the behavior of a real civilization. The world looks more alive in 2.0 than it did before, but, at least for me, it's still not enough, not by a long shot, it's just a nice little start.Look and FeelAll in all the game still looks and feels like a mobile game, it is designed to be played on a 5"" display and not on a 24"" monitor, and that might be a K.O. criteria for many people. Godus has no tooltips at all, instead you always have to bring up an info screen that covers the whole monitor. There is no quick action bar to select god powers, you can't use the mouse wheel to scroll threw the timeline but you have to click and drag it instead and so on. The  more time you spend playing Godus the clearer it gets that this game's main target group are mobile gamers, it being on PC is just an addition to that concept, not the other way around. Another aspect of the game that just screams mobile are it's timers, it takes ages to get anything done. It starts of okay but once you reached the second age building simple abodes take more than 20 minutes and rebuilding a new shrine requires several hours. That's okay if you just want to play the game for 5 minutes and then leave it till these things are done (currently you have to keep the game running cos there is no server yet) but if you are the kind of gamer that likes to play a game for at least an hour straight you will run out of things to do and spend most of your time waiting.Jup, still bad.

								Want to feel like a god? Look elsewhere. This game is about digging up cards in the dirt.The bulk of this game has you flattening land for your followers so that they can, in turn, build structures to live and prosper in. The world is made up of layers, like a cake, and you peel those layers to shape the land. In order to unlock spells (that are completely worthless) and expand your influence, you need to collect trading cards in buried chests scattered across the land. To dig up chests and flatten land you need a currency called 'belief' and to get this you need to collect bubbles of 'belief' on top of your peasants' houses. The generation of this belief is on a timer and you'll find yourself waiting hours to do anything substantial. Basically it's a facebook game.Did I mention there is a cash shop where you can buy power and progress (Thus skipping the otherwise forced wait)? Oh yeah, there's that too. I was hoping this game would be the ""re-genesis of the god genre"" but it wasn't really. I don't know how I might have thought that-- oh wait, the developer said it, silly me. Multiplayer might be cool in the future-- that is if it actually becomes... ya know... MULTIplayer. Right now it's just an AI skirmish mode where you play against a bot. When you go to the multiplayer lobby you are inundated by a flood of fake IMs from a 13 year old girl or something. It's weird and a bit creepy. Somebody wrote her dialogue, winky faces and kitty faces included. By the third match and subsequent IM deluge, I started to hope that the writer of this was on a pedophile watchlist.However, this game is not currently finished. It is a steam early access title and I will update my review as it becomes appropriate.			",238,59,1,38,31,2,55

								When I first got this game I was hooked. I would have recommended it in a heartbeat to anyone who showed an interest in it. I even bought a copy for a good friend of mine so he could play it too. We even had PvP matches in the now removed multiplayer side of the game.The game is not what I paid for anymore. I did not pay for a mobile touch screen game. The fact that 22cans have gone this route with Godus has made me play it less. I used to spend hours on end playing until it was changed to this mobile style.Just take a look at this old screenshot which shows a few features I miss from the game:

Features like flags on buildings to show when they are full that wave in the direction of the wind!And a follower who is named after a friend who I beat in multiplayer PvP match.Not to mention the better looking buildings with more variety.The side bar of skills was easier to use than the current system.How about the other races, like the ginger hair race or the mountain men. Now we are just us and the Astari :/And have a look at this old screenshot too, the larger towns created using a statue with actual roads:

Just these 2 screenshots alone show how far backwards the mobile style game took. So much variety removed to make it 'more suitable' for the mobile devices.Again, I did not pay for a mobile game. I feel like I was cheated out of my money, led to believe I was getting a cool game that I actually enjoyed playing only to have it taken away from me and replaced with an inferior substistute, not worth even half what I paid for, that mobile users can play for free!I get the feeling that this is what 22cans intended from the start, get our money and use it to launch themselves into the mobile gaming market.For this I can not recommend Godus anymore. It's a sad case as I loved how it was going before they took the mobile route :(			",177,36,3,15,33,1,21

								I really want to like, nay, to love this game. I really want to enjoy it and spend hours on end sculpting worlds, making everything better for my little worshippers and punishing those that dare oppose me or my little minions. I just can't.I supported the game in the Kickstarter campaign and I was thrilled to see Peter Molyneux reinvent the Populous game. This was awesome and I wanted in. Following the team develop the game gave me hopes and concerns, unfortunately most of the latter. I saw some appalling design descions and hoped they would change it or that I just would be proven wrong. Gaining access to beta in 2013 (two years ago) told me first hand, that that was not the case. At the time, they told us it was at most 40% complete.I played it an entire evening and afterwards I felt I had been waiting for the fun to happen the whole time. It was like, I just have to play a little more, and then the real fun begins. It had potential but it's a slow, grinding, waiting and ultimately boring game. Disappointed I left it there and haven't touched it until yesterday.Two years have gone. There's a counter ingame that says it's 53% complete. Almost nothing happened to that progress bar in two years!Truth to be told a lot of features have been added but the core game is still slow, grinding, waiting for the fun to begin and ultimately it's still a boring game. There are so many design decisions that seems to be in place to slow the game down, make the player do senseless tasks and grind to oblivion and back.Realising that the game has actually been redesigned to a mobile game with in-app purchases to speed up gameplay makes all of the above make sense. This is however not the game I bought. Peter Molyneux revealed himself a fraud unfortunately.I want to love this game but I just can't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Peter M who is the owner of this studio has basically did a switch and bait tactic to get funding to produce this game, but instead used those funds to make a mobile version and just basically dumped the PC version to the wolves. If you purchase this based on the store page you are being decieved and will regret buying it because the features promised are missing or incomplete. There are 2 programmers left working on this since Jan 2015 so dont expect any large updates/patches any time soon.I usually do not do reviews as they are a personal opinion and one persons opinion may/maynot agree with anothers opinion.

								THE MOST EPIC example of how a potentially wonderful game can fail.It really breaks my heart to say that somehow they almost developed the game I always wanted, but then gave up, little by little, of the whole thing.PLEASE DEVS, if not because of the people who bought it, at least for yourselves ... just finish this project! I mean ... man, you have done the hardest part (the concept of a highly optimizable ground for AI, the beautiful design, the water simulation...) so just use what you already have, put some sense and an end to it!PEOPLE, for now, untill something changes, you should not buy it.

Early Access Review
								Here is how much 22Cans cares about this game. You cannot close this game unless you use the task manager. The quit and close buttons in this game either do not work or freeze the windows. There has been no hotfix and its been like this since whenever they last updated - a few months ago?This is a mobile game being funded on Steam. This is an updated review for Godus 2.0.2.0 hours: Around ~10hrs+Once again, I suggest waiting before purchasing - after all, there is supposedly a mobile version coming out that will be FREE.First, I just want to say: Voyages are very annoying. I can't stand it and I would have to say it is the only reason I am not advancing through the game as I want to - because it takes so much effort for me to even attempt a voyage. Some of the voyages don't even give you enough time, even WHEN the AI chooses the correct pathing. If you're going to time it, at least give extra time if a follower enters the goal so the OTHER followers who are RIGHT behind the first follower has time to enter. It's just so stupid when you lose a follower when he's ABOUT TO ENTER THE DOOR. By Godus he can even SEE the house! HERE is where I  would want the pointer we had in the previous version, where a light appeared from the sky and the followers see it and set a path towards the light. Seriously, are we as the Watchers of our people just going to let them wander around and get LOST? We should be guiding them, not with just shaping the world around the people but also have a guiding light. It is not a good thing when you have a god game and you feel HELPLESS as your followers go full noob on foreign ground. If the developers want voyages to be like a sort of mini-game with a challenge. Dont't make it a challenge for the players to hope the followers choose the right AI and go in the correct direction.Let us point towards the direction we want our followers to go and instead of making the followers act like they're blind, give us some randomly generated challenges. Give us the ability to put our God powers in action. In one of the earlier challenges, there is a Giant who I am pretty sure was dangerous for our followers. Thankfully there was a second path you could force ur followers to take if you block the path towards the giant quick enough. But say you couldn't find another path and must face the giant. Can I not just say....squish it with the finger of god? We can easily incoporate ways to use beautify to stop swamps that are slowing the people down, or activate a speed totem to bring my followers faster to their destination. Instead all my followers are using a broken compass.   There should be no reason to have chests laying around with resources that don't come back. Is the world which was created lack actual resources? The followers should be using material around them. If that is too hard to do for this game, I feel the chests should replenish like the trees and rocks in the game. Maybe not to the amount the latter comes in, but at least every 6 hours or a day if you want, there would be some random chests in the world. This way you can make the voyage system look attractive but not required - people can WAIT to earn resources for their game, or play voyages to get them faster. After all, we have to wait for belief, it wouldn't change the fact that coming back to check for chests would be a reason for the God of the world to visit the homeland. The interface is a little better than the book in my opinion, as its cleaner and a lot faster than the previous one where I had to scroll through all the resources if I wanted something or just simply never looked at it. I think the previous interface for the god powers and totems should have stayed however, opening so many screens does the art of the Godus world no justice if you cover it up. There were a few interface suggestions within the forums I hope don't go unnoticed. One of the biggest highlights in this game has to be the way the world looks. It is very simple yet is what makes the game beautiful and makes me want to stare at the screen endlessly. I was especially happy with the addition follower interaction. Seeing a follower sit by the river to bathe made it look like the people had things they did outside of their homes - they had minds, they communicated. But it is purely just asthetics and have no influence over the world itself. Other than improvements to the art part of this game, there doesn't seem to be much improvement from the previous version in terms of mechanics.			",27,7,0,10,8,0,1

								You are not allowed to post to this forum: you have been banned from all Godus discussions. There it is, my badge of courage! They can stop me from saying my piece there, but they can't stop me here. The game is utter trash, no play mechanics, no updates, not written for PC, etc. etc. etc. The game has no basis to exist. On the forums, when players say what needs fixed, or added to the game, the devs. ignore them. Instead they start asking what should be done w/ the trees. Oh yeah, rotten game but I really want to see changes made to the trees. In development, but you would never know that, since there have been no updates for over 5 months. That's not all you won't see, expect no information from the devs about what is being done w/ the game, the devs. have little/no contact w/ the player base which shrinks daily. The only people still having anything to do w/ this game are the people who have recently wasted whatever amount of money they just spent on this garbage. Steam should have removed this game from their catalog about 6 weeks from the day it was first offered for sale, if that long. This game is Early Access & that is a bad thing, because this game has turned the public away from this mode of development in droves. Developers who were considering this type of format, should be seeking out Mr. Molyneux & lynching him for killing the concept. The game also went through Kickstarter & gave that format a bad name too. The reason it is being sold on Steam is to grab more cash to develop the mobile game. When did Steam start selling mobile phone games? Peter Molyneux (the person in charge, or the one ignoring this mess, take your pick) was hailed as the creator of the god game with the release of Populous. Many games followed, but if you want them named I'm not going that route here, that's what a search engine is for. A few games on his list after Populous had some interesting play mechanics, but Peter has a mouth that offers what his a$$ cannot produce, but that's where most of his recent work has spewed from. THE MAN FLAT OUT LIES!  Don't believe anything he says, if he states it will be in the game, it won't. If he says it won't, you are guaranteed that it will.Godus is not a PC game, don't think that for a minute, it's a cow clicker phone/tablet game that needs no actual thought to play. It's click, click, click, until you go into a fog & come out the other side wondering what did you just do with the time you wasted on this? Nothing, you just passed time that's all.I've already turned this review into a TL:DR post which is sad. I could go on for paragraph after paragraph. Let me end w/ just one more thought, if I stop just one person from spending any money on this loser, that alone will make my time writing this worth it. I hope it is you dear reader. Thank you for your time, please don't waste your money on this tripe. My rating is -10 out of 10.Edit 8/13/2014The knuckleheads who continue to leave comments about how long I played this crap need to realize that there are multiple timers. Some of them running for periods of up to 4 days... yes you read that right, it's not a typo. I left it running more in the background than I did in actual game play. As far as Early Access, periodic checks I have made in the forums still indicate that the game is in just as bad shape as it was in the time frame in which this review was posted. In fact, the devs are still engaged in working on the mobile apps, & forsee no major changes being made to the PC version until ""sometime in the fall"". Since they make more false statements than anything else, that equates to maybe never to me.Check out the Ipod store. This ""game"" is up there, & the devs have stated that they are engaged in working on the android version. So if that is where their current thrust is, just how much work is going toward the PC?  This ""game"" has sat at the 50% completion level for a year and a half now. Say whatever you like about my review, come back here after you wasted your money on it & let me know just how much you like it. This crap was put on Steam merely to generate more cash so that work on the phone apps work could continue, nothing more. Go play it on your phone, it's free but the timers can only be over ridden by the purchase of gems costing real cash. Waste your money there, you'll probably spend less on that than you would buying this tripe here. My review stands...			",699,125,35,107,93,6,162

								In it's current state, Godus does more to perptuate the empty addiciting feeling you get with other social games then add any real depth. Once again Mr. Molyneux has talked the expectations from his creation far higher than he would ever hope to reach. Once you've clicked for the ten thousdandth time (trust me it will come much sooner than you think), you'll be so fet up that you'll probably never touch this one again.

								This is a Kickstart project I regret backing. Since it's first iteration, it clearly showed it was a mobile game transplanted onto a PC. Regardless, I loved the art style and I played it for many many hours. Then 22Cans went silent for months and I lost interest and abandoned it. Recently they picked up and I've spent a few hours playing the latest build.And it's ♥♥♥♥ing dreadful.The mobile game transplated onto a PC has fully metamorphosed into a pay to win mobile title. As an example, take farming. As soon as you discover farming, you can no longer build. Anything. Unless you have wheat. Each farm produces wheat - in 90 minutes of real time. REAL TIME? WHAT IN THE ♥♥♥♥? So every one and a half hours, I can build a couple of houses. (And the ♥♥♥♥ing retard farmers can't harvest the wheat, oh no, you have to do it yourself).Of course, you can always buy wheat using gems. 22Cans love gems. They go out of their way to constantly point this out. They have built a game around the microtransactions of gems. Because PC users have already paid for the game (their words), PC users don't have to buy gems. Instead, we can sacrifice our followers in a pit to get a gem. Of course, that makes your followers hate you, also triggers another real time timer to respawn that follower - in 30 minutes or so. Whilst the new faction (which I have to admit, is funny) steal your followers.The last update also added voyages, frustrating mini games where you try to get your little dudes to a temple for rewards. Of course, if you screw up then you can either way HOURS of real time for reinforcements to arrive to try again or... you got it, pay gems.This game has so much promise. I really like the art style, the humour, and the ideas of the game. But the implementation is ♥♥♥♥ing attrocious. I have never sworn so much in a review... I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with the direction of this game and it shows.I shall go back to playing Banished. Hopefully 22Cans realize what sort of a ♥♥♥♥ed up abortion they are creating with these delays and reduce them to miniscule levels or I can't see this working. Maybe mobile users have a different mindset to traditional PC / console gamers as I don't understand how on earth they think putting realtime blocks in place makes a game fun./endrant.

								I want to like this game. I have played over 30 hours and have tried to feel out and understand this concept of using REAL time as the main form of currency in this rather UNgodly city builder. This attempt by 22cans to carry over Gems from the mobile version (gems being the currency that users pay real money for in the iOS version) and trying to squeeze them into the PC version is absolutely a bummer. For a few days I started to think that it might work alright, but in the end its just an empty currency middle man that really doesn't feel like it belongs in a game I have already purchased for a premium price. All the gems in the world are currently not helping me reduce the absurd wait times for generating specialized followers (farmers, miners) one of my wait times is currently 21 hours (REAL HOURS) for 1 new farmer to be produced. That 1 new farmer allows me to increase my total farms by 1 and makes me shudder at the future cards that have yet to be unlocked that require... 70 farms... or worse... 50 Mines. That is literally weeks of forced waiting just to unlock in game functions that are less than enticing. And like everything else in the game, the price and wait times increase with every added specialized follower or item placed. At this rate, I would assume the last farmer of my settlement will take around 2 days to be produced. 22cans wants you to believe that these ""valuable gems"" are their gift to us gamers who want to ""play at our own pace"" when really its just a misplaced ported currency that might make sense in a freemium mobile game model where you want your casual pocket gamers to be dropping $5-50 a pop for small offerings of gems that are really only used to bypass timers. How fun? These gems in their current form do not belong in a paid PC title.Not that you're reading any of these complaints, Peter Molyneux, but I was a big fan back in the days of Populous and up to Black and White, but you have proven time and time again since then that you are completely out of touch with what your fans (and now your duped financial backers) want. 21 hours for a single farmer Peter? What PC gamer has the time to check in constantly to collect belief? How have you managed to take such a neat looking little sandbox antfarm with so much potential and turn it into a game about waiting and the tedious collection of such ridiculously related resources? You sold your backers on the idea that you were going into this without a publisher, telling us that this would lead to completely unhindered creativity and maximize community influence on the product. How did you think we would feel when you revealed that you are building this game around a freemium mobile business model (because you DID end up partnering with a publisher after all) and that we the PC users and financial backers would now be stuck with shabby ""pay to play"" mechanics? Waiting so long for relatively unexciting things to happen completely disrespects the time of the gamers who want to sit down and actually play a game for more than the snippets of time between the various and superfluos wait timers. Im lucky to get a half hour before I literally run out of things I can possibly do.You've lost it Molyneux, or you've just gradually become more and more of a con man over the years. This kickstarter is almost theft, as you used our money (when you have millions) to fund a game that you are hoping will saturate app markets and shine just enough when compared to the morass of bad free to play games so that you can... what... sell gems for a living and retire this profession you obviously stopped caring about? Next time, do it with your own money, chap.			",26,23,0,12,20,0,7

								This is a tough game to review. I usually find myself enjoying the mechanics and art style of the game, but the development for the game has been pretty bad.There used to be multiplayer, there isn't, anymore. This is just one of many things that were supposed to be in the game, and now will apparently never be included.The reason for that? It's pretty much ""done"" in the eyes of the company making the game, aside from some finishing up. Communication has been quite bad from 22cans, with nothing answered clearly enough to indicate that they're not abandoning the game.Frankly, the game is pretty fun to play, if you're into the whole sim-people sort of genre, but it lacks focus, development, and a future.With those faults, I wouldn't recommend it at this price, as in retrospect, the idea of what it would become was probably what motivated me.Knowing the game will never become much more than it is now... that kinda kills all passion to play.

								This game is broken, unfinished and not worthy of your money. Don't bother!If you're looking for a god game, this is not it! It's a silly attempt at what would have been a cow-clicker grade microtransaction-filled mobile game if it weren't for the initial criticism that prevented that from really coming into existence as far as the PC/Mac release goes.I don't think the developer even knows where to take this game from here, let alone the fact that the sculpting system is part of the game's biggest design flaw. They have also stopped communicating leaving anyone who bought the game in the dark, with no chance for a refund.I can't possibly recommend this. Not even for free. And it being still in early access is not really a valid excuse for anything. I was hoping for a revival of a game in vain of Populous or Black & White, but this abomination is nothing of the sorts and never will be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ufortunately this game is dead.Peter molineux once again lied until the sky fell down and wasted the crowdfund.The result is a game that would've been great idea and it started also good but has now been abandonet.Sometimes they claim to be doing something, but it is obviously not progressing at allAs a early acess buyer and supporter I'm very sad that they betrayed the players and people who tried to make this work.The most important lesson is that if Molineux ever tries to make a game we should simply boycott him and his lies.

								GODUS Beta 2.1 Review Update August 2014 8 months after my first Review of this game, I have given Godus another 20 hours of game play in the latest 2.1 Patch.The worst parts of the old Godus Alpha have been fully realised, Godus 2.1 is now an iOS game and the freemium model mechanics are fully in place.After 20 hours in the 2.1 build I can say that there is no game here, just a count down mechanic, followed by a countdown mechanic, everything else you do in Godus leads you to a bigger countdown.The largest I have found is 3 days (72 Hours) to unlock the next expansion so that my colony can grow to undoubtedly find another unlock beacon set at an even greater threshold, the point of which is completely lost on me.It seams the 2.1 version of Godus was created to it's sned entire community to sleep, that way we don't notice the complete lack of an actual game.There is nothing to do in Godus other than wait, it really is the core mechanic, wait then wait some more.Small village becomes larger village, check back every hour to collect minor resourses (belief), village grows at a rate so slow that you can feel yourself aging as time passes in game.Voyage mini game - created to help pass the time I'm sure, unfortunatly the core rubber banding sculpting mechanic is still a waste of space so failure is a regular feature of the mini game due to the game not actually doing what you have asked it to do, you only get a couple of go's at a mission before you run out of villagers, then the inevitable countdown clock starts on the mini game as well.Back to the main game......... nothing has happened, close game and open some time later.Open game....whilst I was away some other AI village has stollen a good chunk of my villagers due to a happiness mechanic that I can't possibly have the resourses to alter.I can only assume that the Game Devs have in fact never played 2.1 from the start without any Dev buffs enabled.To that end I broke out the hex editor so that I could experiance the game without the artifical timers, I had played for around two days at this point and wanted to see what excitment would be in store for me if I'd had the patience to continue playing at this speed for the next three months.At this time I had around 38 Gems I believe which is enough to do completely nothing, hex editor to the rescue and somewhere like 5000 gems later and I'm on the move, sculpt this, unlock that, rush XX build etc, after a few hours of this which would have litterly been months of wait timers I had a pretty impressive land, with miners, farmers & worshipers filling my reserves at a decent rate.I'd unlocked so much land that I was building right next to the AI (AscarI) home base and the realisation struck me, there is no game, it really is just countdown timers, just like a facebook game.There is no enjoyment, there is no depth, just forced mechanics to slow you down and an interface that changes the rules it plays by depending on which section of the game you are in.Powers that are unlocked in the main game arent functional in the minigame, minigames are designed to make you fail so that you have to continue waiting.Skill has nothing to do with finishing the minigame, repetition is the only thing you need so that the artificial fail points can be overcome, there is no way of skilfully navigating some of these levels withour repetition.1 - It's officially a iOS app now and all the monetisation mechanics are there, we just don’t have to pay for them as PC users - it's still a rubbish mechanic regardless of the fact we don’t have to pay for it.2 - The early game is so so so slow, I fell asleep at my keyboard on my first brand new play though with the 2.1 patch waiting for builders to build simple grass huts with a 18 minute timer on them.3- Cards - still a rubbish and juvenile attempt at something cute?? doesn’t add anything to the game.The are alos in short supply and you need bags of them to unlock anything even slighly usefull.4 - new leashing mechanic to replace totem powers - well that is a win, it works well and is far more intuitive +1 for that.5 - The game is slow, Ice age slow, mountains in real life form faster than this game.6 - apparently sculpting is less of a thing now as villagers will be able to populate hill better in the later game and thus requiring less sprawling flat areas - I havent found this to be any different than the old builds, large flat areas are still required for density reasons.7 - Camera rotation is back in - Wahooo +10 big win. Guess what Peter M - I don't get lost in my land when I rotate my camera, just like I dont get lost when I walk in more than one direction in real life.9 - It's moved from Alpha to Beta 2.1 - but there seems to be a game missing??I still would not recommend this game to anybody that I wanted to remain friends with.I'll check in next year and see how we go.Kickstarter estimated release date September 2013..... yeah right.-------------------------------------------------------------Review - December 2013Firstly I'm a massive fan of Peter Molyneux past games, Dungeon Keeper being one of my all time favs.With that said, I gave this game 100+ plus hours of gameplay, restarted several times to give the game the best possible chance to grow on me.The game concept has a lot of potential but is hamstrung by several of the core mechanics.1 - it plays like a facebook game2 - click everything, click faster, click now, you will end up with a wrist injury in this game...click, click, click, click you get the idea.3 - it feels like it was designed for the mobile platform, but the devs says it isn’t.4 - it feels like it was designed to be monetised on the mobile platform, but the devs say it isn’t.5 - Tiering up is actually less efficient than keeping your entire population stuck in the stone age6 - sculpting land is one of the most painful experiences I've had in a game, not that sculpting any given area is hard, its just that you need to do so much of it.The initial fun of doing a little bit of sculpting (an hour or so) is killed by the knowledge that you will need to do another hundred hours of slow slow slow mind numbing, frustrating, rubber band breaking boredom and pain. 7 - the devs don’t communicate, the official forums are nearly dead, and even the mods on the forums seem to have given up.8 - game updates, well we had one two months ago.........9 - complete feature sets are missing, but that’s OK its an Alpha, but with the speed of updates it might always be an alpha.So, after all of that, I still enjoyed parts of my time in the Godus world, I still think it has potential if some of these core mechanics get redesigned.Can I recommend it to anybody I want to remain friends with, Sorry but NO.

Early Access Review
								This game is terrible. In the majority of early access games, i can say that, but only if i then say ""But it might get better"". With Godus, this is not the case. The game is terrible, and it isnt going to get better. Let me say a few things, before i get to the review, in fear of losing some people to boredom.If you want Black and White 3: Do  NOT  buy this game. If you want a city builder: Do  NOT  buy this game.If you want a town simulator: Do  NOT  buy this game.If you enjoyed farmville or other such games: You MIGHT enjoy this game.This games very core concept is simple, really: use your ""Dragging"" Power to drag the land (Think of the land as a layer-cake, with evenly-sized ""layers"" to the landscape) to make areas of flat, even land. When a large enough area of flat land is found, a house plot will be placed. By clicking on a nearby house, a person will appear to walk over and build on the new plot of land. The reason you do this is to generate a arbitrary resource, over time, called ""Belief"". With belief you can drag the land, place statues that increase the efficiency of the people and a few other, minor, things, such as directing your people in a specific direction. To gather this belief, you click on a house when a pink bubble appears over each of their individual houses.Then you drag some more land and get more houses.But that isnt all, thankfully. You can also ""Tech Up"" through several ""Epochs"" of civilization - bronze age, iron age, and so on. To do this... you find ""chests"" scattered around the world - some underground, some out of your area of influence, some found by doing arbritarty minigames that amount to doing what you were doing already. When you find enough ""chests"", you can place the ""Stickers"" you get from the chests onto ""Cards"", which unlock ""Technologies"" which results in a advancemnt of ""epoch"". The reason all of those were in quotations was due to the fact that all of the above thing; Chests, Stickers, Cards, Technologies and Epochs, are all completetly arbritary. You find a ""Furs"" sticker, and nothing happens. You get the ""Family"" card and nothing happens. You advance a epoch, and nothing happens. At best, the technology system is nothing more than a glorified banner representing how much you have played the game.There is a horrible sounddesign (Wind that gets annoying, and various ""PLING. PLONG. PLING"" noises from clicking things) The graphics design is awful, consisting of manequin people (devoid of all personality, emotion, or even looks) Houses (Which are basically brown squares that all look the same) and the landscape (Which frankly looks just weird, really.)Please. Dont buy this game. It is a waste of money. There is so little game in this game for the $20 you could spend on it. Go and buy another $20 game, or go get a book. Watch a movie. There is no reason to spend that large an ammount of money on this game.			",236,28,5,55,41,0,67

Early Access Review
								My long, horrible experience with this game:I bought this game shortly after the early access was available and I have to admit I quite liked it. There was a fair bit to do, controls seemed easy enough and it was quite fun with very little restriction in exploring the World even though. You had to ctrl+alt+del to quit the game but I expected some big bugs.Then everything went silent, for months there were no updates and no communication. Nothing was announced until the update was around the corner. A complete over-haul of the game was done which completely changed the game, some new things were added which restricted the original explore at your leisure feeling of the previous version. It also changed from feeling like a PC game to feeling more like an Android app that I'm able to play on my computer. You still had to ctrl+alt+del to exit the game which was a tad annoying.Some minor and additions changes were made. A happiness meter which was added to this re-vamp turned out to be game breakingly bugged. The ways to make them happy were expensive and very inefficient, while in the game your citizens would become depressed within seconds of anything happening. A warring faction that was introduced would just wreck your village with you being pretty much unable to fend off as it happens pretty early on and frequently. You still had to ctrl+alt+del to quit the game which was getting tedious.Needless to say a patch was quickly developed and removed some of the key features. Nothing was really added to the game until the next major update, some tweaks and changes here and there. None of these updates kept you from still having to ctrl+alt+del to exit the game though.Then the big downfall happened with the next major update. Had they spent all these months adding lots of new content to the game and fixing bugs? No! Well, technically no. The time spent in those months was in bringing the unfished, buggy pile of crap into the mobile phone market. It's free, but leans heavily on the pay to win aspect. What had they done to the PC version? They turned it into the style of the mobile app and kept the pay to win aspects with it, instead of paying money for these aspects you had to pay with resources and such. You still had to fecking ctrl+alt+del to quit the game.I had hope for many months, after 18-24 months I was still clinging on to some sense of hope that something would emerge positively from all this waiting. All that's happened in two years is a revamp with no real game progress, the game developed and re-coded into a mobile phone version, then the game seemingly being ported from the mobile app with a few tweaks. I quit the game for a long time until about a month ago. I thought I'd see what's new and what's been added since I spent a few months away. Well turns out nothing was really new, the progress I made was less than when I played the 1.0.3 version. After a few days of getting to a point where progress was just halted, I was getting a handful of stickers a day and it turned out I could use the ""pay to win"" aspect to get more I just uninstalled the game and vowed never to return. Oh yes, I had to ctrl+alt+delete to quit the game before uninstalling it.			",362,202,2,92,77,7,89

								*Preface: when looking to buy this game, read the forums. Not just the genreal discussions, but the subforums. I explain why later*One of the only games of over 100 that I've uninstalled from my library with no intention of reinstalling.Riddled with bugs from day one that are still not fixed, a resource system despised by the community that they refuse to alter, and boring repetitive gameplay that is very unlikely to change, These things have been discussed in mulitple other reviews,  but 22cans now has another nail in their coffin:Any negative posts about the game or company, as well as discussions about refunds or legal action are either outright deleted or hidden in a subforum no one will visit. The moderators of the forum have, two days ago, created two subforums where they have placed all negativity to give the illusion to newcomers that everyone is happy happy happy. The disturbing thing is, as recent and deplorable as that is, it is only a contender for the worst thing the PR team does. Banning anyone who speaks out while obvious trolls who say they like the game but are only there to stir up anger are allowed to roam free*. You will see people clearly just there to make people angry, but because they're saying positive things they are exempt from punishment. Anyone calling out these obvious trouble makers is branded as ""hostile"" and threatened with banishment from the forums. Anyone posts a relevant quote in two or more threads it is considered spamming and they are threatened with banishment. I'm amazed this game is still allowed on steam, early access or not. I believe that one day Valve will be bitten from its association with this game My adivce: STAY AWAY FROM 22CANS AND ANY RECENT PETER MOLYNEAUX GAME*There are the occasional people who genuinely like the game, nothing against them. There are even more who claim to like it just to create arguments with those that see all the problems, however.			",66,15,0,24,18,1,3

								I really cant express in words how disappointed I am with this game. I remember long nights playing Populous: The Beginning when I was younger - even the little phrases of the braves, ""waybo? Gid'aye"" after all these years are still etched in my memory. I still from time to time come back to this game as a timeless masterpiece of the God Sim from the original God Sim master himself, Peter Molyneaux.How the mighty have fallen. Godus sounds good on paper. It sounds like a spiritual successor to Populous, and I was an early supporter. I forgave the game it's early flaws;  a complex, confusing morass of ""stickers"" and ""cards"" for gameplay progression, a repetitive AI and gameplay, a directionless, non-existent story. Such was my reverence for Populous I was convinced that ""it'll get better with the next update."" I couldn't be more wrong. After some time now, various updates and promises to a loyal fanbase that this game will get better I am now finally giving up. Godus is a frustrating and unrewarding experience. I have played since the first version and through all the updates and I still have no idea what is going on, how to progress or improve my villages and can make no sense whatsoever of the sticker system. I have found myself doing exactly the same thing since the start - continually clicking stupid little purple bubbles just to get enough ""belief points"" to move the slightest bit of land.. continually coming up against ""you do not have this power"" message, with no clear path towards gaining said upgrade or ability except another 60 hours of repetitive clicking. This game is an insult to the legacy of Populous and the God SIm genre. It's almost an embarassment to admit that I have purchased it and I have finally had enough of wasting any more time with it.For those who have played Populous: The Beginning and hope for some kind of spiritual successor I strongly advise to look elsewhere. This game is so awful and tedious I wouldn't even download it if it were free. I so wished it would be different and for months now I have given it chance after chance, without any improvement. It pains me to say it, but I see no hope of redemption, since it's actually gotten worse as time goes on.Avoid - and if you are unfortunate enough to buy this game, the next time you load Populous you might notice the braves all speaking English - ""told you so!""

								At the time of this review, Godus is basically just a freemium mobile game that has had the pay aspects very sloppily pulled out.  Nearly everything is timer based, which is aggravating to say the least.  Sculpting burns through your ""belief"" resource like crazy bananas, so you get to spend a lot of time not playing the game while waiting for more belief to spawn.  Of course you can spend gems on belief and other resources, but to do that you have to sacrifice your people to the pit of doom, and wait about an hour or so for them to respawn.  Oh, and forget about dragging your followers from the far reaches of your civilization into the one and only pit of doom- IF the buggy controls dont end up guiding all your little people to some random spot on the map you didn't intend, they'll have routing issues and just get stuck until you kill them.Having to wait an entire day for a farming colony to spawn a farmer is just frustrating as all get out.  One would think with all the 'pay x gems now to do y' they would have included an option to fill a settlement with workers in exchange for gems but nope.  You get to wait.Voyages are frustrating annoying mini-games, which I honestly can't tell if they're broken or not for me as I completed one and then could no longer access the menu to it.There is no easy in game option to restart the game fresh, you have to manually locate the save.  A minor nuisance, but still.The graphics could be better- I prefer to play most god-like games zoomed out for a better overview but it doesn't like to render that far out.The unlock cards though gameplay mechanic seems straightforward but NOPE.  You don't actually unlock the feature on the card until you put enough matching stickers on it- oh and you can use gems to buy more stickers.I actually do enjoy the sculpting aspect, despite it's quite buggy nature.  However having to wait for hours for enough belief to actually do it is annoying.It's only playable if you only spend 15-20 minutes on it here and there, since the timers elapse in real time.  That said, I'm glad I got it on sale for really cheap because it is NOT worth the 20+ dollars they're asking.  It's still considered ""early access"" and it says only 52% complete so... here's hoping they fix it so it's more of a real game and not just a gutless imitation of a pay model.  Until then, it's not worth more than 5 bucks.			",52,23,1,17,13,0,9

								If you are mentally handicapped person, who is fond of facebook games, you'll definitely love Godus! Don't trust Godus' description on Steam Store; this game is not about being a god, about gathering followers and spreading your love across the land. No, this is something much better! Godus is about clicking: clicking faster, clicking better, clicking stronger. Oh, and about cards. Hidden in chests. Deep beneath the ground. And guess what, you need to CLICK on the ground to get to them. How wonderful! And so your quest on clicking throughout entire gameplay and gathering pointless pack of stupid cards continues. Alone. Because entire world is empty, just like the game itself.Sounds fun like hell, doesn't it!? Indeed, because this game is hell for everyone looking for something ambitious and entertaining. Don't waste your time! Take out money from your wallet and buy this unfinished, unpolished, underdeveloped game which lacks everything for only NINTEEN DAMN EUROS! The. Best. Deal. Ever.

								They are NOT focusing on developing this for the PC. This is a simple, badly ported Mobile game, that was touted as being made FOR PC both here on EA AND on Kickstarter, but has been revealed to actually be designed primarily for Mobile platforms. Heck, the Mobile focus is quite blatently obvious, with the farmville-esque timers for nearly everything.Simply put, this feels like 22Cans has outright deceived their Kickstarted backers, and the people who bought it via Early Access,  into giving them the funding to make a Mobile game, rather than the PC game we were promised.Do NOT buy this game, furthermore, I STRONGLY advise you to NEVER buy any game developed by 22Cans, or Peter M.We, as gamers, need to send a message that we will NOT stand for this kind of bait-and-switch buisness practice.

								The game itself is fun (at a push), but it plays like a mobile/facebook game - i.e. it expects you to GO AWAY and come back later!!!I knew before I bought it had timers, but I thought it would be in-game time (and the way the devs talk, you expect it to be so). Nope, time passes real-time, and makes no difference if you don't actually run the game. Which is annoying when you have something that you can only access over the next 72 hours, but you're away visiting family/friends/SO.I hate this game for expecting to keep me on a leesh, like it's a pet that needs letting out. I've played 4 hours... the first 3 were fun, the final hour was after a days break... I ran out of stuff to do in that 1 hour, and the game made clear that I should come back the next day. As other reviewers have written, this is a mobile game that the devs have purposely sold as a computer experience to raise funds to make a game they can monetize in micro-transactions. It shows, the game is not playable solely from a fixed location - you need to be able to access casually throughout the day. Waste of money.			",27,8,1,5,16,0,9

Early Access Review
								I pledged on this game in december 2012. I had big hopes and I really fell in love with the idea of the game and it's mechanics. Now, three years later my patience have run out. In the beginning when I got to play alpha (beta?, don't remember anymore) I got really excited. Some stuff was really cool and some mechanics needed to be changed, which I think is normal for a game in alpha (or beta..). 22Cans send out an survay and asked people what they thought about the game, and I felt like they really did listen to us. Many of the things I (and many others) thought needed a change, they actually changed - after this everything fell apart. They suddenly decided to focus on the mobileversion of the game, and almost left the PC-version to it self. There have been so many updates, and so many ""new"" beginings - and the worst part is that the game actually gets worse and worse in some aspects. It feels pretty bad that after spendig money on kickstarter for a PC game, that the developers changed their focus over to the mobilversion.I really, REALLY, advice you to stay away from this game - at least until it's 100% finished (which I think it never will be), since the game is 2 years late already. Keep your money and spend it on something else. I can still spend 5-10 hours on it sometimes, but it's just not finished and it dosen't work as inteded. But taky my advice, and with over 100 hours with the game, don't fall for it and buy it.			",116,31,2,35,27,3,29

								I am so frustrated and disappointed with this game and Peter M. As a long-time fan of Populous and some other of Peter M. games, I was really excited to see Godus appear. I even bought a copy for my son as I expected he would get the enjoyment I did out of Populous.I played the early betas for hours and enjoyed up to a point. I always accepted these were betas and fed back to 22Cans when I encountered issues. They were prompt in replying and fixing these issues. I was impressed and felt positive about the future of Godus.As time has progressed, the game has not progressed well imo. It has become very frustrating and certainly doesn't come close to any Zen like experience. In fact quite the opposite!I just played the latest version, 2.4 or something. The first thing I encountered was a stuck title screen. After bashing my keyboard a few times expecting it to move on, I went to desktop and found, by accident, a popup telling me it found to saves and asking which one I wanted to use. Good grief what a school boy error it is for this to appear in the background!Eventually, I got into the game. Whoopdidoo, the tutorial - AGIAN!! And yes, 22Cans, your voices ARE aggravating. Why can’t I press the space bar to zip past the tutorial? Why do I have to go the options menu to skip tutorials? And why oh WHY! Am I presented with yet another stealth popup in the background asking if I actually want to skip tutorials??!!  I only found this when I did ctrl+alt+delete to bring up task manager to kill the game. I was tense and shouting at this game by now and I am a patient person – honest!I still hope they get this game something close to what was envisioned by Peter M. but I admit that I am losing faith by now. Fingers crossed it gets better. If you are considering buying this game, I would seriously wait until it is complete and then read some reviews of the finished article. At this stage, I don’t believe 22Cans deserves our faith or money in their ability to deliver something great! ",22,7,0,4,8,0,14

								NOTE: Have in mind that even though Steam says I played 300+ hours, I played about 30 hours worth of what a normal human being would call ""actual playtime"". Why? please read.As far as the Early Access goes, this is a game that should be in Mobile Devices and worth as much as, incredible amounts of grinding and the best game to compare it with, is FarmVille, but without the microtransactions... at the moment?At the moment, It is a landscape editor with funny little animations of Slender Man-like people building villages...your work? other than edit the land to make some space for your little guys to do all the work, you'll have to dig holes to look for resources like wood, no... no chopping down trees or telling your guys to do it for you, the wood, fire, pelts and more cards (yes, cards) are only found in chests hidden underground (it would do way better with resource gathering, like Age of Empires) these are used as requirements for upgrades, usually new buildings... and you need to click over every single house to collect their ""Belief"", yes, one by one, every 5 or so minutes (I've had to click over more than 50 buildings), yes there are ways to make it easier, but they increase in cost the more you build, which increases the grinding, but at least it would be harder to develop carpal tunnel, anyway the Belief is the resource used to build statues, use powers and more.I don't really want to get into deeper detail since it is in Early Access and a lot of this stuff could be no more than place holders for better stuff that is in its way... at least I hope so, because this is no fun like this and absolutely not worth those $20. So better give it some time, unless completely sure about buying it.For more information you can check TotalBiscuit's Alpha Strike:

								Hi there,so another major update. Still nothing improved much, sadly. I had big hopes when I bought this games. This is not really a god game compared to Populus or Black and White etc...Its more a very primitve kind of sim city or civilization...Let me share some thoughts:The people in the game are doing nothing on there own. Despite of wandering around and get lost or homeless. Why are there always these a annoying hints that follows got lost? What should I do with them?  Further more, when I unlock a new better building, people don't upgrade it on there own. I have to destroy the house with Finger of god to get it replaced.These card collecting issue didn't improved at all. It even got more boring. You have to collect a lot of cards to unlock a single feature. After severall hours of gameplay, I still couldn't unlock the improved landscaping features (I have unlocked all Shrines of Expansions).  And it gets worse when you advance in the timeline. Your people should harvest the needed materials to let you advance in technology.The technology tree fells stricktly linear. There is a choice what you will unlock first but at the current state there are not enough cards to develop what are you interested in.Settlements are confusing. The infulence range increase, but what does it do? It does not collect more believe in a greater area, nor are more houses integrated... strange...Lets talk about the GUI:It seems to be developed for a tablet. I've bought a game for a PC, so I want to take all advantages of it.  All this linear scrolling with cards and advancements are very confusing. A technology tree would be more convenient.    A small world map on the top right would be nice for fast navigating. A greater zoom range would help, too. Rotating the map is missing. It is still a lot of clicking and dragging, as I can not unlock the improved landscaping features...State of the game:Its really buggy. It crashes all the time. Noumerous contradictory statements of cards description ... It feels as if the developers where rushed to realse anything, as fast as possible - too sad.At the end some good points - I like The Discovery Journeys- The leashe feature is nice for collecting believe and sending around your peopleIn my opinion, the developers should start rebuilding the core gameplane engine to a god game and stop sticking on the ""old"" game.So far, I hope it helps.

								In November 2012, Peter Molyneux launched a lofty ambition to ""recreate the entire god game genre"" with the Godus Kickstarter. ""Godus blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White.""The game would ""take seven to nine months to complete"" and offer single player, multiplayer battles, ""a deep social and competitive feature"" and be available on Windows, Mac, Linux and mobile devices.Two years on and the game now has more in common with an over-monetised mobile game than it does a reimagination of the god game genre.  Peter Molyneux has since talked about new projects and it's rapidly looking like Godus will be abandonware.Games of this complexity will not happen overnight, but the community is tired of the lack of updates, the lack of communication, the obvious bias to mobile monetisation (at the expense of real game play) and now the cannibalisation of the Godus team so Peter can move on to his next project.  If you can get it cheap (as in $2-3) you may get 5 to 10 hours entertainment from it... but remember it was Kickstarted two years ago and has been on Steam Early Access for nearly a year, so expecting a fully fledged game at the end of it may be wishful thinking now.

								Let's get the ground work out of the way.I quite like Molyneux games.  I played the crap out of Populous and Populous II as a kid (and syndicate wars, magic carpet and pretty much every other game he had a hand in in the late 80s and early 90s).  and I loved most of them.  Not all of them, but most of them.  So I'm not of the ""It's Molyneux!  Get him!"" mindset.And I know that this game is very, very much in the early stages.  It's understood that thre's not going to be a great deal of content, and that a lot of the cool stuff they want to put in won't be there for a while.Fine.But with all that, I cannot in good conscience recommend Godus.  Not just in its current Early Access form, but at all.  Not because it's Molyneux.  Not because it's not ready.  But because I have a real problem with the design choice that clicking a few thousand times to move landscape into a more efficient configuration.  It's mind numbing.  It's repetitive.  It's physically uncomfortable after any length of time.  And that process - the slowly dragging tiny bits of land so that settlers can be coaxed into building more or bigger settlements?  That's the main mechnic of the game.I got some brief enjoyment collecting belief as fast as I could to try and play the tune the belief bubbles make before it reset, but very brief.  After about 10 minutes I realized that I was experiencing all the joy of a Skinner box.The folks at 22 cans are working to make their game more fun.  They really are.  But until such time as they remove this bizarre fixation of social-media gameplay, I can't see a single reason to recommend this.  The god game genre really does need a new contender, but unless something fundemental changes, this isn't it.  I don't feel like some powerful (or even innefective) deity sheperding (or brutalizing) my believers.  I feel like an under appreciated road worker who is tasked with levelling the land through mouseclicks alone.Maybe this game will get the changes it deserves.  Maybe something that's fun to play ratehr than just think about will come out of it.  And if it doesn't, I'll vry happily eat my words.  I'd really LIKE to eat my words. ",75,28,0,9,18,3,19

In Godus you are a god, an all powerfull being who... wait, no you're not!Honestly, this should be called: Very Weak Wizard... usYou're a God who at the beginning can do NOTHING, you learn how to change the terrain, then you do nothing again... for ages. You tell your people where to build there houses and provided you have enough space and belief, they do, then they hide in their houses (for the most part) and you never see them again. Until you ask them to build a new house. Then a while later you learn a few new powers and then you do nothing with them because theres nothing more to do! The ""enemy"" tribe is a waste of tiem and a BIG gimic and a failed attempt to keep you going back for some more.The first build I played I enjoyed, It was good but then things started to go down hill, every update either something changed drastically or nothing changed at all, like 4 new features have been added this year and thats just not good enough! Godus honestly doesn't seem to be going ANYWHERE!Its a Sim City game... and a terrible one at that.I have been a supporter of Molyneux for DECADES.I played Populous (the whole series), loved it.I played Magic Carpet, loved it.I played Fable (the whole series), Meh, its alright.I played Black and White (the whole series), loved it.I player Dungeon Keeper (the whole series), loved it.I played Curiousity, Loved it.I played this waste of time... yeah.I've heard people moan about Peter, saying hes a liar and can never delivery what he promises, and I stuck up for him, EVERY TIME, online and in real life, for literally yearsI bought this steaming pile of rubbish in early access to show my support for what I believed to be a revolutionary game, I bought a copy for my wife, and my mum (who loves the populous series) and we all sat by and watched as the development team systematically ruined this game.I just can't keep sticking up for molyneux, he stole peoples money, he promised what he cant deliver on AGAIN and I honestly think its time to retire.

								Last year i had actually written a review for this game giving it a massve thumbs up. However the direction of development now means I am doing a complete 180.Dont get this game at present. The game revolves around you playing god. A god that can sculpt the landscape, direct your people to build things, mine resources, breed, erect great temples and use your godly powers to sent great balls of fire and brimstone upon your enemies.Sounds awesome right? Well it would be if not for the fact that the base of this game now has it foundations on the Mobile phone version, so huge F2P elements.Anything you need to do requires a resource called belief, which is generated by your followers in their houses, which you have to wait for....up to 30 minutes in some cases. So build more houses, so you get more belief right?Yeah but that would require an abundence of belief in the first place, which you dont have, to speed up building you need to direct followers to the area you want to build on which, you guessed it, costs belief.Hey maybe take a ship sailing and play the mini game whilst you wat? No that requires followers in which you have to wait for.....yet more belief.To be honest the whole premise of waiting to play is beyond belief. Dont get this game. You will be sorry.I will ammend this review as they make changes....if I can ever be bothered to to boot it up again.			",87,32,1,44,39,1,41

								Update: November 23, 2016Devs releasing other games, nobody in that studio is working on this title anymore. If you like throwing away money please consider just giving it to me then ;)AVOID AT ALL COSTS ANYTHING ELSE FROM: 22cansUpdate: December 3, 2015This will be my final update as my opinion hasn't changed for this so called ""game"" as it doesn't deserve one more second of my time, It's definatelly (in my and many others eyes) a scam as 22cans moved onto other ""projects"", no news from devs, no news from steam yet still this thing remains in the store as early access funding their other projects on mobile (yes, godus mobile is of course still going strong thanks to our investment here on PC). Save your cash and avoid at all costs because you will not get a refund, the ingame timers make sure that you try to play it for longer then 2 hours as you hope that the game improves after the tutorial. I will never invest or buy anything from 22cans, Peter Molineux or members of their team ever again and I higly suggest you do the same.TL;DR: R.I.P. godNOTusUpdate: May 19, 2014Still a fraud and only getting worse, the mobile version has been released and no official word about it as they ""can't say anything"". Read the forum yourself and check out all the nice mobile screenshots. They promise a PC game but the mobile pictures prove that it's no more then a PC port.You want a mobile game to play on PC, then buy it. You want to be lied to the entire time, then buy it. You have an common sence, stay far away from this as your money is just used for the development of the Pay to Win mobile app.Original review:One word FRAUD.They promise a lot and deliver basically nothing. Latest interview states that they are focussing on the mobile market and that we PC gamers shouldn't complain.I've honestly tried to stick with this game hoping it will get better. But every update makes the game harder and more boring to play (increased waiting times) and is more and more  focussed on the mobile store where you can buy things to speed up the waiting game.Keep your money and spend it on a real PC godgame!This game is just telling you what to do and you aren't even close to a god. If you still have hope that this will become anything more then a tech demo for the mobile free to p(l)ay game then keep your money in your pocket untill it's (if ever) released on PC.I'm done with it for now and will see if *he ever delivers on any of his promises.*he being Peter Molineux the so called brains behind the gamesorry if this is really negative but I can't say it in any other way, just check out the steam godus forums and you'll see that I'm not alone in this.

Early Access Review
								So, I bought Godus at 75% off. I was curious if countless Kickstarter backers being disappointed at this game meant it didn't meet their expectations, or how bad it really was. What I am writing is based on several hours of playing the ""beta V2.4"" version.To recap, 22cans collected lots of Kickstarter money to make a PC version of the game, and 5 months later when it foreseeable they wouldn't get done they contracted a publisher for a mobile version and finished that first.If you ever wanted to experience the ""fat-finger"" feeling you get on mobile on your PC, this game delivers: when I am clicking and dragging to move a mountain ""slice"", what moves is often not quite where I clicked, and I don't know why. But hey, instead of fixing this, we can prevent people from losing too much by only allowing small changes -- which means that big changes (and you'll need lots of them) have to be executed as a series of small changes. A real PC game would let me make the change and ask for confirmation or, even better, allow undo or reverse time, but we can't have that in a Skinner box, now can we (see below)? There are a few other things that don't quite work right yet (including infrequent game crashes), but the former is part of the core game mechanic, and I'd have expected it to be in the 53% that are allegedly completed.I don't play much mobile myself (though I recommend LYNE on any touch device), but the rest of Godus's mobile inheritance are characteristics this game shares with monetized ""Skinner box[en.wikipedia.org]"" games that I have been looking at plenty on Kongregate, The game is structured around annoying you into spending ""gems"", which in the PC version don't have to be bought, but that doesn't solve the big problems of this approach. To do things in-game you need belief (mana). In a f2p game, that would be your action bar that renews by waiting. Well, you also need more believers to get belief, but still, if you like you could idle this game for hours and collect belief and then be able to ""pay"" for sculpting the landscape and sending your minions on errands. (Yes, you ""pay"" for giving orders to the little computer people.) Or you can buy belief (and food, the other in-game currency) with gems. To acquire your godlike skills, you need to progress in the game so you can unlock a skill card that you can only use when you have placed ""stickers"" on it that you either find in treasure chests or (surprise) buy with games in the form of ""booster packs"" (another favorite Skinner box staple). Oh, and best hold off on opening too many treasure chests, because there are skill cards that make the treasure in them more valuable. Much of the game is automated. ""Zoning"" for buildings can only be done indirectly by blocking the automatic zoning off unwanted spots with terrain. Unit pathfinding sucks over long distances: toons will tell me several times they're blocked until they finally find their way to the destination. Again, this is a core feature, which should have been working in the mobile version, except people on tablets apparently can't send units as far away as I do. But collecting ""belief"" is not automated, it's a useless ""makework"" klickfest that only makes sense as part of a ""core loop"" on a skinner box.Oh, how you get gems: by either killing your believers (which makes them unhappy, which gives the AI opponent an advantage), by doing a ""voyage"" which the commentary tells me I can repeat as often as I like, but I made one voyage and now I can't any more, or by finding some in treasure chests, which are limited.Generally, the game setting makes me uncomfortable: my job is to flatten large amounts of landscape, combine cottages into housing blocks, consider rocks and trees as detrimental (you get a skill that makes trees positive later), and homeless people beg you to kill them for gems, basically. God is a real estate developer.I do love the terrain: I love its colors, I love how the shape makes paths and building sites, I love to shape it (when it's not being annoying, see above), but the rest of the gameplay? Forget it. This is what the kickstarter promised: to be god in such a world (and kudos to the artists, they did a good job in creating a world you'd want to be god in), but the gameplay is being an accountant, and on your first playthrough you have incomplete/misleading information to boot.The pity is that the terraforming minigame levels show that someone somewhere realized that doing these terrain things is fun. But building a multi-currency klickfest economic waiting game on top of that is just not warranted. They've taken something very fun and tweaked it so that there's barely any fun left - which on a monetized game makes people hope it'll be fun and exciting if they pay, which they do and it is, which makes it as profitable as drug dealing.""Free-to-play games aren't after everyone for a few dollars -- they're after weak people in vulnerable states for hundreds, if not thousands."" (source[www.gamasutra.com]) (more[notalwaysright.com])Wanna bet this game goes free2play with monetization within a year after its full release?Shame on you, Mr Molyneux.Oh, what do I recommend? If you want to feel like a god, buy SimCity 2000, Settlers 2 Gold, or any other world-building game that doesn't make you work for your basic game functionality, or feel you have to buy your powers at Gods-R-Us.

								Unfortunately I bought this game over a year ago believing we'd see a beautiful civilization building-game with some great features and power-to-the-player. Afterall, this game is GODUS. YOU ARE A GOD!. No.. Not really. It doesn't feel like it. You place huts and sculpt the land and every-once in a while you strike little dudes with a lightning bolt or whatver. And building your civilization you need to find. 'Cards'Very sad. Not to mention all but really two developers have abandoned this game, and the ones still here have done nothing. A big **** you to the main developer Peter. Giving us a dream but not backing it up.			",176,19,3,17,31,2,26

								CLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKIt's a Peter Moyneux game; set your expectation at ""he'll never even finish it"" when you buy it, and you'll still end up disappointed. Extremely little progress since it has come out, and next to nothing in regards to reaching out to players with information or even excuses from 22 Cans.As for gameplay, its little outside of clicking non-stop. You know the baby game from The Stanley Parable? It's pretty much that.I loved Fable: TLC, and I enjoyed Black & White, but I can no longer make excuses for Peter Molyneux, and can no longer recommend his games. Save your money and buy something you'll enjoy (unless you love clicking a ton, then have at it).			",21,4,1,14,1,0,3

								I actually wasted my $20 in the kickstarter for this thing. We were promised a next gen populous with an open world, and we got a glorified flash game. This is my biggest gaming-purchase-related regret to date. You're better off learning Dwarf Fortress than dealing with this muck.. This game is basically the sim city 5 of the populous franchise. (disclaimer: don't be fooled by my ""hours played"": horrible game mechanics forced me to wait for 'belief' in order to do anything.. waiting for long period of times just to do a few things hardly felt god-like)			",89,14,1,17,15,1,14

								Don't waste your money.Direct from the Kickstarter page (Where they were funded over half a million £)""It’s this experience we aim to reimagine. GODUS blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White.""Couldn't be further from the truth, I'd rather play any of the 3 amazing games listed above than Godus. Can't believe I wasted my money on this boring♥♥♥♥♥pay to win game. Populous - Amazing god powers, volcanos, lightning, earthquakes, angels of death, firestorms, tornados and more. All you need is the mana (generated from your troops, braves in huts generating the most and combat troops generating less). Absolutely amazing game for  its time before 2000.Dungeon Keeper - Great game that revolved around building a dungeon with different rooms to bring weird and strong creatures into your domain to fight for you. Included some spells castable with mana, many different rooms. Was a solid game.Black+White - I LOVED this game, even if I prefered populous and DK over it. B+W was great, again there was god powers, fireballs, areas of influence, you even had a creature that would fight for you!Honestly, you'd be better off spending money on these 3 great titles, than this 2014 failure that is Godus.

 This game is like a one-sided relationship: As much as I love this game, it just pushes me away every time I try to get closer to it. Godus was packed with a very cool idea and beautiful gameplay and graphics. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. Since then, the devs have tried everything that they could to make the game as simple as possible. Stupid updates, an annoying micro-transaction system that makes me wanna puke, no feedback from the devs... So let's talk about the positives: + the game is beautiful+ the gameplay is very relaxing+ the game is very easy and gives you the feeling of progression... That's about it right now Now the negatives: - The AI will often work against you as if they want to revolt against the player.- The enemy is no challenge. Their 'troops' are almost hilariously easy to defeat.- A lot of features appear to be there, just not right now...- The biggest part of the game just ends after a while, eventhough you are still expected to go on.- There is no clear goal in this game, but there IS a goal.-  There should not be any micro-transactions in an UNFINISHED game. - A lot of updates just seem to change nothing at all, maybe some bugs, or might even remove features.- The game becomes INCREDIBLY repetitive after a while.- Features such as sculpting are a bit awkward and don't often work as you'd like em to.-   THE GAME WILL NEVER GET OUT OF EARLY ACCESS!!!  I just want to elaborate on that last point, because it seems to be an ongoing trend in the steam early access business. The game has been in early access for a LONG time, but never seems to change in a way that is noticable. When changes do happen, they are hardly ever improvements.The description of this games states:  ""GODUS is a unique game that we hope will grow to be truely special."" I feel like this statement is very important to talk about, since godus IS a very unique and special game, especially for me. However, as time passes by, the game becomes much less special and much less interesting. It's a shame that such a unique and fun game is slowly fading away into the 'unfinished' terrain, where it will likely never see the light of day again. So, should you buy godus? I really, REALLY wanted to say yes, but right now, godus is basically a bunch of promises that will never be fulfilled.The answer:  Sadly, no, not right now  My apologies if the English is not very good, it is not my native language.  Also, I still really love this game, but I just think it is not worth it  right now .  ",202,24,2,4,18,1,21

								In the beginning I was really fond of this game, since it had Peter M., the creator of Black&White, working on it.So I purchased it and dabbled around until I hit the limit of what was currently posssible at that time, and to be honest i quite enjoyed it.I unistalled it, deciding to check back once it was out of Early Access, but I kind of forgot about it.A few days ago I found a news article stating, that Peter M. had left the studio, was currently working on something else and the current lead developer saying, that he's ""sorry"" for not finishing the PC version and instead focusing on making this into another free-to-play mobile game.I re-installed the game and started it, to see what was going on and how the game had changed. I very nearly smashed my fist through the monitor.I could've handled the abbandonment by Peter M., but turning this into another ♥♥♥♥ing free-to-play, cash-grabbing mobile-oriented game?! HELL NO!The straw that broke the camel's back for me was when the tutorial suddenly changed it's language to italian. Everything else was in english, the menu, the annoying commentary and everything else up to that very moment had been in english, but when the tutorial decided, for whatever reason, to change it's displayed ""quest"" text to italian, I lost it.This so-called ""game"" started out as something promising, but now it's nothing more than a another example of waht's wrong in the game industry.It once held promise, but since then it's been gutted and abused, and is now forced onto the corner of the street, to make a few bucks from the mobile-device gamers, like some cheap ♥♥♥♥♥.It has been a while since i felt disgusted, but what happened to this game makes me sick.

I don't know man...4, The game is MUCH more polished and bugbashed but one question remains: WHAT IS THE MAIN PURPOSE???Let's settle down here: Why do I, or should I play this game? Is there any goal? Apart of hunting chests, yea, whoa. Chest hunter simulator 2014 for 20 EUR, thanks.Is there any goal? No folks. At this point (after 2 years), I'm still trying to find out, what the goal of this game is supposed to be. Is there any economic or social, or military goal? Nope. Is there any emotional reward the game can offer, or any other reward worth your time and money? Nope.At this point I can only say one thing: DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME!The game had a great potential I think. If it was up to me I would have made it a funny civ and city management game with quick battle option against real players with a good ranking system.UPDATE:Ah, so after we funded your life and studio you abandoned the PC version and made it into an Android mobile game?!

								At first I was reminded of a game I played over a decade ago...  Populous.  But this isn't really like Populous.  Its more tedious having to raise and lower land so that your followers can go run around and build new huts to gain belief.  There needs to be more random acts in the game other than a stray wolf or two that might come along and eat a follower at the skirts of the civilization.  Instead, for any type of combat, you are carted off to another world to do battle.  The challenges in the other world are easy.While I understand this is still in Beta, I don't see the game changing to incorporate elements that make me want to revisit the game when it is released.  Good try, but, needs something more.			",194,47,0,31,21,3,38

Up to a point where it's straight out an mobile game. Even their roadmap, currently as of writing this, is saying that they've stopped the development of the PC version to focus on the iOS version for the casual gamers and that they will pick up PC development in the end of the summer/start of autumn.I cannot recommend this game to anyone and if you REALLY want it.

It's early access after all, I can forgive it.I check back often, because I realized i've been Molyneux'd... again. This game is the same as Spacebase and that other game that finished EA early, except this won't, in fact it'll probably never be ready because they made it into an iOS game too. Which means they cut back on their features. Which means.... we've been Molyneux'd again.Don't buy this game. I don't know why I keep falling for this man's lies. But I do. I am an idiot.

								Do NOT buy this game unless you are really okay with high wait times.  It is NOT free-to-play, but it has elements that make it feel that way.  The devs are theoretically working on balance issues, and to give them credit, gameplay engineering should probably be what they get working right now.  However, there are serious timing/balance/resource issues with the game that make this frustrating gameplay experience.  I'd recommend anyone curious about this to follow the forums, and ""wait and see"" the game finished before plunking down $20.  That said, if you can find it on a 90% off deal, go for it, because the game really does have a lot of potential.Bottom line:  Wait until this game is finished, then read the reviews before you decide.

								I don't write reviews much. But this game....I like this game. I really do. It's just that there is so... little. It feels like there should be more. It feels like everything you're doing in the game is just the tip of the iceburg.... but that's it. You're not on an iceburg. You're on an ice cube, and are impressed that you can balance so well. Then you realize the game is devolving into another collect-a-thon mobile game. You know the ones, you have buildings that make a resource and you have to play it for a minute every fifteen minutes and tap on the resource to collect it. That's what this becomes in about two hours of play, unless you love terraforming. But eventually you'll realize that there's no reason why you should play anymore, because it's just more of what you're doing now, but for even longer.Sure, there are tiny side games you can do as well, but that's what crappy mobile games do too. They have just enough content to seem fun... and that's it.Oh and you can pay real money to buy gems in this game to do the same stuff slightly faster so you can hurry up and get to more of the same stuff.

								I bought this game right when it came out and at first it seemed really cool and I had high hopes considering 22cans made bank off the kickstarter and it was being made by Peter Molyneux. More than 2 years later, this game sucks. Thanks to this game (and another which also had a fat stack of funding due to kickstarter) I will never purchase a Early Access game ever again ( which is sad cuz there are some pretty sweet looking games that are early access right now). Hell, I'll never buy a game that was funded from kickstarter because there seems to be a pattern here people...just saying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Review as per Godus v2.0.1 - March 19th 2014First and foremost - buyer beware. Right now Godus is a mobile/tablet game that will also be released on PC without a cash shop.I could bother you all with a list of things that are currently wrong with Godus. But I'll let Peter Molyneux himself do the talking instead.""To Molyneux, the value of being an independent developer lies in being able to do things like muck around with odd funding models or release schedules without having to answer to a broader authority.""Source: Molyneux shares his strategy for indie development[www.gamasutra.com]Secondly there are a few figures I'd like to present to you.By Peter's own account we have 1 million early access supporters.""From there, Molyneux recommends developers move to Steam’s Early Access service. He claims that Godus netted another million installs through Early Access, which brought in more money and players to keep development going.""Source: Molyneux shares his strategy for indie development[www.gamasutra.com]Add to that the original £526k and a promise for the game to be ""finished"" in 7~9 months (starting Dec 21st 2012) and the obvious incomplete state of the game right now.I recommend strongly against getting this game right now.I'll leave you here with an additional statement by Peter from the same page and leave it up to yourself to conclude what this means about the current state of Godus.“If you put a million people together, about 5,000 of them will turn into nightmare bullies who will destroy the culture you’re trying to create,” said Molyneux. He claims that by removing player communication from Curiousity, 22cans learned how to better create a healthy community.Source: Molyneux shares his strategy for indie development[www.gamasutra.com]Peter as much as says that he has no intention of listening to his backers and supporters and instead will simply do as he pleases.He refers to a messy desk being a sign of his creative process - which can just aswell be seen as a metaphor to the current state of affairs in 22cans.This particular article speaks volumes about the current state of affairs for both Godus and 22cans.

								Now, Godus is the type of game that truly makes you wonder why an all powerful god would be attached to one specific group of people with the only truly useful ability available to you is to move dirt. You would think that babysitting a group of common grunts with the thinking power of bread mold, they would at least walk around the villages to give you something to look at. But instead they hide away in little huts and throw up little flags when the house is full ( And I learned that by reading a wiki page ) allowing you to bang your godly fist of might on their tiny doors and thrust them out into the world to.... walk around for a short time before collapsing. You're apparently supposed to have them build a house to live in but the instructions are so irritatingly bland that you'd probably have an easier time deciphering a f***ing cave painting. Godus was originally created to mimic an earlier game with the same concept, to play as a god and build a civilization. But as it turns out, reintroducing a concept from the 80's to the modern age and expecting the exact same reaction is like wrecking your car then dragging it home and offering it to your child as a birthday present. I can understand that the developers wish to try and breath life back into something they cherished long ago. They charge $20 for something that should be considered an indie game then they have the audacity to say that ""The content in the game is only 40% of what is to come"". Well developers, if I pick this game back up in 8 months, I will be expecting to see godly hands wiping entire continents of the face of the planet. But hashing out $20 for a bunch of old men's backyard project is just insulting. Not to mention the ""multiplayer"" being poulated by bots who try to to act like living people. I find it all very creepy to hear a bot talk about it's ""dad coming home so he won't let it play for long"". One last thing I want to wrap up with is their so-called ""beautiful design style"" has about as much beauty as roadkill. A sharp, retro design makes it feel like I could have made something like this myself. Seriously devs, do us all a favor and give us our money back, then kill this abomination.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Godus was a beautiful and exciting concept when it was first announced. The gameplay videos were promising. So I bought the game. I sunk in more hours in this than anything else. In the end, it was all such a waste. The game got stuck in the same phase for a long. The developers keep promising more additions to the game but the updates are always underwhelming. One cannot feel anything but cheated by this game. 22cans should completely focus on finishing this game instead of concentrating on mobile or other projects.			",30,4,2,0,4,0,3

								Yeah, this game will never be 1.0, if it is it will be in name only. It's unfinished, bug infested and just leave a bad taste in my mouth.I have been following this since the kickstarter (backed for some kind of uniqe pet, thta I will never see) and frankly feel betrayed, that will learn me for trusting a kickstarter with a famous name attached to it.I really love Peters older games Fable 1 go me to buy a Xbox, Fable 2 got me to buy a 360 - I loved both those games very, very, VERY much. beat them both over 13 times. Before that I played hundreds of hours Black and White, I even liked B&W 2.Fable 3 was shoddy and not very thought out, still somewhat liked it but - meh.To think I was defending Peter even if he promised to much, I always knew he would still deliver a good game. Shame on me, right? Godus is just a ****ing backstab, take the money make a crappy mobile game with microtransactions and RUN!And run is just what you should do if you are thinking of buying this sad ""game"".

								It's basically a facebook game, focused more on addictive gameplay and ALL THE WAITING, rather than on enjoyable gameplay.The little treasure chest that you dig up are nice, and the PC version not having micropayments is also nice. But ultimately it's a waiting simulator. The game continues counting various super slow things while you're not logged on, like you'd expect from a facebook game. So if the solution to the drag is 'just stop playing the game for a while', then why not go one step further, and just stop playing the game forever?I'll still give it an other chance, but I'm not sure if it'll improve my opinion.Edit 07/12/2014:Gave it an other chance, no real change in opinion about the gameplay, but now it runs *super slow* despite not using up much CPU (~4%) or memory. Even the interface is delayed by a factor of 20.			",185,35,2,54,34,0,74

The Godus Experience(Skip to the ______ if you just want a brief review and not my personal experience with the game)Initial purchase, over a year ago:This game is great! It's got really neat mechanics and it's a really enjoyable game to play. Nice atmosphere too.Next update, a few months after:The devs have just tweaked the existing mechanics and made them more intuitive (i.e. not having to create and destroy farm fields to get resources). Neat!Next update, a week later:Wow, the devs added something that deletes my save file randomly! Now I can start fresh!Next update, about two weeks later:Nice, now there's intermittent crashing functionality!Next update, a few months later:The game doesn't even go past the load screen anymore, sweet!At this point I emailed the devs with details as to the crashing and loading issues, and subsequently forgot about the game for awhile.Fast forward to now, a little over a half a year after the last update.Maybe they looked into what I said and fixed it? Nope, now the game doesn't even open, I just get an error message._____Although it was quite the enjoyable experience a couple years ago when I first bought it, I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone. The developers have made few meaningful changes in the entire span of me owning it, and prior experience with Peter Molyneux leads me to believe that this game will be abandoned. The game was crowdfunded $790,384 USD, which has all been exhausted at this point in development.Gameplay itself was quite enjoyable when I could still play the game, but over time I have less and less been able to access the game without it crashing. From what I have read, the game has become oversimplified and become more focused on microtransactions, hinting that the developer has completely abandoned the philosophy stated when I first played the game; ""You're a PC gamer, you don't need microtransactions."" I feel incredibly disappointed to not recommend this game. When I first bought it, I would have, but in its current state I would suggest spending your money on something worthwhile.

								Updated**Before you read anything or buy anything read this article about 22cans from Gamespothttp://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocky-road-ahead-for-godus-as-key-devs-depart/1100-6425211/Previous**The Game on its own. Its a fun little game but lacks depth. I did enjoy playing it for a while but like some commentators say it has a mobile game feel to it. This was in Early Access at least. I do like the blocky art style and terrain and the idea of sculpting terrain with your mouse is awesome. But this game has been in early access for way to long. It seriously needs updates and added content and even some content has been removed since i first played. So its unfair to say until its finished, whenever that will be. I don't recommend buying it until we see progress and a finished and polished game. It is a great idea, but i think this games style is made for tablets and touchscreen more than a pc experience. That includes collecting faith with hundreds of clicks can get pretty old and repetitive, again that will work better on a touch screen.Controversy**Peter Molyneux!!! (The Carrot & Stick) They Guy who brought you games like Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Fable(Note, that is alot to live up to) and his latest entry Godus (The Mobile Game). Beware this game is far from finished(very much still Early Access) and kinda turned into a mobile game at some point. It really is a cool idea yes, i(The Fool) bought it in the first few days it came out on early access, maybe to early, maybe i was to eager. But 22Cans did take that money and put it into a mobile game or at least it feels like it. I would admit it won the ""The App Store Best of 2014"" award but at the sake of his kickstater support and PC audience. One thing Peter dear Peter at least tell us whats up, pull a rabit out of the hat and say Godus Mobile was actually a ruse to get money to build Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Populous  NEXT LEVEL BUNDLE Ultimate Addition! Ok thats the end of the emotion part coz that is what i personally want from you. I think its a game we didnt ask for but Godus is the game we are given but then again no one asked for Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Populous. But Godus doesn't fit in that group, for now.OK If you really care about this game, talking to the community, listen to 22cans youtube videos. They are trying to bring us a decent game, and its a good bunch of people working on it. I really believe 22cans you should add these videos or links to steam game profile to help people understand the situation. What it turns out to be will depend on our feedback to 22cans and their willingness to listen.I honsestly would have trusted them to build a game by them selves with their history. Communities dont always know what they want and get emotional and that doesnt help the building process with that types of feedback. I still believe in them, and even after all i said before i dont believe they sold out. This is not the forums so i wont put my game changes here but i believe in you 22 cans to blow my mind still. Come on, look what games have you worked on before, we want more of that, plain and simple really, sort of. If you are doing your own thing, thats fine to, just keep us updated in a timely fashion and listen to the communities and i think it will be a gg.

								I so badly wanted this game to be good. I loved Populous, and I've been vaguely following this for a while. On seeing it available for a mere £3.50 elsewhere, I thought, ""This is gonna be a steal.""How wrong I was. And let me make this clear, a full asking price of £15 is an absolute, utter, complete rip-off. What you are buying is a mobile game. This is not a PC game. Yes, they've TRIED to adapt it to the PC... The gems, which you would clearly pay money for on your mobile device, have alternative ways of being attained, through sacrificing followers, or doing voyages (puzzle missions). But you still have to sit around for hours on end for them to build things, checking frequently to collect items by tapping... Uh, CLICKING on them, forming the core function for why anything gets done. I guess the premise of the game is cool, and definitely brought me to playing it. You drag land to make it suitable to be built on. Your people can only navigate certain terrain and rely on you to make a clear path. But it reeks of mobile game syndrome. Almost every single action costs ""belief"" (energy), which recharges over real life time. This is only made worse by the fact that although you have an uncapped amount of belief, you still have to collect it from each individual household your people build, which DO have maximum caps, varying on the type of house. That means your early game houses, making maybe 70 belief per hour, max out at 40. You can see the problem here, if you want to make progress whilst doing other things.And otherwise, I don't yet see any real reason to play. All you do is sculpt land to expand and repeat. There doesn't seem to be any real goal. The voyages (missions) are straightforward and irritating, especially when the final idiot villager you needed to reach the checkpoint decides to go back to the start because you were half a second too slow molding the land, meaning you have to wait (a significant amount of time in real life) for those villagers to respawn so you can complete the mission.I will probably keep playing, for a little while. But honestly, even paying £3.50, this was a rip-off. You might as well just go play Tiny Tower. Or, if you want a really fun PC adapted mobile game, try New Star Soccer! This game has so much work to be done if it's to become a PC game.EDIT: I've played this more to give it a better shot, and my only additional comment is, the path finding is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful, it makes the voyages (missions) impossible sometimes.

								Playing 2.2.1 i think and it is such a disappointment, dont get me wrong there are flourishes of brilliance here, just like any previous early game levels of Peter's, Black & White 2, Fable, Dungeon Keeper, they all introduce some fun and engaging mechanics... but as it opens up, more and more 'features' are piled on to just over complicate the theme developed early on. How does this effect Godus? Well.Belief - This is where things get off to a rough start, waiting for resources is one thing, we all didnt mind watching our gold being mined and slowly piled in our treasure rooms for Dungeon Keeper, or resources being worked in Black and White 2 but where Godus fails is that it takes SOOOOOOOOOO long to generate enough to actually do something and there is no player feedback as to why you get this resource, we cant see them praying, just a bubble to click when a timer finishes when they feel like acknowledging you, that doesnt make me feel like a god, it makes me feel like im looking at belief cooking in a microwave, im looking at a number on a machine to tell me when i can consume my resource, rather than the excitement of cooking it myself and seeing things change organically infront of my eyes. If you are going to have belief. make it something that gives you visual feedback, let us see our followers in awe of us, give us worshipping tents, campfires or churches that followers can go into and express that to us, MOST IMPORTANTLY have those generate belief without us having to click bubbles, whats wrong with it filling by itself over time without me having to witness and acknowledge each person, if i had to play theme park and literally click all my stores and rides to get money from them i'd stop playing in an instant. I'm a god right? i am omnipresent, im not a small child popping bubbles, i want to feel godlike and not like a god damn factory worker, i aint getting paid, i paid to play this! Let me have more fun and engaging activities and less work! Let me be creative as the creator!Id also like to note how the devloper commentary keeps running along the lines of 'This doesnt seem helpful yet but wait a few hours and you'll see', Peter if i have to wait more than a minute for something to require my direct attention in a game or hell be able to do anything what so ever of my choosing the immersion breaks down, i stop questioning my ingame actions and pull back to question what im doing with my life, if the answer to that is 'waiting a few hours before i can play and progress' you are doing something wrong as a game designer...Pacing, look it up!Sculpting - I know many people would rather have a large paintbrush style scheme to quickly shape the area how they deem fit, but i like the more methodical pace this game has, each little touch feels like a delicate hand of god, each click feels like it has a purpose, it fits themematically with your power as a god slowly getting more powerful and powers later do increase how much you can sculp. It ties with belief fueling the power you have, but then thats the shot to the foot, it would be so much fun to sculp all these layers and make something unique to you, yet because it is funded by belief, you dare not use limited belief to sculp unless it fits in with later game strategie, so you end up with a pretty bland group of flat lands full of abodes, rather than a complex village with different elevations, houses on hills etc. I loved how city building was in Black & White 2, minus the wierd happiness bugs ofcourse, it was the feeling of drawing your roads, plotting out your town, shaping your civilization. Even if you do decide to break form and build on some hills the sculpting layers make it hard to make steps for your villages to climb up, if you dont want to add slants to the layers to make it easier for your follwers to climb then perhaps a power that when selected sculps in a staircase type fasion for hills and such, making it less finicky. Have it so i can sculp without using a resource, make it so i unlock the ability to sculp certain planes but then do so freely once unlocked, i like the feeling of sculpting the world, i just dont like moving a foot of land and wasting what little belief i had.Building - I kind of like how my villages decide where buildings are plotted, i nudge them in the right direction by plotting out a space of land and they decide where to build on it, it makes me feel like ive blessed them with free will, it feels godlike in a way which is the whole point. I dont mind clicking on buildings to send out my builders, even though there is no thematic feedback, such as seeing my builder seem inspired through divine intervention like Noah and the Ark. It starts of alright, not taking much time, seeing your population expand is satisfying.....BUT THEN, the timers get larger, larger and larger, waiting and not playing begins as you wonder what you are doing with your life, oh you could send more builders to help but wait, your belief has run dry so you just wait. If that wasnt bad enough, once you build a farm, NOW all of a sudden your builders refuse to work unless you give them some food...what were they eating before, SAND!? Time to wrap up, i could go into the voyagages but its bugged and i cant do anymore, they are basically simple puzzle levels that grant stickers to unlock abilities. The sticker system itself being something i again despise, it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and pisses me off here, it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off when i was a kid filling my sticker books and is just a clever marketing tool to get kids lunch money, im a grown adult Peter, start treating me like one. I basically feel as it stands now ive brought a game on false promises, im fueling the development of a free to play designed mobile made game. Mobile games and their practises in my eyes destroy good game design and just prey on idle hands with engagement levels of popping bubblewrap. If you want this to be a great PC game then start actually designing it as such, seperate it from the mobile money grab, even the sims PC games havent stooped this low yet, infact i'll use that as an analogy for this game.Godus, its like the sims, if you had to wait for them to pick there noses minutes at a time before moving on to their next alloted task, watch them sleep without time speeding up, plot their houses one wall at a time while you actually wait for the builders to come round and place it together brick by brick AND ONLY IF you give them garden grown and homebaked wholegrain bread :|			",341,54,12,22,23,2,19

								Here is my take on Godus after about 40 hours of game play into the game. Godus is the new god sim from the camp of Peter Molyneux, responsible for the incredible Black & White god game, and the not so incredible Black & White 2 - not to mention popular series Fable and Populous. I put dozens and dozens of hours into the first Black & White game and I still regard it as the best god sim I've ever played, the second was largely a disappointment.The Good:First of all, the overall aesthetic of the game is simultaneously simple and striking. I love the way each coloured layer of water, sand, grass and rock comes together to form landscapes, the game just looks amazing.As a newly minted God you will be responsible for the health and well being of your people. That will generally include shelter, food and some forms of entertainment manifesting themselves in the form of belief. You can in turn use this belief to sculpt more difficult landscapes (anything not sand), use abilities or spells and control your followers to assist you. This mechanic works fairly well most of the time though you may find yourself spent out on belief often as you venture deeper into the game - past 10 hours or so.The Bad:Cards. General abilities will be awarded as you open up major milestones in game play - such as reaching a certain population threshold. They will often allow for huge changes in village building, god skills or overall gameplay. The problem with this is two-fold. The first problem is the ability is not usable when it's 'unlocked', you need to further unlock it by using cards which you can only find in treasure chests or from spending 'gems' (more on gems later). The card unlock method is instantly tired and feels unnecessary. As for the second problem, sometimes the mechanic you unlock makes a jarring change to the game flow. Biggest example of such changes is unlocking the ability to create farms. Farms will produce wheat, ok not a problem there. Problem is up until this point in the game you've been able to create buildings and expand your empire without any resource constraint and then as soon as wheat is available all of a sudden the flow of your expansion is completely paralysed as you will likely be very short on wheat. Eventually your empire will build up enough farms but like so many other issues in the game it feels very unnecessary to use it in this fashion.Early on you will unlock the dock, which opens up a side mission which appears to be designed for gods who are waiting on their village to build out and have nothing else to do. By clicking on the dock a side game will open up where you can 'sail' to islands. At each island will be a sort of a Godus style puzzle where when you click begin you will have to guide your followers to the objective as quickly as possible. Get them there fast and you get a higher score, get a higher score and you get better cards. The side missions are a bit bland and boring and you're constrained again by the mobile mechanic of limited resources. I went once, did a couple of islands and quit never to return again. All this area of gameplay is is a time dump. Yawn.The Ugly:There is no disguising it, this game was developed first and foremost as a mobile game. Everything points to it, from the strained resource mechanic requiring time for recharges, to the slightly sloppy controls on PC - which would surely work better on mobile. The most obvious thing is the gem mechanic which is really what I have the most trouble with. It was clearly designed as a pay mechanic to speed up gameplay on the mobile side, but it doesn't translate well into the PC version at all. You don't have to pay for the gems in the PC versions for obvious reasons - you have to pay for the main game. I feel like perhaps the better approach would have been to release this as a free to play game and just keep the gem pay scheme so it doesn't feel as awkward as it does. If you listen to the game developer commentary as you play the game and unlock mechanics, you will hear them harp on about how cool the gem mechanic is and how important it is but honestly most of the time it just felt awkward and out of place in the world. I was often sacrificing nearly all of my  villagers to get gems (the only way currently to do so to my knowledge) just so I could keep playing. Where in Black & White I was looking out for and taking care of my villagers - I find myself just simply murdering all of my people in Godus just so I can keep playing. It's bad, real bad.Unfortunately about 40 hours in I found myself tired of the issues explored above and also the bugs, which are fine as the game is still currently in beta - these are expected to happen. If you can get the game at a large discount and you're a big fan of god sim genre games then by all means you should pick it up and throw some hours into it. Perhaps it will be improved at that point. For right now, I have to say I would not make the purchase again knowing what I know now.5/10			",189,34,2,16,14,2,25

								The promises of this game were lofty, and almost too good to be true. Turns out they were too good to be true, oddly enough in true Peter Molyneux fashion.We were promised a proper PC god game, and instead what we got was a Freemium mobile game which charged people to test it on PC. Though there are no microtransactions in the ""PC version"" of the game, the game is a copy/paste job of the Freemium mobile version. This game is designed to prevent you from progressing so as to force mobile players to pay money to progress, and that design philosophy simply doesn't work on PC where people have bought the game outright.Don't buy into their promises of now being able to fix the PC version with the mobile version out, because they've already said that fundamental changes to the game's systems are no longer possible with the mobile version out; since both games are meant to have interconnected play with each other. This game will not be getting any better than it currently is.I bought into the hype hook, line, and sinker when this first hit early access, and it taught me the valuable lesson to never buy an early access game again. I wasted my money on this; don't waste yours as well.			",87,52,1,26,27,2,11

								Bought this game because i was a huge fan of Black&White. Its not black&white at all. Spend hours clicking on all the abodes to collect belief, that you'll spend in 2 minutes while you reshape a tiny portion of the landscape. The game knows this is the case, which is why the game itself recommends you constantly do other things when you run out of belief to do what you want.You'll spend most of your time with upkeep after the storms start coming... and the devs act like thats a good thing, since you've run out of belief and cant do anything else.

								Where to start? if the previous reviews haven't already discouraged you...If you buy this game you will directly fund bad developers. This is the game that has killed early access for me. I dearly hope there aren't any more studios that function like this. The point of early access and betas is that you can get feedback about bugs and some direction where you target audience want you game to go. This was mostly ignored. Bugs were largely ignored. Each update seemed to lack the features the players bought the game for under the promise of their implementation, and instead came with a bunch of features that noone knew about until patch day. They flat out lied, to get their funding.Patches began to slow, game was only completed on the mobile version. You can guess the rest.TDLR; do NOT fund this fraudulent studio, gamers deserve better			",174,44,1,23,26,1,30

								All we wanted was a game similar to Populous or Black and White. (Ideally populous 3 and black and white 1)Instead we got this pile of rubbish. I was one of many who intially kickstarted the game thinking how amazing it would be, but how off was the direction with this? Absolutely no idea what they were trying to accomplish. Some kind of mish-mash between pc games and mobile games? Who the hell wants to play them? You can't even skip the 30 minute long tutorial. It's not getting updated anymore, this game is dead. If I could get a refund I would but I game it a chance and played a few hours on it. Hah and look at the description - outright lies: ""If you’ve not had the chance to play our delightful, Zen-like re-genesis of the god game on Windows PC or Mac OS X, there’s never been a better time to do so! Now more than ever, as we’re currently making full use of our opt-in branch by running a rapid build release schedule during our PC-focused sprint.""So as reviews prove it's not 'delightful'. It's not a re-genesis in anyway.There is no 'rapid' release schedule. Infact there hasn't been a real update in ages. ...and pc focused? Wow, what an outright lie. Look at the style of it or the simplified mechanics? It was created for mobile devices... and it's darn awful.If somebody would actually make a decent god game in the spirit of Populous 3 or Black & White 1 then I would fund them with as much money as I could afford! But this was such a dissapointment...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			",167,28,1,35,34,2,62

								At this point, I am regretting purchasing Godus. The tech resource ""stickers"" are too sparce, the interface is obviously designed with a touchscreen in mind, and the game proceeds far too slowly.It feels like it's intended to be a pay-to-proceed game, along the lines of something you'd get ""for free"" on the google apps store or itunes. Sure, you can technically play those games without spending any money, but you very quickly reach the point where the necessary resources to proceed are few and far between, a sort of soft wall between the freely available content, and the rest of the game.And that is /exactly/ what it feels like around the point where you become able to unlock the Farming settlements. At that point, play has come to a near halt, and it'll be hours, if not days, before you can make any progress.What a disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought Godus when it first launched on Steam (about a year and a half ago at this point). Initially I was not super blown away by it, but saw the potiential in it. There was a lot of promissed content, and yes, it was made clear that it was not yet in the game. This content all looked good, the game looked on track, the devs were active about talking about the game and their schedual.But it was all just talk, and the game has seen now real progress. A lot of dev blogs are posted, they talk about what's going on, but there's never any progress in the game.Since I started playing there have been many ""major"" updates, unforunantly these updates have just been them scrapping a lot of what they had, trying to reimpliment their ideas, but just making the game more tedious. There's honestly been very little ACTUALLY added since I first started playing, even though they keep uping their ""% of game done"" in the launch screen. I've gone back time and time again, giving the game chance after chance, but it's still a deeply flawed mess that the devs refuse to acknowledge. They keep spouting off about what's going on, and how they'll get to this new feature then everything will be great... Please, do not buy this game, the information on the store page is very inaccurate, and it's development has been very dead for so long.			",88,12,0,15,17,0,37

								EDIT for Version 2.0.:As far as i can tell, the basic game is STILL the same. Less clicking, of course, i give you that 22cans. But most of the other bad mechanics are still there: 1. Cards are now Stickers, obtained in the same way as before, working the same way as before.2. Belief takes horribly long to generate and you can't sculpt land without it.3. I still have to click or hold and slide over every belief-bubble hovering over the huts of my followers to collect it, instead of just having a constant number of belief rising my belief counter like every other Real-time-game! That's game standard, dear developers.There is more to criticise because I only played about half an hour of Version 2.0, but I still hope it gets better. (And it is better than previous versions, as far as I can say, so the potential is there.)I still do NOT recommend to buy this game in its current state, but it is only 49% done, so keep it up, 22cans.UPDATE for V2.0:Although they had fan-feedback and 5 months of time: Only little difference to previous versions, slightly changed graphics and the pay-to-play-structure is still obvious. For myself, I do not like the new journey-feature that replaced the previous battle-feature to obtain stickers, but I think they should completely get rid of this sticker-unlock-nonsense and put in a traditional ressource-gathering system that would give villagers a purpose automatically.But on the other hand, the basic gameplay is kinda fun and who doesn't like to be a god, although a lesser one at the moment, and rule over big settlements?OPINION for CURRENT Version 2.01: Do not buy if not frust-resistent, but hey, now I believe that it could become a good game if they work hard on it.Original Post:I expected this game to be good, at least some kind of Populous-The Beginning 2.0, which would have been very nice.If YOU expect that too, DO NOT buy this game in its current state.I hope it gets better soon (maybe they should fire Peter Molyneux - Ingame shop, fuuuuu.-,-) At the moment it is more like a building place - and dirt moving simulator, the bad sort, of course.Digging, click, click, click, click, yeah, enough space for a small house, click, click, click, yeah, villager builds house, click, click, click, oh, another chest discovered, click, click, nice, a new card, now i only need another 14 ♥♥♥♥ing CARDS to unlock a new technology!!!The lack of possibilities to interact properly with your villagers and their total apathy when confronted with your ""powers"" made this game really annoying after some time, despite this, villagers also lack of any kind of intelligence, beeing only puppets in this big ""I make everything flat to build as much houses as i can""-game.The biggest problem are not the clickediclick-orgies, it is the fact that neither the world nor its inhabitants seem to have any life to care or speak of and that makes the game feel kinda soulless.Please, 22cans, kick out the stupid cards or at least implement the feature properly, give your villagers a backstory and emotions and make me feel like my decisions and actions really matter more than burning trees, flatten lands and crushing stones.Sincerely, a disappointed gamer			",228,76,0,25,27,1,48

								If you're a Black and White fan, RUN.The game is clearly geared towards tablets and mobile for starters. Which means it might be fun to play while you're at the doctors office, but if you're expecting any complex, challenging, exciting interactions you're out of luck. Basically all you do is drag around the landscape to make flat land so you're little followers can build cube houses automatically. The novelty of that wears off in about 20 minutes and there's NOTHING to do while they build except get stickers. You just sit there with your thumb up your♥♥♥♥♥watching a timer count down 3 minutes to build 1 house. What fun. Even if you wanted to continue sculpting you can't, because you need belief to do it, and no followers means no belief. It takes ages to generate belief too, I sure love waiting 10 minutes so I can finally drag the ground around a little bit more woo!Even after you're far into the game it doesn't get much better you dont get to throw rocks, fireballs, trees or anything like that. Best thing you get is a meteor strike. The most insulting thing of all is these silly limitations put on you! You're a god for crying out loud. Want to build a town center? Nah, brah you need 50 premium gems. And all the waiting... waiting... waiting... Might as well be called waiting simulator. What fun does it add to make me wait 10 minutes to expand the terrain in a SINGLEPLAYER game? What does that add? Nothing... frustration is about it.I bought this game a looonng time ago with early access, hoping it could be something great. They haven't done a whole lot since. They overhauled a boring beta to have a slicker interface and a happiness meter! Added a few tid bits for the late, late game. This is months, and months, we're talking about here. What the hell are you guys doing?In summary this is one of those games that wants you to play for 10 minutes, leave it for 6 hours so you can play it for 10 minutes again. It's boring, repetitive and not very Godlike. All you do is wait, sculpt, build, wait, sculpt, and build. As a B&W fan, I feel abused. This isn't a God game, it's a sleep aid.

								I got lured in by a video about Peter Molyneux's latest title where other names were dropped like Populous and Minecraft (granted in world size comparison only - but you'd imagine the creative abilities immediately). They put extra hard work in the shaping tool, because you gonna use that often, he said.An experienced designer, a proven and tested game idea, what could possibly go wrong? At the time I was a little disappointed in the lack of freedom in Reus. Yay, I thought, Godus to the rescue.Do NOT make the same mistake I made. Despite it's only 40% or so finished, this is just another one of those F2P titles (Itemshop coming soon) where your main objective is to pave the entire map with the houses of your people to get to the next level. To build more houses.Did I mention you have to CLICK LIKE A BILLION TIMES and your houses do only occupy like half of the available space anyway. Places and sizes are practically decided for you. Not to mention after several hours of play everything takes like forever to build. All you can do is wait and NOT play the game. Which would have been a wise decision in the first place.I cannot decide what's the worst part about it: The lousy A.I. that is represented by the replay of some pathetic chat messages, or the shaping tool. Yeah, the one that was worked on so ""hard"". It never sticks to where it should, sometimes does nothing at all, all it does is waste believe so you have to click some more.You can't make stairs automatically, which is annoying, and the pathfinding of your guys is usually too dumb to find the stairs anyway.Try giving the shaping tool to a professional 3D modeller and see how well he likes it. If it was me, personally I'd like to smash my keyboard on anyone that suggested this ""tool"" for any serious creative work. It's just wasting your time and resources, as per the objective of any stupid browser game.I seriously wonder how you can sink so low - is it just to make money? What are they coming up next; a game where all you can do is click-destroy millions of cubes? - oh wait...All in all: HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. STAY AWAY!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay, let's be honest.I put quite some hours in the game, going all the way back to september 2013.In the beginning, I had high hopes, refreshing concept, some kind of 'going through history-Populous'-mix, go on.That all changed when I saw how much they changed the focus to the free to play mobile app. At that moment, I felt terrible that I ever bought this game. Okay, there are no in-game purchases, and okay, the building does go a lot quicker,  but apart of that, we PC-players that payed for the game get exactly the same content as the free-to-play mobile players?That just sucks, sorry to say it.At the given moment, I have little hope that this game ever becomes what Peter Molyneux promised it to be. (He left the project btw, nice detail.)I'm really sad that a game with such high expectations can get so low.At the given state, don't buy the game, if you really want to play it, play the mobile version instead, almost exactly the same, just with microtransactions.I do hope from the deepest of my heart that this game is going to be saved, I really hope it's going to be the game all the fans want it to be, but there is still a long way to go.In its current state and with the free-to-play mobile version that is almost exactly the same, I would say: buy this game in sale if you really want it, but be aware it still has a lot of unused potential.Score: 4/10 I guess			",126,44,9,31,57,6,48

								A damn shame about this game, but it was only made because large numbers of people believed Peter Molyneux's trademark tall tales. It's not that he lied and hoodwinked us. We and he participated in a shared delusion.Godus is bereft of gameplay. It's bereft of everything, really. There's no strategy, no morality for your followers, no sense of power for the player. There's no technological development either. Instead of these things, we have a cheap♥♥♥♥♥grindgame for tablets in which you monotonically plonk down hut after hut, for no reason or reward. In the course of that, you have to sculpt the land, but that mechanic is as buggy and unsatisfying as the endless hut sprawl which it precedes.On the other hand - and it's a very small hand compared to the massive fist of ""♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay"" that punches you in the nuts -, the challenges are a bit fun. You take 20-30 of your followers into a pre-made archipelago and have to guide them from A to B on each island, sculpting the terrain to flatten hills, navigate mazes, and avoid giants. I wouldn't give my left kidney for it or whatever, but it's by far the high point of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								(Game is Only 41% Complete, so it's a pre-release review)Nice to look at but unless they drastically change the game mechanics, I definitely can't recommend it.  The game is spent pushing away layers of earth to either flatten the ground so your villagers can build things on flat terrain, or else pushing away dirty to expose a relic that allows you to push away dirt more efficiently.  You have very little control over anything, and you're repeatedly forced into faked multiplayer matches with the computer where you have to push away dirt the fastest.With about 60% of the game to still be made, they have plenty of opportunity to drastically rework the game though and it *could* be good if they introduce more creative tools other than landscaping.

								I will just tell you my verdict up front in case you don't want to read why this is my verdict.  THIS GAME IS A SOLID 2/10 If this game thinks that you play as a God it is truly wrong. Even the trailers voice acting is bad. also if you can see the houses you have to build plots, and at a certain point you start running out of sculpting power and you have to wait in order to make more trees or rocks. This game was truly a waste of my money and my hope is that you do not waste your money on this early access game and instead go and buy, I don't know, any other early access game that is actually making  progress. This game is meant to be a mobile game and it isn't even worth the price it would be if it was a mobile game. I wouldn't pay a dollar to get this game and I wouldn't get it for free because there would be a paywall. The paywall comes in ... I don't know 2-3 hours in the game and even then you were waiting for faith. The game starts you off with enough trees and rocks  but it is an illusion to make you think that the game will be that easy from there on out. This game could have been so much better by removing the ENTIRE FAITH MECHANIC. The faith mechanic makes you have to wait and wait and wait until you have enough to make small increments of an amount of sculpting the smallest little path so that you can hurry up and get your followers through. The only good part to faith is that it is a reason to build homes. So let me tell you how I would have made this game if not my own game: THIS IS HOW I WOULD CREATE GODUS THIS IS NOT WHAT GODUS IS LIKE 1. In the beginning you start off on a randomly generated but fair landscape.2. You can sculpt the landscape however you want without being limited to breaking down trees and rocks (which makes no sense that you would want to destroy trees and rocks as a ""GOD"" because, lets be honest, if you were truly to play as a god you wouldn't need to break trees or rocks or wait for a long time to be able to sculpt.)3. When villager is created (by you) you can choose what actions you want it to do.4. When he builds a house (in the location you want him to not where the game wants you to) he will live in it.5. Create other villager and have them make babies in the house (or not).6. Create as many villagers as you would like but only some of them with housing will be happy, the others will not be.7. Villager becomes mayor and you can now move on to the farming era.8. After enough houses are made and enough population is there you can move on to the next era, to the next era, etc.9. Whatever you do in between these steps is your choice but these are just the essentials or how to progress from eras.10. I would update this game seeing if the reviews were bad or if I see any bugs reported.11. Wouldn't lie (and didn't lie) about any of the steps or hide secret things in between the steps that you absolutely HAVE to do.			",141,19,0,12,19,1,7

								I just want to start off by saying, The fun factor of this game IS there.  If it was not for the epic scale PR issue, this game would probably be in ALOT better shape then it is.This game currently as it stands has alot of endearing casual god esc mechanics, akin to a lesser version of Farmville.Once you learn the mechanics and the tricks, the ""grind"" everyone hates douse become alot less of a hassel then you would think.My problem is a problem of content.  The game as it stands is very Linear.  They have a sudo case of diversity in the game's tech tree as it stands, but there is an obviouse singular way to go about it; with only a few abilities truely being optional.Should they fix this One major problem, the game could be quite fun in a casual way...  that said, the comunity who innitial bought it were lead to believe that it was something else, so thats another issue in its self.

								The game is boring and maby only worth 2 or 3 bucks at this point. The potential for this to be a micro transaction app is disgusting. The game is at 53% done and if these are the core mechanics I cannot see it getting any better. You get no sense of being a God, Black&White did this better but not fully, and the powers you do get feel forced and confined.This game is a joke. The team can't even get a fully fleshed out game done and they spend time on wasteful holiday updates. How about focusing on finishing the game. I will never buy another peter molyneux game in my life, I am tired of his lies and false promises. Every game he developes is like a dream torn away at the last moment, false promises and poor games make a good developer not. Peter, I used to feel bad for you when you got called a liar in print, no more, you are exactly as they portray you. No more apologies just finish this game and leave.			",73,8,0,7,17,0,21

								Though still in beta, I have dipped my toes into Godus several times. Each time, I'm hoping for Populous and I end up with Farmville. I sat for 15 minutes watching buildings complete and favour recharge waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens, the game is slow and boring. There are other modes that seem interesting, like player vs computer or potentially player vs player, but they require spending a significant amount of waiting to get into.Unless they gut the entire game and respin from scratch the progression mechanics, do not bother.

								given the pace of developement for this game I don't expect it to be finished in our lifetime.  it has a % completed number on the loading screen and that has gone up ONLY 4% in over a year! bought it last year, and while changes have been made and some things improved, very little as far as the goal of the game has changed.  the most effecient way to play is still to flatten everything... something they said they were trying to get away from... well... it didn't work.  belief is still far too slow to accumulate, and now it's even worse... It used to be that when you weren't in the game your houses still built and accumulated belief... now it all stops when you close the game.  Previously when you logged in you had all your houses full of belief for you to harvest and give you a nice boost to play with... not any more... if you are low on belief when you close the game you'll still be low on belief when you start it again.  as a result, the tedium is now much worse.  this could be fixed a bit if sculpting the land weren't so expensive and take hundreds of thousands of belief from you in minutes easily.  Also, as a ""god"", you are the most pitiful supreme being ever imagined!  you make spaces for them to build buildings and farms, and eventually mines... then they can't even harvest those things themselves... you have to do that for them.  maybe this was an attempt to keep the player engaged but really, it just makes you the supreme farmhand.  your powers are pretty much useless most of the time, especially since you won't have a lot of belief to spare to actually use them regularly until you are about ready to go to the second world.  new voyages have been ""coming soon"" for many months now... someone needs to clue them in on what soon means.  the NPC rival tribe is a nuisance more than a threat and just forces you to waste more belief to kill them by using your finger of death or repositioning some archers... both of which cost the same amount of belief.  reaching milestones give you cards that you have to collect stickers to unlock... I unlocked the card with the milestone... why do i have to unlock it again with stickers?  early cards take a few stickers but later ones take far more... and of course the stickers are hard to get without spending gems.  gems are essentially free... you just have to be evil and sacrifice your people to get them easily, otherwise you'll never get enough.  and yes, gems are a setup for microtransactions... but because peter doesn't want a lynchmob on his door the PC version doesn't actually have the microtransactions... i.e. it's all built in to easily be added but there is currently no way to actually pay real money for gems.  that is a good thing in my opinion but we didn't give our moiney to his kickstarter to fund his microtransaction game for mobile phones which is essentially what he's done.  All in all the most fun I have had in the game is ammassing millions of belief until I have enough to rain meteors on my people non stop when I am completely bored of it...			",51,4,0,15,4,0,11

								UPDATE AS OF 20/02/15Apparently, the failure of Molyneux and Godus has grown more and more popular in the last month. I believe these 3 articles might be interesting for anyone still convinced Godus is worth any money at all:http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/13/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/peter-molyneux-game-designer-interview-godushttp://www.pcgamer.com/godus-designer-admits-kickstarter-promises-likely-cant-be-kept/Original review:I bought Godus around a year ago. Its simple and colourful graphics, the User Interface and the many various features intrigued me. However, as many users said, the game has been on early access for ages and there was more re-designing than actual improvement of the game.Many features were removed, some were later re-added, glitches regarding savegames occured and forced the user to restart from 0 - when it wasn't an update to mess up with it in the first place. Overall, what disappointed me the most is that 22cans has been playing with its fans for a while, giving an awful support which made me almost hate the game, and abandon it even before I received the (is there a pejorative of late?) reply. And as if that happened once, months after giving up with Godus I decided to get back to it, only to see that unrealistic features that I didn't even want (like the mixed and multiethnic people of a presumably paleolithic society??) were added. I begged for support and gave availability in case it was required to mod the game on my own to restore the caucasic-only population. I even explained my reasons, saying that it was good to add up races but that a player should get to pick which ones he wants and doesn't want - regardless the colour. The response I received (about 2 months later) was a copy&paste, and guess what? The writing was so bogus and automatic that it rang a bell in my head, I went checking the older email from my first ticket and they were identical!Apart from the lacking, dumb, and almost self-generated ""support"", the game itself is poor as I mentioned above. You can enjoy it maybe for about 20 hours in case you have little experience with God videogames (as the undersigned), then it gets repetitive and pointless. I suggest anyone wishing to play a game of this sort to rely on the comments of god-games enthusiasts/aficionados in order to find a way better (and likely older) one.To sum up: It seemed promising, but knowing that this game has been on early access for 16 months with little improvement, buying it at the moment would be a waste of money. DON'T LET THE VIVID COLOURS AND CARTOON-LIKE GRAPHICS TRICK YOU INTO PURCHASING. 22cans has probably hired good graphic artists in order to show off a slideshow of artworks that don't represent their game at all. Get the Maxim game SPORE instead if you really want to experience how it feels to be a God.Random features that should have been implemented (in my opinion):-Aspects allowing the player to personalise and customise his or her followers and their society (morphology or and climate of the starting area, building architecture, followers' clothing and so on)-A real objective in the game, whether you like a military, economical or diplomatic society (what is the point of building up a civilisation if there's no bloody warfare? Mind that archers were put in the game only lately and have little value in this sense anyway)-Diversification of the planet fauna and flora (they should have implemented animals and plants other than pine-like trees instead of different skin colours for your followers) You can check, for instance, any info regarding wildlife on the game's wiki. All of the issues I detailed above and below can be found here on the respective topics' pages. http://godus.wikia.com/wiki/Wildlife-A complex resource system which still doesn't exist at present, There is no hunting, there is no gathering, there is no fishing whatsoever. There aren't different types of metal or rock that you can collect. You may think I'm point out a stupid thing nobody cares about, but if managing multiple resources is just plain boring, why the hell do all the strategic games that I've played so far usually distinguish 4 types of resource the least? (Gems don't really count as a resource, it's a premium-like feat. you find in freemium cheap♥♥♥♥♥games)-I could continue, but the time I spent writing this objective review should cost 22cans the money I spent on their masterpiece, for anyone reading my thoughts on it will refrain from buying, hence reducing the negative popularity of this game and eventually saving the last slice of credibility the developers have left.

								A prime example of the pitfalls of Early Access, as well as crowdfunding in general. Cavalier developers breaking promises isn't new, but when somebody with such a vivid legacy of successes and achievements does it, the sting of those unfulfilled wishes is particularly harsh.What began as a barebones prototype, and in a lot of ways has remained exactly that, Godus has failed to cover any meaningful ground in its quest to become relevant in today's gaming market. Riddled with technical issues, plagued by unimaginative gameplay and marred by dull visuals, you'll rarely want to come back for more (if you ever came for any to begin with).A total shame, and by far the biggest black mark against Peter Molyneux's name to date. Do not buy.			",128,38,5,11,14,1,0

I am sure you can read the press and watch the interviews, please do and just remember them if you see 22cans or PM pop up as a developer again.			",76,25,0,14,23,0,23

								CRASHED AFTER GIVING IT A SECOND TRY AFTER HALF A YEAR. You know what. The person who commented made me want to try this again. 60 hrs on record, I mean there has to be something right? No. While trying to close this crashed piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥(mind you my pc is top notch) I am both reading forum posts and watching youtube videos of this game. AS I SAID IN MY PREVIOUS REVIEW, THIS GAME IS♥♥♥♥♥♥ NOT CRAP, IT'S♥♥♥♥♥♥ You want a more justificated review? OK! The game has been in early access way too long, and made way too little progress. Being a GOD has never been this boring. The sculpting aspect is the one thing cool about this game and it gets boring in 5 min to 2 hrs depending on how stupid you are.PROS: I GOT THE GAME CHEAP WHEN IT FIRST RELEASED.CONS: 1.I GOT THE GAME. 2.IT COSTS 20 eur now, what the flying ♥♥♥♥!?3. It went freemium on handhelds. 4. The most boring and deppressive GOD SIMULATOR of our time. I AM DONE! JUST ♥♥♥♥ING DONE! You know, i thaught that dayz was a fail of an early access. NOPE! IT'S FAN ♥♥♥♥ING TASTIC. so much proggress comparing to this. Now that I'm looking in to this, it looks like a straight up money grab scheme. I can't believe Peter Molineux was involved in this. WAS, because he has jumped ship obviously. I know i can't get a refund. the sculpting aspect got boring really fast for me ;). But I will say this. After ""The Lost Chapters"" the Fable games got ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier. I know why. Peter is going senile stupid. and this is the last straw. GET HELP! DONT BUY THIS GAME!!! AGAIN - ♥♥♥♥ YOU PETER! :)			",43,10,1,1,9,0,3

								I bought this game almost immediately when it released on to Steam.  Like many others, I have fond memories of Populous, also made by Peter Molyneux.  The promised multiplayer was a major draw for me, as I thought the idea of an MMO-ish Populous game sounded amazing.  However, it seems the multiplayer will never happen, and the content of the game is lacking even to it's spiritual predecessor from 1989.  This interview says it all:  http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/13/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter/ ",230,92,8,58,40,5,53

This game has you dig up dirt for what?CHESSTSCool you can ""spread your influence"" but for what its not like your going to find another actually living beathing person in your home base. Dont even start on the multiplayer (there isn't) to subsitute that of course we have to add some werid AI thats a 13 year-old girl with her family. Im not joking they write 100 percent correct grammer. I left in the middle of a conversation with the ""person"" typed one letter and she responded. AWFUL not like your going to ""settle in new lands"" be awesome if you could but thats highly unlikey. Why? because they have you diging up for CHESSTS (which take FOREVER) and you can hardly ever find enough( sirously im stuck) Awful 22cans. Just awful.			",31,10,0,14,7,0,2

								I love god games and I have loved Peter Molyneux games - Black & White and Fable in particular. I was very excited when I saw a gameplay video on gamespot with Molyneux playing the game on ipad; looked great and fun.This beta is very poor at the moment - it lacks any gameplay element apart from land flattening by clicking; its like a scaled back version of populous with lots of mouse clicking and prettier graphics.As you expand your village and field of influence you soon realise that 1. you have to create a flat featureless landscape for villagers to build houses on and 2. the villages are empty of life unless you click the houses for the villagers to come out which they do to build more houses then they wander back in to their houses or sit around for a bit and die. Oh and theres no way to make them go in a house so you just wait for them to die. Though there's no discernable effect for you if they do die.Weirdly for a god sim, in order to advance you collect cards from chests which act as your resources, when you get enough cards required your civilisation advances. Its a mechanic which removes your villagers from interacting with the land and environment - empty flatness is the result.Ever played a dying MMO with formerly bustling areas empty of activity? Godus quickly feels devoid of life and depressing to play.My fault for not waiting for reviews, but I trusted what the trailers seemed to offer; leave alone and play something with a soul and a less painful UI mechanic. I wish I could get a refund as I feel tricked into paying £15 - I'd gladly put this £15 as an extra thank you to the makers of a good indie game Starbound/Faster Than Light/Fez come to mind.Did I say empty and flat enough? Oh I said it again.			",34,27,0,15,21,0,6

								Sadly, it is time to write my very first negative review. And before someone chastises me for my 3.5 game hours on steam, please note that this does not include my offline gaming time while I am travelling, cause this is the best time to wait and gather belief without being connected to steam. Sounds sad, I know.I was one of the first to back this game on steam, because I was absolutely enamoured by the idea of painting the world to your desires, helping your little citizens to grow, explore and expand. The idea for the game is great, but the development is not. And to add insult to injury, the devs actually noted in the initial release that the game is like 45 or 49% ready. This got me thinking optimistically - good, so it will be finished soon. 15 months later, the game hasn't progressed decently enough to merit a purchase.Stay away from it like it is a forest fire till they actually finish it. After that it may well be a decent experience. I know I had fun with it. ",197,65,0,53,50,0,48

From what I can understand it's not changed much from a pay2play mobile game tapfest anyway.Long time Peter Molyneux fan, but I'm feeling pretty goddam decieved as this was sold as a game that would follow the traditions and gameplay of his early classics like populous and black and white.Literally all they had to do was remake populous and that would of been enough to keep me (and everyone else) happy. Easily the most dissapointing thing i've ever invested in on early access/kickstarter and I invested in double fines space base df-9 so thats saying something. ",229,47,8,25,44,1,51

								Had so much potential but it's like a free mobile game that I had to pay for. Once you've gained and spent all your faith within that given moment you have to wait to generate more. That is my only issue for the game but it is a big enough issue for me to not want to play more. EDIT: I've also only just realised it is STILL in early access. It is quite ironic that the acronym is EA because EA games are generally a let down.			",127,5,3,7,7,0,12

								Godus: 13 months laterGodus is a LOT better than it was when it was first made available on Steam, but it still has a long way to go, and I'm not sure it's going to survive the trip.I will not expound on the soul-crushing gameplay issues that were rampant in version 1.x.x of the game, as many of them have been fixed. The issue now seems to be one of...waiting.I have never seen a game that requires quite this much waiting. You will not notice it so much in the first 10 to 20 minutes of play, but as the hours go on, you will find yourself collecting your belief, sacrificing your followers for gems, sending out builders to contruct new buildings, sculpting a tiny piece of your land, then realizing you have 45-60 minutes (!!!) to wait until you can do anything else, because you need to wait for more followers to spawn, more belief to generate, and for those buildings to finish contruction. Once, the game told me I would have to wait over A DAY for another farmer to spawn. In the developer commentary, they say that you should use this time to go ""treasure hunting"" or on voyages, but there is only one available (very short) voyage right now, and treasure hunting for stickers takes all of 5 minutes...if you have enough Belief to move the land around looking, and if you don't, you have to come back in a couple hours so it can generate.Compound that with the fact that ore takes five real-time hours to mine, wheat takes one real-time hour to farm, and some buildings take upwards of 20 minutes to contruct, and that is AFTER the speed-build card has been unlocked. I wonder if by the time we reach the space age, the shuttle will take 10 real-time years to build! When it comes to belief, the larger buildings only generate it once every several hours. The smaller buildings make it faster, but they make so little that you end up waiting just as long for it to generate several times so you have enough to actually sculpt something. I often found myself doing everything I could, minimizing the game, then doing something else for an hour or two, just to re-open the game, do my ""chores"", and minimize it again. If the ridiculous wait times were removed, I think Godus would be a lot more fun, but it would still be a very shallow game. It feels skinner box-ish, and there is a real lack of any need for strategic thought. It doesn't really matter where or how you build your settlements, where those wheat fields or mines go, or just how often you sacrifice followers, just as long as you have enough belief to place a swamp in the Astari camp so they all drown when they try to party. Godus as it stands now is little more than a web-browser game that was obviously designed with a pay-to-not-wait mechanic in mind, not unlike Farmville. It's playable in its current state, but only for 15 minute windows among hours or days of waiting.			",54,10,0,7,27,0,16

								Update #2 Review:The game is currently bugged out with the new update from what I've played. With this new update, the tutorial has been bugged, asking me to ""fill in the circle of land"" even though the screen showed nothing but blue water. Unfortunately, I couldn't continue the tutorial since I couldn't even see what was going on. I will wait come back to this later to revise my review.Update #1 Review:When I purchased this, I thought it would be something remeniscent of SimCity or a game like that where you have control over a majority of actions.That was far from the truth. The only things you do in this game are clicking on trees, rocks, and flags. If you want, you can click on the landscape to change it(albeit very limited in what you can change requiring you to dig from the outside to the inside which is problematic when you find a card chest hidden in the middle of a continent about 5 layers into the ground at some point) but in the wider scope of things, it isn't required. It's still optimized as a mobile game, making everything as simple as possible so that people can play without effort.If you have money and time to spare for this game, go right on ahead. Otherwise, I'd recommend waiting until more options are put into the game if ever. Really, all you do is make sure there's land available and it automatically builds for you. I regret my purchase which I could've used for another game.EDIT: This is a review for the current Early Access game. As the game changes with updates, I will be changing my review to better reflect the game at all times.			",1361,369,57,182,187,15,236

								OK so after playing the game for 85hrs I'm ready to give my first review on steam.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. (If you only have to spend a couple dollars or pounds to buy it then yes its worth wasting a couple days playing)I feel like I'm being abused by the developers of this game.Constant swapping between worlds to send hundreds of followers to the pit of doom just to move the game forward at a more reasonable pace.I saw the kickstarter for this and got really excited so when the opportunity came along to buy it for a couple pound I jumped in.Now let me be clear this is a mobile game to make money out of muppets, this is not a PC game and should not be marketed as such.The game drags along at an agonising pace because the devs have slowed it down to a crawl to make money from mobile users.You will spend hours killing followers to get gems to then buy stuff to speed it along.You will spend hours roaming the map collecting resourses with your mouse, because auto collection of resources costs gems (and ore and wheat auto collection is not available to me after 85 hrs of play)I'm stopping playing this as of today and I may check back in a year or so to see if you have sorted out the steam version.That being said the game has a lot of potential but the devs have to come to the conclusion that PC gamers are not mobile gamers.

								don't make mistake of investing in unfinished junk.  There's only one game mode, and the main aspect of ""sculpting"" costs ""belief"".  The devs have every attention of it playing like clash of clans, where you have to log in several times a day to run your operations.  In all honestly, this a mobile bleedcash game that they tried to convert to pc, and doesn't function.another steam early access game that's a flop.  Voyages are supposed to be a main feature of the game, but don't work after the first voyage.  A simple trip to the steam forums or google reveals the devs are ignoring it, and if you report a ticket you'll just get chewed out for it.			",213,26,3,15,23,2,24

								When I was young games like Dungeon keeper and B&W started my pc gaming career, heck I even liked Fable dispite most of the claims Peter Molyneux not paning out. Chalk it up to a reverse bionic man, they just didn't have the tech. It was on that track record that I gave Godus an extra bit of patience. The carrot on the stick that kept me coming back were the updates about how this new team that was left to work on this game after Peter moved on to other things. But those quickly turned into vague, nothing posts about nothing that did nothing to convince me that things were on the path to the better. In the end, I would love to one day rewrite this review into a postive one about how a game that everyone assumed had died and was forgotten got a fabled miraculous combat patch update and this sceen saver simulator finally becomes something more then a title in my library I hope to one day trade to some innocent gamer who knows nothing about it. Anyways, if you see this game on sale I would say avoid it.

								It used to be a little fun, but it never quite did it for me. The controls are wonky and it feels like I'm playing a bad board game. It's a neat idea, just exectued very poorly. Evidently a mobile game port as others have said. DON'T DO IT! DON'T BUY IT! You know what you should go buy instead for 20 dollars? Go buy that one movie you really liked that you never got around to buying. Take your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/mom/dad out for a cheap dinner. Go see a movie with a friend and get popcorn. Go buy 5 king sized candy bars. Those are all WAY better experiences than this. I feel like the other negative reviews state very well what's wrong with this game. I don't want to type it. There's a lot.			",48,4,4,4,25,3,8

								It looks like this game was put on steam simply to garner more money and to help them test it for it's release on mobile devices. It's entire premise is you need to wait an hour for ""belief"" to accumulate so you can play - and on the mobile versions you can spend real world money to get belief!Unfortunately this obvious and wide spread mechanic for in app mobile purchases doesn't translate to the PC. They may even in the benevolence remove the shop from the game... but the game is still utterly unplayable, requiring you to wait for hourse to improve your village... with no end point appart from making things more expensive and requiiring more belief. Don't support these developers.			",53,26,1,30,45,0,67

								Don't bother spending a dime on this game unless in a few months(?) you see actually gameplay footage of all announced features in the game. I don't recommend this for anyone in it's current state, which is very likely to be very similar to it's final stage, which is far from anything it claims and previously claimed it would be. Uninteresting, bare boned, unifinished product of a company owner who always bites more than he can chew. Do some small research in the Steam Forums for this game before considering throwing your hard earned money at this game, because it's legitimately awful at it's current state, I question why Steam still has this in their store.

								This is an ""iterative review,"" reflecting nearly a year of interaction with 22Cans and attempts at playing Godus: Godus is boring; 22Cans has mislead its customers; Do Not Waste Your Time or Money. Continuing to sell Godus in Early Access, Valve hurts the Steam brand.<edited to reflect The Roadmap>Godus is a free-to-play mobile game that may -- emphasis on the uncertainty -- someday become a casual PC game that is optimized for tablets.As of this review (June 2014), 22Cans has ignored customer and backer feedback for 1.5 years, or nearly nine months longer than they originally expected development to take. I am sure that ~some~ members of the community are happy with Godus. But the majority of feedback on Steam's forums, the vast majority of the reviews on this site, and everything I have heard about the ""backer forums"" strongly indicates that people thing Godus is going in a bad direction, and in a direction antithetical to the original intent the regenesis of the godgame.PM has said that the primary goal of a game designer is to make money. One would have thought that the primary goal of a game designer who was crowdfunded would be to deliver the game that people thought they were funding (or to fail in the attempt.)Over time, the game has incorporated more free to play (f2p) elements, such as gems, and stickers, and wait timers, things that break a person's progression with the game and fundamentally destroy any chance of immersion. After each update, the community gave constructive feedback, suggested different mechanics that would improve our experience, and attempted to engage 22Cans in the promised ""participation in game design."" 22Cans would go silent for weeks or months at a time, and then make changes like ""click and swipe"" instead of ""clicking"" (when the fundamental concern was that this farmville-type mechanic was fundamentally broken and that a Player Deity should not have to concern itself with swiping and that it made no sense in-game.)22Cans has likely made these decisions at the behest of it's mobile publisher DeNA. A publisher, mind you, that they promised not to take on when they pitched their kickstarter.With the release of the Roadmap, 22Cans has confirmed that a) they will continue deceiving customers (they are using a SDK that builds software for multiple platforms concurrently, and there is no difference between the mobile game and the PC game beyond the length of timers and the presence of a gem shop to speed up said timers) b) they have no interest in delivering a game that is not casual in nature, and c) 22Cans will continue to ignore the feedback of the community that backed their vision and funded their company.For the past several months, I have enjoyed interacting with other members of the Godus forums as we tried desperately to get 22Cans to deliver the game that they had promised. The Roadmap proves that our attempts were in vain. Don't give Peter more money to make a free to play game.</edit><edited to reflect 2.01 & GDC comments>Godus is a F2P mobile ""zen-like"" game. Think ""Sim-Bulldozer"" with a lovely ambient soundtrack and you will get a good sense of what to expect. Using a mouse or touchpad to interact with the game may lead to a repetitive stress injury and should be avoided at all costs.The good: the artwork & the audio (both highly subjective)The bad: gameplay mechanics (hour long timers to complete actions, collection of ""stickers"" that break immersion, etc.); strategy (gameplay is functionally on rails, i.e. there is one ""correct"" way to play the game); feedback from devs (new community manager is doing a good job, but in his GDC talk, P.M. strongly suggested that indie developers should ignore community EVEN WHEN they have explicitly promised community feedback will guide game development)</edit>Godus is not yet what I'd expect for a PC god game. As of 1.4, it plays like a clicking-oriented mobile game where one shapes the land and creates space for automated followers to build structures. The structures are uniform across the first two ages (all that has been released): housing in age one, farms in age 2.The real tragedy of the game is that it was advertised as the successor to Black & White and Populous. These earlier games forced the player to choose between competing goals which would differentiate the play moving forward. B&W did a particularly good job incorporating moral alignment into all aspects of the game. Godus, on the other hand, simply requires the player to click - a lot - and create flat land for development.On a positive note, the landscape (pre-farm) is pretty and I find the sound appealing. I will revisit this review once an update causes me to change my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I didn't think that a game by Peter Molyneux could possibly deserve the poor reviews, so when Humble had the game on sale, I bought it to see for myself.How wrong I was.There are so many reviews summing up the poor aspects of the game, but overall - for me - the one thing that sticks out most is the fact that the game was unceremoniously dumped onto the PC market in its mobile app form. With the exception of buying items for real world money, there appears to be no difference between the two versions of the game - no thought has been given to the difference of the platforms or the gamers.Certainly, the game is early access, and who knows, may actually improve if pigs start flying. There are many early access games that are less developed (apparently Godus is currently 51% complete), cheaper and still far superior than this.For the person who brought us Populous, Fable and Black & White, this is not a game to be proud of.Certainly not worth the £14.99 current cost and not even worth the £4.89 I paid.

								Generally, I support Alpha games/games in development. And with fond memories of Populous and Black & White I had no problem throwing some money to Peter Molyneux to finish his god-game. Now I find out he's not going to finish it. The game, per it's menu, is 53% complete and he's moved on to his next project. I think it's a sin that it's still up for sale and it certainly doesn't help support indie game development.The ""game"" as it stands is incredibly tedious and repetitive and, by Molyneux's own admission, devoid of a plot line or story.Just walk away from this one.

								An abandonned game by Peter M. 22cans doesn't think they can meet any of the promises and have pretty much abandonned the PC port for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile game. To be fair, I should have noticed that when they first released the game. Everything was on timers from day one which should have been an obvious warning sign since PC games do not have farmville timers (thank God!). PLEASE REMOVE THIS TRAVESTY FROM STEAM! Just looking at it is an insult to the people who got ripped off from the Kickstarter and Early release.TL:DR Creator abandonned the game, devs don't care, mobile game money grab from the beginning DON'T BUY.

								This game used to show promise. That was before the indroduction to gems. The gem system, like many mobile games, basically means, you can wait a long time for an action to be completed, or you can spend gems. In these mobile games, gems are usually scarce. Most of the time, you can buy them through an in app purchase. This is an infuriating system. There isn't an option of buying gems in Godus on pc though. The only option is to earn them, which is difficult, or, wait. I ♥♥♥♥ing paid $20 dollars for this game. I want my money's worth.			",133,22,0,29,18,1,11

								I VERY rarely write a negative review. It takes an extreme level of stupidity or lack of care to make me do so. EA is well known for this, as well as Ubisoft lately. I, yet again, need to criticize this game and the developers. I LOVED Black and White, 1 and 2. Played them a lot... Suffice it to say, too much. This game will never compare. In their latest review, they are essentially throwing out cop outs as to why they ""cant do things right"" as they said. The admission was that the game was written without certain things in mind. Like what? Being usable? Have a few soldiers? Players actually wanting a game that works for more than a few hours without game breaking crashes?This has been a major failure, and despite some great hope I had in the beginning, this piece of crap needs to EITHER die or be rewritten from scratch. No more ""fixes"" at this point. YOu can only shine♥♥♥♥♥♥so much.

								With over 60 hours played... I cannot reccomend this game.  It has a lot of gating that prevents progression.  You could say this is a form of extending content... like a mini-game that requires a level of random luck to the point that a 5 minute mini game is 5 hours of frustration: aka not a good thing.  Collecting stickers is a lot less about fun and more about ""I need these... and I need way more of these the longer I play.""  Voyages are a crutch at best.  None of them are as fun as conflicts/battles of an earlier build were.For being an all powerful diety it takes forever to do anything, especially shape land.  The limits and costs on land shaping are a barrier even late in the game.  It makes you feel less all powerful nad more like someone forced to do tedious tasks over and over for the sake of people that don't often seem too thankful and already need you to tell them to do anything for them to actually do anything.Best played in short stints if you do buy.

								This game had so much promise ""reinvention of the god game"" etc etc. As a initial backer of the game on kickstarter and played many hours of the early access to give feedback and relish in the devleopment process - I have been just terribly let down by Peter and his team at 22Cans. While he has reinvented the god game alright, he has done so with free to play mechanics that involve terrible terrible timers and obsticals that make the game NOT FUN. I sat througout early access giving the team the benefit ofthe doubt as the kickstarter community complained about the obvious free to play leanings and as everyone was ignored by 22Cans. They're doing what they want - which clearly is nothing like any of the fans who wanted a modern Populous, Powermonger, Black & White etc.  If this is you, don't waste your time with this game. If you like free to play mobile games,  pick this up for free on an iPad - but be warned of the bugs there.A very dissapointed ex-fan of Peter.			",86,166,0,19,21,0,19

								I can't really recommend this game. I supported this during the KS and played it through a number of the iterations. I've sunk over 30 hours into the game so far, so it's not like I didn't try to like it. Currently this game is more like Settlers or similar games to Settlers. It's not a Populous game, it's just your basic, grind-fest god game. Some of the earlier iterations were really great and the game looked very promising but the devs changed the game greatly and now it's no longer a fun and enjoyable game. It's like everytime you get through a roadblock, there's another 3 roadblocks created. The game has forced paths and feels very limited and linear in so far as progression is concerned.I simply can't recommend this game in its current form and the way the development has been going lately, I don't see that changing any time soon.

								Quite boring.Also the game concept feels like it is preparing for later conversion to free2play.The sticker system to unlock new technologie is confusing and frustrating.Looking at the time things take to finish, it feels like a browser game.Wait 30 minutes to get 5 sailers for the mini-game.Wait 8 minutes to build the land expansion.Wait 15 minutes to respawn sacrificed settlers.It just feels... wrong.

								Excruciatingly slow and boring. After the complete revamp it's much less obtuse and a little less full of itself, but it's still taking a pace that *might* work for a microtransaction-driven short-play-session game; on a PC where I'm looking to play something for half an hour or an hour I find myself sitting reading a book for 5 to 10 minutes at a time while waiting for the game to make progress by itself. There are a few things to click then, before I go back to my book.Very disappointed to have backed.			",76,55,0,56,24,0,28

								As I write this, the game has been taken back to the drawing board for a redesign due to the backlash from the community at the direction the game has gone. So this review may not reflect the finished product but reflects Ver 1.3.1The game in it's current state is a click fest of a tablet game that has no depth or fun and not worthy of investment until a product is put forward that reflects the game as originally promised on kickstarter. The graphics are pleasant and has a familiar feel of previous titles from Peter Molyneux, but falls short on imagination and innovation with a population of hermits with no free will or character. If you accidentally click on one of the houses and a follower escapes captivity as I like to call it, they will eventually die if there is no shrine or building to work on, they will not re-house themselves and nor can you do that for them. A couple of hours in to this game, you come to care very little about their peril and and when you hear the famous Wilheim scream from the movies, you just shrug and carry on with your dragging and clicking.I feel this game has taken a lot from the Curiosity experiment which was a tablet and smartphone app to see how people work together tapping away at a cube for an end result. I can't imagine anything more unfulfilling than clicking away at a screen with no strategy involved or end in sight for that matter. It just keeps going and going.For those of use who have already bought in to the beta (and still care) we do hope to have an update which turns this around and gives us the God like feeling we have been hoping for and to have miracles that aren't just land sculpting and clicking houses. For those interested in the game, wait for the finished product or just read up on peoples feedback to each update on the forums.At this stage, I really can't recommend this game even if someone has the spare cash and curiosity.

								Buy it on discount and it will still be too much.It seemed like a winner in the early stages of the game, and I was so excited to see it develop. It's an excellent time waster but what you get for the time invested is beyond anti-climactic. Waiting to get a tiny piece of land uncovered for 15 hours instead of them just creating new worlds... After the tutorial island you come to Weyworld. No instruction in how to use the severely underpowered defence archers, so you get wiped. Hardly any place to plant fields so expanding is soooo slow. And then when Weyworld finally is finished.. there is nothing. I sunk 170 hours into this, mostly in the background of films, since the game has to be open to unlock areas. Up to you to buy it, but recommend it? No, can't do that.			",27,35,0,20,38,1,31

Another chapter to add to the ""things Peter Molyneux promised but didn't deliver on"" book that's been growing over the years.When I first saw Godus, I had a lot of hope. It seemed like a really cool concept that had a decent amount of progress being made on it. Well, that is all it was: a cool concept.The game is painfully boring, and feels like something that isn't even suitable as a half-a**ed free to play mobile game let alone worth $20. I guess that is unless you enjoy spam clicking and watching nothing happen. It's a crime to even call this a ""God game"".The one saving grace I found to the game was modifying the landscapes. It was fun to make mountains out of the terrain and all that for a whole fifteen minutes before I realized there wasn't much else to the game.Not a big fan of being lied to, but after the promises he's made on previous games (*cough* Fable *cough*) I shouldn't be surprised. I'm all for supporting Kickstarter/Early Access games (I've bought quite a few), but not this. Save yourself the money and buy a game that isn't a complete scam. This is the prime example of Early Access backfiring.I'll leave you with this: even Spacebase DF-9 makes Godus look like a complete rip off. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								F2P Mobile Cow clicker. Havent been updated in 4 months, and no feedback from developers. Just check out its steam forum, its a big dissapointment.Bryan Henderson the 21-year-old chap who won 22 Cans' much publicized Curiosity mobile game challenge, which the company's founder Peter Molyneux promised would feature a ""life-changing"" prize. Henderson was told he would be named ""God of Gods"" within 22 Cans' strategy game Godus' multiplayer world. This grand title would come with a royalty check from the game's revenues, starting from the beginning of his reign.In the months since then, Henderson has received nothing. Godus' multiplayer component has not even been implemented. The game, which raised $750,000 on Kickstarter, has failed to meet the targets its backers were promised.22 Cans' forums and Kickstarter page shows hundreds of messages from fans demanding refunds. Why? Because they paid for something and it hasn't been delivered. Because Molyneux has clearly handed off the project to a reduced internal team, while he looks at something new.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I cannot say it better than some of the other reviews: While in theory this could have been great, it has turned into a farmville type game. Honestly, dont waste your money. When it first hit EA, it showed ALOT of promise, even a little story mode that acted as sort of a versus mode (assumed, by me, to be precursor to online quick battles) . Now....well now we remember why old Moly has his reputation.One thing that i do like, however, is the graphic style: Cartoony fun and clean. But seriously, dont buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Worth 15 bucks...  but barely...(as long as they stop trying to add paywalls and microtransactions like they tried to weasel in at one point... This isn't worth microtransactions, Peter thinks his game has more value than what reality dictates)....  For how long Godus has been developed, it seems VERY unfinished.... There is a LOT missing in order to call it a game... I think Peter bit off more than he is capable of swallowing... No rival AI worth a damn.... It's one sided... It gets old and boring fast without an adequate threat.... Populous was awesome and well designed... This could be like that game, but it's just not at the moment... Random raiding parties to fend off with a couple feeble god powers (more annoying than anything)... The archers (the only other defense) are worthless... There is no enemy rival God trying to raise, protect, and defend his own tribe(s)... The limited sculpting drag length gets annoying and tedious fast... I honestly hate having to manipulate land at all... It would be nice if buildings didn't need totally flat land to build on... Hillside building would be cool... Build Build Build for no other reason but to get bigger and Build some more... I'm not ready to absolutely hate it, but if it doesn't go more in the populous direction with rival enemy AI, then this is just going to be garbageThere is beggining structure for a potentially awesome God Game here, but from what I've read, this company seems barely holding its head above water... i wouldn't evpect this thing resulting in anything great in the endJUST MAKE A REALLY GREAT POPULOUS!!!!... Make an exact game as the original Populous with modern graphics and a little more added, like multi player, AND IT WOULD ROCK!!!.... Stop trying to get fancy and doing it as horribly as possible!!!!

								New review since I can now play the game, after about a month of having it constantly crash on me.This game is not good. It tries to be too many things at once: a modern version of Populous, a game that is playable both on mobile and on PC, and a challenging yet easy game.It succeeds at nothing. The game is too hand holding at first, and becomes incredibly obtuse later. It is riddled with remains of mobile tropes like 'gems' which have a half-arsed implementation on PC: you get them for 'free', but they are both needed and drop too little to be of actual use.Only get his on a deep sale like it recently had (I picked it up for €4), at least until the developers manage to make it better.

								To whom it may concern,This letter is regardind a ""game"" called Godus, sold on Steam. It's developer, Peter Molyneux, has misrepresented Godus. He lied about this ""game"" and it's content. Godus is nothing more than an app, that costs $20 on Steam. An app that is available on mobile for free. This app was developed with the money Peter Molyneux collected from kickstarters and Steam Early Access sales, all the while making false promises about what he would deliver.For Steam, I urge you to give refunds to any person who has bought into this scam called Godus. As none of the information on the store page says this so called game is availavle for free on mobile. Also, the advertising on the store page is false. Labeling Godus a God themed game is akin to labeling Farmville a Farming Simulator 2013. Just look at the player reviews posted on Steam, over 99% are negative. People had gone so far as to give this game a ""thumbs up"" and post a sarcastic review to highlight how ludicrous this app is and their dismay of realizing they were lied to.I don't blame Steam for this. However, please remember how you treated the community, your customers, when WarZ and Legends of Pegasus turned out to be disastrous games. Neither delivered gameplay as advertised. Steam has pulled those games from it's store and gave out refunds to their customers. I ask Steam to do the same with Godus. Godus does not belong on Steam store as it's a free to download mobile app, sold on Steam for $20. That is a disgrace.This is a Farmville type game, on PC. The development of this game is funded by PC version sales, mobile version has been released as a free to play game. It's a scam.This game is a sham. Google ""Peter Molyneux lies"" (developer) and read about all the times he had scammed the gaming community in the past.Added 02-16-14Also, the developers and forum admins plain out lied to the community. There used to be a ""There is no shop"" stickied thread on Godus forum. The thread quoted a promise by Peter Molyneux (owner, developer), not to have an in game shop. Forum moderator banned anyone who said otherwise or those who told of Peter Molyneux's history of lying to the public. They also banned anyone that pointed out all the game mechanics, indicating there would be a shop.Now that thread ""There is no shop"" has been deleted, and the shop for in game purchases has been announced by Peter Molyneux. Once again, going back on his word. He lied to the public, those who bought this ""game"" and the kickstarters.So don't believe a word of advertisement on the store page. Do a search of Peter Molyneux on google and see what comes up. An epitomy of a con artist.Look at the following Godus reviews for yourselfGamefaqs http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/719104-godusIGN http://www.ign.com/games/godus/pc-148566PC Gamer http://www.pcgamer.com/game/godu/Neoseeker http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/PC/godus/Giantbomb http://www.giantbomb.com/godus/3030-40919/N4G http://n4g.com/channel/godusGametrailers http://www.gametrailers.com/games/4r57fe/godusSupercheats http://www.supercheats.com/pc/godus.htmGameinformer http://www.gameinformer.com/games/godus/b/pc/default.aspxGamespot http://www.gamespot.com/godus/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought this game not long after its Alpha release, and loved it at the time. Understanding that it was in Alpha and didn't have much to offer, I took it for what it was going to be and was very excited. I got a few enjoyable hours of play out of it until I beat just about everything they had to offer. Then this game started to lose my favor- The updates that deleted my progress (multiple times) were the first, then the unbearable glitches that were worse than in the original testing phase. The game froze without warning and very frequently. Then finally, the biggest slap in the face to date- they released a fully functional FREE Ipad version, while the people patiently awaiting a complete PC release were left wondering why they paid for a broken game. Also, the new Godus Wars release came out, free to Godus owners- which would have been nice if the original game was complete. Did I mention the newest update doesn't even launch the game anymore? Literally unplayable.TL;DR, I bought this game when I started college in early release. I have completed an entire college education in the time it has taken this studio to get absolutely nowhere, and release other microtransaction titles in the meanwhile.			",43,1,0,1,12,0,2

								This is the game that made me very skeptical of Early Access titles.  Over a year after this has launched in Early Access on Steam, and the game is still a mess.It is actually worse than it was 6 months ago.The latest changes make it painfully obvious that they PC version of the game is an afterthought to the mobile version.  From what it looks like, the mobile version is going to be yet another ""Gem Shop F2P Special"".  These f2p concepts have infested the PC version of the title in the mest egregious ways.* Gem shop in the PC version?  Check.  So, you can't buy gems, but the harvesting them is grindy, boring, and time consuming.* Play to wait model?  Check.  You get to play for a little while, take a break, and come back to harvest your ""resources"".  Think Clash of Clans.Could this have been fun?  Yes.  Could it still be?  Yes.  Do I believe in 22 Cans to make this work?  Not a bit.They want to cash in, that is all.			",269,58,1,74,41,0,74

								Every once and awhile I like to come back to this game to try and see if I can enjoy my self. I can't, this is one of the slowest boring games I ever played. It even feels lacking for a god game. I'm a GOD I should be able to do more but instead its an extremely slow game that you gotta pay for on Steam but is free on tablet devices. I know I can unlock more powers and skills or what ever to do more like better benefit my people or torture them but It's so slow, its like those tablet games where you build something then it makes you wait an hour. This is the only god game I ever played but I can safely say from seeing what other games like Black and White are, this is one of the worse god games out there. Don't bother buying this, if you to try it get it on a tablet like an iPad or something its free on the app store.			",175,16,9,38,29,0,30

								The game is about landing on an island, levelling out and smashing houses together to form cities. but there is something mildly therapeutic about spend hours just making an area the same level. if u look at a 'successful' island. there is no character, no flow. i dont think the creators had an endgame in mind.Original:I bought this game expecting good things from Peter Molyneux, but there really isn’t any progress here. I know I should have learned my lessons but this thing has been in beta for 2 years, and there really isn’t any progress. Actually it’s more like digress:They have taken out key features which made this feel like a god game.Now it just seems like a glorified Mobile game (actually I think they stretched their wings so far as to make a mobile version, which requires an additional cost)Premise: flatten out land and remove trees so little people can build outs which u click on for exp, while avoiding infinite waves of bad guys trying to take your little people.I'd like to push these guys to get out of early access but there is not point. After 2 years, they got their money. And they're laughingUpdate: saw on this page ""none of your friends play godus: tell them why they should""lol... they shouldn't			",68,9,0,6,9,0,8

								It's got an awesome design, visually speaking. It's very artsy — At least to me. I like the look. Sure it's not the latest & greatest graphically, but it's different, it's fun, and it's artistic. It feel appropriate for the type of game and the in game setting.But the game is boring. Not because it's slow but because it's overly repetative. Morph the land to build more and to earn more followers and then expand more, oh look a piece of treasure, now expand more land... inch by inch I might add. I'ts mind numbing, it's boring, it's slow.I don't honesly like leaving a bad review or a negative rating, let alone on a game that is still in Early Access, but it's just not there for me.

								Why? Why would you attempt to poorly remake Populace in a mobile game format with a weird, archain waiting system?  The whole sticker and card thing is meant for the mobile games 'cuz the power isn't there for anything better. The tarrain movement, while a neat idea, is imprecise and and wonky. /rantYou guys don't have the right to say that as an in-dev game it will have iteration problems, ya'll are a bunch of professionals who've been in the industry long enough to know that these kind of problems make or brake games. There are far more problems with the game then the tings I have said, but those were my biggest gripes, and the inaccurate and wild tarrain movement system made most of those mission to grab more stupid stickers impossbile when the cursor selects the wrong layer, and/or makes the piece change its shape so dramatically that it will unceremoniously dump several followers into the water./endrant			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Spent $20 on a game made by a spurious dev with a history of screwing players over only to learn that Peter Molyneux made false promises on Kickstarter to get this ball rolling. More than a year past the guaranteed release date and no sign of completion of the game in the near future. If, on the off chance, that this game is somehow completed within the next 6 months, it will not be the game that I had spent my $20 on. To top it all off, what do we as the gaming community receive from the devs? ""Oops, sorry, we sure ♥♥♥♥ed that up, didn't we? We'll make sure we don't make the same mistakes in our next kickstarter project! Speaking of, please invest in our next kickstarter project. Did we mention we've got a new project on kickstarter?""Don't spend your money on this. The game is moderately enjoyable for 10-15 minutes at a time, but the lack of compelling gameplay mechanics, story elements, or anything at all to do with being a religious deity seriously limits the desire to continue playing this game. The devs should have made this a mobile game only, but how would they extort steam users into paying for it then?			",100,18,3,17,28,0,22

								Straight up unplayable. You manage to build a hut and nothing more. Funny thing is that I bought the game for 4 dollars on the humble bundle xmass sale. And I feel I should have bought something else. Maybe a Mariah Carrey CD. I hate her music and I think that this would be more useful (and fun) than this game. There isn't even an user interface. Game seems to be gorgeous . I'd rather just look at the pretty pictures from the preview here on steam. Thank god I didn't bought this thing on steam. I just saved myself a few dollars. But I could have bought a CD, put it inside my microwave ad watch the pretty sparkles. It would be more fun (and interesting, entertaining and far less frustrating) than playing this game. Stay away.EDIT. This game is actually free on the iTunes store. Stay away, save your money, buy something that is not this game.			",81,31,3,5,15,0,8

								22cans announced the other day that they were stopping work on Godus and RPS went to interview Peter Molyneux. Hard-hitting journalists that they are, RPS decided to open the interview by implying that Pete was a ""pathological liar"". I don't usually read RPS, but a link to that article popped up in my twitter feed that particular morning and being that I was stuck in the middle of a protracted bowel movement, I suffered through it. In retrospect, the article wasn't particularly fair - focusing on Pete's failures and much-maligned promises, while ignoring everything else - but at the time I was very much on board with the sentiment. Having purchased Godus shortly after it's Steam release, I was shocked at the lack of content in the game. I had played a couple of hours and kept waiting for the game to be fun, but that fun never materialized. I got bored with the game very quickly, and never thought about it again until that morning last week where I was stuck on the toilet, reading an article about Peter Molyneux and wondering in the back of my mind if I should see a gastroenterologist. Godus is barely a game. Peter Molyneux, for all his successes, may very well have left his best days behind him as a studio lead. Don't buy this. Don't buy anything Pete has touched.FYI: A ""normal"" amount of blood to pass with your stools is NONE, so please call a doctor if you're pooping blood. True, it could just be hemorrhoids, but it could also be colon cancer and if you're over the age of 30, you need to start worring about that stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I used to have faith in Peter Molyneux. I know that seems like a joke nowadays, but it's true. I thought Fable the first was a charming game, despite it not living up to Molyneux's claims, and Fable 2 was fine. Black and White was a genre staple of god games, and Dungeon Keeper remains a fantastic game.I saw Peter Molyneux was returning to god games and was thrilled. A return to form after the massive disappointment which was Fable 3.I was wrong to believe him. I was wrong to have faith in him. I was wrong to trust anything Peter Molyneux says or does. Godus is not half of what he said it would be. It is not even a third, and it shows no signs of further development beyond the money-grabbing farce that is the cash-store-fueled combat game they put out instead of adding real combat to this game.I keep calling it a game, and I now feel perhaps that is too kind to it.Peter Molyneux is a liar and a fraud, and 22cans is a development studio of thieves and cronies. I can only hope the studio shuts down and Molyneux never releases another game, instead retiring to obscurity as he should have done instead of sullying himself with this shameful display.I award this game no points, and may God have mercy on its soul.

								I bought into this game quite some time ago, when it was still in early development.My decision was based on the idea of an update to the God-Game genre, I still fondly recall experimenting with the original Black & White when I was much younger - and I also quite enjoyed the sequel.At first glance I thought to myself ""uhhh, this looks like it might suck""(but, given that it was so early and there was practically no game there, thought I'd come back later)I keep checking in every few months, and even now (2014 is about to turn into 2015 thisevening), all I really have is a sense of vague disappointment and worry that the whole exercise is a waste of time.  I hope each time I check for some evolutionary change (heh, evolution in a God game)...... but each time I check, it just looks and feels .. lame.Sorry, a good piece of feedback should somehow quantify - and it's hard to sum it up.  Graphically and game-play wise, it just seems like a heavily scripted made-for-mobile experience.A God Game should give you a pale shadow of an impression of how it would feel to be an ultimate being.  People worship you, you protect/punish them, you stun them with the miraculous, you ... etc etcThis game, you just feel like some kind of disembodied structural world janitor.Sorry, every time I've booted up I've found it boring - and the card and progression concept to be actively painful.

								After giving this game almost an entire year of time to change my mind, I'm finally writing a review.Around last Christmas time I found this game, and I looked into it, and read about what it was supposed to be like. Considering that I'm a huge fan of Minecraft, this seemed like a really wonderful game that would offer similar mechanics and a beautiful art style. It also boasted that it wasn't yet complete, and that tons of other features would be added.Throughout my time playing Godus, i quickly realized that it wasn't what was promised. There are many, many things that are disappointing, frustrating, and down right infuriating. The worst part is that when I redownloaded it recently, I expected that some of these basic things would be improved upon. They haven't been. Based on that, I'm writing this review.The worst and most disappointing thing is that this game truly became a mobile 'waiting' game. It works with the same mechanics as Farmville, but the in-game mechanics and balancing of certain features are worse. When I purchased the game initially I thought that it wouldn't be like this at all. It really cheapens the idea of what could have been an amazing game.My biggest beef is that within the year that I didn't play it, I came back to the game being more buggy, having worse balance issues, and being more laggy on my system for no reason. I kept having the repeated issue of cards not appearing when I completed an objective, or the finger of god not working properly. The spacing of buildings has obviously been changed from what I remember, it is no longer as intuitive and everything is poorly spaced. Every UI aspect has gotten more and more annoying, like if I have a new card, the pulsating of the top right button is aggrivating. The way that the stickers have been rebalanced seems way, way worse. There is now one, maybe two stickers in every treasure box, whereas a year ago it was more randomized and you could find between 1-5 stickers in a box. They are almost forcing you to used the voyage function, however that hasn't been upgraded or improved since last year either. They've made it increasingly challenging to get stickers and gems in the worst way, because it now feels like sculpting to find treasure boxes isn't worth the belief, and the voyages only yield a small amount of a specific sticker at every goal reached. Honestly that alone was so annoying that I just stopped improving any card that I didn't think was necessary- and in doing that it appeared that new cards weren't appearing anymore when I completed a goal.My final, most infuriating issue with this game is the Astari aspect. Nothing is explained well enough, their appearance in the game isn't explained enough, and the way that their mechanic works makes no sense. You basically have to rely on the finger of god power, and once you've done that, there is absolutely no point in creating or pushing for the military settlements. Since the Astari and the reason that they are in the game is never explained, they feel like a giant annoyance that continually pesters you. The fact that the only real option is to wipe them out by saving up belief and then either squishing them during their festival or squishing a tree and then squishing them in rounds of 4-5 feels both annoying and cheap. They also somehow gain happiness at an inhumane level, which makes it incredibly challenging to not eradicate them immediately so that you just don't have to deal with them any more. Apparently the one thing that has been entirely reworked is the fighting mechanics, which I didn't even have a chance to see. Between cards that I remember being there a year ago being removed, the gem system being ridiculously unbalanced (considering that now basically your only option to progess in cards is to gain gems to buy packs, instead of it being about the finding of treasure or even the voyages), and how the sculpting is still the most tedious and uninuitive feature in the game... I'm uninstalling, I'm never reinstalling. I'm thankful that I bought this game on sale for $5, but even that doesn't feel worth the money at this point.My advice to the developers? Drop the project. You released this game 2 years ago and have made no improvements for at least a year. Try not to screw up this hard next time.			",17,12,0,4,10,0,6

								DON""T BUY THIS $#!T GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VALVE LET THE GAME LEFT STEAM PLEASE!編輯時間 2014/08/30V2.2還是希望新手任務可以調整跳過格線回來了所以我又玩了一下PC版寶石可以用小人跳樓(?)來賺但是房子產生信仰的時間大幅拉長 步調變的反而比以前面慢很多如果要玩要注意等待(無聊)的時間變很長就算用寶石還是慢(要等小人生產)所以還是不太推薦編輯時間 2014/08/09新手任務變得更加煩人  雖然已經不用用工作管理關了 但還是會錯誤還有房子蓋完格線會消失 難道就不能用選項來開關嗎暫時不會再碰這遊戲了  我還會玩是因為至少可以排房子...編輯時間 2014/05/10自從更新2.0後 這遊戲反而連""玩""都有問題，動不動就會有BUG而讓遊戲無法進行下去，甚至直接錯誤跳出，然後關遊戲反而需要用工作管理員才能關閉，雖然是early access，內容當然不是全部，但是連遊戲體驗都有問題了， 所以目前不建議入手。PS. 內容以新加入的元素來說是很不錯的，至少解決之前(1.X)需要一直點的問題，卡片可以隨自己喜好升級等，但是以可玩性來說，我給0分!

Early Access Review
								i was excited when i saw godus on steam, i bought it even though it was still in early access; the video i'd seen and the name attached to the game were large factors in that.on first play i noticed right away that the feel of the game was for mobile and not for the pc. figured i could live with that, wth. well, turns out there were all sorts of obvious mechanics that were meant for micro-transactions, all to be implemented later on, which made the gameplay ridiculous on a pc. game turned frustrating pretty quick. i uninstalled it and let it sit for about a year before i returned hoping development had come further and my gripes had been solved.i returned to find total silence from 22cans, a community stewing in anger, development seemingly come to a standstill, developers in the wind, and a game that was still frustrating. promises had been made! suggestions would be considered! all pretty much empty words.then a ray of hope, new builds, and the silence from the devs is broken. except, the same thing happens again. at this point i'm just fed up. i know the game is in EA but the writing's pretty clearly on the wall. maybe i'll return again if it ever goes gold, but until then, it's a big disappointment. too bad to, i really enjoyed Dungeon Keeper and Fable.

								Don't bother with this pile of garbage. Peter Molyneux is a known overhyper and swindler. I paid $20 for this a year and a half ago and its the same pile of unfun micro management garbage that offers absolutely nothing new to the god game genre. And its just kills me to look at the same terrible ui and visuals that have plagued this game since its inception. The developers have abandoned ship and Molyneux is too busy with the mobile version. I could have invested that $20 in far better indie games. MULTIPLE far better indie games.Who at 22Cans studios thought that the NEXT EVOLUTION of God games would be:*Continuously deform terrain for hours so that there is FLAT space where you can build houses.*Click your current houses so that your followers will go out and build houses on flat spaces, increasing population.*Continue to deform terrain so you can discover 'cards' that let you research new things.*Rinse, repeat, until you've unlocked all research, and rinse, repeat until your 'Civilization' looks a Rio De Janeiro ghetto that spans the entire world, is filled with huts on one side where you started, and manor houses on the other where your technology has advanced. Then realize the entire time you've been playing a glorified mobile time waster game where you wait for your houses to reach a certain time, then click on them to collect 'god power'. Then, wait until they're ready to be HARVESTED again, and click it again! OH BOY, SO MUCH FUN. I'M DYING FROM THE FUN. IT'S LIKE A PC VERSION OF FARMVILLE.HONESTLY, Black & White 2 was far more fun than this pile of garbage. Why didn't Molyneux decide to make a Black & White 3, and fulfil all the hyped up promises and features that he NEVER put in Black & White 2?Why Peter Molyneux or anyone at 22Cans could possibly think from the beginning that this monotonous, personality-less gameplay they developed could EVER turn into anything marginally fun to play is BEYOND me.Terrible from inception, and with the way the games structured now, theres no way it could ever be fun.I want my $20 back, but I know that'll never happen. And lets be clear here, I didn't buy this a month ago and now I'm freaking over the fact that the game hasn't changed entirely in a month. I BOUGHT IT ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO.2/10Fun for the first 20 minutes.			",57,5,1,16,22,0,51

								Echoing what many others have said in their reviews, this game is not worth it by a long shot.

								Just to start this off: This game is crap.When I bought the game about a year and a half ago, I was expecting a game type where I sculpted a world and played in a sandbox. What I got was nothing close to that. What I got was a game with no menu and no way to quit where I started on a sand island with a hut on it. Then I got a tutorial that said ""You gotz to keeps ur peeps growing and use cardz to move land!""The ""sculpting a world"" aspect of the game seemed like it was completely removed. I had to pop these stupid pink bubbles and get these points to use my powers. The bubbles gave me about 0.01 points each, and I could use about 5 seconds of my powers even when I stocked up on the bubbles for 3 days.There was no exploration aspect of the game. You would always run out of trees and rocks to get extra points. You got about 2 yards of extra space every time you used all of your resources to expand more. The continuous crashes. The not at all needed mesas, which you had to use all your powers to climb over, and there was nothing at the top except for a new area and then ANOTHER F*CKING MESA.Do not waste your money on this game. It is not worth it.			",47,5,0,2,14,1,12

								Sorry to say, but even with latest updates this game remains utter crap. Considering how bad this is, and probably will remain when finished, it will never be worth the fortune that was required for early access. I for one wish i never paid a cent for this game. So, good luck!As for the review. If you like playing games with no meaningful progress what so ever, go for it! If you liked populus and want this game because it is similar to that game? take your computer and throw it out the window, get your shoes on, and go for a run. Because going for a run makes more sense then wasting your money on this game. So, if your wondering what makes this game bad? Well, for one, there is still nothing to do. You click around, and wait for the time to pass. Nothing grows, nothing progresses. Your sims do nothing, and achive nothing. You achive nothing and do nothing but clicking around. After a while you get a spell that enables you to set fire to trees. Guess what you do next? You are so bored that its 99% chance you set fire to the whole town you just spent hours building, because, thats the most action you ever gonna see in this game.Beware, stay away, and remember: if your god is as boring as this one, change religion!

								Don't buy this.As I write, the game now hasn't been updated in nearly 2 years. The developer hasn't spoken to the community for nearly a full year. There is no-one working on this title. It is incomplete and dead, and it was pretty much dead before that too - there was a total of maybe 3 updates for the game, ever, and 22 Cans don't talk about it. The official forum mysteriously disappeared. They churned through community managers, and then basically stopped hiring them. Godus is, at it's heart, a mobile game. The intention is to make it pay-to-win, with you paying to speed up the time between rewards in exactly the manner Peter Molyneux slammed DK mobile for. This PC version exists purely so that Molyneux could make PC gamers pay for the development of the mobile money-spinner via kickstarter. In it's current state, it could more or less be drummed up in a game jam over a weekend in Unity... only you'd probably do a better job of making it fun.It's actually offensive that Steam haven't intervened and removed this game from the store, since it's not 'early access' - it's never going to go anywhere from here, and it is basically an elaborate kickstarter fraud.

								The game itself has a lot of potential.  You're a god, you get to shape and morph the land around you and help an entire population grow and prosper.  However, as it currently stands, there are so many improvements needed, that one might quit playing after an hour of repetitive clicking and expanding, clicking and expanding, clicking, and, you guesed it, trying to expand.The card resource system is flawed.  Once you can't find cards, you're out of luck for trying to upgrade any of your next improvements.  The game is currently only 40% unlocked, so I hope this issue is resolved with expansion and more multiplayer battles for cards. Either, or as someone else mentioned, a system in which resources can be mined or harvested.My finger goes numb from all the clicking.  Every house your citizens build accumulates more influence, the main source of your power in the game.  After a while, if you want to collect influence, you have to go back and individually click every house that has available influence to give to you.  I really wish there was some sort of ""collect all"" option, but sadly, there is not.Overall, This game has some serious flaws that ruin the enjoyability of the game pretty quickly.  I don't know why I put as many hours into it as I did.  Hopefully, the game improves, but until then, I would not recommend this game to anyone.			",43,5,0,7,13,0,4

								As of 9 AUG 14.  Do not purchase this game.  I've come back to Godus several times hoping it would end up like Black & White since Peter Molyneux is the driving force.  Since it's foundation Godus has played more like a browser game you come back to daily than a PC game.  Now with the launch of Godus Mobile the true market has been revealed.  I do not understand why they spent so much time developing it for PC when this is very clearly a game designed for mobiles.  Gameplay mechanics consist of shaping the world with clicking, and waiting for your followers to breed or generate belief.  If you love clicking and waiting purchase this game.  If you are expecting something like Black & White or Black & White 2, go elsewhere.			",34,4,0,20,14,0,23

								Yeah great.Bought it when EA came out. It was really promising. A straight God Simulation with a good flair and look. I hoped that it would be formed to another Populous from Peter.But NOW with 52% complete it is just another dumb Mobile / Facebook Games. Later on with buying Crystals for real money. Yes, you can collect em. You can play without paying anything more. As the shop isn´t available yet, you don´t have any other way. So you have to click a few times when starting the game and then wait. about 20 minutes for a building. about 30 minutes to collect some Might. Click click, wait. Or spend crystals. Crystals you have to buy soon.Oh and the graphic looked very good at the beginning. There were streets and flags etc. Now they are all gone. Because it has to work on IOS, too.

OMG, no!For pity's sake, don't plow any more funding into this half-baked project. Would you pay money for the first few chapters of a mystery novel, when the author is saying ""Don't worry, once I have your money I'm sure I'll have some really great ideas about how to write the rest of it. Of course, I'll be spending most of my time working on the first few chapters of my next novel...""Godus in its current state offers a few hours of really good gameplay. Then it stops. There's some nice graphics, excellent music, interesting mechanics. But no actual game. You can play the starting phase over and over, but you hit the same wall every time.At least the concept is good. I was more enthusiastic about Godus than I am about the endless me-too projects we're seeing in Early Access lately. But with Peter Molyneux actually admitting that he's scaling back development on Godus - and, unbelievably, putting a fan with no development experience in charge! - I'm losing hope. Maybe this new guy will make it work, but I see no reason anyone should put another nickel into this thing until there's a major sign it's actually going somewhere.Early Access is a really cool idea, but it's in dire need of some tough love. Stop funding projects too soon. Never fund projects until they really show that they have a strong plan for a complete game - not just a beginning and some vague mumbles about how great it's going to be - someday.

								All the Bullfrog games, Lionhead studios and others with titles such as Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Fable, Black & White... I loved P. Molyneux' games or ones that he was involved with. I was even able to see past the bad of Black & White 2. With all these games in mind I was so eager to kickstart this game, well.. biggest consumer mistake ever.It's now a decade or two later that I realise it's not Peter M. who was this brilliant game designer, it was always the combined efforts of his ideas backed by a developer team which wasn't afraid to say ""No Peter, that's a bad idea, we can't do that"". I think that this time around he was surrounded by young devs who dare not speak up enough against such a ""legend"" and that's where Godus went wrong.I'd give you a helpful list of what's wrong and what's not however there is no need, check it out on mobile for free, the same paywall mechanics are present in the PC version and weren't somewhat ""changed"" until a huge outrage (one of several) from the community. Every other feature is the exact same on the PC version. Multiplayer will never see the light of day so there's a con for ya. It's not in a fancy summarised list, sorry, I'd do that if there was still hope for this game in the future, but there is not, not an ounce.It breaks my heart to say this, I had such high hopes for the game, but please don't buy it, it's broken and unfinished, don't give him a cent, don't spend a cent on his new game ""The trail"". This mans golden years are over, he is no longer backed by strong willed and seasoned developers like he used to be in the past, he is the M Night Shyamalan of the gaming industry.

								In its current state, Godus is a chore more than a game. You click, click, click until your hand gets numb, with little to reward you other than more things to click on.  Everything feels like it is designed not to entertain you, but to keep you busy. There is progression, but only in a sense that things start off tedious, and then you are given tools to make your gameplay slightly less tedious. You start off having to click on each individual house to gather belief, with which you can sculpt land. If there was some moderation to this it would be alright, but it literally takes hours to get anywhere and your wrist will start hurting from the hundreds of times per minute you have to click to get a decent patch of land for your villagers to settle on. Then you are given some new tools through which you can do more while clicking less, which does make the game less tedious, but with a focus on the word less - and there still isn't anything that actually entertains. It would help if your villagers seemed to have lives of their own, but even on that front not much seems to happen. They just stay in their houses until you decide they are allowed to come out - then, when there is no place for them to settle, they just die.I would advice people who are on the fence about this game to first watch some movie reviews before purchasing this game, as there are quite a number of decent reviews out there that pinpoint exactly where this train went off the rails.

								I want to like this game and I have invested a lot of time into it.  Unfortunatlly it just isn't any fun.  Everytime an update comes out I get excited and play it for a bit, but always feel dissapointed in the end.    Sculpting in tedious.  You always seem to be waiting for belief which is a huge time sink.  You don't seem to have to make any choices when it comes to cards, you basically just build everytihng.   You either mine stickers or sacrifice you populate to buy packs.   There really seems to be no strategy and tactics to the game.   I don't regret backing this game because I like the idea of projects funded by the communitcy instead of big mega studios.  However, I'm sad it's largely been a big failure.   Peter has some great games under his belt and I was hoping this would be another timeless classic.The best thing about the game is the voyages which gives you a  little but of a puzzle challenge.  In the latest build (summer 2015) you finish it pretty quick and you are done.			",3,0,0,1,3,0,11

								I've kept checking back on this game, hoping against hope that something might actually come from it.  But alas, it was not  to be - the game is basically devoid of meaningful content and has about as much depth as one of the endlessly cloned facebook games.  'Click this! Get stuff! Build more things to click!'.  I played for as long as I did hoping that something, anything interesting would happen, but nothing ever did.  Far from a god-game, it makes you feel like a minion, doing boring, repetitive tasks in the service of an inscrutable goal for the benefit of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Update, Feb 2017.This game hasn't been updated for two years, so consider this the post mortem.In the end, Godus turned out to be a pay-to-progress Farmville style ipad game, with a nifty sculpting mechanic, which was later nerfed because players spent too much time sculpting and not enough spending money.The PC game originally promised, was essentially just a lie, told to leverage more money from the PC community, for development which was never spent on developing a PC game.Peter Molyneux was eventually called out for his lies by several gaming sites and has since retreated out of the spotlight, vowing never to show his face again. Many felt that, since 22Cans comitted fraud, on a fairly large scale, no future products from 22Cans should ever be allowed on Steam.The final part of the mystery remains that Godus/Godus Wars are still available on Early Access, despite the projects having been abandonned a long time ago.

								Check the forums to see angry people who backed this in Kickstarter and/or bought the game. Although it's an Early Access game and everybody should know there WILL be problems, the saddening thing is where the game is going.Is this a God game? No. It is a farmville copy now. You collect faith, you build houses, you unlock cards to be unlocked again, then you try to find stickers to really unlock the card to gain power.There are strong indications about that there will be an in-game store, both in mobile and PC versions. So, you'll pay to play, and you'll pay to make it enjoyable to play, you'll pay more to make it fun.Buying this was my worst decision, and I definitely would not recommend this to anybody.

								I bought this game because it looked like it was going to be at least a spiritual successor to Populous.  I purchased early and while it was playable, it wasn't good for more than a couple hours of fun.  I tried again a few months later and not a lot had changed... there were really no new features of note.Now, after coming back to it after another number of months, I find that the studio in charge is pretty much moving on to other projects, reassigning staff and such.  I never saw the Kickstarter for this project, but according to a couple of interviews with Peter Molyneux, things were over hyped and may well not get delivered as they were originally laid out.Ya, save your money on this one.

								Garbage game, one of the few Early Access games I wish I didn't buy. Crappy controls, crappy UI, crappy gameplay and the list goes on and on. They took super long in between updates and mainly ignored the PC community.Now they want to put out this new game Godus Wars, sure they gave it to Godus owners for free, but still... how about you go back and fix Godus first? Finish what you started instead of doing something new right away. Godus Wars I hear is a multiplayer game with RTS elements, nice idea but it is far to late now. I will try the new Godus Wars since we get it free but as far as this original Godus goes, it is complete crap and literally the worst example of EA that I have witnessed myself. Many great games come out of EA and KS, Pillars of Eternity, Kerbal, Prison Architect, DayZ, Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin, Darkest Dungeon, Ark,etc..   Godus though is crap! Let's hope they learned from these mistakes for the new game, but I am not expecting much at all. PM I think you're time is up bud, hang it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								tl;dr other reviews? Yet again, Peter Molyneux greatly overexaggerates the capabilities of this game. Godus is flawed, uninspired, and deficient in community and dev. support and communication. 22cans released Godus on Early Access 6 months ago, but the game has received only 1 significant update that has not fixed the major issues of the game (besides, of course, lessening the maddening amount of clicking necessary to do anything). If you're expecting an updated Populace or Black and White, then prepare to feel incredibly disappointed.			",62,11,0,24,13,0,29

								Huge dissapointment. Not even close to the good ole god games everyone has come to know and love, and I am not sure if it ever will even get to that point. From watching the dev videos, reading blogs. This game is aimed more towards casual play, lacking the content, and depth a god game deserves.At this point the game is nothing more than sculpting land, and clicking thousands of times on houses to get followers out or to collect the little orbs (faith?) so you can use your powers (which are pointless). Everything in the game right now is pointless. The followers do nothing on their own, have no AI. Man I could go on ranting forever. The updates to this game are extremely slow, and we were promised updates at a lot faster pace. Also the devs don't really come around to often or fill us in with anything worthwhile. The game is surviving on Peters name, and that is it. This is not worthy of a single penny much less the $19 they are asking for now, or whatever the cost is now. Let me make it short and sweet.- If you like doing mundane tasks, for no reward at all. Then pick up this game.- If you do not have high expectations and do not care if you are let down, and have money to waste. Pick up this game.- If you feel you have been neglecting your mouses buttons lately, and feel it needs a work out. Get this game.- If you are trying to wear out your mouse, so you can convince your parents, wife, girlfriend, etc. To get a new one. Get this game.- If you are expecting a game like Populous. Avoid this game like the plague. The only thing similar is the followers and that is even pushing it.			",120,19,5,22,62,0,19

EDIT 28 March 2014: The developer is now more communicative with their players and has released a major update to the game. The game is overall much less of a chore to play now but it's still based on social game conventions, in other words, most of the gameplay consist of waiting for real world hours to recharge belief, build shrines or refilling a boat embark on voyages (missions that play like a simplified version of Lemmings). The gameplay additions are welcome, but unfortunately the number of bugs and crashes of the game has increased. I would recommend to wait a little more until the game is more complete and polished before spending 18,99€ on it.-----------OLD REVIEW:I know that when you buy an Early Access / in-development game you can't expect it to contain most of the promised features at first, but at least I expect regular communication from the developers (weekly or even monthly updates about its development). There hasn't been any announcement on the Steam Community since October, and their Facebook and Twitter feeds appear more interested in selling t-shirts than talking about the game.  I'm not asking for a big content update patch every week, but at least they should inform us about what they are working on (and I'm referring to what is being worked on for the 1.4 patch for example, not just cryptic ""we are working hard on your feedback and have big ideas for the future"" kind of videos that just make more far-off promises). I feel like they have no pressure whatsoever in finishing the game, as they have my money already.			",83,64,4,26,10,2,10

								Back in the distant Eighties, Peter Molyneux created the first 'god game' POPULOUS. An early milestone in personal gaming. Simple but instructive UI, a logical and addictive mechanic, challenging progression and a true sense of achievement when a game was won. Nowadays, we are presented with monetisation: in-game purchases, carrot & stick condescension; a dumbed-down, craven ideology - tantalising to look at but utterly devoid of fun - the essential ingredient of a 'good game'. I want a story about humanity's impact on the world, a wise fable about the consequences of unfettered exploitation, the threat of climate change - prehistoric as well as contemporary. An archaeological story rich with detail, humour and frivolity. What happened to you Peter??? ",185,13,5,9,37,0,32

Early Access Review
								This text may be a little bit longer, so here is my conclusion up front: See this as a warning:This is not a game, it‘s also not a „Zen-Like“ experience. It‘s another Mobile/F2P cash-grab waiting to happen. I haven‘t seen anything this brash since the Dungeon Keeper Mobile „game“.  As a Kickstarter-Backer I feel betrayed by Molyneux and 22Cans and the only reason I checked the latest update (2.1) was out of morbid curiosity.It just sucks, don‘t buy it! If you are really curious, just wait for professional reviews to tear this thing apart. Or look at all the other negative reviews here. Many of the more realistic people have abandoned this F2P garbage long ago, just search the forums for a bit, or check the Kickstarter comments: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/22cans/project-godus/commentsHowever: Most reviews are still negative, and with good reason:Maybe I should start with the only positive thing I have to say about Godus: There are so many timers that I can go off and do pretty much anything else, until they finally run out. I‘m not kidding: I played through the Expendrabros campaign and I still had to wait another 10 minutes until anything happened in this „game“.Even simple buildings take up to 30 minutes to build, depending on their size. Well, you could say: Isn‘t there an upgrade that accelerates building time by 90%?Yes, there is, but now you need wheat to build new houses. First of all you need a farming settlement to get farmers, which costs 3000 belief, which, at this point of the game, takes more than one hour to gather.Now there are another 30 minutes until you can send out the first farmer, who needs 90 to 120 minutes to give you 2 – 4 wheat, depending on the size of the field.The next building you unlock after gaining the ability to create farms takes 30 minutes again and needs 6 wheat, so yay, even more timers.Later on you get mining settlements, which cost 7500 belief, which is not so bad at this point. Just gather the belief you can get right now, shut Godus down, play Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion for a hour or two, check into Godus again, gather belief, and so on. It should only take about 5 hours. Miners now take one hour to spawn und the mines take 6 hours to give you anything.Oh, and you only get belief after a timer runs out, small buildings take about 20 minutes, settlements about 5 hours.(and that‘s also the reason some people have so many hours of Godus on their steam account: it‘s something you just have running in the background. It‘s NOT actual gameplay)But there is a solution for this problem: Gems!You can use gems to finish any timer. You can „earn“ some gems by voyages (about 29 in total, which is a joke) or you sacrifice some of your followers. That wouldn‘t be so bad, because the little guys and gals don‘t have any personality whatsoever, if the game wouldn‘t try to make you feel bad about it (which doesn‘t bother me either). And then the „game“ suddenly starts to punish you badly for unhappy followers without warning. Everything else get‘s a unskippable tutorial, except the happiness „system“, so it come‘s really unexpected in an otherwise astonishing linear „game“. You see: Followers become unhappy, if you send them to their doom, what you will want to do, so you don‘t have to wait for hours until you are able to do anything again. It doesn‘t have any impact on their behaviour, so nothing is lost here, but there is one problem: There is another tribe, the Astari, who don‘t really do anything, no expanding, nothing (there is no AI to speak of, so far, and I don‘t think there will ever be any). They aren‘t even on the same island as you and all they do at the beginning is mock your people, so they want build so fast. Not really a threat.But: When your people are not as happy as the Astari, they leave you periodically, and you can do nothing to stop them. A lot of people will leave you (the first time this happened to me, I lost 125 of about 400 people). So not only do you have to start the whole process of waiting all over again, you also have to get your people happy.Either you use some simple miracles and spend a lot of believe (thousends of it), which will take you forever, or you spend some gems on fountains and special trees. It‘s kinda like Fable III: They have no personality, they just react to stuff, which has some consequences and otherwise they only have some idle animations (I checked Fable III out after becoming disappointed about Godus, and I would have never ever backed it, if I had known what a trainwreck Fable turned out to be). They do nothing else: They don‘t build on their own, no exploration. It‘s all micro-managing.Basicly: Every aspect of this game screams cashshop, like in the free Mobile version. If you ever read Molyneuxs reaction to Dungeon Keeper Mobile, than you might find it funny that you can spend 70$ for gems in the shop.Right now you can‘t guy any gems for real money in the „PC version“ and 22Cans keep reassuring us, that this won‘t ever be possible on PC, but frankly, after almost two years of misdirection (just check the Kickstarter page), broken promises (weekly updates) and just straight up lies (for example the FAQ of the Kickstarter page), I see no reasons to trust those people anymore.In my opinion they are designing the whole game to be absolutly tedious without the use of gems, just so they can get in the cashshop with the argument, that we asked for it.The controls are awful with mouse and keyboard, the sculpting is imprecise and the graphics are just horrible, especially the animations, when zoomed out just a little bit. They even got worse since the Mobile launch. There isn‘t even a free rotating camera. They have been focusing on Mobile for the last two years, and it shows.While checking through some other Steam reviews I saw one that said „This game comes along nicely“, and I have to disagree! Godus has been in development for almost two years now (December 2012) and for almost one in Early Access (September 2013). In one year, they added the happiness system, and almost nothing else. There have been minor things, like having to grind wheat and ore in addition to the believe, but mostly it‘s only a variation of the stuff there already is. Oh, and there were the voyages, the only thing reminding me of a real game, simply because it‘s a cheap Lemmings knockoff. The „game“ has even lost more features than it gained. There are no multiplayer skirmishes anymore, and there is no „campaign“. While both were awfull, they at least had potential. Apart from that, there really isn‘t much to say about the game itself, because there really isn‘t much. It is awfully linear. You grind three kinds of things (people, farms and mines) to get new abilities and bonuses. It‘s just another Mobile/F2P game.In comparison: The majority of the Steam community and the Kickstarter backers told 22Cans that they don‘t want any timers and especially no gems, and just look how that turned out. Molyneux is really great at nullifying the critics: The Steam community doesn‘t matter, because it doesn‘t understand the concept of Early access. The Kickstarter Backers don‘t matter, because basicly he just wanted to get the reinvention of the god game financed, but Kickstarter forced him to write all those promises and stuff. I am really, really sick of it. yourself: 


YouTube™ Video: Peter Molyneux on Gaming's Future, Kickstarter Games and New Godus Gameplay! 

			Views: 26,998		

			Peter Molyneux sat down with Tara to show off the latest build of his first Kickstarter game, Godus, and all the new features we can expect to see in upcoming weeks.		

I really have no hope for this game, whatsoever. Just stay away from it, or wait for some final verdicts by game journalists, if you really have to. Personally, I will never buy anything for 22Cans again and I am looking forward for the inevitable failure of Godus and hopefully of the studio behind it.			",70,4,0,30,29,1,46

								Still an incredibly slow game.  It feels like ""Farm Ville"" or ""The simpsons"" Ipad app's.  Clicking to earn belief on every single house so you can use your godly powers is a pain and becomes tedious.  Having buildings that take 5 - 15 min to build is boring.  Searching for treasure underground to unlock resourses and flattening ground... thats all I feel like I'm doing.  You can play some side mini games that are dull and unchallenging.  You get stuck to a tiny little bit of land that you have to work on expanding that takes a lot of time and energy.  You can order your people around to build things, I like that but I hope you dont mind using all your belief ordering a few villagers around.  The cards you earn don't seem like a great achievement/ and or very exciting to unlock.Summary:If you don't mind a slow iphone game that takes ages to build anything and you have to tap the screen to gather your resources then this is a game for you.  If you don't mind expanding a city full of people that do absolutly nothing unless you tell them to then this is a game for you.  The game has a dull dead feeling to it, you build a city for what?  the people don't move around, they dont gather resources to build new places and have to be told what to do.Would not recomment			",20,4,0,5,15,0,10

								it is very hard to rate this piece of software and stay polite. I have been simply trolled by Peter Molyneux, who promised a lot during kickstarter campaign, regenesis of genre, jupiter sized world etc... Developers declared they are inspired by games like Populous, Black and White, Dungeon Keeper, Civilisation or Minecraft. Sounds great. But after 2 years of development they delivered us facebook-like clicking ""game"" (not a PC game) with an aggressive money-grabbing system. There is no strategy in the game. The core of game is based on enormous long timers and collecting of stickers. Unfortunately it is hard to see how Godus lost its potential, because on the other hand there exist a great community around Godus with many experienced players who suggested really cool solutions to developers how to make Godus enjoyable, but they do not listen to feedback.Godus is delicious as hell.

								During the kickstarter, Peter was quite dishonest with us. He didn't mention that he wants to make a mobile game about waiting. I honestly hoped this will be the next populus or black and white, but sadly I've got FarmVille like game where you wait for basically everything. It's not that I'm impatient but this is just tedious and frustrating to wait and grind dull voyages. There are still a lot I like about this game, and it would be very promissing, but there's no way they will make a propper game out of this, instead of stupid clicking cow, even though there's almost no clicking now. Waiting simulator in tags, suits this game pretty well. Sitting for hours in waithing for something to finish is no fun at all. Regret backing it back in the day, but shame on me. Truly the god game, that makes you feel really powerless.To be fair, I actually like the new village system. It looks cool, and it feels cool, except that obnoxious waiting times. It was the only thing that kept me going.But after you unlock  happines thing, you suddenly discover that your people will leave if they are unhappy. And Peter was saying ""GO AHEAD THROW SOME OF THAT FOLLOWERS IN THE PIT OF DOOOOM!"", and not actually telling that theres a consicuence for doing so. Great damn idea, they leave in like packs of 50 people and it takes bloody 24 hours to replenish them. TWENTY FOUR FREAKING HOURS OF WAITING BEFORE YOU WILL LOOSE 50 MORE!  Before that I was thinking ""Ok I can still play once in an hour for 5 minutes, whatever, theres no way around it"", but now I give up, this is just poor iOS game design. Should have told your damn backers that you are making an iOS game, this is no Regenesis of nothing.Honestly, I don't give a damn about cross play. Do a separate game for phones if you really want that kind of crap, but let the PC gamers have an actuall game... you know... the one you can PLAY. For now I can't recomend this disappointing thing to any sane person. As a matter of fact, they need to make something godly miraculous (haha a pun =_=) for this to be recomendable to anybody ever.P.S. Peter said that we shouldn't freak out about gems, but why shouldn't we, Peter? Yeah, we don't need to pay for 'em but clearly they are in the game only because of smartphones. And the ways to acuire them don't make any difference, since everything is too slow anyway.I might sound really hursh, but am I? Investing your money, and most importantly your HOPES in people, who clearly don't have your interests in mind, convinsing people that this time Peter will do it right, and actually beliving in that while all the hate♥♥♥♥♥♥was thrown around. Well, congrats people, you were right, you may laugh now, it can't get more sour that that anyway.			",149,51,0,31,18,2,23

								I followed the Kickstarter progress with great anticipation.  When the first version came out, I played it for a while.  It was very rough around the edges, but it had potential.  Now it's 3 or more major iterations later, and things have actually gotten worse.  Your people are either very stupid, or try to kill themselves on purpose.  The land sculpting was fun in the beginning, but has gotten so epensive now, it's not worth the trouble.  And then there is the waiting...  If you like free to play crap where you have to wait 30 minutes for a house to be built (or give us some gems and you get it instantly) then you will LOVE this game.  But it has no place in a PC environment.  PC games tends to sit down for an hour or more gaming session, not a 5 minute ""click on everything and queue it all up so you can wait again tomorrow.""  And even though the PC version of Godus has no method to buy gems for cash, it still is the same mentality.I am very disappointed.  The only bright side I can see is that the game is currently 50.5% complete.  Hopefully they can still bring this game back.			",433,203,37,58,89,6,121

								The only way I can see this game moving forward is to scrap it and start again.If you think that ""the regenesis of the god game"", the genre that contains industry defining games, made by the person who started it all (you know, the one who oversells his ideas), should be a mobile game, then buy this on iOS. I've been following this game ever since the Kickstarter. I saw promise with this. It left as soon as I started playing.Ok, enough vague statements. Here is why I am annoyed with this.1. Waiting. You can only play the game for around 5 minutes before you have to wait 2 hours to be able to do anything again. That's not how you engage your players.2. Dual currency. Yes, I know. You've stated many times how there will be no microtransactions in the Pc version. Could you at least redesign the second currency so that it is not obnoxious? All you've done is remove the payment part. The only way to get more Gems is to screw yourself over.This isn't the regenesis of the god game, this is the death of it. If you're thinking of buying this, please don't.			",115,32,2,13,14,0,23

								I stopped playing this game a while back. 22cans appeared to have no interest in the players opinions on the game and support was basically non-existent. My whole experience with this game was nothing short of terrible. I would dread the updates as normally this would result in the game not working. I would submit a support request only to wait days before getting a generic response saying they were fixing a problem which had nothing to do with the problem I had submitted. I can't recommend this game. It looked promising but in the end this is a game designed around making money from mobile devices and should never have been sold on the PC.

Early Access Review
								So Peter Molyneux is at it again. And by ""it"" I mean making really, really bad games, while promising you the moon.After setting up his kickstarter to get morons like me to fund the game, it quickly became obvious that his intention was to add a micro-transaction store to make ""gems"" purchasable so that you didn't have to wait for eons between tedious button clicks. After enough stink was raised, he has now backtracked and said that he never intended for PC players to have to use the microtransactions. (We did, after all, already pay a healthy sum for this... thing.) Instead, we can now earn our gems in-game by sacrificing our builders.So for you who have not had the ""pleasure"" of attempting this poorly designed clickfest, let me sum it up for you:You move land around one piece, one layer, and one click at a time, taking a significant amount of effort to perform this tedious task, for the purpose of clearing enough area for a builder to place a building. However, this process quickly becomes expensive, and you have to collect ""belief"" from the buildings by - you guessed it - clicking each individual one. Each building is on a timer, and slowly earns this ""belief"" that, once earned, you can use to... Move more land.Sure, there's other ""things"" in the game, such as collecting ""stickers"" so you can put them on ""cards"" so you can eventually get an upgrade that would let you do something like, build bigger buildings that take longer to make belief... Or build buildings on grass instead of sand. Or collect your builders and sacrifice them for gems (you get 1 gem per, you don't have a lot of builders, and it takes them 16 minutes to replenish).Most recently added to the game is the ""sailing"" minigame. If you thought the rest of the game sounded pointless, you'll love this one. Your goal is to drop off a handful of ""workers"" on one side of an island... Then sculpt enough land that they can reach a target on the other side of the island. Enthralling...I actually muscled my way through the first round of this drivel because you have to get the cards and stickers to advance the game in any way. (Since apparently as a ""God"" you have some sort of Pokemon fetish.) By the time I got to round 2 (called Mountains and Meteors for those who want to give it a shot) I got through 7 levels quite easily, then hit level 8. Which I'm not even going to bother attempting to finish.In this level of the minigame, you have to drop meteors (which it's a roll of the dice what they'll do when they hit) in order to wipe out the ""giants"" and clear a path to the other end of the island. However, the whole system is so buggy that I'd be shocked if anyone ever managed to do it their first run through. (I was using a cheat and didn't manage to get through for hours, and finally gave up on the 5th game crash. Did I mention it's buggy?)On your boat, you have 30 ""workers"". You have to put a minimum of 10 down to get to the other end of the island, which gives you a maximum of 3 attempts. Fail all three (and you will... Repeatedly) and then you have to play the waiting game for ""reinforcements"" to attempt it again. And by the waiting game, I mean there's a SEVEN ♥♥♥♥ING HOUR TIMER. And this is still fairly early in the game! You could spend your gems at this point (you start with 100) to get an instant boost, and that'll cost you 69 gems for your first attempt. Afterward, you can burn all of your builders, turning them into gems, for your second attempt. After that, it's time to shelve the game and wait for a few hours real-time before you can attempt it again.I mean, I suppose you could go back to sculpting the land, except that all of your builders are now nuked, and you used all your belief to kill them for gems. So you can sit and twiddle your thumbs and wait until you have some more belief bubbles to pop, or you can uninstall this hunk of reconstituted dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and play something that's actually entertaining.I actually have a ♥♥♥♥ing headache as a result of trying to enjoy this game that I paid good money for.Sure, the game is still technically in alpha, but this is the third iteration of it now. And while I would never have believed it possible, each iteration is actually worse than the previous one. There's simply no direction in the game. It's not entertaining in any way, and it's exceedingly clear that the team (and by ""team"" I mean Peter - who refused to allow the team to do any work on the game while he was on vacation) that the ""team"" has one, and only one focus with this game: To figure out how to make it as boring as possible so people will purchase stuff with the microtransactions. Unfortunately, he's missing a major part to having any sort of microtransaction game be successful, and that is that first, the people have got to want to play it.This game is the equivalent of bubble wrap, but you're only given a small 6"" by 6"" sheet once every few hours unless you pay extra money. You can pop through your bubbles fast, or you can do them one at a time, but either way you're left with a hunk of plastic you have to throw away and then sit on your♥♥♥♥♥and wait to be handed another one.Now, all of this said, after realizing that I would have to wait another 2 hours to click another bubble, I just used a hex editor to give myself unlimited ""gems"" in the game so I wasn't held back by the microtransactions. And you know what? It was even more boring. Never would've thought that was possible.  Even with unlimited gems, I never was able to finish the boring♥♥♥♥♥""mini-game"" mission.  Cannot recommend this game any less.  It's the last time Molyneux gets my money.  (And ignore the ""hours played.""  Apparently the game glitched at one point, stayed running in the background, and racked up hours even though it wasn't ""visible.""  Apparently it stayed there for over a week.  I've only managed to muscle through about 5 hours of actual play time.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game was developed for mobile devices..Having played this on an iPad, the touch and drag features fit in pretty well, and you can play pretty casually. Playing this on a PC is a different matter entirely. The endless clicking and dragging quickly drains most of the magic in the first hour of gameplay. Add to that the fact that you you're constantly babysitting villagers and waiting for belief to earn you more click and drag points and the game quickly becomes a chore. Unless click and dragging ad nauseam is your idea of fun, download this for a mobile device and stay away from the PC/Mac version.			",37,7,1,10,5,0,4

								You had one job that you said you would do: Revitalize the god game genre by making a modern version of populous.What wasn't in that job description, and what nobody in the community wanted, was you experimenting with F2P mechanics, mind numbing mobile click/tap fest mechanics and, well, designing the fun out of the game.Utter Fail.

								Yeah, this is my first review, so it'll probably be awful, but I'm going to be brutally honest here: This waste of cash was BORING.What do I mean?  Well...there is so much micromanaging, but that's only percentage-wise.  The gameplay is EXTREMELY slow, enough to put someone to sleep.  A game about being a sky-god SHOULD NOT BE BORING.  I spent the entire first session, all 91 minutes or whatever, waiting for it to kick up its intensity even slightly.Nothing.  Black and White was better than this - B&W shoots Godus with a sniper rifle, in one eye and out the other, from a distance of about a kilometer, then does awful things to its corpse.To make it worse, the click-and-drag interface.  Oh.  Dear. GOD the interface.  A lot of people seem to be frustrated by this point, so read those reviews for more details.I would more easily recommend Dwarf Fortress - yes, THAT Dwarf Fortress - to a casual gamer, than I would this to anyone.  Heck, I enjoy DF, and I'm pretty casual.That this game is $20 USD isn't just salt in the wound.  It's more like someone put a rocksalt shot in a shotgun, put the barrel's opening directly on my right hand, and pulled the trigger.  I literally would not recommend this game for 10% of its asking price.You want a better game?  Go buy Dragon: the Game.  It's $2 cheaper than this, and while yes, it's still in development and pretty buggy, that means the developers want your input as much as your cash.  Give it to them, and don't give this developer a dime.You want another better game?  How about The Long Dark.  Same price, but much better developed, with survival in the wilds of frozen Canada and wolves trying to tear you to pieces.  It's tough, but at least it's a way better buy.You want another one?  What am I, a computer?  Go browse on your own.  You'll probably find more hits on Steam than this thing's cost in pennies.			",75,29,0,22,5,0,5

								22 cans had good idea for a great game and even better kickstrarter funding (even backed the projects). Soo.... what happen?Instead of completing what they have promised and upcoming ideas were major abuse of what they had gotten on Kickstarter and the game has gone through several major changes (more or less broken game system that was promised) and not least the company has had its problems. 50% of the time they have spent on the game is twitter, blogging, unnecessary drama and just talking and ""ideas"" will  be in the game.  If this was a different company and Peter M (one of creator Black & White) was main leader and use kicktarter money right hte game would have been a huge hit and maybe finished by now.The other 50% we don*t where went since the are more or less back to start for a mobile game that nobody care about now.

								I had high hopes for this one as a big fan of the old Populous games, and various other Peter Molyneaux creations.Unfortunately Molyneaux left the project, leaving the game in early access with a lot of development to go, and perhaps two full time developers working on it. Essentially because one quite vocal fan/community presence decided to step up and take over the project rather than allow it to be simply abandoned (credit to you, Konrad).Basically Godus is the story of a very rich man who decided to take people's money on Kickstarter to start his latest brainchild - which he could have easily funded himself - getting bored, and leaving less than half way through development. It serves as a lesson to myself and others about the dangers of early access, and a reminder of why not to trust Peter Molyneaux.			",89,7,0,28,25,2,41

								I first bought this game the last time it was 50% off--back when it was a giant clickfest. It was novel for a bit, but that wore off quickly once I grew aware of the clicking and the fact that this was just a big ol' ""flatten the earth to get villagers and cards to unlock more earth to flatten to get more villagers and cards"" game.Now, with the recent update, there's less clicking (more click+dragging) but it's pretty much the same game, only instead of cards you collect stickers. It's the same mechanic--there's a chest under the ground, you reveal it, click it, get a sticker to apply *to* a card to unlock its bonuses (you unlock cards based on the number of villagers, and they don't get activated unless you apply the correct amount/type of stickers.) It's still pretty much a ""flatten the earth for more villagers"" fest, so it's easy to realize mid-play that the gameplay is stale and really quite pointless. It plays more like an android game than anything. Definitely not worth 20 bucks (I'd even say not even worth 10. 5 at most.)Other than that, I love the sound effects and art style. Shaping the land to be asthetically pleasing can be something of an art, but doing so hinders progression. It pushes the player to the mentality ""I really want to shape the land to how I want, but I should progress first and do what I want later"" which is a huge deterring thought most experienced gamers can become aware of almost instantly.

At this point there is just nothing left to do.But that being said, that's why I'm saying it has great potential, but right now there's just not that much to do after the first 8 hours or so.

								DON'T BUY IT !The game is more and more a free to play like, with in app purchase and all of that, stuf that was never announced when I bought it. The creator is so self-loving that he doesn't even realise what the hell he is doing (""it's not free to play, it's invest to play"" he said). I bought the game thinking that it would include fight between gods with their minions, instead it's just a giant ""click the bubbles and wait for more"". You know that new dungeon keeper on mobile ? Yeah it's almost like that. Once you get a bit far in the game, it's ""buy gems or wait 24h"". I wouldn't say anything if it was a free game, but this is unacceptable for a game that cost 20 bucks.

At least they fixed it so I don't have to open Task Manager to end the process when I want to stop playing.			",241,27,1,24,26,0,62

Early Access Review
								I really wanted to like this game..but the only thing it really accomplished was to make me very cautious about Early Access games. I enjoyed the earlier alpha releases, but then subsequent releases removed 90% of what I enjoyed about those releases. When I watched the videos produced for each release by the developer, I got a sense of frustration from Peter Molynieux and felt like he was mostly defesndive. I began to realize something was wrong when I felt like I had been scolded after the videos. It may very well be that this game is not yet half done...but what progress has been made toward ""completion"" has also taken the game away from what once had me so very excited.I have enjoyed many good games from Mr. Molynieux, including Populous, which was one of my childhood favorites. I have come to expect great things from games bearing his name. Unfortunately, it isn't just that Godus isn't good...the major problem is that I feel deceived. That will be a long and painful scar that will cause me to doubt all future Early Access purchases--especially those associated with Peter Molynieux.			",369,99,12,68,79,4,102

								Right now, this is not fun at all.It's painfully obvious how they made this a mobile centric game, and their (to me) annoying slathering of time delay mechanics infuriates me.In my opinion, time delays and and cool downs have to be the laziest game design mechanic i have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Especially when they are needlessly added to a game to artifically extend the total play time of the game. And even more so when the intention is to hook the player so they feel the need to come back to the game after the hour long wait is over. That is a trope used by mobile games since their genesis. I do not find it fun, and Godus is filled to the brim with it.There is some potential for a great experience in this however. Unfortunatly it is burried under a mountain of problems:waiting around for things to snowball (if that ever happens).horrible pathfinding AI the followers exhibit.not being able to destroy old buildings to alow for newer better abodes.painfully slow progression (i want to be able to get reasonably far in an 2 hour play session).Voyages are not fun at all for me, i want to manage my homeworld. That's why im playing a god game. I don't want to do silly mini games meant for mobile players to gain the very basic tools to progress in the main game. Also bogged down by the crap pathfinding and clunky inconsistent sculping.The gathering rate of belief is to low, almost all my time is spent waiting or grinding in voyages to get belief just so i CAN PLAY THE MAIN GAME THAT I PAYED FOR !If these things are fixed/balanced or removed I believe i would indeed enjoy the game, because watching the followers grow, your towns grow, and your landscape grow, is all extremely cool and fun. For the PC version at least. PLEASE.Please note: theres the entire back half and end game i have not yet experienced since i can not will myself to play the game that long. ",358,46,4,30,41,1,33

								All the PC aspects, and coincidentally the fun, has been removed from this game.  It has been aimed at mobile gaming, something that feels like a betrayal.  You can play with stickers, but not make any choices.  The click fest was replaced with a more mobile friendly drag.  The text even says ""tap"" and not click now.  I definitely look twice at paying for games still under development now.  Thank you Godus; you inspire distrust.			",19,6,0,30,42,0,44

Early Access Review
								This game is awful, time spent in the game feels like time fully wasted. It reminds me of my mortality and makes me sad that I'm spending my precious time on this earth playing this crap. And I've played it for less than 10 hours since I bought it long ago.It takes a certain type of s*** to cause that sort of hatred so quickly. And the worst thing is, that this game could have been sooooooooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. If not for the crap decisions the developers have made.I'm not just going to ramble on about all the reasons this game is terrible (but it is, don't buy the game). Instead, I'll give you a first hand experience of my thoughts on this game, from the time I bought it till now.I bought it far before the big 2.0 update (or should I say the entire scrapping and remaking of this game).That's right folks, I was there at the very beginning of this disaster. I bought this game as it mentioned it was inspired by populous, and I thought 'wow, a game inspired by Peter Molyneux's good era of games, before he became an awful game developer, and without any input by him, sounds great!'So I bought the game, and was excited at first, it wasn't bad initially, for the first 20 minutes. And then the awful AI multiplayer tutorials came on. Cringeworthy, embarrasing, pathetic. Playing with fake people, all of them tragic and worthy of some form of pity for some reason. One girl seemed to have issues with her dad, one dude was 30 and unemployed, desperate to gain fulfillment in his bleak life by getting more gems in the game.And they never ended, they went on and on and on, this pathetic illusion of multiplayer. 'Why is the game doing this? Who thought it was a good idea? Why would they make it like this? Is this the only multiplayer in the game? Will it ever end?'And then the grinding happened, which I should point out has not changed in the updates, it seems even worse now.It was at this point that I found out that good old Peter Molyneux IS involved in the game, which explains so much. He was brilliant in his time, and I have huge respect for his older games. Black and White was a masterpiece, simple as. I've loved it for years, still play it occassionally, and I firmly believe that the creature AI is yet to be outdone in a game, including it's not so good sequel.But now, Peter is the worst kind of 'maverick'. His ideas are great, but the way he implements them are terrible, TERRIBLE! And the reason is simple, there is nobody to reign him in. He is a well known figure, who's going to argue with him? They let him do what he likes, and he ♥♥♥♥s♥♥♥♥♥♥up.If they took his great ideas, and then made them fun and enjoyable with some outside help, controlled him a bit, this game would have been fantastic. But it's not, it's garbage. It has been for a looooooong time, and the countless updates have done nothing to change that.The only thing that could save it would be a complete overhaul of the game, redo it from scratch, remove the grinding, make it fun. But they won't do that, they can't, too much time has been spent on it already.I'd demand a refund if I felt there was any hope of getting it. But to be honest, it was worth buying it for the multiplayer tutorials in the past. I'm serious, they were so awkward, so awful, it was hilarious, if slightly painful to read. The type of bad that only Peter Molyneux could make.In short, don't buy this game, it's a great concept, could have been FANTASTIC, but is boring, dull, and tedious. And the worst part is, the developers f***ing know it! They have the nerve to tell you in the commentary to do other things while you wait for crap to happen.Do other things Peter eh? Like play another game? A good game? No need to tell me twice!			",90,11,1,12,19,0,40

								If i can actually get it to start then it's... still awful not worth rating. Another weak attempt Peter :(Also i'd like to point out this ""game"" is £14.99 !!! Years on its still barely functional with next to no gameplay.Please just go and buy something like Besiege. Its £4.99 and infinitely better in every way. Besisge isn't a god game but it'll give you hours of marvelous fun creating ridiculous contraptions.Or if you have no money at all go on Newgrounds or some other website where you can play other peoples home made flash games, the majority will still be better than Godus.I find it truely remarkable that the mind that has brought us some of the greatest pc gems of later years, not only fails to deliver anything near what was promised, but actively cannot identify that the absurd statements he comes out with are mostly full blown lies.If you going to make a statement like "" i dont have a reputation in this industry anymore"" then you really should make sure that you are not the one thats♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on your own fireworks before inviting everyone round for the big party.

								There's some interesting stuff here, but it doesn't have much of an effect on game play.  Right now, it's a bit of farmville meets hidden object.  It's just not fun.  Digging for chests is a hassel after the first few, the voyages are more stressful than strategic, and developing your village takes too long.Also, please don't use the term ""breeder"".  It's a derogatory term for a straight person here in the US.  Even if you're just applying it to your female characters (hence the pink shirts), that's still not right.			",138,56,0,30,25,0,29

								It looked promising it first. But after 2 days of playing it, I reckoginzed that there was barely content in it. I mean, the ""sculpting"", as the devs call it, gets really annoying after a few hours. Im playing StarCraft 2 at masters level with 250 actions per minute (mouse and keyboard controls) - that can be exhausting, but it's no comparision to this piece of garbage that I spent 20€ on. Moleneux - you lost it.Since MONTHS, the devs are focusing on a ""FREE-TO-P l AY"" mobile iOS port that makes them more money via the ingame shop.Horrible game, stop wasting your time with Moleneux miscreations. Yes, he made some good games, like Dungeon Keeper - but those times are way over.			",124,9,2,12,13,1,35

								If you're at all interested in the god game genre (Black & White, Populus, etc) hold off on buying Godus. At present, it's barely a game. The team promised monthly updates but remember this is a team headed by the industry's most creative and compulsive liar - Peter Molyneux. The game hasn't seen an update since October and the team has been completely silent as to when the updates will resume. Wait for the full release because, hontestly, with Molyneux's track record, there is a chance this game will never see the light of day. And if somehow it does it may only be a fraction of the original vision. Anyone looking to recapture that Black & White magic will be sorely dissapointed.			",152,19,3,12,34,2,28

								Stay away. They dared charge $20 for this ""game"". If you want a more exciting game go play minesweeper. While it may sound cool in theory or look pretty, in reality this is simply no better than Farmville or other casual games' the only difference being that they had the nerve to charge $20, rather than reeasing it for free.Gameplay wise the game consists of dragging dirt around until the AI finally decides to place a house there so your people can breed. You then keep repeating this until you have taken up all the land available, hopefully gaining a large enough population in the meanwhile to allow you to continou doing so.Is there an end to this game? I could not tell you, nor do I really care, since I soon gave up on it and wondered instead about getting a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The recent (2.0) improvements to Godus are superficial at best and the new tutorial insulting.I think one of the most fundamental problems is that there is no personality to your followers or their settlement. I would gladly collect belief and look for stickers if it actually meant that it created something spectacular and I could follow individual followers and their struggles to build families etc, to survive and build a civilization in a hostile world. As it is all you're doing is creating space for them to build, but no reason for them to build something specific at a specific place. No dangers for them to overcome or strategy in placement or deliberate pacing. No economy except belief which is best acquired by not playing but rather logging out and returning later. In Godus I am not a God, I am the creator of flat surfaces. I'm basically a bulldozer that collects stickers. ﻿			",150,199,0,26,17,1,26

The worst thing is lying about still trying to improve it, when in reality no significant updates are ever going to happen.  This attempt at a money grab is a huge reason why Early Access if frowned upon.  Enter at your own risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Godus is a game built without drama or conflict.  The only constraint you will run into is a risk of carpel tunnel as you slowly expand your influence in a dead world.  While Godus is technically a god game your followers cannot engage in any independent activity and require no food or resources to continue existing, as such there is nothing to do but keep nudging them to expand until a population cap is reached, and no constraint other than time to prevent you from reaching said cap.  It is also worth noting that while Godus states that followers are your measure of size and scope, followers do not directly create each other.  Followers instead make houses, and upon making a house they enter it and never again exit.  After a certain amount of time passes you can click on a house and get a new follower from it, and thus continue to expand your empire to houses.Godus also features the ability to reshape the terrain.  While this can be fun, it lacks the visceral feel of performing the same action in a game like Minecraft and uses an interface for this that is less engaging than the one found in the original Magic Carpet.  Rather than using dramatic spells or a slow change from a low level by means of follower activity Godus chooses to have you raise and lower the terrain by means of double clicking.  I kickstarted this game, and unfortunately it did not deliver.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Godus is a ridiculoulsy bad game which takes all the worst aspects of smart phone games, and manages to make them worse. Any good aspects are compltetely overshadowed by the contrived time sinks and make-work system. As such, simply sitting down for an hour or two isn't really possible, not if a player makes a mistake at any point, and even without a mistake, it's likely a single play session will last only 15 minutes, followed by a 15 minute break. Break and repeat, ad naseum.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very interesting game that gives a certain amount of power (Early Access) that lets you shape the world to your hand!Only problem is, this game rarely updates, mostly 1 update every 2 months, what is very annoying, because there are still alot of bugs, and the makers only make dev blogs about it, NOT ACTUAL UPDATES!I would not recommend this, because of the lack of updates, and they're mostly ignoring a part of the community, even when they try to help the developers themselves...

								Tons of issues with this game, even the workshop looks like a joke a 5 year old made. Seriously take a look at the workshop. Game is glitchy and if i try and minimize steam it goes blank like a really bad flash game, heck this game even made my dog howl and hide under the bed its that bad. I am glad this came in a bundle with some better games or I would be very mad, and wished there was still a refund button or something. Hopefully uninstall button works better than this game.

Need belief? Wait forever then click every house. Oh! A chest is here, under 15 layers of dirt. I better click through all of those; that way you can click EVEN MORE! Dear god I hope you like ♥♥♥♥ing clicking cause ♥♥♥♥. Sadly, the only thing clicking won't get you is fun, or your money back.			",341,130,5,51,50,5,66

								The game can be enjoyable and relaxing, my issue is simple.Will this game ever be complete?This game originated on Mobile platforms, and has been in Early Acess almost as long as DayZ Standalone (with much less progress in my opinion) and I am not very impressed with the changes that have come about, and from the looks of other reviews neither are other players.Who could ever reccomend a game that may never actually be complete?

Early Access Review
								This is a freemium game for the ios and android but is being charged a fee to play it on the pc. Well... I should clarify that. they removed the ability to buy stuff from the pc game but they left all of the stuff in there that is designed to slow down the game so that you buy stuff. very strange.... for example... I'm now waiting a few hours for some stuff to build.This is the only game where I am glad to be interrupted while playing it because that means something will be done when I come back to the game.Hopefully they remove all the painful delays from the game when it leaves early access.Update: Ok. I've had some time to play the game and I'm now able to look beyond my overwhelming frustration with the time delay to provide some more feedback. (sort of able to look past it)Pros:1. I really like the look of the game2. I also like how they let you model the land to build stuff on it. I think they got that one down pretty good.3. I like how you have to grown your population to unlock stuffCons:1. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE having to wait 3 days for something to be built. And that is what the timer says. 3 days. it actually takes even longer then that because your workers take naps. So it will probably be 4 or 5 days. I'm going to do a few minor things in the game then I don't expect to ever play it again unless there are some radical changes in the wait time.2. I hate all of the stupid, pointless resources. you have belief which lets you build some stuff. Then you have to get wheat to build other stuff and then you have to get ore to build other stuff and then you have to have gems to do other things. So you end up having to create this huge infrastructure of ore to be able to unlock to portals and once they are unlocked they don't do anything.3. This game wins for being the most frustrating game I have ever played.4. So there is this In-Game game where you have to get your followers to go from one point to another point on a map. It makes me so mad because you can't control your followers and they are idiots. Oh and did I tell you it is timed. So you have to get your followers to go from point a to point b in a very short time frame with no control over them and things are trying to kill them and you have limited resources. Fun... it is not.5. Oh yeah. so my theory that they took the free game from the ios and brought it to the pc was confirmed. They forgot to remove a button from the pc version which, when you click on it, tells you to buy gems at the store... except for the pc version doesn't have a store so... yeah... Conclusion: If they got rid of the wait times and balanced out the other stuff I think I could recommend this game... right now where the game is there is no way I would ever recommend it.Oh yeah my hours into this game are so big because I just leave it running in the background. It is a easy way to build up resources.Update 2:Ok They just released a new balance option which is AWESOME. It lets you eliminate a majority of the stupid timers so that the game is actually fun. So here is the deal.I would actually recommend this game if the balance options, which allow you to speed up the timers, stay in the game. However, I'm under the impression that they are going to remove them once the game gets more developed. At that point I think the game will go from being awesome to sucking.I actually came into this review specifically to update my review to be a recommend when, as I was typing, I realized that they probably are going to remove the balance options and then I'd have to update my review again. I'm just going to leave it as a not recommend until I get more concrete info that the stupid timers are going to stay in seconds rather then days.			",213,78,4,38,24,4,37

								Godus, so far below par.Having played the game on and off for the last few days, and currently at about the 12 hour mark of playtime, I can tell you that the game has a lot of potential.A lot of the 'early' parts of the game are fleshed out well, and seem quite polished, however the 'middle' part of the game is about expansion and landscaping two things that are not very exciting, and often I find myself expanding because increasing population gives small rewards.It is very difficult to unlock the cards needed for technological advancement, and it is not really something that you can affect, the 'treasure chest' mechanic feels random and un-rewarding.Currently the game has many glitches and difficulties. It is SOOOO tedious to reshape the landscape, and it often does not reshape the way you want it to resulting in people getting stuck everywhere. The Astari (rival tribe) also gain loads of happiness and beat your tribe whenever you save and leave your PC for more than a few hours, even when their entire kingdom is covered in swamp land and they all die every time they leave their houses. If you win people from rivals they do nothing but annoy you for the entire game.Overall it is a wonderful looking game, with a lot of potential, but can't help but think the PC is an after thought for the developers, and it will all be about buying gems on a mobile phone. I have had some fun playing it up until this point. I would not recommend paying full price for this game while it is in Early Access, however it could easily be worth the full price when the game is finished.My recommendation would be to pick up any Civilization game, because while this game looks super cute, right now Civilization does everything this game does better!

								This wonderful addition to a growing arsenal of Facebook games is a lovely waste of money. The features here are nonexistant, which goes along perfect with the end-user's interest level!If you're really intent on spending your hard-earned cash on something so fleeting and bare, twenty dollars could probably get you a few hours of a horrifying methamphetamine high for a similar price. I suppose buying this at sale price would make for a great gag-gift... if you're that terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in your group of friends that no one likes anyway.10/10, thanks, Molyneux.			",102,5,1,17,8,0,2

								For some reason, the Godus team thinks that people enjoy waiting long periods of time for buildings, mana regen, etc to finish. They must have looked at games like EA's Dungeon Keeper for iOS and say ""Hey, we can do a game like that, but without (currently) any real money transactions. We'll still keep the awkward in game currency and still make players wait around for arbitrary amounts of time. Hours even. We'll make it so they play for only 20 minutes at a time and then wait an hour for stuff to finish.. Brilliant!""Molyneux..... You've fooled me for the last time. I'm done. You'll never get another dime from me. Everyone, please stay away and stop falling for his money traps. If it didn't come from Bullfrog Productions, it's just a waste of time and money.

								DO NOT BUY!Godus isn't merely incomplete, it's a game with no gameplay. Despite being ""over 50% done"" the game still shows no signs of a solid mechanical core or idea, and the terrible progression systems and heavily gated resources only serve to mask the fact that there's very little to do even when treating it as a zen-sandbox. There's no megastructures or sweeping vistas to build because, almost ironically for a god game, the game only lets you destroy. You can erode, flatten, and homogenize, but never build. The only real avenue of challenge is waiting, and ""progressing"" through the game only makes this ""challenge"" worse. Rather than progression being a way to overcome old challenges and open up new challenges, advancing through the tech timeline only adds a new coat of paint to the waiting game, often adding hours, or days, to the time it takes to gather new resources.Additionally the game's sparse mechanics are broken with almost insulting ease. Gems, the pay-to-win currency of the mobile version, are so powerful that the ""cost"" of sacrificing followers to the Pit of Doom is entirely offset by the things bought with the resulting gems.The game will not get better because it isn't a game yet. If they haven't figured out what the gameplay is by the 50% mark then they probably never will.			",115,35,0,23,20,0,16

								A man cannot serve two masters.  Godus as it stands has too much tablet DNA to be a decent PC game.  This is a real shame, as there are some wonderful concepts there that can't quite get out.I've like Peter Molyneux games since the beginning.  Godus is similar to Black and White in that the interaction with the world is very different to a standard PC strategy game.  This isn't a bad thing.  The lack of direct control, the interaction with the landscape, even the treasure hunt aspects are all really interesting and work well together.  But the problem lies in the execution.  It is very difficult to play this game for more than 15-20 minutes without running out of things to do.  On a mobile game, that's fine.  For a PC game, it's frustrating.  The reason for this is that everything is based on real world time, so if a beacon is going to take 16 hours to build, you shut the game down and come back in 16 hours.  Again, this is standard for a mobile game, and there are justifications for it in a social game as well I guess, but it means there is a lot of dead time.  Much more dead time than actual fun time.The shame is, I enjoy playing the game.  The land sculpting and bringing together settlements is really well done and a lot of fun.  But normally after 5 minutes, just when I'm getting into it, I'm out of belief.  Then there's 5 minutes of hunting chests, maybe go on a voyage, but really there's nothing to do but close the program and wait a couple of hours.As I say, the land scuplting aspect, coupled with the lovely minimalist artwork, really is lovely and interesting.  The landscape is beautiful, although it's something of a shame that your main interaction with it is to turn it into a flat parking lot to put houses up.  There is promise here, I will continue playing.  But at the moment I could not recommend this to anyone else.			",40,16,0,10,24,0,13

The game promised massive things but delivered what amounts to a pea on a plate. It will never get finished so don't waste your time.			",342,114,7,84,68,4,77

								I used to look up to Peter Molyneux.  I was once a fan.  He created some amazing games back in the day - Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Magic Carpet, Black & White, Fable - to name but a few.But these days it seems he has sold out.  After complaining about EA's interpretation of Dungeon Keeper  (a mobile phone version that employs 'pay to play' limitations), Peter has done it himself - he was created a mobile phone game for the PC that is severely crippled unless you pay - and keep on paying - to make it playable.Offering a 'pay to play' game after the user has already forked out £14.99 is dispicable.  This game was originally fun in the Alpha phase, but is now a shallow attempt to relieve the player of his or her money.Shame on you, Peter Molyneux - I was once a fan, but will never entertain the idea of buying another of your games.Uninstalling.

STAY AWAY!I had very high hopes for Godus, with the persistant world promises and actual civilization building á la populous meets settlers. However this is nothing but false promises or broken mechanics, at best. The whole game is a complete and utter disappointment, possibly the worst let down I've ever been served by mr. Molyneux - and I've played all his titles.It's nothing but a pay-to-wait game with a premium price-tag slapped on top to really milk every cent from your pockets. They've introduced a gem-shop (that they claim will never be charging actual money.... yeah, right). I don't want to spend half the cost of a AAA-title to sit around and NOT PLAY THE GAME while waiting for all these idiotic timers to tick down. No, it's just not 5 minutse or 10 minutes here and there, EVERY SINGLE BUILDING is blocked by timers that can stretch upwards 24 HOURS. I have 12 hours on record on steam, with a good 30 piled into it in offline mode. Even after my first 6 hours of playing, I ended up in a situation where I could do nothing but WAIT for an hour until I could continue playing the game. Further developing my settlement took me a WEEK OF WAITING within my initial 20 hours of total play time!There is absolutely NO reason what so ever to buy this game, or even look at this steam store page. THEY DO NOT DESERVE YOUR TIME. The mere fact that you're reading this is bad enough. MOVE ALONG!DONOTBUY ",124,11,0,21,39,0,21

								Godus – a game that you buy to play it 10 minutes per day. Because it does not let you play it when you want to play it.Godus is fun for the first 30 minutes. Building a small village, collecting belief, sculpting the landscape and playing little mini-games can be fun. But after that you need to expand and you want to create bigger settlements.Well, too bad … it takes 20 minutes to complete a single building. Belief generation takes even longer. Later in game you also need to farm wheat to be able to create buildings. That is where the fun begins. Wheat takes up to several days until it can be harvested.After two hours your gameplay is as following: Start the game, collect belief, collect all the wheat and build as many as five new buildings with it. Wait for the next day to repeat that process.It feels like a mobile game, with the same amount of waiting. It is pure cheekiness that this game was ever released for PC.Stay away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR - while an interesting idea, the direction that this game is going in does not look to be a fun one.  The gameplay is repetative and fairly boring, and the mechanics that the game is based on get old very fast.  In this game you will be doing the things you learn in the first 10 minutes over and over, but with new graphics slowly being added to these repetative tasks just to keep you playing.  Cannot recommend until this game evolves beyond putting down lots of buildings that all do the same thing. This game is based around three mechanics:1. Sculpting the landscape2. Collecting 'stickers'3. Building resource-generators on the landscape.You sculpt the landscape in order to clear enough space for the resource-generating buildings to be built, unlock more advanced buildings by collecting stickers from chests in the ground and spending them on the 'timeline', and telling villagers to move onto the site where you'd like the resource building to be built.Sculpting the landscape is done by clicking on the 'layer' of the world you want to manipulate, and dragging it to where you want it to be.  It's restricted by whatever layer is beneath it, though, so you won't be building any overhangs etc; and, once you've played for the first 10minutes or so, it quickly becomes apparent that all you actually need to do is flatten everything to create as much building space as possible.  This makes the world much less exciting to look at, the dragging-world-layers mechanic that was initially interesting gets old very fast, and you'll find yourself often selecting the wrong layer without any clear indication of what layer you're actually moused-over at the time.By moving the landscape around, you'll find chests containing 'stickers' - by opening these up you'll get to spend them on buying 'cards' from your 'timeline' - each card is effectively a technology that allows you to interact with your world a little more, and build more advanced resource-generating buildings.  Initially you can only manipulate the sand in your world, and you unlock grass, mountain, and deep-sea terra-moulding through this 'sticker' mechanic.  This isn't at any point enjoyable - you've already been moving the terrain around just to build things, so doing it some more to get a resource you need to progress the game is just a joyless grind.  Other unlocks include manipulating multiple layers at once, generate resources faster, and build your buildings in a 'settlement' instead of just loose in the world.Building these buildings themselves is only partially in your control - once you clear some terrain-space, a 'plot' will appear on the ground.  If you clear a big space, and have the right technology, the plot will get bigger and your villagers will build a bigger house on it.  You have no control over the building's style, rotation or purpose...a house just gets built on it.  You can also put down 'totems' which auto-build and have AoE effects on your villagers such as walking faster etc.  These houses generate 'belief' in a bubble above, which you have to click/drag on to collect, and is spent on manipulating the terrain to build more houses on.Once you unlock settlements, they become centralised belief-collection units, and unlock an additional resource - firstly 'wheat' and, later, 'ore' - luckily you don't have to click to collect these, but are auto-collected by villagers and spent on building more...you guessed it...houses.  They also unlock more...errr....houses from the timeline.  You also get the added joys of having to race your in-settlement villagers to any unused building plots, as farmers will build farms on them (to generate wheat) if your builder doesn't get there (to build a house) fast enough.  Considering that there's no 'cancel construction' button and your demolition tool costs belief to use...this gets annoying pretty quickly.The gameplay is just too repetative to enjoy at any level other than what you really try and make for yourself- and you do have to try - this game isn't fun; you make it fun.  It suffers the same sort of mistakes that Spore has - too few mechanics, too little challenge, not enough game.This may all change - the game is in early access, but the game is 49.5% complete (as of writing - version 2.0.5), and we're talking some fundemental game-design flaws here.  Your time, and money, would be better spent just going and buying Black & White again.			",76,33,1,17,30,1,17

								I know it's early access, but wow. It's bad. don't waste your money. I got it as a gift, and I feel bad for the person that got it for me, because they paid good money for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Hopefully it'll get better since it's early access, but I can just feel the ego of the tutorial narrator coming out of the screen. ""i think this and that and this is where it gets fun"" it doesn't. It stays slow and impossible, and there are very few ways to get the all important resource item: gems. It's like a play to win facebook game, except the store is broken so you cannot make anything but agonizingly slow progress. I know the developers can do better. Black and White is better than this game, and it came out when I was still in middle school. From what I understand it's been early access for over a year and has had very little improvement, so there isn't much hope. Save your money and put this game on the bad list. Whoever made it should not be allowed near a game designing project ever again. I can literally see the potentially fun game trying to poke its way through, only to be bashed down by poor design choices, like someone made a perfectly good angel food cake and then decided put habanero and garlic sauce on it, with a bit of liver chopped on it for good measure.

I can take solace in that nothing has changed from him but at the same time I can't believe the guy behind black and white 2 made this piece of garbage. This game feels like it's aimed for microtransactions in a future state and plays like a lousy tablet/cellphone port. For christ sake the ♥♥♥♥ing quit button in the menu doesn't work, it just crashes the game and then I have to go into task manager to end it.

Because of relatively early concerns the backers had Molyneux promised that this game will never have micro transactions or that it would be planned to make a mobile game or even a mobile pay to win game out of it.

								You know, its rare that I don't like a game.... very rare. With over 400 games in my library i can honestly say, its hard to make me not like a game. But if there is one award I should give to Godus its the award for best way to make me dislike a game. Lets start off from when i bought this. I bought it thinking it was an intuitive age of empires meets Sim City kind of deal. It was. However, the progression was slow, the build time for things was ridiculous after a while, the level of immersion was awful, etc, etc. But I said to myself, I said ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't dislike games, you have games in your library that most wouldn't ever want to touch. So this is just a case of the game being in early stages."" So i agreed to let the game grow. Then a couple weeks ago... i learned this would be P2P.... HOLD UP.... I can play games like Black And White for one cheap price of 20 Dollars, but for this i have to WHAT NOW. OH HEEEEEEEELLLLLLLL NO. That was the last straw. I vowed that I would not ever play this game again, and were it possible i would ask for a refund immediately. So, friends, dont buy this game. Its not worth it.P.S.: In recent statements the DEV said they would be focusing on the mobil app more, so its not even worth bothering.			",687,167,15,77,68,6,75

								I bought this game early with high hopes based all the previous works from its designer, but I have to say he lost his way along the line. This game was not originally pitched for mobile users but they developed as if it was. All commands required only one single click and swipes, instead of harnessing both mouse buttons and keyboard. A true waste of input hardware. Collecting belief is an unnecessary an cumbersome task that holds no place, or purpose for that matter, on this game's mechanics. Games from the 90's already had na automatic resource collection but Godus INSISTS, revision after revision, to maintain its boring and laborious swipe/clicking resource collecting system. why?After many complains, they added an automatic belief collector, which is nothing but a Totten with very limited range and high cost that collects belief whenever is available. As you build more of them they become increasingly more expensive, thus ultimately limiting how many you can build. Every new feature has a drawback, every design decision is a double edge sword. I really don't understand why someone with so much experience in god games is unable to simply DELIVER WHAT PEOPLE WANT.If you are reading this review, please, consider very carefully before buying this game. You will feel more frustrated with mundane tasks than excited with new discoveries. It is the truth. If this game is meant to be run on PC, it must be re-re-designed from the ground up, entirely, because as it stands, it is a casual mobile god game with an identity problem. ",179,21,4,13,16,2,26

								Pros- graphics are alright, considering- ability to actually conquer your enemies using followers- you can move the land?Cons- not really a game... more of a game engine test kinda- seems to be following the current Sonic game model in terms of updates (as in okay, bad, bad, horrible, better... etc.)- have to do the tutorial every time you restart (they say you won't in the final version, but...)- works better on a mobile than a PC, despite how they advertise- the strategy part is fighting the program as opposed to learning to work with it- god game only in that you have ""godly"" powers, so you're more of a steam roller to help your followers progress than an actual influence*WARNING* Lengthy review, because I feel like making up for the hours wasted on thisI know this is in early access, and that they are (hopefully) no where near done, but wow. Just wow. It gets worse every time it updates. I personally liked how it ran way back when I first bought it (when it was a game). The next update made both me and my brother stop loading it period (he even uninstalled) because of some stupid decisions the developers made. Now its ""playable"" (working would be a better term I think)Don't buy this program. At least not until its out of early access. I bought this program a while back, when they still had conquests (fight to colonize an area between the player and an AI) and The Book (which made it at least FEEL like what you did impacted the development of your followers, since things you did determined what they worshipped or despised). Now there are voyages, which are boring when they work and just annoying when the game tells you they're available (and they're not, so now a good portion of the screen is a button). The recent update made your somewhat interesting (though most are useless) powers more expensive (in terms of game currency), so it takes longer to do anything. The tutorial messages won't seem to go away (they're planning on hiding the tutorials, but right now the dialog box that shows up doesn't work [the mouse bugs out with it too]). The AI is only a little smarter than before, but still not all that bright. And the only competition in the game is easily wiped out (which I think is great, because they are extremely annoying. Any enemy that can wipe out most of your people WHEN THE PROGRAM ISN'T EVEN RUNNING is a horrible idea).So if you like waiting for an hour or so to get a small amount of progress (in relation to what I use to do within the first hour of ""play""), buy this. If you want a program that markets as a game, but is actually a ""sculpting"" program with lazy colonization features (if you can call it that...), here you go. But if you want an actual god game, go play Black and White or even Spore (I like Spore, I just don't consider it a god game like B&W). This isn't strategy or god game, in fact its more just simulation or a linear path. Like watching grass grow. Perhaps exactly like watching grass grow...Just warning you, it is still extremely buggy, which is to be expected of something in Early Access. Also, it will probably get much worse before it gets any better. Personally, I'm done with it, since most of those near 500 hours were spent just letting it sit and do whatever with little to no interaction on my part. That zen part of the description? That's trying to achieve peace after all your followers stream out like cattle from your settlement into a deadly swamp, immediately wiping out your settlement. The incredible power you wield? Thats your ability to click the quit button when the game is lagging to hell and using 8GB of RAM (really 22cans? Please work on your efficiency). Making games is hard for sure (I'm a CS major who makes games, so I get their pain [maybe...]), but this feels like they're running in circles after their own tails to do what they want to do (which is fine, unless what you want is going to extremely limit the player's actions in horrible and ultimately stupid ways) instead of focusing on making the program an actual GAME.All in all, I wouldn't suggest this to my worst enemy, much less some person I have no grudge with. There's a reason there are so many bad reviews for this. Don't spend money on Godus. Just save yourself the grief. Because unless things REALLY change, Godus will never live up to its tags and developer descriptions.P.S. You can tell they're being lazy, because they just tinted the skins for the followers (the last update added multi-colored skinned followers so they aren't all just tan, but the Astari [a rival civilization of breeders...?] are all messed up by this, making black Astari with tan heads and other random bits...) to, I guess, make it seem like they're making more progress. Lovely how they focus on new skins for followers instead of maybe making the program run smoother, isn't it?			",240,60,0,49,24,1,11

After an initial ease-in period, most of the game's content is locked behind time gates. Some of these gates are more annoying than others, but it all pushes the game towards a very slow, very stilted pace. Collecting belief and wheat and other reasources has a rather fun, tactile flow to it, but the wait for these payouts is so long that you'll rarely be interested in actually hanging around in-game for them to pop up.There are definitely some fun elements to the game, such as the competition between your people and the indigenous, party-loving race that threatens to lure your villagers away with promises of good times. However, every good idea seems to come with some small caveat that hinders full enjoyment of them. In the case of the inter-racial rivalry, the problem is that it continues to simulate even when you aren't playing, meaning you could come back from taking a break from your tribe only to find that everyone got bored of waiting for you and jumped ship, leaving you with scores of empty houses and a tanked happiness rating.If you want a game that you'll pop onto for a few minutes to an hour at a time to gather resources and make minimal land gains, or something that you can leave on in the background while you play other games, work, or slack off watching youtube videos about games you may or may not be interested in buying, then this game might be right for you. Otherwise? Give it a while. It's in early access yet, and 22Cans claim to have some incredibly interesting plans for the future. If they can't deliver in the end, then nothing wasted. If they do, (and I really do hope that they can) then you won't have burned yourself out on a lesser version prior to release.A note: In its current state, as a game, Godus is not worth its $20 asking price. However, if you're interested in following the development process of an ambitious (and probably overly so) title backed by some very passionate people, it might be worth it for you in order to follow the game along. That's a very big, very tentative 'might', however.			",159,44,0,24,27,4,22

								Maybe someday this will be the next God Game promised from the kickstarter, but this isn't it. More like Farmville with even more clicking and waiting. Many systems don't make sense such as farming and every advancement forces you to wait longer and longer to do more things. This is more like the anti God Game. And the fact that this was supposedly the re-design to make things better is not a good sign for what's to come. Again, the game is 49.5 percent complete at this time so maybe the next patch will make things better. But they've gone too long without proper updates and this is just horrible.

								Why is this mobile game on a PC platform store?--2 years later and the game is by the Dev's estimate about 50% done.The Kickstarter page and Steam Store page seem to offer Godus as a God game with battles against rival tribes and control over the tasks of your followers. This is not what the game is.Essentially, it's a cow-clicker where you click, wait for the timer to reset, then click again. That's it.I've played this game for about 70 hours - mostly whilst watching something in another window - trying to find out when the game opens up and gets interesting. I have concluded that it doesn't.			",111,8,2,7,12,2,16

								This game is just a mobile pay to play game with a very shoddy pc cover.  To do anything in the game requires gems, which can only be gotten by sacrificing your people, but in order to sacrifice your people you need to have enough faith to control them which requires you to purchase faith with gems.  It's either that, or you go and wait 20+ minutes in order to collect faith from the huts.  I would not recomment this game.  Godus is a pathetic pc port of a mobile game that requires you to buy gems or wait hours in order to do anything.			",200,42,0,29,22,1,25

								I really wanted to recommend this game. The potential of Godus is off the charts. However, you know what they say about potential if it's unrealized. So much work needs to be done, and the lack of patches (as everyone else has noted) leaves me wondering what happened to my twenty bucks. Forty bucks if you count that I bought this for my brother as well.The game could be tremendously fun. I've spent plenty of time on it as you can see the number of hours I've spent in game. There is just something unequivocal about throwing a meteor at your enemy's buildings and watching his followers running around, screaming, and on fire. On my more benevolent side, though, developing my civilization, and watching it grow in the peaceful world is fulfilling on it's own. It is a time sink, and the number of times I've clicked my mouse is somewhat preposterous. Like my brother said, you click your mouse more times than in Diablo, which is saying something.The real issue is lack of updates. It can be difficult in later stages of the game to accumulate the resource cards neccessary to advance. When storms begin (when you've reached farming) having to click on each and every abode to repair is insane. It takes quite a bit of game time to develop your cliff sculpting ability which makes it somewhat easier to clear areas for abodes and towns.Anyway, I really would like to recommend this game, but I need to see more work done to improve and complete the game.

Yes 22cans is a bunch of 100% dishonest scumbags.    I just really do not have any words to do justice to how totally 100 % Crappy this game is.  It is all about timers, timers on a pc game people.  Some of them reaching into 24-48 hours.  Let me be clear here, Timers just like a free to play game on a PC game.The height of creativity from the so called developers is, Lemmings.  Yes folks, they cannot even make their own idea, they have to steal from worthless 1990's games.I could go on for but there is no point.Run the hell away from this crap.    The name of the game should be Crapus.   Do not be Godused like me, do not buy this crap for any reason.  Do not even buy this crap for people you hate.Good day. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I like this game, I really do, I want to play this game for hours and just watch my little followers as they do things but sadly I can't.The game is a port from a mobile game and it shows, the controls were quite clearly designed for a touchscreen and some of the instructions still tell you to 'tap' things to get them to do something, alongside the controls it is also evident by its stability, I know this is an early access game but it has crashed 5 times in the last 2 hours, even for an early access game that's pretty bad.The game itself however is a fun one, like I said, I like it, I like the sculpting mechanics, I like the followers behaviour, I like the slow gameplay, not everyone will though, it's a very niche catergory of gameplay and it takes a while for the game to kick into gear.In conclusion I like this game but I can't recommend it yet, it just isn't ready yet and I don't when it will be ready, it shows promise but just can't deliver YET, notice YET.

								Let me first say this: I know this is an Early Access Game.However, Early Access or not, unless this game changes some pretty fundamental concepts, Godus will remain a very unsatisfying experience.Godus feels incredibly...  Passive.The nearest comparison to Godus is, perhaps, Black and White and/or Black and White 2.  The thing is, though, that if you go into this game with that attitude or with that mindset, you will be horribly disappointed.  You control almost nothing.  You don't get to dictate placement of buildings; and even if you did, there's only one kind of ACTUAL building (houses of various ""tech level"") to create, and you do so by simply clicking and dragging land into as wide a section of flat, open area as you can manage.This game is almost entirely clicking and dragging.  There's nearly nothing else to do.  No commands to issue, no challenges to face, no interaction with your followers, nothing to demonstrate your godly powers upon (and even if there were, it would be terribly unsatisfying, like everything else in the game).The art style is bland and so minimalistic as to be legitimately unattractive.The user interface is one of the worst I've ever dealt with.The only content in the game is pointless expansion coupled with some insipid, uninspired, unrewarding ""challenge"" missions where you take on ""another player"" (read: insultingly obvious pre-scripted ""bot"" with an avatar that is a photo of someone).Honestly, I can't warn you away from this game enough.  Look elsewhere.  Maybe Reus or Black and White 2.  There's (probably) nothing for you here; you'd be better off with a Facebook game, because that's exactly what this feels like.

								To begin with, I would never recommend this game to anyone for both gameplay and ethical purposes.The whole purpose of the game is to increase the population of your ""village"". This is achieved by *drumroll* flattening ground. Not only is this boring, the mechanics of flattening the ground is clunky, buggy, and frustrating.This game is nothing what it advertises. It is also nothing compared to the other game ""equivalents"" made 10 years ago.$19.99 is not worth a game that is supposed to be free and deserted. You would have more fun playing ""Earth Flattening Simulator 2013"" ",131,19,0,17,11,1,4

								I was looking at this game while it was majorly discounted and decided to give it a go. At first, the game wasn't too bad.  But after eight hours of practically the same thing, I was down right bored.  ""Sculpt, Click, click. ::Make more villagers.::  Click, click.  Oh hey, a box.  Sculpt. Another box.  Click, click.""  That is pretty much all there is to it so far.  Sculpt the land so your villagers can expand.  Sure, there are some 'God Battles' but I found they were too easy and lack-luster.  This would be a game that I might pick up every once in a while, for a half hour or so at a time, but definitely isn't worth $19.99.			",4,2,0,18,6,0,4

								it looks great, and the idea is kinda cool. i still think it looks cool and the idea is great but the execution is just plain meh. you start the game and you click. you click a lot. you click to shape flat pieces of earth, you click to remove trees, you click to expand, you click to get your people to make more houses, you click to get belief. seriously, if that sounded boring then i think you can understand why there is a red thumbs down symbol in front of this text.when i started playing this i thought, meh it's not finished yet, it will get better. it hasn't done that so far.it's still clicky clicky and as this game doesn't have a do-over-button (you have to eff around in some shady part of the roaming folder i believe to do that) if you don't play for over a month like me you end up wondering what the hell it was you were doing.there's also the gameworld itself. as i said it looks nice, no problem there but when you play it full screen you would think you have a huge patch of stuff to look at. wrong, it's still a small square in the middle where it's just mocking me showing it's small renderdistances. this is really annoying when you go all a-sprawling with your towns and houses.. so what i do now is open it, update it, click a few times on a few houses, wonder why i spend the money on this and exit the game. if you ever want to buy a polished turd then look no further, it looks great but it's still♥♥♥♥♥♥ ",32,5,3,3,25,2,6

Early Access Review
								Godus is a game with a lot of potential, but in its current state it is not worth the cost. It feels like a free phone app with excessive clicking and no real goal (made worse by the fact that the playable world size is -very- limited at this stage). The current multiplayer feature is nothing more than a mini-scenario lasting around 5 minutes that is won by whoever can shape (click) the land around them the fastest. Normally the lack of content wouldn't be something to criticize on an early access game, but this one has been horribly slow to bring in updates and new content. The creator of this game, Peter Molyneux, who has made some great games in the past, definately over-hyped and promised much more than he could deliver. At least for now, this is a game to avoid. If it should ever get into a more finished state and live up to the claims of being ""The Regenesis of the God Game"" I'll happily change my review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Some 9 months in early acess, and the same problems remain. This game is not a worthy sucessor to the great titles of Populus, Black and White, etc. This has the feel of a f2p mobile game that involves waiting, clicking, and sticker collecting. There is no gameplay as of such, and while we are told to wait, be patient and it's only 49% complete, for a game that has been in development for over a year, it is very disapointing.

								It has all the good intentions and the basic framework necessary for something but it falls flat and become very clicky and ""rinse and repeat"" after the first six hours.  The challenge is increase by making the terrain more frustrating (which, IMHO, is more of an annoyance with the tools to work the more complex terrain being earned achievements AND cost features).  The AI  is an oxymoron...it simply isn't.  It is not my desire to be hateful.  The plebs are simply doltish.The click to release/collect stuff in the UI is unpleasant.  It works at the micro level, but at the MACRO level it is completely unworkable and the (""town"") solutions provided are absolutely untennable from a cost perspective -- that is, balance is beyond crack-smoking wacked.  This is where the suspension-of-disbelief completely breaks down.  A god should not be designating ""towns"".  BAH HUMBUG.  Villages, communities, towns, etc are emergent!  They should be self-organizing and set their own boundaries.  This how nonsense is just a silly ""gold sink"" that shatters the illusion of divinity and turns reduces the game to a poor hack of stone-age SimCity.All this aside, I will keep my eye on this title.  If 22 Cans doesn't go♥♥♥♥♥♥up and keeps their oars in the water, they have built a solid foundation with this product.  I believe it is a fine spring board.  It is sold as advertised.I am not unhappy with the product nor do I have buyers regrets.  I believe it is worth what I paid for it.  I do not believe it is worth full price of $19.99.  If you can get it at 50%-90% discount, then it is a value to have in the kit as this title grows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Early Access games are incompleted games still in development. Some of them are already entertaining, but Godus really feels incomplete.I would like to say ""wait until it's finished"", but it feels like it will never be. The development team rarely updates the game or interacts with the community, a community that already lost hope of seeing a finished product.It makes me sad to say I've lost hope, too. In the beginning it was very promising, I find the art style and sculpt system good, but we believe focusing too much on the mobile version made it go astray. Now I only hope the development team learned from their unfortunate mistakes, and I wish them luck for their next projects.If you still want to play it, search for it in the app shop of your mobile.

								I played this game for over 60 hours now . I played every update so far but with the last one it got more clear that Godus never was meant for something else but a mobile game . You can play around 10 minutes before you have to wait again forever . It is very monotonous and if you played the mobile version you will see that it is the most standart pay to play game that you can find , even though Peter Molyneux said it over and over again how much he hates these kind of games. You get the same crap on the PC version but here you pay 20 bucks up front . The constant notifications on the PC version asking me to spend gems ( which i would have to buy with real money on the mobile version) are annoying as hell. Never will i ever again buy something that involves 22 cans or Peter Molyneux .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do NOT buy this. Selling a typical mobile game, which even is free for mobile devices for 20 bucks is outrageous. It will have you wait for hours to gather resources and new followers. While you can purchase those via the in-game currency to speed things up, which you can also do in almost every other mobile game there is, charging that amount of money for an unfinished, poorly executed mobile port is simply criminal. I really wish I had read the reviews before buying it (hoping to find a nice god-game after the genre didn't do that good in the past couple of years), because I would have avoided wasting money on it. Hopefully the Dev's will get the s*** they deserve for doing this.			",13,1,0,3,3,0,0

								Unfortunately this is a game that gets worse with every update. I had really looked forward to a new, Populous-style game, but that is just not what this game is. I was unimpressed at first due to how much clicking and dragging and waiting for things to happen was involved in the game. Coming back a few months later to check in, the developers seem to have 'solved' these issues by making literally everything work off a timer, which you have to spend gems to speed up.Granted the gems don't require purchases, but why the hell would I want to mimic the mechanic of pay-to-win? Maybe I should just attach a slot-machine handle to my desk and pull that as I play so I can experience the fun of being in a casino as well.

								I wanted to like this game. I really tried to like this game. I played it for 51 hours, across different updates and really did want to like this game...This feels like a stillborn. 9 months of excitement leading up to utter soul crushing disappointment. I can only hope the team can hit the whiteboards and figure out a strategy to pull it together. If they do, I'll be more than happy to come back and re-review the game. In its current state, with the company being pretty much bankrupt and hemorrhaging staff, it's not likely going anywhere until Molyneux gets picked up by a producer or sells the IP...

								I purchased this game very early on and thoroughly enjoyed it. However the updates continually made the game more unstable and removed key features from it that I had thoroughly enjoyed at the onset. I stopped playing after more than 60 hoping that when I came back months later the game would be a bit more stable as it had been in previous patches, however it seems 22cans has since been dissolved. What a massive disappointment. This game had so much potential before some soulless money hungry CEO came in and forced them to adapt the game as a mobile pay for play app. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.

								I really dont understand what happened with this game. When it first game out it was really interesting, although it needed work. They recently did a huge update to it, and now it is basically unplayable. There is a new mechanic that rates how happy your people are...aaand it is impossible to understand. So now you will have people leaving your group without reason. Additionally they have made the game extreemely freemium heavy. You used to be able to play click simulator all you wanted (this game), but now the amount of faith that you produce is so small, and the amount required to do anything is so large you have to wait several hours between building. All in all don't get this game. If you want the same experience just click your mouse over and over again for 3 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I LOVE god games. I have been an avid fan since the days of Populous, and I own them all. I resisted buying this one until it went on sale and I am so glad I did. Me, a person that will happily play Black and White 1 and 2 over and over again trying to perfect my game ... I was bored with Godus before I was done with the tutorial. I know a game is bad when I start to play with my phone in the middle of the game. I know it is still in progress, but the errors being made in this game are fundamental and they need to be fixed now if the game is going to succeed. Problem 1. The sculpting ability is sloppy. I used up my belief just trying to uncover the chests I saw poking out. The ground movement is not fluid and big chunks disappear or you spend belief and nothing changes.Problem 2. It is silly to expect a human to sit and watch a screen where it takes almost 10 minutes to build a basic abode on the grass and even longer for belief to refill at each abode. The only reason this is acceptable in online games is because we are surfing, not watching.Problem 3. Gamers HATE to click every house to pick up money, belief, mana, whatever. This got old about the same time it was invented in online games. To put it in a game that we paid for is a huge mistake. It is a feature of FREE games, and that is why they are free. Problem 4. GEMS, really? I don't care how you are planning for their use. Call them anything else! Something original would be fantastic.Problem 5. MINI-GAMES? I didn't buy a collection of mini-games. I bought a god game and that is what I want to play.Successful god games succeed because they start off handing you power, making you feel responsible for something, and allow you to use that power for evil or good and still continue to play and progress through the game. Gods don't spend gems, they don't collect belief bubbles, and they don't agonize over sculpting a bit of land because it might cost too much belief. The kind of god I want to be creates mountains and then knocks them down to make an ocean instead because I feel like looking at blue today. I want to sacrifice followers on Monday and grant wishes on Tuesday because I feel like it. AND I DO NOT WANT TO CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK LITTLE HOUSES TO COLLECT ANYTHING! Thank you for your time and attention. I hope this game gets a huge revamp and a phoenix rises from its ashes so I can change my review.			",60,67,0,52,75,0,48

								This game is a pay-to-click PoS poorly 'designed' for iOS and other mobile devices, it was not ever designed for a PC market and you should not inflict it upon your computer.Even after the mythical and very long awaited v2.0 update the core mechanics have not changed.  The developers have simply tweaked some values to 'reduce the amount of clicking'.These 'changes' (which apparently took 3-4 months to implement) increase the value of in-game currency given for each click, but increase the duration between clicks. This effectively means you spend more time doing nothing instead of clicking; not a very enlightened trade-off.The ability to double click to ‘sculpt’ the terrain has also been removed, thus making terrain ‘sculpting’ (flattening) less clicky, having the amazing effect of making it slower and similarly (or perhaps more) RSI inducing.The end results of v2.0 update is to make the game slower, and leave the player doing nothing instead of clicking. If I was a cynic, instead of a realist, I might suggest that this would be a good place to insert ‘use gems to speed up <insert verb here>’ mechanic, and the inevitable and corresponding ‘purchase gems for real <insert currency here>’ in the store that ‘doesn’t exist’.Good times…Do your body, mind, soul, wallet, and computer hardware a favour, and stay as far away from this cancerous and ultimately unrewarding excuse for a ‘game’ as you are able.Do not ever pay money for this ‘game’.Do not accept it as a gift; be offended if someone tries to give it to you.The horror... the horror...

								Picked godus up because hey its a god sim. Wasen't expecting much because it's a moly project.It's a click fest that is just broken enough to be extreamly frustrating......call it candy crush syndrome. It playes a lot like a ten minuite time waster on an IPhone. Enough timers and enough delays that it goes from being in the grove playing to hitting a brick wall with regularity.That said using a time honored tradition of cheating you can plow ahead more or less at your own speed. And then there are the storms......................................A micromanaging god game where you can lead your followers around as needed, sculpt the land, and drop monuments to encourage things..................and they put in enviromental hazards that can wipe entire city blocks of buildings so you don't get any faith AKA god cash until you tell each and every follower to go out and repair houses. And by the time you are done it's ususually just before the next storm because the followers are really really stupid and you have to keep on them pumping the god given endurance or they never make it before the next storm.Personally I say avoid this one. review current as of april update for godus.

								This game started off with MASSIVE potential but it seems as they ""develop"" the game it just gets worse and worse. I'm not sure where they are going with the game because each new release feels like there is a completely new direction.I bought this game July-ish 2014 and it has done nothing but get worse. This game is most definatly NOT worth the current cost. This should be free until they figure out what the heck they are doing.Maybe, just MAYBE when the game is out of beta it'll be playable. Give it another 2 years though... :(The reason for my distrust in this game and Peter Molyneux is the fact that he accepted SO much money from Kickstarter and Early Access Release wthout creating much of anything.I'm a little upset at the development delays and this article shines some light on some serious issues: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/13/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29 ",447,93,7,66,59,3,55

								In earlier versions I actually thought this game was kinda fun, even though it lacked a lot of content. I've now tried the latest versions and found the game to be less fun than earlier. Waiting for belief to be able to sculpt was bad enough, but now having to wait for food to build as well took the fun out of it for me. In addition they put in an annoying feature that makes your population drop if they're unhappy. I tried deleting some abodes to make room for bigger ones, but found that I then had no food to build the larger abodes and the deleting of abodes made my population so unhappy that large portions of them moved away. You might argue that I played it the wrong way, but it seems weird that it should be -so- punishing trying to edit your layout.			",128,31,1,45,24,0,36

								I'm going to start with saying. I was a huge Populous fan ( it was from the deceased company Bullfrog ..... which for those to young to remember, is when we had truly great God Sims like Dungeon Keeper and the aformentioned Populous Franchise ). For some reason no one makes great *God Sim* games anymore ............ I had hope for this. But after paying and playing this garbage. I can safely say this is a smack in the face to Populous. It's NOT fun at all, it's sluggish boring and repetitive. Esentially Populous The Beginning without all the cool fun streamlined combat, village building and awesome world altering spells. ( Everything is a chore in this game ) Seriously people save your money and rather grab yourself a copy of *Populous The Beginning* ........... yes it's dated but it's still a million times better then this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Kind Regards, Peace to my brothers and sisters,Jared			",37,2,0,3,4,0,7

I will i got about 2-3 hours of fun out of it but it quickly turned to things taking hours to happen and on top of that you have to click every building over and over to collect the resourse used. On top of that you can only get a few settelments a item that pools the buildings together so you do not have to click them all, except that you can only get 3 with the resourse then you are stuck with buying more with gems that you will have to buy with real money when they open the store. The game plays completly like a free to play. And damn you to Steam you need to put a large warning on anygame that is going to have a microtrasaction system so people don't pay 20$ to get to have a free to play style game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Reviewing GODUS as is at this time is not an option, the new build has mostly revised the rules around the game and thus invalidated a lot of the issues and complaints I would have listed. However, instead, I'm going to review the development narrative behind GODUS. Specifically, I'm going to look at Peter Molyneux's approach to developing games.Molyneux reminds me of a child who's managed to find himself in a factory full of paint cans and brushes. Every colour is available to him, every possible brush thickness and shape, he wanders through the factory, his mouth open in a permanent expression of amused shock, his fingers delicately stroking the paintbrushes, his eyes full of childlike wonder. His imagination explodes, runs riot, he dreams of wonderful fantastic vistas, much like a child's imagination unchecked is capable of roaming so free and so far. However, like a lot of children, his imagination far exceeds his fine motor skills, so when it comes to taking the brush and applying paint to canvas...... we get a splotchy mess.GODUS is a splotchy mess. Fable was a splotchy mess. Most games that Molyneux has been involved in have been to some extent, a splotchy mess. The successes have come about when the rest of the team have been able to refine the splotchy messes and turn them into something that resembles what is actually either going on in Molyneux's head, or a marketable game, or somewhere between the two. It's tricky to figure out where the magic is, when it hits, like Black and White, it opens up whole new ways of looking at games in general, but unfortunately, you wind up seeing a lot of splotchy messes between the rare flashes of inspiration.Not that it stops him. Now this would be perfectly human and forgivable were it not for the fact that Peter has a ... well, an almost Steve Jobs like ""Reality Distortion Field"" that he projects. It's as if there are two different worlds in existence at any one time when Peter talks about his games, and when he talks, we're getting a glimpse of the game -he- sees, and not the one -we- see. Case in point would be ""Curiosity : What's inside the cube"". Peter called it a profoundly lifechanging experience. Pete, mate, IT WAS A GAME WHERE YOU CLICKED CUBES. IT WAS COWCLICKER FOR APPLE DEVICES. THAT IS NOT A LIFECHANGING EXPERIENCE.One day someone will tether Pete to the ground, and then we may once again see a return to form like the Bullfrog games of old, until then, we're going to see splotchy messes, infused with occasional strokes of genius, but often way, way oversold and far over marketed by Mr. Molyneux himself. Take anything that comes from him OR his dev team with liberal quantities of salt, and look up information about the game from other sources, then make your own decision if things like GODUS might appeal in the long run.

								I'm afraid I haven't played the latest patch (1.3), but stopped at 1.2. Sadly, this game (while it has promise) was fun and new for a few hours, but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations put forth with the video interviews. This is Peter, so I did go into it with a grain of salt. However, the gameplay aspects were shallow in the extreme, only rewarding flat lands and even the existing gameplay of the ""40% completed"" being incomplete to a marked degree.The detractors have valid points (if poorly stated). This plays more like a FarmVille game than the ""re-envisionment of the God game"" that was discussed by the developers. There is an abundance of clicking, even after settlements. Most of the gameplay subsisted of creating level land so that your followers could just build more bigger houses, and discovering cards (like ""wood"" after you've de-leveled several forests). It can be ""mindless fun"", but then, you are missing out on the whole ""God-game"" aspect of control and direction which was presented in many interviews/demos before the beta started.Everyone purchasing should fully understand that this is a beta (actually closer to alpha, as key features have not been included and many key features are being re-designed), and my review was written from that standpoint. I will update it as time goes on.As of recently, the total disregard for the community who funded the project, as well as (now going on the fifth month without an update to the game) how they are dealing with the development process is wildly in violation of how Peter stated during both the kickstarter and during the initial Steam greenlight project. Even a complete re-write should see more participation than this from the developers.Their behavior is more toward a company who will never provide a product (a la cash grab), even if their intentions are good. Three months since a decent blog post or any sort of communication (besides a tweet of ""we are still working on it"") - this is a real slap to the face on many decent developers with far fewer resources than 22Cans.At this point, I believe the company should be renamed ""22Cant's"". As a developer myself, I do not condone their lack of communication and development progress after nearly half a year, and most developers with greenlit projects don't follow this mindset, either. All of the vitrol from the players could have been avoided with a decent communication model, and better development standards (			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So, in B&W1 I was given a handful of followers. Same as Godus. In B&W, I would create disciples, plot new farms and actually help harvest and collect food for the village, putting it in a village store. This was to encourage growth, namely, reproduction. Coupled with the food collection there was a wood collection aspect to ""pay"" for the newly constructed farms, and as new villagers were bred, I would build new houses, and civic centers to encourage growth. In Godus, I move land to make new structure plots simply appear. Then I would click and wait. Then once those are full, I move more land to make more plots appear to click them and wait. Then a new ""stage"" would have me move land to make farm plots appear to click on them and wait. See, in the First B&W, there was in interconnected web system of needs and wants. These systems would pull on other aspects creating a complex balancing act between resource collection and its application.In Godus, all the needs have been removed. Simplifying the strategy to, clear land for buildings, click on their plots to make them appear, then wait for people to fill them. Repeat as needed.This is the same simplification that led B&W2 to being a simple matter of power resource collection to build huge swaths of cites, which ultimately attracted all the other inhabitants on the island to migrate to your city. If you did nothing but power build, the game was done in 4 hours. A shame, as it still had hints of complex balancing systems, and even incorporated an army system that was really a waste of resources that could be used to build the city bigger to... Win. Godus however, stripped the last vestiges that could be considered ""strategic gameplay"" away, instead relying on a large enough playing field that it becomes a matter of setting a patrol of looking for things to click, click them, and while you’re waiting, make more room for building to be clicked on.I guess what I’m getting at is this game, hell, the entire God Sim genre, has been simplified. Gone is the complex strategy of determining if that last bit of wood from the nearly clear cut forest on your land was to be used for a new house, to extend your borders of influence, or to offer it as a gift to another uncontrolled village to hopefully win their belief, or throw it at their houses to smash them and make them fear and respect you, or... ANYTHING! The game truly felt like a sandbox.Godus is like playing with a stopwatch. You click you wait, you decide where you’d prefer to click some more, level that land by clicking, then click some new plots to have new clickable buildings. I don’t know if I’ve made my point entirely. I fear I haven’t. I fear you wouldn’t know what to do with this information. I fear you would rather play Farmville than reinstall B&W1 and see what was so damn good about that game. I fear this because of this 2.0 ""reinvention"". I fear for the future of god games. I don’t know if the world will ever be blessed with another B&W1. I kind of doubt it ever will. I hope for this game. I hope it can become one tenth the game B&W1 was, IS! It isn’t. It can’t be. Not with the fundamental game design it is sculpted around. Replay B&W1.Really take the time to see the game play system. (Resource management, base/city building, population management, a true belief system, critical thinking and open ended problem solving (to toss the rock or place the rock? (good or evil))Learn from past mistakes (B&W2 city building earning ""impressive"" points, destroyed your belief system)And make a god Sim worth of the title. Godus is an awful game in comparison to its predecessors. I wish it wasn’t. Only you hold its keys though.Leave it as the card collecting, sticker sticking, Farmville tablet gaming, thoughtless, strategic less pretty looking time wasterOrRethink its very core gameplay rules, and remake the entire game, pulling from the resoundingly popular and honestly, best God game in existence, Godus’ big brother, B&W1. You are a brave development company, weathering the public as you have. Bravo! But you do have our money, and almost every one of us is chanting ""BAIT AND SWITCH!' ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Aug 11, 2014: An update came out, and I'm okay with parts, but then very unhappy with outhers. There's not an advisary civilization called the Ashtari. They first make their appearence and jibbering little men with wooden masks and they taunt your followers. At first it was amusing.The commentary int eh game help, but SUPPRISE! Thsoe Ashtari are going to bleed your population dry. If you;re not as happy or happier than the Ashtari, you will bleed population. You know nothing of this mechanic until you quite possibly sarcificed population for gems, which they make sound like it's a good or necessary thing. To me, this new ""feature"" is WAY imbalanced. Where they can steal a good number of people in an hour, it take any building 30 minutes to repopulate when emptied. Whitch the fact that you can't impove happiness later, you might as well be trying to use a bucket with a damned hole in it. The programmers let you see your happiness meter where it stis quite close to the middle if you didn't sacrifice a single person, but the Ashtari start with a higher happiness, so you're screwed. And if you didn;t buy cards prudently, they you're even more screwed.Voyages are more defined, but the problem is that if the main game still continues while the voyage continues, you're still apt to lose population to the Ashtari and you can;t do much about it because youlre scarmbling to scrape for gems and stickers. Still missing in an official reset. You still have to delete gamefiles if you messed up. Also missing is the ability to make multiple saves. The game autosaves for you, but there will be only ONE save.Added was the commentary, which I first though was helpful, but then it was just a bloody nightmare. The best thing to do is to play at your own pace. Screw what teh commentary says. Build your population base up and get as many freebies as you can before really expanding. In essence, Turtle harder than the main commentator.The game is imporving, but it keeps rtaking steps back. Hopefully after the next update, I will have better things to add?I know that the game is an early release, but it still feels overwhelmingly stacked against you.  Jan 21,2014: While playable on a PC, this game would porbably be better on tablets, or even comuters with tough screens and windows 8.The meta-story in the game is somewhat interesting, and if you don't know better, you might think it was an actual chat room.The game also has the feel of an older games done by the same guy. Notably, it's VERY similar to Populous. Serious updates and fixes are needed. A bug that proves fairly annoying is that after storms, you cannot rouse residents to fix their houses. The game shows promise with further development, but currently, it feels like an empty shell.			",48,36,0,31,44,0,26

I funded it through kickstarter in December 2012 and waited for it very eagerly, watching the weekly youtube updates, dying to see a preview of the gameplay. Then it got released on Steam, with the game being much cheaper than having funded it through kickstarter. AND THEN you notice the gameplay and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ A horrible ipad app that could have easily been developed by the same guys from Zynga/EA.  This game is the definition of an RSI-inducing game. Clicking everywhere, everything and with little motivation. I won;t even bother going into the whole GEMS thing which we all know is going to show up in a very stealthy mode IF THERE EVER IS ANOTHER UPDATE! How long has it been now without any news from the team, 3 months? ♥♥♥♥ you Peter Molyneux. I'm never buying anything even remotely related to you ever again.Steam should have a refund system for early access games like this that take advantage of gullible(or maybe hopeful is the correct word) people and scam you in the most irritant way possibble.

								Goddus - a game gone wrong, by a development team with no clear path forward. (A review on the PC version only)A sad outcome for a premise that promised so much. Goddus has been plauged numerous problems relating to delivering on the vision that was published on Kickstarter. Without focusing on the many broken promises, or failure to live up to (what I think are realistic) expectations, Goddus is underwhelming in all aspects. The long promised story mode is a poor text only background story accessed by clicking on chests. The poor execution of gaining power (mana) and the general lack of multiplayer leaves the player without much to do. The game as it stands (this long into development) is simply not fun. The game's (re)design is substandard, the execution is substandard and the removed features such as multiplayer is incomprehensible.  The game is supposed to be around 52% finished (this has only risen about 12% over the last 18 months or so I THINK (speculation on my part), yet is now in the years behind schedule.  The funding of this game appears to be based on deception or at the very best, incompetent promises without the ability to make good on the promises. Don't you fall into the same trap that I did. Put your money towards another game or save it until Godus is eveually finished (or you reach pension age - which ever comes first).  This game is dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You click, and then you click, and after that you click again. Finally you click some more and after a while you realize all you do is click, click, click and click some more.Godus looks and feels like you're playing a mobile game on your pc with an android/ios emulator. Oh well, at least it's a fun game right? Wrong. All you do is click to cut trees, click to build houses and buildings, click to modify the terrain, click to open chests, and when your power is low you click the countless belief bubbles. Than you can go back to click to cut trees, build houses and so on... About the looks... just take a look at the screenshots in the store page. I'm not one of those narrow minded people who think graphics are everything, but tell me those graphics are not something similar to what you see in games made for smartphones, tablets or even facebook.  I can't believe the same guy who made the masterpiece Black & White is responsible for this debacle. Granted, Molineux is not the most consistent game designer out there, but even his bad stuff (Fable series, the movies) were not complete disasters. Anyone who played and enjoyed Black & White will agree that game gives you that ""God"" feeling. You are in control of a powerful being that can be worshiped, feared or both.  In Godus, despite the name, you don't feel like you're playing as a God at all. It feels more like a city management game where you are some kind of mayor with some superpowers.This game is about what, 60% complete? I doubt it will get any better once it's finished. Huge disappointment. Thanks mr. Molineaux.			",301,50,8,41,35,2,47

								The IDEA is very fun and casual, but mechanic really cripple this title.  This would actually be better suited as a phone app because using a cursor gets very tedious at times.  The game itself is not very fun, and I'm failing to see what the big deal is, Peter Molyneux.  I regret spending my money on early access to this thing, and I do not recommend anyone do so.  I don't think it will be a good game, but definetely do not spend money on this thing before it's finished.UPDATE: I wrote this review 9 months ago, when I had put what ended up being an unfair-to-me amount of time into the game in order to write a decent review.  Now that the game has been updated, I dare not make that mistake again.  I can tell you now that after a large change in format, the game is still essentially the same.  It STILL needs to be a phone app because that is the feel of it.  It's not an RTS because you're forced to wait in real time for things to occur and resources to gather.  In the audio tutorial Molyneux gives in this new updated version, he reminds players to, ""build with strategy,"" and I find that very amusing, considering there is no concievable part of the game I would say involves strategy, other than the miniscule quests to retrieve more stickers for power-ups, and that addition almost seems to have been added with the purpose of giving the player something to take their mind off the fact that they're being forced to wait in real time for their fun to begin.  The game is cruel to the players, in this regard.  Honestly, I don't understand how a team of developers can continue with a title like this, or how it could possibly still be recieving funding.  That is how unfun this thing is.Honestly, the one thing I was just waiting to hear Molynieux say throughout the entire audio tutorial was, ""Now, you may want to get up and go do somrthing else for a bit, because large abodes take up to 20 minutes at time to produce anything usable in-game.""Do not buy this early access.  I still do not think it will make a good finished product.Final verdict: cell phone app trying to play with the big boys.			",37,11,0,3,20,0,8

								When you purchase an early access game the idea is to help a project move along because you believe it will be good. Well this project may be good when it gets released.... In a retro sort of way. The updates to this game are non-existant. It appears the developers for the most part stopped work on it. When this game actually is released it'll be like us going back to play NES, it may be interesting for a day but then we can go back to the virtual reality games. This game has been on sale so many times in early access its pathetic. Don't bother. The game itself, its a decent alpha, with 0 replayability.			",101,2,2,16,13,0,19

Early Access Review
								Reviewing after 2.0 update. Entire game has significantly changed, though none for the better.The graphics have been downgraded, much of the game now would navigate better if it were played via tablet so tasks like going through the horizontal progress bar are aggravating at best.The clicking has been removed in lieu of clicking once and dragging. This however has lead to a complex system of clicking, holding, dragging, and often has undesirable or confusing outcomes. IE being unable to escape a tutorial because you're unsure which way to click or hold or drag the mouse. The actual gameplay has become very confusing from the original. You set up town centers and designate parts of the population for different roles, but why? Afterwards the population seems to do little to nothing and understanding how to control them or what to do with them was inexplicable to me.If you find any of this review confusing its likely because I was confused about how to even understand the game. Certain aspects are simple, others overly complex, the new sticker system is very tiresome. There are abundant reports of crashing and bug problems but none of these were problems with my set up. So the only problem is that the game, the gameplay, the plot, continue to disappoint. If you're interested in this game, then do not buy it until it is a finished product. Last early access game that I'll ever back. For a game I had high hopes for, it has disappointed through each and every update.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game as it is now... well I'm not going to write down a bible of complaints, I'm just going to say the same thing the other 779 people are saying below me. The game is about clicking the land as if you have parkinson's decease, that's about it. Unless they add a REAL ""godlike"" concept like Black and White or Populous the game is barely entretaining and becomes repetitive after 20 mins of playing. Do not buy.			",57,11,0,6,6,0,4

Molenuex has gone mad trying to charge money for a Free to Play type game. -Build alot in first hours. -Wait to collect bubblers to build more-Wait to expand borders. -Click on every single building to collect something.-Continue doind so indefinatley.-Collect cards by tapping on land (which costs points which you have to wait to collect or BUY) to dig up cards to upgrade civilization-wait to be able to tap a little more. or PAY and do it all at once.

								I bought Godus in the belief that it would be a micro-managing game, very reminiscent of the ""Black and White"" series, because it seemed to in that direction.What i got was a left clicking simulator.No, im deadly serious. That's the controls. There are no choices, you just sit on your flat♥♥♥♥♥♥from an overview perspective (Civilization style). And you terraform the landscape by left clicking for your followers - ai. the population that you are ""controlling"" (if you can even call it that). The population also happens to be the resource that you use to perform various actions, and there's a reasonably deep crafting system implemented in the game, but IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE GAMEPLAY. Maybe im being too harsh on it for being an Early Access game, but i would be VERY surprised if this game gets any better.			",111,5,2,4,4,2,3

								The lovely graphics and easy interface, combined with the recent Steam sale, made the game seem appealing.However, the easy interface grew rapidly dependent on much time waiting and much time spent clicking, eventually adding up to ""much time wasted"" (and not in a positive way).It's still a very calming game to look at/listen to, but not much fun to play.

								I have been following this game since I saw it on kickstarter. I loved Black & white as a kid and thought this would be similar, but with more of a challenge which had been stated by the creator early on. I bought it the first day it was available on steam and was extremely disappointed within a few minutes of play. The art is beautiful, other that that I can't think of anything else very positive. The game play is very repetitive tap and drag style. The main mechanics that give you 'points' fill power meters sort of thing are so repetitive you could play one minute out of every 15 and more than maximize any and all needs. The multiplayer is against a robot and once again repetitive. In short it is hugely unappealing. The overall game feels like a free tablet game I paid 9.99 for. The only reason I wrote this was to hopefully save someone the money I spent, the game is pretty but other than that its little more than an interactive screen saver.			",23,5,0,2,11,0,1

								From what I understand, promises for Godus's future  gameplay are big. A large, complicated, engaging game is promised. But as of right now, Godus not only fails to deliver a shining new god-game experience; it falls almost completely flat of being at all any fun to play. With gameplay cropped generally to slowly flattening out pieces of land, and digging up cards, and where your villagers do nothing of particular interest, the gameplay that emerges is much too simple.Though I hope that the future of Godus is a bright one, as of now it is just not worth your £15, or your time for that matter.

								I purchase this game long ago for early access, and completely regret my purchase. The game is in a poor state, and I still give them the benefit of doubt but haven't seen any updates for months.The game is horrible at the moment. It is constant click fests, it is ridiculously slow, and it landscape tool is undeniably frustrating to use. The civilization will start building house any chance they want without any creativity or other buildings. Forget about any thought of shaping the landscape, the town, to create a beautiful world. It's impossibleThis game should be on facebook or on a tablet, but even that is an insult to the game developers that design their game specifically on such platform. I enjoy time management games like GameDev Story, Valkyrie Crusade, Adventure Town, etc. Godus is a complete lackbuster in comparison.---Like every game, there is always potential for more, I just hope there developer can turn things around after the revamp. Once the new overhaul has rolled out, I will review the game again.			",123,13,1,41,7,0,4

								The more I try to play this game the more I hate it, such an ANTI PC game I've ever met. I literaly sign on, collect believe, farm farms, sculpt landscape, quit.. and wait until the next round of believe/farming comes in. The game will take YEARS to play becuase of the crazy time delay and duel money system going on. It's crap, you can sacrife your followers to earn gems, but it makes them unhappy, so you have to spend gems to aquire happy statues it's the pinical of evil. Also sacrifing will cost believe, which is required for everything, but no worries, again, you can buy it with gems.  Round the merry go around you go. Even the developers commentories say ""we think  you're bored with collecting believe by now"".. Well NO♥♥♥♥♥♥SHERLOCK, the whole game is a frustating waste of time..  DO NOT BUY.. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT.. Go buy a goldfish, that is more rewarding and exciting that trying to play this game. Update 28/09/2014: New version (2.2.1).. Excellect the tutorials are gone we've been trusted to use a mouse again. The game has had some major changes since previous version. Sadly hand holding is still in, early game you will be slowly pulled throu' the mechanics of playing. Flatten landscape followers build houses, repeat. Gems are back!!, gems are like in game currency you would have to buy on a mobile version, but this PC version the developers are at pains to explain there is no way to buy them. Instead we get a pit of doom to sacrifce our followers which will earn gems. Gems (on pc version) can be earn other ways too (doing missions and finding them in treasure chests). Gems are a Major mechanic in the game becuase lets face it, it's a mobile game. Run out of believe and a little card will be waved in the bottom corner encouraging you to spend 5 gems for 1000 believe. Believe is the currency that you can earn slowly over time and is required to do ANYTHING in the game. So when it runs out, you have a choice.. wait for more to be generated by the houses, or spend gems to get some NOW. Gems can also be used to speed up buildings or capturing of beacons..The developer are constantly reminding us there shouldn't be any downtime, aka. time where you are doing nothing just waiting for believe to come in. However, they are so wrong.   If your believe drops to zero you cannot use the leash to move your followers around this creates downtime. You could go do missions, I'll get onto those in a minute, so long as you haven't messed them up previously. If you have messed them up, you either wait for re-enforcements or SPEND GEMS to get them NOW. The missions.. Missions are a side game to the main builidng of your colony. Think 3d lemmings and you would be pretty close, your ship will land at an island, and it's up to you to get usually 10 of your people from the ship to the temple on the island. They take the most direct route, like lemmings, regardless of hazards in their way. You need to change the landscape to provide a safe route, using god powers where nessecary. It isn't bad sub game, you get to play with god powers so great except gems raise their ugly head. If you fail the mission you can retry but the lemmings you commited are gone, your ship hold 30 lemmings, you need to get 10 to a temple to win, so you can fail 3 times before being prevented from playing on. Of course spend gems and reinforements arrive, no gems? thats ok, you can wait HOURS for them to arrive. Oh in this version there is another settlement on the island, which is interesting. Sadly the developers commenty is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to the game. It's like going to a movie with someone who's seen the film and keeps going ""oh this is a good bit"", ""watch this"", ""you may want to cover your eyes"".  You unlock a card and they will say ""Get this card its VITAL.. or maybe it isn't?. by now you should of done X or Y, if you haven't do it we promise you it's really good"".  This next land is already flat for your new houses, so don't change it too much, (or do if you really want to)"". ""The other tribe appears to be friendly and harmless, or are THEY?"" .. You get the idea...Still I'm going to keep my recommendation to No for now. It's not as bad as the previous versions by a long way but still it's feels like a mobile game. Maybe it's a good game for people who like games such as the Sims, or Farmville? (not critizing them games, just trying to give an idea of what sort of gamers I think might enjoy this game).  Side missions could be fun, lemmings style, but the need for gems to reinforce when you mess up does spoilt it somewhat.(older reviews below) Update 09/08/2014: Godus is so damm boring, it wants to hand hold you every step of the way. The latest beta 2.1 forces you to do the ""tutorial"" which is at such a SLOW pace it will put you to sleep. If a game needs a tutorial at that pace there is a problem. The developers are DESPERATE for you to CARE about these little followers. Please stop it, stop it, we're all grown up, we're not coming to game from never seing a computer or mouse before.Honestly, I have no idea who their target audience is?. It's certainly not gamers, I suspect without the tutorial even casual gamers (facebook gamers) could work it out. So why??.. It's like they have nothing so they have slowed the pace down to a crawl.  ""We want it to be as relaxing as possible"" the game says, well they succeeded, as it's a total snoozefest.Seriously don't buy; I've clocked up 22 hours and yet to get to do anything really ""fun"". It's like a pretty mobile game, constantly teasing you to keep on playing it but the rewards for doing so NEVER arrive. I think the developers want us to care about the little people but really all I want to do is the fun god like things like Volcano's, and Lighting strikes. Still can't do them, after 22hrs!!

								Positive review here, and I'll tell you why. I got this game a long time ago. Played around with it for a while and quickly lost interest as it did not have much to offer. ""Early access"" I said and uninstalled it. So of course time passed and I heard bits of info here and there how bad this game got and how bad the development was. Not surprising as I see a lot of early access games to just kind of die. However recently a friend of mine who has been following this game told me something changed.So I went back into it.And I actually like it.yea I dont love it. But it is still Early Access after all. I started to look things up about the devs and found this out. Molyneux the man who is hated probably as much as EA stepped down as CEO back in Juneish. Dunno the exact date but most articles are around that time period. So as I was going through the reviews I noticed how people are still complaining about Molyneux ruining this game....So here's some positives as to why you should at least keep this game on your wishlist or buy it on a sale.Heres an article stating Simon Phillips is taking over as CEO.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-17-meet-the-man-trying-to-fix-22cansThe devs are active within the forums and on the 22cans twitter (they respond to tweets more than posting their own)As you can see in recent updates (Yes im aware the last one was in September) they are working away on a combat update.Also if you read the Godus opt in steam section on this page you'll notice that they update the dev build more than the actual early access. This meaning you'll get more content although it will be buggy.tl;drGame has a new CEO and is becoming active again, Wishlist this and check back every once in a while or buy on sale.P.S. when reading reviews do your own research to make sure some highly liked review isn't utterly wrong.

								even at £3.74, i really can't recommend this game. i have it because i backed it on kickstarter when i thought it was going to be a nice modern populous. this is nothing like the game we were led to believe it would be.why does my profile say 68 hours spent? well when it first came out there was some farming mechanic where you had to acumulate a certain amount of wheat to meet your next goal, and this occurs over time as you play, so i just left it running for a couple of days.it does LOOK pretty though. which is why its such a shame its currently so poor. first builds showed promise but given the progress made in the last 2 years, i have absolutely no hope that it will ever be a decent game.if something good comes of this, i will change my recommendation.right now, avoid like ebola. and those horrible sherbert flying saucer sweets.

								I was giving this application the benefit of the doubt but the release of the Roadmap (http://www.22cans.com/godus-roadmap-where-are-we-headed/) made clear that the developers are unwilling to add any mechanics that are not compatible with a cow clicker game.""Happiness"" generating structures will need to be clicked regularly and manually, mana needs to be harvested manually from individual houses and settlements, sculpting hasn't improved one whit since the earliest release and is as carpal tunnel syndrome inducing as ever. (said to be less painful with a touchpad but that's little consolation for a PC game)Strategy or decisions simply do not exist. Not in unfinished form, not as a stub, not even planned.Instead the plan is to add more levels of their Lemmings clone... which is in no way related to the ""normal"" playfield.You just go ""spawn Lemmings clone now"", taking you away from the regular map.It is said that hope dies last but alas, it can die.

								Update: Gave Godus 2.0 a chance. Better but not something that's worth the money, nor my time. Recommend to stay away from Godus!I've been putting off writing a review for this game for quite some time, as I wanted to fully analyze all the concepts of Godus before giving an opinion.Godus is a game that sounds great. You play a God and you help craft a civilization, but in reality, it ranks as one of the worst games I've ever played. While I understand it is an Early Access Game, even then it appears to be going into a direction that upsets me.Want to build a building? Too bad, not enough mana. Want more mana? Wait 5 hours of real time, OR spend gold *cough* credits *cough* to rush the process. Oh wait, you wanted to build a building, right? Well the game thought you meant destroy the Northern side of your town... Whoops. But you may think, wait there's combat, that must be fun! I just clicked on their guys a bunch and killed them all. Ended the battle and went back to waiting 12 hours for enough mana to expand. But wait, I can't expand until I find resource cards. How do you find them, you ask? By click around the map until you find little chests with them in it. Something which may sound interesting, gets really old, real quick. Especially while waiting 12 hours for enough mana to find those chests.Overall, Godus is like being on an Easter Egg hunt where you have to find all the eggs buried under pounds of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ only to find the eggs themselves are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Except I imagine that would be more entertaining than Godus.If all else fails, take that extra $20 bucks you would have spent on Godus and rip it into shreds, the small amount of pleasure you get in those mere seconds will be much more than you get out of any hours of this lackluster, pretense of a real game.

								I was excited when this game was announced. I bought into the game in a very early stage and the concept was one that harkened back to Popolus. The level building was brilliant and the game had character to it. Well.. here's the problem. No Support! It has been abandoned for quite some time now and I would NOT advise anyone to purchase this product. In fact, it should not even been still for sale. It's a shame, for Godus has such potential, Peter Molyneux should be ashamed to let this product down. Over promised, under delivered and abandoned.			",241,27,6,31,17,3,36

It's slow, there's no customization, no interaction, your effect on the enviroment is negligable at best. It's like Black And White without the control, without the skill, without the interaction or personality.I wish I could get my money back, and it'd take an extremely drastic overhaul to change my mind.

Early Access Review
								Godus has not lived up to my expectations so far. While not backing it at Kickstarter I purchased this game through Steam Early Access. My decisision to buy the game was mainly influenced by its description on Kickstarter which basically describes it as as combination of Populous, Dungeon Keeper and Black & White. I don't think it lived up to those stadards or will ever do. If you are unsure whether to buy this game I recommend reading the reviews and read through the Steam forum.In short: I cannot recommend buying this game. Missing content was expected since it is still a Beta version, but in order to turn into a PC game the game mechanics would need to be redesigned from scratch. Based on how the developers ignored community requests in the past I highly doubt that is going to happen.On the good side:* The artwork: I really like how it looks and the sound effects are also quite nice.* The sculpting (customize your homeworld): the land consists of multiple layers which can be dragged or pushed back in order to extend mountains or to create a giant parking lot. Unfortunately the developers have taken away the ability to raise land. Therefore if you flatten a mountain there is no way to rebuild it afterwards.On the bad side:* It's no fun: Godus is in my opinion a game for cell phones or tablets. The main resource of the game is belief which is created by your followers. Unfortunately the generated belief is not automatically streaming into a pool but needs to be manually collected. Every 15 minutes or 24 hours (based on the size of the house) a belief ""bubble"" will pop up over the houses which you need to collect manually by tapping or swiping. Sculpting and the other ""wonders"" are very expensive and you will usually run out of belief after 5 to 15 minutes of playing and then have to wait some hours for more belief to be generated. This makes perfectly sense for a mobile game which is played every 4 to 6 hours when you have 10 minutes of free time. I ended up letting Godus run in the background while I was playing or doing something else just to check in later if more belief was available (that's also how I got to those 90 hours of playing). To mitigate this problem the developers introduced ""The pit of doom"" where you can sacrifice followers for ""gems"" which you can then use to purchase belief. At some point two additional resources, wheat and ore, are introduced which you need to build more houses or unlocking additional areas of the map (the latter can take up to 7 days for certain areas. Real time, not in-game time!). The generation of those resources also takes several hours which leads again to sitting around and doing nothing. * Communication with the developers: the community managers of the developers asked some months ago for things the community would like to be changed. The long timers and the missing content were among the most frequently mentioned things, but nothing was changed. There is no updated road map and absolutely no communication regarding what the developers are currebtly working on, nor is there any indication that the game will improve.* Outlook: given that the developers recently released this game for iOS which can generate a steady stream of revenue for them I don't believe that the game mechanics will change. Nothing was done regarding community complaints in the past either. Godus will probably be an above average game for the cell phones but should never have been released for PC in its current state.

								even at £3.74, i really can't recommend this game. i have it because i backed it on kickstarter when i thought it was going to be a nice modern populous. this is nothing like the game we were led to believe it would be.why does my profile say 68 hours spent? well when it first came out there was some farming mechanic where you had to acumulate a certain amount of wheat to meet your next goal, and this occurs over time as you play, so i just left it running for a couple of days.it does LOOK pretty though. which is why its such a shame its currently so poor. first builds showed promise but given the progress made in the last 2 years, i have absolutely no hope that it will ever be a decent game.if something good comes of this, i will change my recommendation.right now, avoid like ebola. and those horrible sherbert flying saucer sweets.

								It is not fun to play, the mechanics are not intuitive and once learned it just isn't fun.To me it feels as if the game was first designed to be a mobile game and the mechanics of the game were designed before the actual game itself. That seems confusing but basically, it seems to me like the design was ""This mobile game should be tap based, should include cards that give certain abilities or power-ups, should include stickers that also give some sort of ability. Now we should figure out what the game is about."" Included is a small game filler of ""clean up"" where you click away trees and rocks for building placement and such.Cards essentially act as a tech tree. It unlocks buildings or gives the player abilities.Stickers represent resources.Faith represents the 'energy' mechanic from mobile games.The game itself represents an attempt at a timesink.In my opinion, this game fails. It would fail on the mobile side too. ",187,39,0,31,21,2,45

								I really liked the promise that the earlier versions showed, but now this game feels like I'm playing a free-to-play game or Farmville. I wasn't on for a few days and then I come back and 50+ of my people immediaetly went over to the Astari because the happiness festival happened several times while I was gone!  I don't want to have to babysit my game. I don't want a game I paid up front for to feel like a free-to-play/pay-to-win game, which is basically what this turned into. I thought this was going to be a cool, unique game, but I feel like it's just turning into another iPhone game. I can't sit down and play this game for 3 hours, I sit down, start it, check on things, go do something else, come back a little later, etc etc. I'm not playing it, I'm babysitting it. It's no longer fun, it's a grind. Why buy this when you can get Farmville and other games for free?			",230,34,9,21,69,4,58

								Terrible. Just terrible, and it keeps getting worse. Being a cow clicker wasn't enough. Despite claims that the game is meant to be played in short bursts over long time, they've added Astari, which basically punish the player for not a) murdering horribly or b) checking in obsessively. So, one more thing we loved in Populous and Black and White taken from us-- the ability to shape our own moral choices and play somewhat our own way. Godus basically convinces me that someone else must have been responsible for the original charm of Black & White. Nothing, not even the sequel, has ever come close to that charm. This ""regenesis"" of the god game is so far from understanding what made god games great, and seems a tired, hackneyed mobile-milking scheme straight out of the Zynga playbook. It is slow, unwieldy, relies on clicking and collect-and-spend monotony, and it just keeps getting worse. Do not bother trying to get in on the early access to shape the game. The secret of Curiosity is that it revealed Molyneux's new favourite mechanic-- the endless, obsessive clicking-- and he will not be budged from relying on this mechanic. Every time we point out the game's flaws, he punishes us with something even worse. Too much clicking? He slows everything down so we click less frequently. We still click just as much, we just have to wait in order to do it, sometimes for days. Too little features, too much flat land? He makes sculpting at different levels much harder, and then builds it in so we really need to build on the places where it's worst. Godus is Molyneux playing his own god game with us, and the more we ask for a better game, the more misery he is going to dump on us. That might work in Black & White, dude, but it does not work in the real world. We're not going to come around just because you keep making it worse. We're just going to go off and find better games. Let's see if people Stockholmed by this product are enough of a market to keep it alive. I'm betting no.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I know the game is not done.  I get it.  I just felt rage a second ago.  I was unable to exit the game without it freezing.  This was followed by the realization that there was a debug program running and that I could not exit it.  So I tried the old ctrl - alt - delet and saw nothing there.  Then I realized that it was running as a sub prosess.  I became angry.  I knew that the alpha would be broken but I didn't think it would eat up my performance after it already crashed.  Hiding it was not cool Peter, just ask like all the other Devs and let us make the choice to send you debug info.  As to the game.  I am  110 hrs in and progress has become only a crawl, the progress is time gated,  the interface feels like it will be a mobile game, and I do not have fun playing it any more.  I think that Peter has gotten me to pay for his move in to the mobile space and that the game will come with a purchasable currancy.  I respect the man's vision and I hope that this will approach the fun that I had with the Black & White series he made for me.			",217,64,1,41,37,2,35

By click around the map until you find little chests with them in it. Something which may sound interesting, gets really old, real quick. Especially while waiting 12 hours for enough mana to find those chests.Overall, Godus is like being on an Easter Egg hunt where you have to find all the eggs buried under pounds of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ only to find the eggs themselves are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Except I imagine that would be more entertaining than Godus.If all else fails, take that extra $20 bucks you would have spent on Godus and rip it into shreds, the small amount of pleasure you get in those mere seconds will be much more than you get out of any hours of this lackluster, pretense of a real game.

								The developer(s) of this game is very clever. Something that isn't really mentioned very well is that this is not a PC game.It's simply a port of a WIP mobile game, primarily developed for IOS. This should be a key sign of why you shouldn't spend your money on this, but I guess I'll go in to further detail.As it being a mobile game port, a lot of the content is clicking. Clicking and dragging things around. Perhaps on your phone or tablet this would be a fun way to spend your time, lazily tapping on the screen, but it's not at all a great game mechanic on a PC, as this is not the right way to go about it. The game is focused around this mechanic, and it shows poorly when using a mouse. You're suppose to shape the landscape to help your villagers build their village, but controlling is a task in of itself, as ground will bounce back to where it originally was if you don't have enough faith. To gain faith, you have to destroy rocks and trees. Now, I don't know about you, but personally, if I was a settler, I wouldn't want trees randomly disappearing. That's a source of lumber, and almost a necessity of building a village. I wouldn't praise a god if it suddenly vanished, but apparently these villagers do. It's also focused on cards, and to collect cards you have to discover them through digging through the ground, which requires faith.If the re-occuring theme isn't already noticable, it should be painfully obvious by now. The game is focused around faith. Every action seemingly requires faith. You have to wait, and ""pop"" the faith bubbles that appear above your villager's houses. The entire focus of this game is clearly and blatantly a mobile game. However, you have to pay $20 to get the game right now, with so little content it's arguably not even in alpha stages yet. If you truly desperate for that feeling of being a god, skip over this game and go on over to GOG.com and purchase yourself a copy of Populous: The Beginning for $6. You're gonna like the way you look, I guarentee it.			",180,14,0,13,24,4,19

								This game feels like something from Kongregate. It's mobile roots are very clear in the ""hurry up and wait"" gameplay, even with the hunting for treasure chests to distract you. It takes almost an hour before you gain direct control over the followers, which is awkward at best.Belief is far to scarce a resource when it is requred to perform literally the only direct action you are capable of. This game is boring, please avoid.			",114,17,1,22,15,0,35

								I was giving this application the benefit of the doubt but the release of the Roadmap (http://www.22cans.com/godus-roadmap-where-are-we-headed/) made clear that the developers are unwilling to add any mechanics that are not compatible with a cow clicker game.""Happiness"" generating structures will need to be clicked regularly and manually, mana needs to be harvested manually from individual houses and settlements, sculpting hasn't improved one whit since the earliest release and is as carpal tunnel syndrome inducing as ever. (said to be less painful with a touchpad but that's little consolation for a PC game)Strategy or decisions simply do not exist. Not in unfinished form, not as a stub, not even planned.Instead the plan is to add more levels of their Lemmings clone... which is in no way related to the ""normal"" playfield.You just go ""spawn Lemmings clone now"", taking you away from the regular map.It is said that hope dies last but alas, it can die.

								Quite possibly one of the worst games I have ever played in terms of updates, overall the game is unfinshed this being reflected by the fact it is in early access, however it feels as if it will never be finished as well as this, Godus was stated as a game that would redefine the god game genre this is certainly not the case it just doesn't have the feel that old god games gave of truely being all powerful at best it is a poor recreatement of Populous. As of this update on the 7th of June 2016, the game still feels as unpolished and unfinished as ever this game is, in my opinion, great at demonstrating the need for better (actual) modertion of what ""games"" are allowed to be sold on Steam.Second update as of the 28th of November all I can say is I should never have waited and just got a refund straight away this has got to be one of the worst examples of the modern attitude to game development, if you can call this thing a game.

								Now, in all fairness, god games are a difficult genre to do properly. One has to purposefully limit the player in order to prevent the game from becoming boring, yet one has to empower the player enough so they actually feel like at least a minor god in the game world.Now let's come to GODUS. Like many things, I got it on the cheap so I'm not ranting on the basis of 'oh em gee what a ripoff.' If you get something in alpha or beta, you pays your money you takes your chances. Let's look at the game itself.It's a mobile game. No matter what anyone else has said, it was always intended to be one.How can I tell?It's obvious, thanks to friends in the industry and a little (so-far unpublished) dev work I've done on the side.Mobile app monetization is done by throttling the player experience: let the player do some things, force them to wait, then let them do it again. It's that waiting period that mobile games cash in on: people get impatient especially in the last hour or so. That's often why the timers are slightly off from what would seem natural off-times like eight hours or twelve hours or a day or so: you've waited a whole day, but there's just one hour left before you unlock Gizmo X you want, so you pay ten cents and get it.Everything about GODUS' architecture reveals that it's a mobile app. Everything is timer-based and requires physical pickup, so one can't just leave it running, get a scrumload of power, and then do whatever one wants. Problem is that it's being sold for PC and isn't being monetized, so it's all a dreadful waste.For example: you need to clear space for your followers to live. You do this by sculpting land, which has been a genre staple since Populous (thanks, Molyneaux). You sculpt land by spending belief, which you get from your housed followers, so it's a self-supporting cycle.Fair enough.Thing is, your housed followers don't generate belief at a rate, like say resource buildings in an RTS; they generate a wad of belief on a timer that you then have to pick up; you can then spend this resource in a somewhat unimpressive bit of sculpting and then have to wait until more wads pop out--no stutter-production like, say, Supreme Commander or probably Planetary Annihilation, which appears to be a far superior god game by sheer accident.That forced-wait mechanic is the industry standard for mobile games, and it's like that because it makes mobile games make money. PC games? They get your money up front (and then more for DLC) so instead you're basically investing in a useless timesink, which is further compounded by the lack of (or any plan for) a creative version where you can sculpt to your heart's content.Minecraft, which is what everyone wants to be in beta, had survival and creative modes simultaneously through most of its development. As it turns out, this is more or less why: while balancing the effort/reward ratio in survival, if people got frustrated they could go into creative and make whatever they wanted whenever they wanted. When that got boring and they wanted challenge, back into survival. Survival/creative dichotomies packaged together are intensely good things.But back to GODUS. I could and will describe the other mechanics, but they're all effectively subservient to the house-sculpt-house-scuplt cycle.Except when they act to interrupt it.In the beginning, you house and sculpt pretty normally. Not the most exciting thing in the world, but it works. Later, when your civilization discovers agriculture via Cards (which are effectively bonuses or levels-up unlocked via population and then double-unlocked through applying collectable Stickers found through in-map exploration), suddenly you've got Wheat as a resource that you need to build more houses.Which, in the mobile world, would mean another thing to monetize. Need more wheat? Wait, or buy more.In the PC world, it serves only to stunt gameplay. While you wait for wheat to accrue (when it does; it seems buggy), you're basically stuck acquiring belief and sculpting land waiting for when you can further expand your housing and therefore follower population and therefore progress in the actual game.This is a slow, tedious, boring process. For example, I spent half an hour letting the game run while I did chores then came back to collect the dropped belief and then sculpt for an entire thirty seconds before running out of belief. In that process I was able to put a small dent in a mountain in the way.Needless to say, I didn't feel particularly godlike.So that's the tactical level pretty much ruined; what about the strategic level?What strategic level?Remember when I mentioned Cards? They're arranged in a Timeline, which roughly models the progression of a civilization from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. This is purely linear, with Cards unlocked solely by population count (and, later, Wheat and Ore. No, that's not 'total Wheat and Ore' generated, it's a set Wheat or Ore cost. You have to make the active decision to either wait the length of the Romanov dynasty to build a few more huts or wait a geological eon to get a card that progresses you through the game). This means that everything you can get is revealed to you from the very beginning, and none of it strikes me as particularly impressive.So, to recap:1) Mobile game sold as a PC game, so it's the timesink of timesinks well beyond MMOs (which at least generally let you do things over all that time).2) Completely linear gameplay.3) Effectively zero customization, unless you want to spend the time to sculpt land into interesting shapes. This is best achieved through savegame cheating, which is highly indicative.And what should good god games have?1) Activity--you are constantly going around fiddling with things, doing this, doing that, being all godly even if you're not always allowed to pull out all the big guns all the time. (None of that here.)2) Empowerment via customization--you're a god, aren't you? Shape your people! Make them expys of Hindus or Jews or Aztecs or bloody Cthulhu Cultists.That's perhaps the most frustrating thing. There's nothing particularly keeping GODUS from being a good god game. Other people complain about the simple cartoony graphics, but that worked really well for Spore particularly in the Space game--at which point you were basically a technologically enabled god, no? The adjustment from timers to rates isn't that great a change, and the cost of doing things could be finagled. Yes, it would require changing the core mechanics but it's not insurmountable since all the assets could be exactly the same. Keep the Card/Sticker mechanic, but put it in a tree a la the old standby Civilization tech tree so you can optimize towards plains dwellers or mountain hermits or coastal barbarians or whatever. One could even leave in the Wheat and Ore mechanics so long as they were put on a rate system rather than a timer system, which would also give them far more visibility.More fundamental changes would include stealing a page from the Spore Creature Creator and let people paper-doll and combine the simple art elements to customize their culture. If Dawn of War could do it for the RTS, then any amount of customization--even if it's limited to user-modifiable skins--would really add to the sense of being a god and your followers being your followers rather than just generic people. (Actually, thinking about it, the Spore engine would be perfect for a god game.)Okay, I'm starting to get excessively emotional. Let it suffice to say that these changes seem highly unlikely and, in this game's current state, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. If it were a mobile game, that would be a different matter: it would be unimpressive, but passable. In this case, avoid it. ",126,61,0,18,21,0,38

								This game is in early access and usually that means a glitchy, but interesting enough game to keep people playing. With this game the opposite tactic was taken. There are very few glitches surprisingly, but the game itself is so boring and so far from what was promised that you will be kicking yourself for the next year for falling prey to yet another money grab by peter.I would like to make it clear that this game could very easily have been a top selling, highly praised, and award winning game, but who wants to have happy customers?

Early Access Review
								Godus has not lived up to my expectations so far. While not backing it at Kickstarter I purchased this game through Steam Early Access. My decisision to buy the game was mainly influenced by its description on Kickstarter which basically describes it as as combination of Populous, Dungeon Keeper and Black & White. I don't think it lived up to those stadards or will ever do. If you are unsure whether to buy this game I recommend reading the reviews and read through the Steam forum.In short: I cannot recommend buying this game. Missing content was expected since it is still a Beta version, but in order to turn into a PC game the game mechanics would need to be redesigned from scratch. Based on how the developers ignored community requests in the past I highly doubt that is going to happen.On the good side:* The artwork: I really like how it looks and the sound effects are also quite nice.* The sculpting (customize your homeworld): the land consists of multiple layers which can be dragged or pushed back in order to extend mountains or to create a giant parking lot. Unfortunately the developers have taken away the ability to raise land. Therefore if you flatten a mountain there is no way to rebuild it afterwards.On the bad side:* It's no fun: Godus is in my opinion a game for cell phones or tablets. The main resource of the game is belief which is created by your followers. Unfortunately the generated belief is not automatically streaming into a pool but needs to be manually collected. Every 15 minutes or 24 hours (based on the size of the house) a belief ""bubble"" will pop up over the houses which you need to collect manually by tapping or swiping. Sculpting and the other ""wonders"" are very expensive and you will usually run out of belief after 5 to 15 minutes of playing and then have to wait some hours for more belief to be generated. This makes perfectly sense for a mobile game which is played every 4 to 6 hours when you have 10 minutes of free time. I ended up letting Godus run in the background while I was playing or doing something else just to check in later if more belief was available (that's also how I got to those 90 hours of playing). To mitigate this problem the developers introduced ""The pit of doom"" where you can sacrifice followers for ""gems"" which you can then use to purchase belief. At some point two additional resources, wheat and ore, are introduced which you need to build more houses or unlocking additional areas of the map (the latter can take up to 7 days for certain areas. Real time, not in-game time!). The generation of those resources also takes several hours which leads again to sitting around and doing nothing. * Communication with the developers: the community managers of the developers asked some months ago for things the community would like to be changed. The long timers and the missing content were among the most frequently mentioned things, but nothing was changed. There is no updated road map and absolutely no communication regarding what the developers are currebtly working on, nor is there any indication that the game will improve.* Outlook: given that the developers recently released this game for iOS which can generate a steady stream of revenue for them I don't believe that the game mechanics will change. Nothing was done regarding community complaints in the past either. Godus will probably be an above average game for the cell phones but should never have been released for PC in its current state.

								I have been playing this game for a long time. There are times when I think this is a crap game, why am I playing, its so boring. Then there is something that happens to redeem it and I continue to play.Here is the bad: Too clicky...If you like to click, click, click...This is the game for you. You spend a lot of time clicking on houses to collect belief. You need belief to do anything worthwhile.You are basically doing a few basic things1: molding the landscape2. Collecting belief3. Building houses There is no interactiveness with the people in any meaningful way. Sometimes you see them do amusing things, like climb a tree, but there is no sense of any connection with these small people. Eventually I stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥whether they were in good health or happy or anything and started to sacrifice like crazy to make diamonds. It would be nice to see some animals and give your people direction on caring for animals or other types of crops.I'd like to see something other than the same look of the buildings. How about little shops. LIttle churches or other kind of shrines they would have to build and worship at. Barnyards with animals. Market towns--they even had those during ancient civilizations. I hate the voyages component. I don't enjoy having to sculpt that much and it is distracing and I don't find I get any value out of it. I actually kill off my people in order to accumulate enough diamonds to buy stickers. Then I use my ""happy"" tree and fountain to bounce up my happiness. Developers--don't mess this up for me because I'm not doing any of your stinking and boring voyages! I hate everytime there is an update, it goes through the same damned tutorial each time. Why can't there be a ""skip it"" button. It is so annoying.This is an early access game--if you don't like bugs (and there are lots and lots of bugs). Don't bother buying.I have heard some negative things about the IOS/android free game. I think as somebody who bought it for computer, I was mighty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to pay for a game that is now offered free on mobile devices. All I can say is, the final version of the paid for game better be freaking awesome. What is good? Well, there has been some addressing of issues of trying to decrease the amount of repetitive clicks, but they haven't gone far enough.visually the game can be quite appealing to look at, but I think there is also a long way to go to make it more interesting to play. There is no excuse not to do a better job with this game. BTW, I stopped playing this game until the next big update because I have lost all my buildings in some big error and I can't be bothered to figure out how to fix it.			",9,6,0,8,27,0,6

								Update: Gave Godus 2.0 a chance. Better but not something that's worth the money, nor my time. Recommend to stay away from Godus!I've been putting off writing a review for this game for quite some time, as I wanted to fully analyze all the concepts of Godus before giving an opinion.Godus is a game that sounds great. You play a God and you help craft a civilization, but in reality, it ranks as one of the worst games I've ever played. While I understand it is an Early Access Game, even then it appears to be going into a direction that upsets me.Want to build a building? Too bad, not enough mana. Want more mana? Wait 5 hours of real time, OR spend gold *cough* credits *cough* to rush the process. Oh wait, you wanted to build a building, right? Well the game thought you meant destroy the Northern side of your town... Whoops. But you may think, wait there's combat, that must be fun! I just clicked on their guys a bunch and killed them all. Ended the battle and went back to waiting 12 hours for enough mana to expand. But wait, I can't expand until I find resource cards. How do you find them, you ask? By click around the map until you find little chests with them in it. Something which may sound interesting, gets really old, real quick. Especially while waiting 12 hours for enough mana to find those chests.Overall, Godus is like being on an Easter Egg hunt where you have to find all the eggs buried under pounds of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ only to find the eggs themselves are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Except I imagine that would be more entertaining than Godus.If all else fails, take that extra $20 bucks you would have spent on Godus and rip it into shreds, the small amount of pleasure you get in those mere seconds will be much more than you get out of any hours of this lackluster, pretense of a real game.

								The developer(s) of this game is very clever. Something that isn't really mentioned very well is that this is not a PC game.It's simply a port of a WIP mobile game, primarily developed for IOS. This should be a key sign of why you shouldn't spend your money on this, but I guess I'll go in to further detail.As it being a mobile game port, a lot of the content is clicking. Clicking and dragging things around. Perhaps on your phone or tablet this would be a fun way to spend your time, lazily tapping on the screen, but it's not at all a great game mechanic on a PC, as this is not the right way to go about it. The game is focused around this mechanic, and it shows poorly when using a mouse. You're suppose to shape the landscape to help your villagers build their village, but controlling is a task in of itself, as ground will bounce back to where it originally was if you don't have enough faith. To gain faith, you have to destroy rocks and trees. Now, I don't know about you, but personally, if I was a settler, I wouldn't want trees randomly disappearing. That's a source of lumber, and almost a necessity of building a village. I wouldn't praise a god if it suddenly vanished, but apparently these villagers do. It's also focused on cards, and to collect cards you have to discover them through digging through the ground, which requires faith.If the re-occuring theme isn't already noticable, it should be painfully obvious by now. The game is focused around faith. Every action seemingly requires faith. You have to wait, and ""pop"" the faith bubbles that appear above your villager's houses. The entire focus of this game is clearly and blatantly a mobile game. However, you have to pay $20 to get the game right now, with so little content it's arguably not even in alpha stages yet. If you truly desperate for that feeling of being a god, skip over this game and go on over to GOG.com and purchase yourself a copy of Populous: The Beginning for $6. You're gonna like the way you look, I guarentee it.			",180,14,0,13,24,4,19

								Godus has so much potential but so little of it is used.  When I bought the game I thought I would have total control over the world but disappointingly I did not.  The system used to manage how much power you have is so limiting that after just 30 minutes I got bored.  As a gamer I give Godus 5.5/10.  I hope that the developers stop limiting the player and start embracing the ""god"" genre and maybe someday It will be a fun game.			",14,2,0,2,8,0,2

								The game is flawed in its design, a simplistic system of followers expanding a settlement is great.Then what?Maybe I can conquer other tribes? No.Maybe I can give my race its own unique identity? NoMaybe I can buy this as a replacement for black and white? Erm.. No.This game is a waste of money. Don't buy it, if all you want is to drag some land around then go ahead, collect 'stickers' (oh how patronising) and advance through non existent eras (everything looks the same).The fact that this was designed by people from Lionhead, and still manages to turn out crap signals that you shouldn't buy it.

								When i bought this game i really thought: ""Wow, there's somebody out there who knows what a good game needs!""But since the last changes including timing behaviour and the free mobile app release i really feel cheated. I dont understand the programmers. My only explanation for this development is financial pressure... I dont think the game gets much older with the last changes. Maybe, but then it definitely needs a general chat like Settlers Online. Then it can be used as a simple chat client.Sorry, but i'm really disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game was made for phones and tablets or whatever at first and then put on to the PC platform. It's basically a normal game put on a bigger screen with a bigger price. The game so far is just adequate, but it's still in early access. A bit challenging with losing followers to the astari and keeping the followers happy. Gems come from sacrificing followers - I need gems to buy gifts to keep the followers happy. So it kinda goes in a loop there. Also, when it rains, the houses kinda lean sideways like the trees, making them look weird. Yes trees sway in the wind but I doubt houses built from stone would. Last problem I have with this game is the camera. It would be way better if we could rotate the camera around the map as sometimes it is hard to click on certain objects or control certain aspects of the game. Overall this game is just a joke and it's too expensive to be satisfying at the time this review is written. 15th October 2014.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After 12 hours of this game played I've decided it's not for me. The pace starts out fantastic but slowly devolves into a pointless time sink. You have to wait for your followers to pop up little prayer bubbles that fill up your belief meter..once that's done you can tell the bums to build new houses, farm, mine, etc.. But either your costs to do things are badly balanced or you think people have so much more time than they do to waste waiting and doing nothing. I wouldn't even mind waiting but when I logged off for 30 minutes because I was sitting there for 15 minutes after I finished everything that I could, ran out of belief, ran out of wheat, waiting for the previous game close to wear off (loss of 80...when I closed with super happy followers and crying Astari meter)I just don't have hours to leave a game running in the background and that seems like a huge waste of my resources anyway. Maybe make it so that I'm not penalized for closing the game and make things cost a little less or give me some damned way to get belief rather than waiting on prayers. Just..so badly balanced for people with no time .. on a game that is already fairly relaxed and chill. Do you expect me to sit and stare at the scenery?			",151,49,4,21,17,3,15

								Don't be fooled by the ""EARLY ACCESS REVIEW"", the game has and always will remain in early access. I purchased this unfinished product through the Kickstarter campaign years ago, like many people, hoping for the creative vision of Peter Molyneux to be brought to life. Godus aimed to be the spiritual successor to Populous; which many adored including myself. With Godus being spear-headed by such a reputable developer, I expected more to say the least.Game mechanics could be fun at times. Sculpting the landscape was easily the most enjoyable aspect. However, the game rapidly becomes boring. Due to a lack of features and/or features being incomplete and even features being removed, you will find yourself bored early on. Along side sloppy mechanics is a story so shallow it makes a kiddie pool look like Mariana's fu*kin' trench.Progress is and always has been non-existent, and the game never achieved the incredible potential it had. It seems like they never had any idea what they were doing, nor did they know which direction to take the game. A perfect example is how they released Godus Wars as a standalone game; while it was free for all owners of the original Im confused why it wasn't incoporated into the original Godus. Updates quickly became fewer and farther in-between, and the head developer Peter himself, ditched the project to pursue mobile gaming. Shortly thereafter the rest of the development team left.-----------------------------TL;DRGame died a while ago and is incomplete and not fully playable, do not purchase.			",91,5,1,6,16,0,12

								Godus is one of those games you are supposed to come back to every now and again just to tap on a few buildings to get more of this stuff to create more buildings to get more of this stuff, to then do it again, and again, and again, and again... Im not saying its all bad, in fact it does look pretty decent when playing. Its really just the mechanics, you know when you accedentally destroy about 50 of your buildings because you mis-clicked. But over all it cant really be called a game - not really worth the money			",324,48,2,52,35,3,55

								This is the single most tedious game I've ever played, and I enjoy slow paced things. Everything runs on the currency of your time, and everything just takes so long or costs SO MUCH in game stickers or gems. I'm glad I didn't pay the full asking price because it's hardly worth the few quid I spent on it. Clearly a free to play game that has been badly translated towards a full retail release. Please just avoid playing this until the reviews get better.			",35,30,0,5,8,1,13

								This is the worst piece of software to claim to be a game. You don't actually get to play it. The only option is to wait. It's like sitting down to watch a tv show, only to be told you have to wait thirty minutes, then get a few seconds of the show, then told you have to wait another thirty minutes. Every action penalizes you with more waiting time. The developers don't really want you to play it. I really enjoy how the developers talk frankly about having to endure the annoying nature of this game throughout their commentary which plays through the early part of the so-called gameplay. They're aware that the game is miserable, but they don't care. In fact, it almost seems like they think it's a feature. I cannot conceive of the person who would enjoy this ""game.""

								This game looked great from the basic reviews. I was hoping for another god type game, or something like Black N white, or Populous. It appears that 22Cans no longer cares about finishing the sim, as in its still in alpha/early access and only has two employees working on it (from what I can tell). Some people might enjoy it but for me, I just cant recommend this to anyone. Save your income, go for an older game or just wait. This sim/game reminds me of a flash game that should be on facebook, not 20 bucks.  Its also the last early access game I ever jump into as its the third game that will never be finished.

This game even for an ""Early Access"" was released way to soon, and with way to many promises from a man who loves to promise the sky then not deliver. I rarely try to pile only bad into reviews for anything, but it was my own fault for trusting this Lead Dev again, oh well. It does appear that development has been quietly abandoned on this project, with no updates in several weeks now. Reddit users on the Godus forum have said they only received canned e-mail respones from 22 cans. Maybe check it out if / when it gets finished, otherwise stay away for now and sink your 20 spot elsewhere. One passing thought, on these early access terms, what happens to us if it does get abandoned since we were never delivered the promised product by the developer?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I love finding new games on steam and I bought Godus when it was on it's first round of trials, and regretted it. Thats's 10 quid I could have saved for limited theory for example. First off there is no goal to the game, pure sandbox, and that can be fun which Garry's mod proves. But nothing happens in this game, literally just building homes over and over. Don't even get me started on the bugs, game freezes constantly, progress lost and shuts down all the time. SO when I found out the game had been completely remodeled I was intrigued if it could have improved. Nope, just a faster paced, slightly prettier game. I highly suggest avoiding this game, and to the developers I have watched your update videos and the amount of time you have put into this piece of rubbish is remarkable. Just let it go, give us refund if possible or make something new, small and fun. It just angers me that you can still think this can be a good idea when you have so many bad reviews!

								I was looking forward for a new god game, what I got was this garbage.What do you do in this game? You click the ground, you click trees, you click rocks, you click houses. Click, click, click. I had to install a program to automate clicking in order to even play this game.Why do you click? To gain belief the currency in this game. With this currency you can click the ground to move it around or you can use it on one of the many useless god powers such as the ability to slightly change the texture of the ground or send a tiny comet to make a tiny hole in the ground. The very first power you get is Finger of God which lets you, for a limited amount of time, destroy houses your followers have built and slightly push your followers around; not very satisfying. All you do in this is make the ground flat so your followers can build houses there, when there are enough houses the area which you can click increases and you can make more ground flat and so it comes full circle.You can also find so called cards buried in the ground. When you dig up enough of these your followers will be able to build new sorts of houses. Does this affect the game? Nope, it's still the same old click click click click the ground.I bought this game in early access and made it to the point where you could no longer advance in the game, after several months of no updates or any life signs from the devs a new patch was released. A complete overhaul of the game they said, except now it doesn't even work. It glitches out in the tutorial and that's it.To summarize, everything you do in this game is pointless. It's the exact same thing from minute one to however long you can bear playing this garbage. Do not buy this game, it will only end in disappointment.			",57,2,0,5,8,0,0

								Before they added the happiness meter I had fun even if I had ridiculous wait times. Now that the meters is there I can't do much because no matter what I do my people are unhappy and a few are just spewing out unhapiness. I dunno what to do I give them everything I can at this point to make them happy but nothing changes. I have lost over 100 of my 260 followers today (I have played less than 1 hour and it continues while you don't have it open). There isn't a restart button that I know of soooo I can't perform trial and error. tl:dr ♥♥♥♥ the mood meter it needs tweeking.			",203,17,5,33,22,0,28

								This is the worst piece of software to claim to be a game. You don't actually get to play it. The only option is to wait. It's like sitting down to watch a tv show, only to be told you have to wait thirty minutes, then get a few seconds of the show, then told you have to wait another thirty minutes. Every action penalizes you with more waiting time. The developers don't really want you to play it. I really enjoy how the developers talk frankly about having to endure the annoying nature of this game throughout their commentary which plays through the early part of the so-called gameplay. They're aware that the game is miserable, but they don't care. In fact, it almost seems like they think it's a feature. I cannot conceive of the person who would enjoy this ""game.""

								This game looked great from the basic reviews. I was hoping for another god type game, or something like Black N white, or Populous. It appears that 22Cans no longer cares about finishing the sim, as in its still in alpha/early access and only has two employees working on it (from what I can tell). Some people might enjoy it but for me, I just cant recommend this to anyone. Save your income, go for an older game or just wait. This sim/game reminds me of a flash game that should be on facebook, not 20 bucks.  Its also the last early access game I ever jump into as its the third game that will never be finished.

								If you were enchanted by the video the way I was - expecting and hoping for a beautiful stylized art version of something akin to Black and White, move on. This is more FarmVille than it is anything else. You will get to points where things take hours or even days to complete. Their solution to time sinks? How about these puzzle like mini-games that we call voyages?! Those were not even mentioned when I looked into it, and then they were touched upon, but then ultimately explained in great and lengthy detail in game. Sadly, this is ultimately another user abusive game that will end up draining the wallets of people with way too much in them on a mobile platform. The PC version is just a time sink. Ant farms are more fun. In fact, SimAnt was more fun. Overall, I would not recommend this game to anyone, finished or not.  ",117,32,4,20,21,0,16

								Play-to-win. Rubbish.Unless you want to wait for hours while your ""subjects"" generate belief (which you use for _everything_) you need to constantly use Gems to get belief. You use gems to unlock cards (game progresses for every new card). And guess what?It's an in-app purchase to get more than the token gem here and there...and you need gems. Lots of gems. If this had been for iOS I'd been less surprised since the greedy bast*rds flock to iOS, but this?It's NOT worth buying. The devs are laughing all the way to the bank.Start over with a new game? Uninstall. Save game unless your gem-hoarding fails? Forget it! Let's force players to buy gems for real money so that they can, eventually, see all the fluff and crap they have promised.I spit on devs and games like this. Greedy and disgusting.

								This game has a bit of promise, despite being at the moment a boring mobile game clickfest.The cartoonish style is very pretty, and the enviromental engine looks great. The game kind of plays like Populous with an Evoland style progression; But ultimately it boils down to waiting and clicking.All of this is pretty much excuseable in an early access game. However, the last ""update"", or in this meaning, any word at all from the developers, was in December of last year.Even the slowest early access games show some degree of development, and this game and dev team is so bad at it, the game might as well be vaporware as they run off to develop for mobile and spend their snatched money.Don't buy it until it ever gets finished, if at all.

								ok new update, nice I though and whent in to play.hmm where to start:first of, I do like that they change how things work when gathering belive, makes it easier to drag over than clicking one and one.aslo like the new follower leach, makes it easier to move them around, tho that said, what to do with the unemploide followers walking anround your world doing nothing at all, but cause a poppup msg saying they are lost.this brings me over to the bad part of this game witch is, they anoying poopups, and toturials in the game, and the sounds that foolows.this is actualy the first game I actually had to ""Turn"" of the sound in, to not have to lissen to it all the time.Serriosly forsing a toturial on ppl ain't a good idea, have a damn option to turn it off atleast, so we have the option to skip it.when you have a desently big settlement the popos and sounds really take off, and goes of every 1-2 sec.what the hell?you would thing that is it?.... Wrong there is a huge graphical glitch in the game as well.after you played for about 10 min or soo, you get the screen flashing with black squars randomly moving around your screen.to awoid this you have no option than restart the game, or have your eyes hurt like hell after watching of for 5 min!!at the end I do have to say I actaly enjoyd the 1.3.1 more than the new one, not because the game is badly designs,but you are forced to follow the tutorial, and have to lisen to the poppups all the time, as well as the graphic glitches..as far as the setellment goes, it should prob be auto assign setlles, like this:Builder settlment, produses  builders by derfaultFarmer settelment, produses farmers by derfaultmining settelment, produses miners by derfaultwould work bether than the current system where you need to asign all the houses in the settelment.though the point of the Update was to get rid of micromanagment, not take away some and add it at another place.at the moment I won't recommend this game to anyone, witch is sad since I actually had great hope for it first time I played it.

								You're paying to be in an open beta for a game that's being tailored to be a mobile app. The new version of the game has brought about the addition of increased timers for building and spawning new followers, as well as increased cost for terraforming, translating to a much slower expansion process and a lot of sitting around and waiting. The now slow rate and more expensive god powers reminded me a bit of EA's Dungeon Keeper app and it's hurry up and wait system, where you log in for a few minutes, collect your resources, make changes, then close the game.

								22cans seems to be in way over their head with this game. In the time that it's taken other Steam greenlight games to go from start to finish, they've started the game... got ""75%"" (their own number) done with it... then scrapped everything and started from the ground up.There are no options to start a new game or to reset your old one. If you want to start anew, you have to delete some game files and endure the painful tutorial again. The unskippable tutorial that teaches you the VERY basics of the game. Which I have played through four times. Godus lacks most of what it promises. At this time, the ""enemy faction"" consists of a village where your villagers go while you're logged off. If your happiness isn't maxed out (hell, even if it is), and you log off for more than a few hours at a time, the Astari will steal more and more of your followers. But I digress into specifics.Overall, this game doesn't have a whole lot of work put into it. The follower pathing is unintelligent, progression turns into a grind VERY quickly, and a lot of the god powers look like they'd be fun, but in reality have almost no real utility in the main game. Furthermore, the late-game belief collection system, as it stands right now, is balanced such that smaller, less expensive buildings will generate more belief per minute than larger, more expensive ones. (Belief is the main resource and is how you shape terrain, order followers and cast god spells.) The trade-off comes with the fact that the larger buildings have more capacity. As you progress you gain the ability to build larger and larger buildings that will collect belief more slowly, but can hold more overall. So if you log off and come back 20 minutes later, your little buildings will have their belief maxed out and you can collect it. The large buildings will still be producing belief and you can't collect it. This gets to the point where large buildings and villages can take upwards of 12 hours (real-world hours) to become collectable. While it's less per hour, the large buildings at late tiers in the game allow you to log off for longer periods without wasting belief.That's right: The progression in this game does nothing except let you play the game LESS while maintaining the same progression. The grind of this game's progression is SO BAD, it's actually a RELIEF when you get the large buildings, because you don't have to keep logging on to pop belief bubbles.Maybe by the time this game gets released in its final version it'll be good. But right now, 22Cans isn't listening to its user base. It's designing mechanics that are extremely un-fun. And the game development is CRAWLING. If you're looking at this game and it hasn't been released in its final version, definitely DON'T buy it. It's not worth $10, much less $20.			",94,12,0,9,7,0,14

Early Access Review
								Godus was quite a promising game in first place. However, it got dull and repetitive in earlier versions. After the 2.0 Update they changed a lot regarding the gameplay and -concept. Unfortunately, most of this changes are not well balanced nor make they any sense for the PC version.Since it got released on mobile devices, the PC version also got the same ""features"" from the mobile version like the gem store. On mobile devices, the gem store is the real money place to buy gems which enables you to buy additional stickers (to unlock research cards), explorers for the minigame puzzles, any other ressources to build and grow your civilization, and of course to speed up things. These gems work the same way on PC with the difference that you cannot buy these gems (fortunately) but also almost get no new gems unless you sacrifice your own citizens with an awful impact on happiness. This makes the waiting times for buildings in later stages of the game terribly long (some things need several hours in realtime to build up!). Frankly, for a paid game this is an insult for the customer. Furthermore, the game is still dull and repetitive with one difference; you have to wait even longer to expand and evolve your civilization.If you want to play a god game, stick to the good old Black&White (I and II). This is barely even the shadow of the old masterpieces.			",592,114,26,78,73,8,85

								It's like having aggravated piles and being asked to dab a mixture of salt and vinegar onto them at regular intervals, then being asked to pay for the privilege. It is without a doubt one of the most memorable gaming experiences you'll ever have, in a bad way. Save the money and buy cheap alcohol instead, then pour it on the ground, it'll be more fun and ultimately you'll get more out of it.Lots of potential, spoilt by just about everything else in the game.

What I got was a horrible mess that was somehow WORSE than the original, and he developers had pretty much abandoned it completely.

								I was looking forward for a new god game, what I got was this garbage.What do you do in this game? You click the ground, you click trees, you click rocks, you click houses. Click, click, click. I had to install a program to automate clicking in order to even play this game.Why do you click? To gain belief the currency in this game. With this currency you can click the ground to move it around or you can use it on one of the many useless god powers such as the ability to slightly change the texture of the ground or send a tiny comet to make a tiny hole in the ground. The very first power you get is Finger of God which lets you, for a limited amount of time, destroy houses your followers have built and slightly push your followers around; not very satisfying. All you do in this is make the ground flat so your followers can build houses there, when there are enough houses the area which you can click increases and you can make more ground flat and so it comes full circle.You can also find so called cards buried in the ground. When you dig up enough of these your followers will be able to build new sorts of houses. Does this affect the game? Nope, it's still the same old click click click click the ground.I bought this game in early access and made it to the point where you could no longer advance in the game, after several months of no updates or any life signs from the devs a new patch was released. A complete overhaul of the game they said, except now it doesn't even work. It glitches out in the tutorial and that's it.To summarize, everything you do in this game is pointless. It's the exact same thing from minute one to however long you can bear playing this garbage. Do not buy this game, it will only end in disappointment.			",57,2,0,5,8,0,0

								In the begining, we were promised much. We all knew peter, we'd played other games by him until Fable took over everything. How excited we all were to hear he had left to start again, an make a new god game.Many went out on a limb to support him and his upstart new company 22cans through crowd funding. More of us showed support by buying into the early access on steam. So many promises, so much potential, so many ideas. It seemed like the game so many of us had waited so long for. Early releases were just that, early, flawed, fleshed out, messy. We all had hope they'd listen, polish, an refine Godus into something great. With each passing build, things changed. At first it seemed for the better. The clicking was faint heartidly addressed. Other issues an bugs were talked about. I gave up, when I had a mighty, large civilization that was trapped in endless storms, unable to repair their homes, or do anything else, I moved on to other games. Checking back in after a year away I found something horrible had happened. There were whispers and rumors about this being a mobile game early on. Sure the graphics were easily dont on mobiles, but surely not all the physics peter had promised. Weather varience based on terrain etc. Sure enough, Peter is a dirtly theif that promised us a new god game a delivered a game for the throngs of children that have parent supplied iOS devices with mummy an daddies credit cards hooked up to the istore. It's a very low quality mobile game. VERY LOW QUALITY. I abandoned lionhead after they focused only on the horrible craptastic title of Fable. Peter leaving to start again gave me hope. Followed black an white since I got some random magazine that came with a cd that had a video of peter showing the very biginning of Black an White. The hand, the gestures, the ideas. That game and Black an White 2 turned out pretty good. I had always wanted another black and white god game. Thought this was it. Oh man was I wrong. Don't waste disk space with this trash. It's terrible. Just go buy a new copy of black and white 1 & 2 if you want a good god game. Cause this is not it.F*CK YOU PETER MOLYNEUX!!!!!			",21,9,0,18,13,0,25

								ok new update, nice I though and whent in to play.hmm where to start:first of, I do like that they change how things work when gathering belive, makes it easier to drag over than clicking one and one.aslo like the new follower leach, makes it easier to move them around, tho that said, what to do with the unemploide followers walking anround your world doing nothing at all, but cause a poppup msg saying they are lost.this brings me over to the bad part of this game witch is, they anoying poopups, and toturials in the game, and the sounds that foolows.this is actualy the first game I actually had to ""Turn"" of the sound in, to not have to lissen to it all the time.Serriosly forsing a toturial on ppl ain't a good idea, have a damn option to turn it off atleast, so we have the option to skip it.when you have a desently big settlement the popos and sounds really take off, and goes of every 1-2 sec.what the hell?you would thing that is it?.... Wrong there is a huge graphical glitch in the game as well.after you played for about 10 min or soo, you get the screen flashing with black squars randomly moving around your screen.to awoid this you have no option than restart the game, or have your eyes hurt like hell after watching of for 5 min!!at the end I do have to say I actaly enjoyd the 1.3.1 more than the new one, not because the game is badly designs,but you are forced to follow the tutorial, and have to lisen to the poppups all the time, as well as the graphic glitches..as far as the setellment goes, it should prob be auto assign setlles, like this:Builder settlment, produses  builders by derfaultFarmer settelment, produses farmers by derfaultmining settelment, produses miners by derfaultwould work bether than the current system where you need to asign all the houses in the settelment.though the point of the Update was to get rid of micromanagment, not take away some and add it at another place.at the moment I won't recommend this game to anyone, witch is sad since I actually had great hope for it first time I played it.

								Another bag of fertilizer brought to you by the world's greatest salesman, Peter Molyneux (Creator of Fable / Lion's Head). This game even for an ""Early Access"" was released way to soon, and with way to many promises from a man who loves to promise the sky then not deliver. I rarely try to pile only bad into reviews for anything, but it was my own fault for trusting this Lead Dev again, oh well. It does appear that development has been quietly abandoned on this project, with no updates in several weeks now. Reddit users on the Godus forum have said they only received canned e-mail respones from 22 cans. Maybe check it out if / when it gets finished, otherwise stay away for now and sink your 20 spot elsewhere. One passing thought, on these early access terms, what happens to us if it does get abandoned since we were never delivered the promised product by the developer?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								TLDR: Spent $20 on this game … it was $19.50 more than I should have spent.I tried to like this game, I really did ... but to be perfectly honest, I found Cookie Clicker (http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) to have more depth and entertainment value.  Granted this game is still in development ... but unless its gutted and rebuilt from the ground up it will never amount to anything. - Resources comprise of ""faith"" and ""gems"" ... faith requires you to click each house to gather it ... and you have hundreds of houses ... it is repetitive and boring.  Gems on the other hand wreaks of micro-transactions. - Upgrade tree is … well … not a upgrade tree.  You do not get to pick which path you take, and advancements are based on these stupid little cards that pop up and cover your screen for way too long. - Land masses are procedurally generated and look amazing but sculpting the landscape for use of your villagers is tedious and annoying. - Once you start the game there is no way of going back and restarting.  There is no ability to reset to try things differently.  This sucks alot when you spend a bunch of gems early on just to find out that you need them for something else and have no way of un-doing your previous actions.			",110,17,0,11,16,0,19

								I struggle to fathom a more turdily boring game, that fails to, (in my opinion), deliver on any level of enjoyment or artistic concept: be it due to the needlessly repetitive extraction of buried 'resource' chests, how your population requires depressingly mind-numbing levels of micro-management to sustain it or the fact that your so called 'people' and 'civilisation' have little or no cohesion and would rather build indiscriminately on any speck of land that bares itself, opposed to the land a so called ""God"" would set aside for them, in what was supposed to be your, the player's simulation?!... This and the really weird scripted AI where I genuinely at first was concerned that I was playing with a real girl that subsequently appeared was being abused by her father or something of horrendous sorts.The mechanics of this game remind me of an unflushed toilet... nobody wants to go near them, and the only way it can be fixed is with a pull of the handle and some Febreeze™, (other brands are availible).        Not so much the ""regenesis"" of the god game... more an inbred, drooling, six fingered variant screaming ""Kill me"" in a wavering teary voice. Personally, I feel this game is bitterly disappointing, even in its current development build, (of which I conceed, it is still in development). I can only hope for drastic redesign in many key components of the game if I'll ever reconsider playing it again myself.Thus in my personal opinion, I wouldn't buy this game again, and I implore to seriously consider the long term development ""ideas"" with a pinch of salt... and blatent realism, before you commit to buying this game.

								Ok, Ive put a ton of hours into this game since buying it a YEAR ago. It had its problems back then and it still does now. Instead now this feels like a game i would play on my phone. Atleast (regardless how broken it was back then) when i first got this game a year ago, i had something to do and mindlessly sculpting land into what i wanted did have its charm. Now however i find myself waiting for belief, to rope my villagers into a pit for gems. Using the gems to buy more belief, then to rinse and repeat as i wait for HOURS for wheat to grow, to use up right as it does to build one or two more houses, so i can kill more people to... do it all again. That is all this game is. Waiting and killing people for gems. This is just such a broken game now and for it to still not be done is just f*cking mind blowing. Im done waiting. After a year and only getting what 10% more of a game that cant pick what it wants to be? No Thank You. Don't Buy This Game. Its not worth the time or money i put into it so don't waste yours either.0/10 wouldn't play again			",32,12,0,10,24,0,3

								If you were dumb enough to come to this page after googling Godus but smart enough to check the reviews, then you are a better shopper than me.I grabbed this game in 2013 when it was in Early Access. I should have known better than to think Peter Molyneux would ever deliver anything ever. Google around. You'll see the game isn't done, probably won't ever be done, and what is here is just a hollow experience that is pretty nice at first until it rolls over and dies in front of you.You'll see long wait times... in a PC game you paid for. Why is that? Becuase this isn't a PC game. It's designed as a freemium app for mobile devices. In the early alpha, we saw these elements peaking into the PC version, and I think all feedback said ""Don't you do that. You said you wouldn't."" So, they removed the ability to buy gems, and instead, you have to sacrifice follows for gems, but you still need them to speed up progress.The gameplay is shallow and propped up by timers. If you cheat and get infinite gems, you'll spend thousands of gems just to get something close to what you want to build at the pace you wanted to build it.

								This has got to be, without a doubt, the worst PC game I've played in years.  I think that largely, it's the disappointment that makes me loathe it so.  I was expecting a PC game. What I got instead is some guy taking my $20 and using it to make an iOS game he makes a fortune off of selling premium content for, whilst I am left with a crappy port of said game.  If I can offer one piece of advice, it would be to play the iOS version.  PC games are not something you should wait around for 20+ minutes for something to build in.  It is literally the exact same game, sans the purchasing of premium content.  Instead, you are admonished to destroy your populace (one of the resources) in order to eventually kill enough of them off to purchase something that allows you to sit down and build a hut. At least the iOS version is free; it was built using the money we got suckered into paying for the PC Version.			",117,34,0,53,41,0,63

								I struggle to fathom a more turdily boring game, that fails to, (in my opinion), deliver on any level of enjoyment or artistic concept: be it due to the needlessly repetitive extraction of buried 'resource' chests, how your population requires depressingly mind-numbing levels of micro-management to sustain it or the fact that your so called 'people' and 'civilisation' have little or no cohesion and would rather build indiscriminately on any speck of land that bares itself, opposed to the land a so called ""God"" would set aside for them, in what was supposed to be your, the player's simulation?!... This and the really weird scripted AI where I genuinely at first was concerned that I was playing with a real girl that subsequently appeared was being abused by her father or something of horrendous sorts.The mechanics of this game remind me of an unflushed toilet... nobody wants to go near them, and the only way it can be fixed is with a pull of the handle and some Febreeze™, (other brands are availible).        Not so much the ""regenesis"" of the god game... more an inbred, drooling, six fingered variant screaming ""Kill me"" in a wavering teary voice. Personally, I feel this game is bitterly disappointing, even in its current development build, (of which I conceed, it is still in development). I can only hope for drastic redesign in many key components of the game if I'll ever reconsider playing it again myself.Thus in my personal opinion, I wouldn't buy this game again, and I implore to seriously consider the long term development ""ideas"" with a pinch of salt... and blatent realism, before you commit to buying this game.

								To start off I do think Godus has a lot of potential but with that being said I really don't feel like it is taking advantage of this golden opportunity to make an amazing game. For starters...The 41% of the game that we are able to play at this moment is very fragmented meaning there are a lot of loose ends that have yet to be completed which is reasonable to a point. This game is in beta I know, but usually more content is released in a beta version.The game mechanics are tedious and boring. I have gotten to the farthest point in the game so far (near the end of the bronze age) and not much has changed since the beginning of the game. You drag land to make plots so your villagers can hide out in your house and only come out once you have cleared yet another plot. Furthermore you spend a fat portion of your time clearing rocks and destroying trees. It lacks in appealing and detailed aesthetics. Trees and rocks are nice but the game is missing many major elements that could make the landscape much more appealing to look at.The card system is very annoying and it takes way too much time to increase population and gather food.There aren't enough powers. I know more will be added but for a beta there are not nearly enough.In the end this game is still very much a work in progress. What has been released is very boring in fact the only fun part was raining meteorites down on my below average intelligence, house dwelling ♥♥♥♥♥ known as followers. My advice to you is buy the game while it is cheap and wait until the full game comes out or make sure your investment is secure and only buy it once you know they haven't abandoned the game and it's fully completed, keep in mind it will be much more expensive at this point if it is any good.

								Ok, Ive put a ton of hours into this game since buying it a YEAR ago. It had its problems back then and it still does now. Instead now this feels like a game i would play on my phone. Atleast (regardless how broken it was back then) when i first got this game a year ago, i had something to do and mindlessly sculpting land into what i wanted did have its charm. Now however i find myself waiting for belief, to rope my villagers into a pit for gems. Using the gems to buy more belief, then to rinse and repeat as i wait for HOURS for wheat to grow, to use up right as it does to build one or two more houses, so i can kill more people to... do it all again. That is all this game is. Waiting and killing people for gems. This is just such a broken game now and for it to still not be done is just f*cking mind blowing. Im done waiting. After a year and only getting what 10% more of a game that cant pick what it wants to be? No Thank You. Don't Buy This Game.

								If you were dumb enough to come to this page after googling Godus but smart enough to check the reviews, then you are a better shopper than me.I grabbed this game in 2013 when it was in Early Access. I should have known better than to think Peter Molyneux would ever deliver anything ever. Google around. You'll see the game isn't done, probably won't ever be done, and what is here is just a hollow experience that is pretty nice at first until it rolls over and dies in front of you.You'll see long wait times... in a PC game you paid for. Why is that? Becuase this isn't a PC game. It's designed as a freemium app for mobile devices. In the early alpha, we saw these elements peaking into the PC version, and I think all feedback said ""Don't you do that. You said you wouldn't."" So, they removed the ability to buy gems, and instead, you have to sacrifice follows for gems, but you still need them to speed up progress.The gameplay is shallow and propped up by timers. If you cheat and get infinite gems, you'll spend thousands of gems just to get something close to what you want to build at the pace you wanted to build it. There are these busy-work side voyages that plays like lemmings without good AI.Oh, if you have issues, 22cans will probably ignore you or ban you if you say anything negative about this game.Just move on.

								Definitely among the worst games I've had to pay for.If you had every feature enabled from the start, you could probably have an hour or two of mildly amusing gameplay.BUT, you don't. You don't have anything. You can sculpt the very simple landscape a bit, then you can click on the purple bubble every 5 minutes, and then you can get annoyed every 15 minutes when you get a 'Resource Card' - which makes you wait through this lame♥♥♥♥♥'card-flip'-animation every ♥♥♥♥ing time (and at times you can go through 5 or more of these in a row - and you have to click 'X' in between all of them).I've basically spent 10 hours just waiting for nothing to happen..Best thing I can say about the game; the melody it makes if you rythmically click the purple 'Faith Point'-bubbles made me smile once or twice!

								Update: version 2.01 - after a loong time a new release.. but before you get too excited about that... 'sorry,all your progress will be deleted and you'll have to restart the whole thing from the beginning' that's the first thing you'll notice!About the gameplay, the clicking system as improved, now you can click once to destroy rocks and trees but after a while you'll have the same click click click as before ( i.e. while sculpting land ), the whole world resemble a giant onion, made of layers and you sculpt it by adding or removing layers, and after a while it makes you cry like a real onion but you cry from the frustation!The resources are gone.. well.. now you have resources but call them 'stickers' and attach those stickers to the cards.. you need a certain number of 'stickers' to unlock a card, and you need to meet certain goals to have a card, after a few hours of playing you'll need way too much sticker and simply give up looking for them, no reward factor in this, some cards are plain useless! Now you have 'voyage' maps, where you need to complete a task within a time limit to unlock more stickers, boring after the 10th mission..After playing for more than 5 hours the only god powers i had were sculpting and finger of god.. my followers at least can build houses and field but i can only sculpt land.. And there comes the point, is there a point in this game? i understand it's a sandbox game but this is a QUICKsandbox game, you don't have an objective, you don't have god power, you simply stare at your followers taking up to 15 minutes ( yes.. 15 minutes, there's even a countdown above each construction ) to build one single house. A big No again for me.. no fun, no innovation, no promised update, they simply changed name to some things in the game ( i.e. resources -> stickers, battle maps -> voyage ). Let's see what else they can (un)change with the next release, really hope they give up and give me back my moneyBeing a God has never been so boring :/ you just click and click and click.. did i forgot to say that you need to click? at the beginning it is quite rewarding, you see your population growing but after a few hours when you literally need to take down a whole mountain to make room for a new settlement you just start to figure how many click-click-click you'll need and simply gave up. the powers are useless.. you just use the power to sculpt the terrain and sometimes the totem, you'll never need the swamp or meteor not even during the battles. About battles.. nothing epic at all, just a few punch and your followers sometimes stares at the enemy and do nothing. You'll feel so lonely after a while since there's only your tribe and no one else in the main world to interact... you advance in tech by digging up cards, yes, i said digging so you need to clickclickclick your way to the card.. please developers, remove the meteor strike and give as the most powerful god power of all the time... the frightening AUTOCLICK GOD POWER!! yeahhhh lol			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Something important is missing from Godus.I remember playing Populus and being excited every time my people made a new house. I knew that by having that new house, I would have more resources to use against the enemy. I wanted more houses because I wanted to win the map, then move on to the next one. It was a race against another civilization.What am I doing in Godus? Just slowly making my civilization bigger over time, with absolutely no risk or challenge. It doesn't matter what I do, I cannot lose. It's not a game with a goal, it's just a pretty sandbox with not a whole lot of sand.This is the current state of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's not a lot I can say about Godus as it has been a colossal dissapointment. Even after the promised updates to add complexity and remove frustration from the game, Peter Molyneux has just added to his far reaching repotoir of hyperbole and false promises that have been voiced this past decade. To save wasting my time on writing a full and critical review on this alpha title (I admit, it is still in alpha so there is always the chance for things to change, but the fact that they called their last radicual update a huge change is quite an obnoxious joke and I don't see anything siginifcant changing) I will summarise what the experience amounts to. It is an iOS game through and through that is being developed and playtested on PC. It's overly simplistic interface leaves a lot to be desired by a PC gamer, and clearly is designed with a touch interface in mind.The past complaint by players of how the game involved ""Too much clicking"" has largely been ignored, despite statements to the contrary by 22cans. It seem's as though Peter, or perhaps the lead developers on a whole, have somehow made a design path that has lead them to the same end result of most cow clicker games you can find on your mobile device, that center around town building and what have you. The only difference? Godus has next to no resource management save for Belief, which is frankly retrieved in a horrible manner where one has to wait a full 5 real life minutes for a settler abode to generate a bubble, then you must click the bubble to gather said resource. Sound's harmless? You burn through belief in a manner of seconds just from terraforming the land, and often have to click around 100 houses to gather all your Belief. The problem becomes less of an issue late game, where you have access to Towns that auto collect -some- of the Belief into one giant bubble, but it is still too easily spent and leaves you waiting to anymore work. The amount of waiting you have to do in this game is it's biggest crime. Which add's to my theory that it is designed for mobile devices. You're only supposed to play the game in small snippets, then leave it in the background as your settlers breed and generate Belief. That's unacceptable for a PC game. When you're sat at your desk infront of the monitor, you don't want to be waiting for 80% of your gaming experience.TL:DR?Godus is shaping up to be a cow-clicker that has yet to be monitised, but I can see that being added further down the line as they approach full release. If you're looking for a God game, I highly advise people look elsewhere. As Godus just does not deliver on it's namesake's implications.			",208,23,0,32,14,4,18

								The thought behind the game is somewhat good, but... Its just lacking in sooo many ways. The ""currency"" system is based on income/hour, so after playing 30-40 minutes, you run out and might as well just quit and come back later. Oh, and the pricing system for settlements is increasing, so the 2nd, 3rd and so on is suddently ALOT more expensive = progress is getting slower...The card system - the cards them selfes work pretty desent, BUT...

There is not really communication going between the DEV's and the Community. What once was a most promising Game on PC , is now a doubtfull mobile game.If you look for a real godgame > Try playing B&W again.. It gives you more satifaction then this game will give you..

								The thought behind the game is somewhat good, but... Its just lacking in sooo many ways. The ""currency"" system is based on income/hour, so after playing 30-40 minutes, you run out and might as well just quit and come back later. Oh, and the pricing system for settlements is increasing, so the 2nd, 3rd and so on is suddently ALOT more expensive = progress is getting slower...The card system - the cards them selfes work pretty desent, BUT... You have to put ""stickers"" on them to activate them. And stickers...

								Just wait. It may get better. So far it's a lot of clicking, as everyone else has been saying. I hope they can fix some of the big problems in the game, like the incredible amount of tedious clicking that you need to do in order to get anywhere in the game. That's not to say there aren't positive things. I enjoy the art style of the game. It's quite pretty. It's just that the cons outweigh the pros of this game. You're supposed to feel like a God, and yet that doesn't feel very special in this game. It is a very expensive mobile game in this current state. Hold off.			",228,27,2,16,30,3,21

That's this, except you paid for the game. It's not that extreme, you can do other things while you wait, but that's just the cheapest mechanic ever, and I paid 20 dollars for the game so I should get a full experience. Otherwise, this game is cool, but doesn't give you enough control. Pretty much you just move land and hope to win.			",108,13,1,16,13,2,17

								They've joined the DARK SIDE of ""Early Access"" and it It looks like the Development team took their money and ran.  It was fun, but now not so much. What once was found, is now sadly lost. In my Opinion there is less to do after the patch, and seriously there is no way they can say this game is almost 50% complete. NO WAY! The Godus team needs to pick a clear direction, get motivated and get back on track. At this time, It's just not worth the money.Will update if they can get it right.J.Boog out!

								Update 5/18/2016: Peter Molyneux is still dreaming of Dog Friendship and I haven't opened up the game since. I wonder what the guy who found out what was in the cube is up to?peter molyneux lied to me. though I'm happy to give Peter Molyneux more money for him to dream of dog friendship, I am sort of upset that Peter Molyneux lied to me about his latest god game.Modern video games don't mean clicking a bunch!!! There was, however, so much clicking in Godus that the amount I did when I first tried the beta actually made me very hesitant to ever open up the game again. I will wait until the game is formally released, I guess, and then see if there is less clicking at that point.			",259,67,2,43,28,4,15

								A game that doesn't develop in real time. It develops per click. For a god game, you're supposed to influence and then sit back, letting the world behave how it wants to behave.But no, this is a clicker. If you don't click, you don't progress. Click click click click. That's the only gameplay element here. Yeah you can move layers of earth, but you're only doing that to create building space, which happens after you click click click click.This is not a god game, it is a click game. Until it is real time, dynamic and a living world that just evolves with a player only nudging and influencing trends this game is heading to a terrible finished product. And it is a beta, meaning features are locked. The game won't be improving...oh damn!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Steam should allow returns for early acess game. Why? Becasue this ""game"" is so boring. Its a cow clicker, and not in a good way.The object of the game is scuplt the land and allow your settlement to grow by providing flat land to expand upon. The only issue is the land scuplting is flawed, the land forming doesn't feel accurate and at times it just doesn't work. You need flat land so any idea of creating a ""unique"" island is gone as you need to have more followers. Nothing is auto-managed and the village is so unintresting. Life isn't there, everyone looks the same and they don't do anything on their own. You can only get ""faith"" from clicking on their hovels and begin expanding when they raise their little flags. You also need to wait for some time to get anywhere as theres a timer on everything. The way its set up it feels like a free-to-play game that you would play on your iphone or tablet, not something that you would play on steam. Updates aren't frequent, and unlike other early acess game which at least give a game with some playablity, godus is right up there with towns in which the game just isn't there. I say if I could I would love a refund and uninstall this ""game"". But life ain't fair so all I can say to those who are looking at this game is this, spend your money on other games.

								When i first got the game it used to be simple, progression was quick and rewarding a good game to waste a few hours. But then i stoped playing for awhile then i reinstalled it and it was in beta i lost my old save and had to start again they added lots of new crap into the game make progression slow now and less rewarding. Unless this crap get ironed out in the full release its not worth paying for it now ♥♥♥♥ing thanks 22can's			",61,14,0,1,10,2,19

								It's like paying $20 (or whatever it was) for a soulless and empty facebook clickathon.Molyneux continues to disappoints (something I thought might not be possible). This game completely fails to achieve it's non-lofty goals.Do not buy this. Buy something from a developer that doesn't treat you like a rat in a Skinner box ... like ""Risk of Rain"" or ""Infested Planet"".			",153,41,3,27,32,1,36

								Addition - 24/07/2014I genuinely can not believe Steam are still pushing this `game` for £14.99! I am one of the unfortunate ( and I admit stupid) ones that fell for the hype as soon as I saw the `game` crop up on steam. I have had the last laugh though. My `investment` in this `game` has provided me with many belly laughs reading comments on the forums!  R.I.P Peters career along with 22 cans.OriginalUpdate 2.0 Hurrah. 0.8 hrs played. That`ll be my lot. Deleted.+ Clicking - pretty much gone.- Waiting 9 minutes for my belief bubbles to refill so I can progress - still there. Tablet game.EPIC FAIL in my oh so most humble opinion.

								Ignore the video, any pictures and any comments from the devs at the moment. The game is currently frustrating and very lacking. While it still has potential to be a fun little god game, it would seem that is a very very long way off and in it's current for it is not worth paying ANY money for. The game lacks any real goal or aim, the terraforming is clunky and not easy to use, being unable to rotate the camera, accuratly drag bits of land and having to unlock further tools in a very slow process makes it even worse. Dwellings cannot upgrade themselves so frequently have to destroy and start again. You are forced into a very linear process of population growth, side games or specific area population in order to progress. The AI... never progresses past the nealithic age, they'll still randomly stop working or wander off throught the game. All of this coupled with the fact there are some game crashing bugs, save loss moments and possibly more updates that will cause you to loose any saved maps means this is a game to avoid still and for a long time to come. The game is possibly the poster child for bad examples of early access. (P.S the game will also make you grumpy, because if you play it you'll see the potential and want to play what the game should be at the end of all the mess)			",156,12,1,34,31,0,51

Early Access Review
								I don't know where to begin. There are multiple horrible problems with this game and they are all related:1. HeritageThe game was developed for mobile phones and Windows.It very obviously shows. Not just in the gameplay (I'll come to this later), but also in the UI and the controls which are terribad and only use one mouse button from what I can tell.2. Controls aka ""digging sucks""The game is built around the mechanic of modifying the land your people are living on. This wouldn't be so bad (just look at From Dust) if it was actually fun. But there are a few problems that make it un-fun in every way possible.The main one of which is that it controls just terribly. With the new update they at least made you stronger so you don't have to click a hundred times to move some dirt around.But the other problem is that not only you can only move one ""layer"" at once (which is bad enough as it is), but it's also extremely hard to know which layer the game will think you want to modify which is doubly frustrating because it costs ""belief"" (the resource generated by your people, also the only real resource)3. GameplayThere are no resources like in B&W or other RTS games. You just have to get belief, which is possible to get just by waiting. The game doesn't even have to be running. You just have to check in from time to time to pop the belief bubbles in your village like in Facebook or mobile free to play games.The entire gameplay consists of getting upgrades for your people. This works by unlocking unlock cards by getting more population which you get by flattening land (at this point I want to remind you of point 2) and clicking on icons that pop up over your houses to build more houses. Houses are free, the only cost they have is that they take up time to build (only a few seconds) and some flat land which you have to painstakenly flatten.After you repeated the above process enough times to get enough houses and followers you finally get an unlock card. But to actually use it you have to spend research resources on them. These are little stickers with themes like technology or socializing. By dragging enough of them on a card you get its advantage/upgrade.Doesn't sound half bad, right? Well, actually it sounds half bad, but it's actually full-bad. The reason for that is because of how you get those stickers:You have to get them out of treasure chests burried deep within the terrain around your village. This means you have to expand your village (i.e. flatten more land->build more houses) to get more land to find treasure chests in. Once you found a treasure chest (you can tell where they are by the little floating leafs above the ground) and dug it out you get a random sticker. At this point I want to remind you of point 2 again because this is basically all you'll be doing.That's all there is to the gameplay...4. GraphicsIt actually looks quite nice. I like the graphics style. I just wanted to end with something positive.			",279,46,11,16,28,2,35

Early Access Review
								Even for an early access game there is barely enough content yet to warrant paying the exorbitant amount of that the developers are demanding. What happened to the good old days where gamers are able to purchase a full and complete game? With the threat of game contents held for ransom via microtransactions that borders on being unethical in the gaming universe, many have chosen to hold tightly to their purse coins and keep their eyes on this game with full trepidation. Had I known it would be as bad, I would not have purchased it. Had I known it was the state that it was in I would priced it at least 80-90% off the current asking price. I got it during the Christmas sale and decided to try give it a chance. Was very dissapointed.This game may have what it takes to be successful, however the state that the game is right now I strongly suggest that customers hold on to the their cash. The developers should be paying us because essentially we are the game testers, we are the ones coming up with suggestions and constructive criticsm.  I have clocked in decent amount of hours into this game and I can't progress any further within a few hours. I even started over several times with different strategies with the hope of better outcomes and still nada, ziltch, NOTHING! I have played other early access games that are cheaper and has a larger game content than Godus at it's current state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Absolut time and money waste.All Kickstarter backers got betrayed, they took the money from people that wanted a pc game and now they are making the game as Mobile version with microtransactions to grab more money.Since Early Access (Sep. 2013) 2 ""big patches"" which changed nearly nothing accept making the waiting timers LONGER -.- (all people said since day one they need to go or need to be reduced) So nothing else to do in this game accept clicking your mouse into oblivion and waiting a couple of hourse for a villager to be born or to collect belive which lets you spend it in seconds.Peter Molyneux is talking, talking and talking but nothing happens. (for people that know him it was no surprise that he allways overpromises stuff, but he topped it this time once more with his bait and switch)This is the last game i bought from you Peter.There are way more better games that got made in less time, hopefully you see and read this review and others and spend your money on something awesome.

								I was attracted by the description of ""GOD GAME"" But it doesn't feel even close to any god game I've ever played... and not in a good way at all.Ok, I will cut them SOME slack because it is in early development but still.. the direction the game has been going so far is not really entertaining at all.The map/land is made out of layers and layers of land which to expand your ""civilization"" you have to pull it apart to make it flat. You cannot pull land unless you have enough belief which you have to WAIT for it to regenerate on your already constructed settlements. The mechanics of this is extremely tedius and boring. Eventually you can unlock ways to destroy your own settlements as if they thought this would be fun.. it's not. It feels like an evolved version of farmville but with a fake promise of ""civilization building"".Seriously, do not pay money for this game. IFFFF They improve this game and actually point it into the direction of a God Game, I will edit this review accordingly.			",57,6,0,6,17,0,12

								""Godus"" is a game, hard to understand and at first might seem quite boring! Just dragging land, making houses... Thats it?! Nope.

								It's an okay game. But very slow start up and land scuplting which is pretty much the base game play. Took about 8 to 10 hours just to get the land to a point were I could settle it enough to get to the next era. Also as of right now they have not completed the next era and there is like 10 of them to go. So expet to put in 10+ hours per era in game play. Oh and heres the kicker this is an MMO type game if you ever want to get out of the bronze age you have to fight and win against other players on steam and seeing how they have not made it so you can play with anyone other than the ones on your list right now don't waste your time until the game is completed.

								Godus First thing that i would like to say is that the game is still in Bata and they are only 50% complete. I have been playing the Bata since it first came out. I have seen some realy cool stuff that they have created and may or may not use on their end product. One thing is for sure that do not want you to do anything quickly  building a Small houes  39 sec to 2 min  Large houes  39 min maybe more that is where i called it.  Small farm 5 Min Large farm 1 hour 10 Min the first few land expantions  in minutes  1, 10, 30, then 4 hours  8 hours 24 Hours the coin of the relm is Belief. it used to be that you would  slam down a large number of houses and collect the belief as it became available. that has changed however. Now building is set by the number of crops that you are collecting at the time the only houses that do not cost you crops are the ones that are within the settlements.  Again just another way slow you down.   Sculpting: what can i cay about this. EXPENSIVE stay close to the water level.  from the water level up to the first green level are free after that the cost of belief go up very quickly. dont even think about moving the top of a mountain 2K+ just to peal the top layer off the peak.on a scale of 1 to 10  FUN = 3WORK = 12this game has turned out to be a JOB constantly waiting on somthing to doSorry but i have to give this agame a thumbs DOWN ",42,1,0,1,5,0,5

								So being early access I can only comment on the core game-play as it exists. That being said it fails to meet all promises put forth by both the early access pitch and the kickstarter campaign that funded it.The roadmap they have released shows they have no interest in community feedback and no real desire to meet the commitment they have made.Recommend avoiding at all costs.

								Following this game since it was first released on Steam Early Access, I have had nothing but high hopes for it. Each iteration has shown that there are core concepts ready to dig their heels in and actually become part of a greater game. Each time, however, they keep missing the mark.At its core, it feels like I've paid money to get a FaceBook game. Everything is about waiting for a few seconds, to nearly half an hour, even in the early stages of the game. While I am no stranger to waiting for buildings to be constructed or resources to be collected, the concept of using 'gems' to speed up construction simply reminds me of what happened to Peter's other brainchild, Dungeon Keeper.With Godus 2.2, there's a little more polish to the front end, and definitely some optimizations taking place to the engine, but for being a God Game, it feels like I have little control. Maybe in another year things will get better. Until then, I'd spend money on something different.			",190,23,5,25,44,3,37

There is little depth and whenever they are actually on the verge of a playable game they wipe everything and start over again.  It seems like the devs don't even know what this game is going to be.

								Kickstarter promise: A Real Time Strategy God Game for PC, a sequel to the Populous franchise.What we are getting: A mobile click fest with build timers, like Farmville. An ordinary mobile game on PC.I'm writing this while still on Beta. This is not what we have been promised on Kickstart. Being scammed by Peter Molyneux, is like being r@ped by Mozart or Picasso: you keep denying it because it felt good helping someone famous getting what they wanted, but it's still a serious r@ping and you know you'll never walk straight again.Can I ask my money back? No. Can I delete this from my Steam Library? No. Can you help me forget this? No. Can it become a good game? Of course. I'll change this review, if it becomes a decent game after the Beta. Chances?

								This isn't the regenesis of the God-sim game. It is a mobile game masquerading as something more. The game is an endless clickfest that far removes you from the very idea of being a deity. Mana is manually gathered & ""upgrades"" are unlocked by digging up chests of stickers to stick on upgrade cards. The game pace is very slow, with mana & grain accumulation creeping up whilst you sit looking at a very sterile world environment, waiting for timegates on shrines or houses to complete. Your god powers are very limited for much of the early game - allowing you to do little more than push around ground or set out settlements (at great expense).Avoid. If you want a good recent godsim, get From Dust. If you want a better mobile game, try Plague Inc or the Kim Kardashian thing.			",19,12,0,8,13,0,5

Early Access Review
								Before Godus, I had never before played a game of the ""God Game"" genre, but I can flat-out say that this excuse for a PC game ruined it. This game was built to be one of those money-wasting App Store purchases you buy on your smartphone, where you wait a couple days for some notification to pop up and then collect your resources and leave it aside. For one thing, all you do in this game is click. You click to gather your resources. You click to gather your ""belief"" (the source of power to sculpt the landscaape and so on). You click to influence your people. You click to sculpt the landscape. This type of click based gameplay is not very enjoyable nor easy for a PC based game. Now before I get off hand for why this game was NOT meant for a PC, let me backtrack and explain the other aspects of the game.First of all, you get to mold the whole world around you. In theory this could be fun, since you are a god after all, but somehow this game has taken all the enjoyment out of it. You have a limit to how much you can sculpt, and this is based on your belief. Your belief on the other hand is based on your population. So this means in the early stages of the game, you can do nothing but cover up a few puddles, or smoothen out a miniscule island.The artwork and graphic style of the game seemed creative enough, until it came to the gameplay with it. The world is built in layers of rock, grass, dirt, and sand. This seems appealing to the eye at first, but in game, it was a terrible idea. You can only move one layer at a time, and later upgrade your powers to move larger chunks of layers. This not only causes for lots of unessecary clicking but is also tiring and time consuming. The AI for your followers is also very hard to control and seemed to be built with no thought of the players motives as a god at all. For example, say you were sculpting a bit of land to make your people's small village more clean looking. Once there was a wide enough space, and a villager walking outside, he or she would immediatley run to the clearing and swiftly start erecting a house upon the land. This is not only annoying but inconvinient for players trying to explore the ablility of controlling the land. Because this is an Early Access game, the developers must definitely been working on making this game better, right? No. this is the oppositte of what has been going on. There has been almost no connection between the community and the developers, and what is there is little comments made by the developers summing up to ""This game is great! Buy it!"". After released as Early Access, there was no updats till 5 months later, by then which most of the community had left. The new update erased all of your previous hard work and replaced them with new hunch-backed character models and new tree animations. All of the screenshots you see on the store page aare now completely irrelevant for they have nothing to do with the current state of the game. I am sorry that this review has ventured into the TL;DR zone and now I shall sum it up like a bad third-grade conclusion paragraph: The game was built to be a mobile pay-to-win game. Intuvitve controls are nothing but intuvitive. Creative art style doesnt work. AI is bad. Devlopers dont do anything. It is sad to see a game with such potential go up some careless developer's ***.Please dont bother wasting your money on this. I'd give it a 0/10 for gameplay, or lack of.			",53,6,0,3,6,1,1

								When I first got it, it was extremely fun. I looked forward to new updated. There was a span where I didn't play it. It was when I saw it on the mobile store I wanted to play again on my PC.

Right now I wont recommend it, but If the developers actually fix it and listen, I may change my stance.			",55,3,1,3,16,1,7

								Overall the concept of the game is ok, and I think it will be better once some of the bugs are worked out.  There is a TON of clicking, and the ""card"" system to progress is rather difficult to follow.  Not to mention, land formations cost way too much reputation when you have to clear 20 layers of mountain to build.  Your followers don't have great logic yet either.  Many times I would build a ""stariway"" up a mountain using the layers and it was hit or miss if they'd make it up to the top or walk around for an hour looking for a path.  That and did I mention there is a TON of clicking?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's not that Godus is a bad *game*. a casual world-sculpting game where you build big villages actually is a really cool idea!it's more that Godus is a bad *realization* of that game. sculpting is finnicky and energy-based. unlocking new powers requires hunting around for random stickers or playing a terrible path-finding minigame that pits you against unpredictable and terrible AI with a strict timeline (and the aforementioned finnicky controls). the developer commentary says, ""oh, we don't want you to spend all your time sculpting"", but the game gives significant incentives for you to sculpt *everything*.It's a good idea for a game. In true Peter Molyneux fashion, that idea is lost in the increasingly terrible implementation.			",243,94,2,47,32,1,64

								DO NOT BUY THIS I do though recommend you to download the game ""clash of clans"" on the Ipad though, play it for a week.And then, download Godus on the AppStore (its free there), and then compare the two. ALSO NOTE: The AppStore Version does not even mention that the game is in Development.This game is the most ingenious Browser/IPad-Game i have ever had to play.No, sadly Godus is nothing else but those dreadful facebook games like Farmville  in a fairly beautiful but hollow hull.The gameplay consists of nothing more than constant expanding waiting-times for finnishing new buildings and getting ""belief"", with which you can ""sculpt"" the landscape, which can be rather described as erasing the landscape because that is all you can do, erase, not create.There is no gameplay, there are no tactics, no strategy and no creation. There is just boredom as you watch your builders first for several minutes and later in game a few days to finish building the ever same-looking buildings which in no way deepen the gameplay.There is no vast world. You can not meet your friends. There is nothing.And that is what it will be. The Steam-Version tells you that the game is finished 50-somewhat %. The I-Pad version does not even mention the development-status.This will probably not change. There is no other direction this game could take. It was planned this way from the very beginning and it will finish this way.It will never be the thing Molyneux had us imagine.			",198,42,2,12,16,1,43

								I have never written a review for a game before.  Normally, if a game is bad, I set it aside and just forget about it.  Not Godus.  I feel others should be warned.  Despite it's insistance that ""Because you already bought the game, you shouldn't spend any more money"" this game feels constantly like a micro transaction game.  The faith system is fine.  Aside from the fact that you have to wait to collect it and the higher the elevation of land you want to move, the more in drains your faith so that flattening a tiny mountain can easily take of 10k faith.  The gameplay breaks down to waiting on faith, or waiting on your people to breed so you can kill them again to get more ""gems"" to speed up the game, or waiting on wheat, or waiting on a building to get completed, or waiting on a reinforcements to a voyage.  Oh... the voyages. The voyages (a sidequest to make you feel like you're not just sitting at the computer watching your people do nothing) gives you roughly 3 tries to complete what is basically a lemmings style puzzle.  This is made nearly impossible by the terrible controls.  If you don't succeed, guess what?  More gems.  Need more faith?  More gems.  Wheat?  Gems.  Stickers?  Gems.  This is obviously built around the gem store and the port to a flat price PC game is nothing shy of disingenuous and disgusting.			",198,54,1,58,61,2,70

								Avoid like the plague.This is not worth your time or money as it stands. I feel very sorry for the people who backed this game theough kickstarter. I bought it because I loved Populous, Black and White, and the original Dungeon Keeper; all three of which were referenced in the publicity.It's nothing like any of those three great games. It looks like it could be a very nice populous style game, but it's actually a poorly implemented farmville rip-off. If you like RSI, and waiting, literally hours for timers to run down before you can actually do anything then you will 'love' this. If, like the rest of humanity your time is precious then do something else with your time, preferably involving alcohol, syrup sponge, and your girlfriend (or boyfriend).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Pay to Win mobile/browser game on PC. You can't play continuously, you should just sit and wait till ""belief"" (primary resource) regenerates or more followers become ready for adventure or that house is built or wheat regenerates so you can build things...etc. OR you can just buy gems and don't wait at all. Sounds familiar? Do not buy if you're looking for a PC game.			",38,21,0,10,11,0,6

Early Access Review
								Before Godus, I had never before played a game of the ""God Game"" genre, but I can flat-out say that this excuse for a PC game ruined it. This game was built to be one of those money-wasting App Store purchases you buy on your smartphone, where you wait a couple days for some notification to pop up and then collect your resources and leave it aside. For one thing, all you do in this game is click. You click to gather your resources. You click to gather your ""belief"" (the source of power to sculpt the landscaape and so on). You click to influence your people. You click to sculpt the landscape. This type of click based gameplay is not very enjoyable nor easy for a PC based game. Now before I get off hand for why this game was NOT meant for a PC, let me backtrack and explain the other aspects of the game.First of all, you get to mold the whole world around you. In theory this could be fun, since you are a god after all, but somehow this game has taken all the enjoyment out of it. You have a limit to how much you can sculpt, and this is based on your belief. Your belief on the other hand is based on your population. So this means in the early stages of the game, you can do nothing but cover up a few puddles, or smoothen out a miniscule island.The artwork and graphic style of the game seemed creative enough, until it came to the gameplay with it. The world is built in layers of rock, grass, dirt, and sand. This seems appealing to the eye at first, but in game, it was a terrible idea. You can only move one layer at a time, and later upgrade your powers to move larger chunks of layers. This not only causes for lots of unessecary clicking but is also tiring and time consuming. The AI for your followers is also very hard to control and seemed to be built with no thought of the players motives as a god at all. For example, say you were sculpting a bit of land to make your people's small village more clean looking. Once there was a wide enough space, and a villager walking outside, he or she would immediatley run to the clearing and swiftly start erecting a house upon the land. This is not only annoying but inconvinient for players trying to explore the ablility of controlling the land. Because this is an Early Access game, the developers must definitely been working on making this game better, right? No. this is the oppositte of what has been going on. There has been almost no connection between the community and the developers, and what is there is little comments made by the developers summing up to ""This game is great! Buy it!"". After released as Early Access, there was no updats till 5 months later, by then which most of the community had left. The new update erased all of your previous hard work and replaced them with new hunch-backed character models and new tree animations. All of the screenshots you see on the store page aare now completely irrelevant for they have nothing to do with the current state of the game. I am sorry that this review has ventured into the TL;DR zone and now I shall sum it up like a bad third-grade conclusion paragraph: The game was built to be a mobile pay-to-win game. Intuvitve controls are nothing but intuvitive. Creative art style doesnt work. AI is bad. Devlopers dont do anything. It is sad to see a game with such potential go up some careless developer's ***.Please dont bother wasting your money on this. I'd give it a 0/10 for gameplay, or lack of.			",53,6,0,3,6,1,1

								Alright, let me phrase this by saying I bought this game about a year ago. At that time, Godus was fairly promising. Sculpting the land, building dwellings, it was a relaxing game that I didn't need to focus on too much. I like that sort of thing from time to time. I uninstalled after a while and decided to come back to it today. Yeah. Big mistake.When I started playing this game, it had a few hiccups. The major problem being with a 'card' system. EVERY new power has to be unlocked with substance cards- which you find in chests around the world. Problem is that these are completely random. So you can be stuck with no where to go.Of course, this was six months ago. The new update should have changed something right? Nope.It made it worse. It added a shop system, simalar to farmville or anyother mobile game. While no mini transactions are happening (yet) this makes the card system even more painful to sit through. Your ability to progress is still based on random luck of the draw. The store card packs are also random, from what I can tell, so no luck there. Its incredibly frustrating.To make matters worse- A part of the games abilities lie with faith, which is generated by your followers. It can take up to 20 mins for some of the houses to generate a little bit a faith. Again, this hints to a mobile game like structure, play for a bit then come back later. Not the sort of thing that I want to have Ton my PC.Upon some investigation, I've discovered that all of the problems that I have with the game are things that other players have voiced to developers. Awesome, I thought, that means it may get fixed. Then I see troubling statements, voices being ignored, people being shoved aside. he developers don't seem to care about the players of this version, or these issues would have been fixed ages ago. If you are even considering this game I suggest that you give both the reviews and the forum posts (that AREN'T dev. created) a glance. TL;DR Game looks promising but is delivering false expectation, alongside developers that don't care.			",36,26,0,10,19,0,4

								Do not play this game even though this is in early access it is not worth it. So many things are wrong with it. Including the follower ai which can be happy pathfinding one day but the next, some dust has moved on the mountain and they can no longer get down. It feels more like a chore than a game I once did not log onto it for 16 hours and lost 70 followers. Including all of my farmers. It feels like a facebook game, which is exactly what it is. Its redeeming  factor was the no micro transaction side. I would hope so after paying nearly £20. But the micro transaction system (gems) was still implemented but in the form of villager sacrifice (stupid) I tried to play as Peter Molyneux narated a kind God I never once killed a follower. The happiness system was a horrible addition as your neighbout the Astari threw parties every hour. And who wouldn't want to have a bloody party every hour? The Astari would have a few parties and take my followers. Or I would be on when the Astari had their party and I would smite them which gets increasingly hard as you run out of followers... Meaning the civilisation I was running was in a endless spiral of not enough belief to increase happiness which made me have less culture, which in tern made my followers less happy. Ending in an endless circle. I think this is something that could be fixed but frankly I don't care. If you are looking for a Black and White 3 RUN. Do not waste your money on this. As much as I like Peter Molyneux I prefer sanity, happiness and one less thing in my daily routine.			",168,20,4,17,21,1,40

								Abandon all hope ye who enter here. I started playing this game on the ipad and was enjoying it until the ios8 update wiped out my game. I found it on here and thought, this should be better. How wrong I was. I keep kicking myself, not only for the money I wasted but the time as well.  The controls are clunky and twitchy causign you to waste belief scupting land. The voyages, while nice in theory, are completely closed to a singular solution. Often they fail for no other reason than poor programming. The increasing cost of the settlements, wasted energy and lame voyages have taken this from a fairly relaxing god game into an exercise in grinding.  If you enjoy grinding away for hours at a time with little to no reward, then this punishingly boring game will seem more like a walk through the wild flowers. That brings me to the developer commentary, another feature that seemed interesting a first. While it started out as an insightful look at the behind the scenes, it quickly turned into an annoying, endless montage of excuse, after excuse for why things in the game are terrible followed by the promise that they will get better. I don't see this situation rectifying itself anytime soon. In conclusion, save your money and your precious time. Learn from my poor judgement and move on to the next game on the list. Anything has to be better than this steaming pile.  ",0,2,0,0,4,0,1

Early Access Review
TL;DR version: Peter Molyneux.Gameplay:There are two basic things you need to know about this game beyond one of the biggest red flag names in the gaming industry being attached to it. The first thing is that 95% of the entire gameplay has - through several overhauls - been about shaping the landscape to reach various objectives such as making room for houses or helping your little people get from point A to point B. The second thing you need to know is that the process of shaping the terrain is one of the most inefficient, time consuming, imprecise and straight up maddening things you will encounter in your entire life unless you work in a profession where your boss has tasked you with measuring the exact volume of a unicorn. You will start by trying to grab a layer of the land and start pulling it somewhere only to find that the game has usually selected an entirely different layer than the one you clicked and you'll just haveto get lucky by randomly clicking to get the right one, then you will start pulling it only to find that it will stop immediately in any case where the rest of the terrain can in any way interfere, then you'll finally find a nice solid grab with nothing but smooth sailing only to find that ""wow, I just pulled a laughably small strip of land in a wonky manner almost where it needed to go and now I haveto do this another 6 times to be able to build the tiniest house in the game on flat ground"" and then you will proceed to click and drag so many times that your finger goes numb before you actually start getting any result. As if this wasn't bad enough almost everything else so far also requires such an excessive amount of clicking that it's as if the game tries to give you repetitive stress injuries on purpose.Final word:I want to love this game. I've tried to, I've tried so hard that my wrist went stiff from pain countless times from the hundreds of thousands of pointless clicks but the charming qualities of the game can't justify this. There is no way I'll recommend a game that requires enough painkillers to cause liver failure just for someone to be able to build two settlements in a single day, if they remove ALL the staggering pointless mouse abuse I'll happily recommend it but so far they don't even seem to understand there's a problem. I haven't even mentioned all the wild statements Peter Molyneux has made that (as usual) are completely misleading and will never be part of the game, I love many aspects of many of the games he created but he always overhypes them enough to disappoint millions of people.

								Well I've tried very hard to like this game, having backed it early from Kick Starter. Sadly it's just a 'farming' style time suck.They've thrown in 'gems' to help move bits along, and for the PC you get to sacrifice your people for more gems to additionally help, yet the balance of the game is wrong. It's a lot of sitting around waiting for stuff to happen.Oh yes, you can go do missions once you open the dock, that's if trying to do them doesn't keep making the game crash, and even when it doesn't it just seems to be a lot of against the clock 'lemmings' style missions. There's no real feel of developing, the whole card system just feels silly. If your people are going to advance in areas, surely you should be guiding them to self educate, learn and earn these themselves. Just having them hump eachother until a population count determines they know something is quite shallow.I'd love to go back to B&W if the blasted thing would run.Bottom line, this game has none of the depth we're used to from Peter Molyneux. Sure I don't mind minimal micromanagement, you do though have to have stuff make sense. Here there isn't any. The sculpturing is still a sluggish task too. Can't even have nice things.Avoid unless you really don't care about time and money.			",363,136,36,112,72,4,96

								I could forgive the graphics, I could forgive the sometimes stale gameplay machanics. I actually liked the art style.But the major issue is the obvious built time port from the mobile version. 15 minutes of real time to built one house. And no way of speeding things up. The one thing that the game suggest to go voyage (eg mini games, inside the game) to cover for the time and let your main city built up in the mean time. Is locked behind a once per 24h access wall. Sorry, this is not any where near a PC game. This is a bad mobile port with the pay to play elements left in play, but the ability to pay for it on PC version has been taken out since you already paid for the game in the first place. Which leaves you with nothing to do for hours upon hours.Unless, it will be changed dramatically at some point stay away from it. It is not worth any of your time or money at the moment.

								Overall the concept of the game is ok, and I think it will be better once some of the bugs are worked out.  There is a TON of clicking, and the ""card"" system to progress is rather difficult to follow.  Not to mention, land formations cost way too much reputation when you have to clear 20 layers of mountain to build.  Your followers don't have great logic yet either.  Many times I would build a ""stariway"" up a mountain using the layers and it was hit or miss if they'd make it up to the top or walk around for an hour looking for a path.  That and did I mention there is a TON of clicking?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								DO NOT BUY THIS I do though recommend you to download the game ""clash of clans"" on the Ipad though, play it for a week.And then, download Godus on the AppStore (its free there), and then compare the two. ALSO NOTE: The AppStore Version does not even mention that the game is in Development.This game is the most ingenious Browser/IPad-Game i have ever had to play.No, sadly Godus is nothing else but those dreadful facebook games like Farmville  in a fairly beautiful but hollow hull.The gameplay consists of nothing more than constant expanding waiting-times for finnishing new buildings and getting ""belief"", with which you can ""sculpt"" the landscape, which can be rather described as erasing the landscape because that is all you can do, erase, not create.There is no gameplay, there are no tactics, no strategy and no creation. There is just boredom as you watch your builders first for several minutes and later in game a few days to finish building the ever same-looking buildings which in no way deepen the gameplay.There is no vast world. You can not meet your friends. There is nothing.And that is what it will be. The Steam-Version tells you that the game is finished 50-somewhat %. The I-Pad version does not even mention the development-status.This will probably not change. There is no other direction this game could take. It was planned this way from the very beginning and it will finish this way.It will never be the thing Molyneux had us imagine.			",198,42,2,12,16,1,43

So the unique game got scrapped a half dozen times.

Plus the devs have released a second game that was given to us owners for free, only to be charged in game $5 if we wanted more than a few hours of gameplay... The hell?!

								I will start with how much fun this game is in the beginning. i love the giant sandbox attitude with all the little treasures and what not. it has a fun look and is mostly easy to navigate. What I don't like is after you get going you then hit the point where the land-scaping becomes a chore and a trial of patience, well that is where this game takes a dive. When I play a game, I like to play it not wait to play it. Such a great idea and could still be something great and fun if the spiritual belief system stops behaving like a fremium that stops you from playing. For example, why do I have to wait minutes, hours or even days to get enough belief to clear or add landscape? If they changed that one crucial issue and let you sculpt land without the belief system (or balance the cost of landscaping) then I would recommend this game to everyone. Right now with the game as it is, I feel duped and it doesn't seem to be changing no matter how many people say they don't like the hurry up and wait system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Even after waiting all this time, the best thing I can say about Godus is that it's a mobile game and has no place on the PC.  The incredibly long timers to do anything may be fine to mobile consumers but has absolutely no place in PC gaming.  Peter Molyneaux, you screwed up royally taking P.C. money for youre mobile game.

Sadly, this is probably not the God game you're looking for22Cans promises a great deal with this game, but has so far sadly fallen short in almost every way; a quick run-down through their key beta features reveals a list that sounds promising, but has be missed at almost each turn:You can sculpt the entire world and make it truly unique to you.True to their word pretty much the entire world can be 'sculpted'. However, your ability to alter your surroundings is severely limited. The world is made up of multiple layers stacked upon one another similar to a layered cake. Each layer can be dragged and poked to either cover or reveal the layer below, on occasion revealing a treasure chest (that provides you with stickers or gems - more on both later) or other curio, enabling you to clear space for buildings, fields, mines, and so forth. The system does not however allow you to create your own mountains - you cannot create new layers, only alter or destroy existing ones. Further, each modification takes a certain amount of belief, often leaving you with little to do whilst waiting for your villagers to pray, unless you want to spend gems to purchase more of the stuff.Be adored and worshipped by tiny, devoted Followers. Watch them live, learn and love in a fully simulated world.Admittedly the game is only roughly 51% complete at present, but even with the living followers advancement researched (if you don't research it, the followers will stay in their homes until they are needed to build something) your followers are far from lively. True, they will pop out and form small groups, but it is a far cry from the simulated world we are promised. Additionally, due to the games mechanics, the feeling of God-hood is terribly underwhelming and your ability to interact with your followers begins and ends with sending them to do tasks or sacrificing them for gems.Create villages and towns, grow their population and sculpt the very lands on which they live Building works thusly: First you sculpt a flat area of land revealing a plot upon which you can construct a house. A builder from a nearby Abode will be galvanised into constructing it (which can, I kid you not, take up to 18 minutes real-time before you discover farms, or of course spend gems to speed construction) before populating it with followers and another builder. You will then flatten more land nearby revealing more plots upon which to build house (again, with absurd time penalties). Once you have a few houses nestled together you can combine them into a village using an ever increasing amount of belief. These villages can be specialised to either farming, building, or mining. The first village is always a farming village and has the charming side effect of increasing building construction speed by a factor of ten, making them far faster to build whislt additionally requiring newly accessible wheat to be spent to obtain them. Villages can then be expanded by building more buildings around them and repeating the village construction miracle (for yet more belief). These will then be populated accordingly after an extended period of time (I am currently waiting for a 4 hour 34 minute timer to tick down so that I can get more farmers...fun!). Fountains, shrines, and more can be placed within your civilization but only through the expenditure of a significant amount of gems.Lead Followers from your Homeworld and set sail on Voyages of Discovery to uncharted landsGuide your Followers as they embark on regular Voyages to new and undiscovered lands that hold great rewards.These voyages are a set of logic puzzles set within the Godus universe and are divorced from the mainland. Progress is absurdly easy and you can burn through the vast majority on the first attempt - though should you fail one you will have to wait an inordinate amount of time for reinforcements to crew your ship (unless you wish to spend gems).Nurture the growth of a civilization as it rises from the dawn of the primitive age and advances throughout the ages of humanity.Possibly the game’s most absurd feature is the sticker resource. These small discs can be found throughout the land or obtained for completing voyages, or of course bought with gems (do you see a pattern emerging?) and represent a certain kind of advancement, whether it be technological, societal, or philosophical. These can then be affixed to advancement cards that are unlocked at certain population, wheat, and mineral milestones. The quantity and type required differs from one advancement to the next, but all require a significant investment. These advancements and the order in which you take them can be reviewed at any time in the timeline, though it is so painfully linear that why you would want to is quite beyond me. Do not expect to find Civilisation like research trees here.Meet the Astari - a fun loving, party going little tribe who worship the pursuit of happiness These little fellows are supposed to provide a measure of comedic relief early on, distracting your followers from their duties and generally being quite benign. As the game progresses this role changes and you will find yourself preventing them from stealing followers from you, as every hour you can lose 10% of your population if your happiness is lower than the Astari's. Of course, this leaves you with empty houses that can be re-filled with - yes you guessed it - gems!Cast miracles of both beauty and destruction - choose how to show your divine power, whether that be by growing forests or launching meteors.At present there are a few miracles in the game, and each one require a moderate investment of belief to activate. Their scope is limited at present and it seems that there are more to come.22Cans has been open in stating that the game is being developed for both PC and mobile simultaneously, and it shows. At present the game has the feel of Farmville and its ilk. Everything you do is gated: want to build something? Wait 10 minutes. Want some belief? Wait 5 minutes. Want some wheat? Wait 90 minutes. Of course, these gates can be overcome through the use of gems that are found in chests, rewarded for completing certain tasks, or for sacrificing your followers. Sacrificing has several effects, primarily depriving you of a follower for an extended (30+ minutes) period of time, but also by decreasing your followers’ happiness. This is important as unhappy followers are more likely to leave your settlement to be with the Astari. Gems can be used to fast track almost everything in the game, and can even be exchanged for belief and stickers should you be overly frustrated by the slow pace of acquisition. The company has publicly stated that the 2.2 patch feels very mobile orientated, and I hope that they can make a unique and moreover enjoyable experience for the PC in future patches, but at present this does not seem plausible. Godus is most definitely not worth the investment of time or money in its current iteration and I would encourage anybody to think thrice before purchasing it. A shame really, but there is little fun to be had here, especially for fans of the God genre.			",130,42,0,32,32,1,21

								Well I've tried very hard to like this game, having backed it early from Kick Starter. Sadly it's just a 'farming' style time suck.They've thrown in 'gems' to help move bits along, and for the PC you get to sacrifice your people for more gems to additionally help, yet the balance of the game is wrong. It's a lot of sitting around waiting for stuff to happen.Oh yes, you can go do missions once you open the dock, that's if trying to do them doesn't keep making the game crash, and even when it doesn't it just seems to be a lot of against the clock 'lemmings' style missions. There's no real feel of developing, the whole card system just feels silly. If your people are going to advance in areas, surely you should be guiding them to self educate, learn and earn these themselves. Just having them hump eachother until a population count determines they know something is quite shallow.I'd love to go back to B&W if the blasted thing would run.Bottom line, this game has none of the depth we're used to from Peter Molyneux. Sure I don't mind minimal micromanagement, you do though have to have stuff make sense. Here there isn't any. The sculpturing is still a sluggish task too. Can't even have nice things.Avoid unless you really don't care about time and money.			",363,136,36,112,72,4,96

								Alright, let me phrase this by saying I bought this game about a year ago. At that time, Godus was fairly promising. Sculpting the land, building dwellings, it was a relaxing game that I didn't need to focus on too much. I like that sort of thing from time to time. I uninstalled after a while and decided to come back to it today. Yeah. Big mistake.When I started playing this game, it had a few hiccups. The major problem being with a 'card' system. EVERY new power has to be unlocked with substance cards- which you find in chests around the world. Problem is that these are completely random. So you can be stuck with no where to go.Of course, this was six months ago. The new update should have changed something right? Nope.It made it worse. It added a shop system, simalar to farmville or anyother mobile game. While no mini transactions are happening (yet) this makes the card system even more painful to sit through. Your ability to progress is still based on random luck of the draw. The store card packs are also random, from what I can tell, so no luck there. Its incredibly frustrating.To make matters worse- A part of the games abilities lie with faith, which is generated by your followers. It can take up to 20 mins for some of the houses to generate a little bit a faith. Again, this hints to a mobile game like structure, play for a bit then come back later. Not the sort of thing that I want to have Ton my PC.Upon some investigation, I've discovered that all of the problems that I have with the game are things that other players have voiced to developers. Awesome, I thought, that means it may get fixed. Then I see troubling statements, voices being ignored, people being shoved aside. he developers don't seem to care about the players of this version, or these issues would have been fixed ages ago. If you are even considering this game I suggest that you give both the reviews and the forum posts (that AREN'T dev. created) a glance. TL;DR Game looks promising but is delivering false expectation, alongside developers that don't care.			",36,26,0,10,19,0,4

								Do not play this game even though this is in early access it is not worth it. So many things are wrong with it. Including the follower ai which can be happy pathfinding one day but the next, some dust has moved on the mountain and they can no longer get down. It feels more like a chore than a game I once did not log onto it for 16 hours and lost 70 followers. Including all of my farmers. It feels like a facebook game, which is exactly what it is. Its redeeming  factor was the no micro transaction side. I would hope so after paying nearly £20. But the micro transaction system (gems) was still implemented but in the form of villager sacrifice (stupid) I tried to play as Peter Molyneux narated a kind God I never once killed a follower. The happiness system was a horrible addition as your neighbout the Astari threw parties every hour. And who wouldn't want to have a bloody party every hour? The Astari would have a few parties and take my followers. Or I would be on when the Astari had their party and I would smite them which gets increasingly hard as you run out of followers... Meaning the civilisation I was running was in a endless spiral of not enough belief to increase happiness which made me have less culture, which in tern made my followers less happy. Ending in an endless circle. I think this is something that could be fixed but frankly I don't care. If you are looking for a Black and White 3 RUN. Do not waste your money on this. As much as I like Peter Molyneux I prefer sanity, happiness and one less thing in my daily routine.			",168,20,4,17,21,1,40

								Abandon all hope ye who enter here. I started playing this game on the ipad and was enjoying it until the ios8 update wiped out my game. I found it on here and thought, this should be better. How wrong I was. I keep kicking myself, not only for the money I wasted but the time as well.  The controls are clunky and twitchy causign you to waste belief scupting land. The voyages, while nice in theory, are completely closed to a singular solution. Often they fail for no other reason than poor programming. The increasing cost of the settlements, wasted energy and lame voyages have taken this from a fairly relaxing god game into an exercise in grinding.  If you enjoy grinding away for hours at a time with little to no reward, then this punishingly boring game will seem more like a walk through the wild flowers. That brings me to the developer commentary, another feature that seemed interesting a first. While it started out as an insightful look at the behind the scenes, it quickly turned into an annoying, endless montage of excuse, after excuse for why things in the game are terrible followed by the promise that they will get better. I don't see this situation rectifying itself anytime soon. In conclusion, save your money and your precious time. Learn from my poor judgement and move on to the next game on the list. Anything has to be better than this steaming pile.  ",0,2,0,0,4,0,1

TL;DR version: Peter Molyneux.Gameplay:There are two basic things you need to know about this game beyond one of the biggest red flag names in the gaming industry being attached to it. The first thing is that 95% of the entire gameplay has - through several overhauls - been about shaping the landscape to reach various objectives such as making room for houses or helping your little people get from point A to point B. The second thing you need to know is that the process of shaping the terrain is one of the most inefficient, time consuming, imprecise and straight up maddening things you will encounter in your entire life unless you work in a profession where your boss has tasked you with measuring the exact volume of a unicorn. You will start by trying to grab a layer of the land and start pulling it somewhere only to find that the game has usually selected an entirely different layer than the one you clicked and you'll just haveto get lucky by randomly clicking to get the right one, then you will start pulling it only to find that it will stop immediately in any case where the rest of the terrain can in any way interfere, then you'll finally find a nice solid grab with nothing but smooth sailing only to find that ""wow, I just pulled a laughably small strip of land in a wonky manner almost where it needed to go and now I haveto do this another 6 times to be able to build the tiniest house in the game on flat ground"" and then you will proceed to click and drag so many times that your finger goes numb before you actually start getting any result. As if this wasn't bad enough almost everything else so far also requires such an excessive amount of clicking that it's as if the game tries to give you repetitive stress injuries on purpose.Final word:I want to love this game. I've tried to, I've tried so hard that my wrist went stiff from pain countless times from the hundreds of thousands of pointless clicks but the charming qualities of the game can't justify this. There is no way I'll recommend a game that requires enough painkillers to cause liver failure just for someone to be able to build two settlements in a single day, if they remove ALL the staggering pointless mouse abuse I'll happily recommend it but so far they don't even seem to understand there's a problem. I haven't even mentioned all the wild statements Peter Molyneux has made that (as usual) are completely misleading and will never be part of the game, I love many aspects of many of the games he created but he always overhypes them enough to disappoint millions of people.

								A glorified cow-clicker. In the mean sense of it. Godus feels built to be sold, making for attractive screenshots, with the history of Peter Molyneux and his excellent, actual god-games. As soon as that transaction is completed, there's no game to this.The most frustrating part of it all is that it should be good. With that in mind, and the fact that will never change even if I wanted to believe it, I have to discourage people from spending any money on this game. The strategy genre Godus pretends to belong to is populated with so much better games. I would not even be surprised there are better cow-clickers. Perhaps Molyneux just want to cash in on his name a bit before he retires. A thought that saddens me.			",309,110,22,41,51,2,51

								I have never written a review for a game before.  Normally, if a game is bad, I set it aside and just forget about it.  Not Godus.  I feel others should be warned.  Despite it's insistance that ""Because you already bought the game, you shouldn't spend any more money"" this game feels constantly like a micro transaction game.  The faith system is fine.  Aside from the fact that you have to wait to collect it and the higher the elevation of land you want to move, the more in drains your faith so that flattening a tiny mountain can easily take of 10k faith.  The gameplay breaks down to waiting on faith, or waiting on your people to breed so you can kill them again to get more ""gems"" to speed up the game, or waiting on wheat, or waiting on a building to get completed, or waiting on a reinforcements to a voyage.  Oh... the voyages. The voyages (a sidequest to make you feel like you're not just sitting at the computer watching your people do nothing) gives you roughly 3 tries to complete what is basically a lemmings style puzzle.  This is made nearly impossible by the terrible controls.  If you don't succeed, guess what?  More gems.  Need more faith?  More gems.  Wheat?  Gems.  Stickers?  Gems.  This is obviously built around the gem store and the port to a flat price PC game is nothing shy of disingenuous and disgusting.			",198,54,1,58,61,2,70

It looks like it could be a very nice populous style game, but it's actually a poorly implemented farmville rip-off. If you like RSI, and waiting, literally hours for timers to run down before you can actually do anything then you will 'love' this.

								Aight. Godus. Only game out of the ones I got that merits a review, and this review's a warning - don't be fooled by the fact that Peter Molyneux is in it, don't be fooled by the fact that it's called a God Game. This game has nothing to do with Black and White, Populous, Dust, or any other kind of godsim you can think of.Why, you ask? Well, I could answer in a lot of ways, because there's a lot of things wrong with this game. I could talk about how utterly bad the AI is, but it's an early access - I can live with that. I could talk about the terrible progression system that makes you scout all your territory in search for the elusive graphic effect that marks a box in the ground that may or may not have one of the fifteen cards that you need to make your followers move slightly faster, but that might just be that I'm not target audience for this kind of thing - to be fair, this feels a lot like a Facebook game, you have to log on every several hours to gather your belief, involves a lot of clicking, etc...What is not a subjective thing is that this game has shown almost no progress in its iterations. It takes ages to get a patch and, when one finally comes out, it's more of the same and ten pages of patch notes telling us just how exactly they changed the tone of the ground, while they ignore the core issues of this game. It's been stuck on 40%ish progress (according to the designers themselves) for as long as I've had it, since it came on Greenlight.TL;DR: Honestly, this game is, and has been, awful, and it feels like a complete moneygrab.

An ordinary mobile game on PC.I'm writing this while still on Beta. This is not what we have been promised on Kickstart. Being scammed by Peter Molyneux, is like being r@ped by Mozart or Picasso: you keep denying it because it felt good helping someone famous getting what they wanted, but it's still a serious r@ping and you know you'll never walk straight again.Can I ask my money back? No. Can I delete this from my Steam Library? No. Can you help me forget this? No. Can it become a good game? Of course. I'll change this review, if it becomes a decent game after the Beta. Chances? Low. Very low. These people strike us as very arrogant, they will not take a step back and check out the big picture, the deviation from their Kickstarter promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So being early access I can only comment on the core game-play as it exists. That being said it fails to meet all promises put forth by both the early access pitch and the kickstarter campaign that funded it.The roadmap they have released shows they have no interest in community feedback and no real desire to meet the commitment they have made.Recommend avoiding at all costs. Pity there are no refunds.			",105,49,0,21,28,1,34

								I really wanted to like this game. It looks so charming and it isn't too hard to understand. However, there are some real issues with how it plays. The thing that made me rage quit was trying to establish 'settlements'. If you are going to make me group houses into settlements; 1. Give me enough room between buildings to build the damn farms, and 2. show me where the borders are so I can choose the best area and know which houses will be included.There were many other headache issues but... yeah... it's still early access so maybe it will get better. As it is, however, cannot recommend it.			",347,103,11,51,49,2,56

								This isn't the regenesis of the God-sim game. It is a mobile game masquerading as something more. The game is an endless clickfest that far removes you from the very idea of being a deity. Mana is manually gathered & ""upgrades"" are unlocked by digging up chests of stickers to stick on upgrade cards. The game pace is very slow, with mana & grain accumulation creeping up whilst you sit looking at a very sterile world environment, waiting for timegates on shrines or houses to complete. Your god powers are very limited for much of the early game - allowing you to do little more than push around ground or set out settlements (at great expense).Avoid. If you want a good recent godsim, get From Dust. If you want a better mobile game, try Plague Inc or the Kim Kardashian thing.			",19,12,0,8,13,0,5

								Following this game since it was first released on Steam Early Access, I have had nothing but high hopes for it. Each iteration has shown that there are core concepts ready to dig their heels in and actually become part of a greater game. Each time, however, they keep missing the mark.At its core, it feels like I've paid money to get a FaceBook game. Everything is about waiting for a few seconds, to nearly half an hour, even in the early stages of the game. While I am no stranger to waiting for buildings to be constructed or resources to be collected, the concept of using 'gems' to speed up construction simply reminds me of what happened to Peter's other brainchild, Dungeon Keeper.With Godus 2.2, there's a little more polish to the front end, and definitely some optimizations taking place to the engine, but for being a God Game, it feels like I have little control. Maybe in another year things will get better. Until then, I'd spend money on something different.			",190,23,5,25,44,3,37

								Godus First thing that i would like to say is that the game is still in Bata and they are only 50% complete. I have been playing the Bata since it first came out. I have seen some realy cool stuff that they have created and may or may not use on their end product. One thing is for sure that do not want you to do anything quickly  building a Small houes  39 sec to 2 min  Large houes  39 min maybe more that is where i called it.  Small farm 5 Min Large farm 1 hour 10 Min the first few land expantions  in minutes  1, 10, 30, then 4 hours  8 hours 24 Hours the coin of the relm is Belief. it used to be that you would  slam down a large number of houses and collect the belief as it became available. that has changed however. Now building is set by the number of crops that you are collecting at the time the only houses that do not cost you crops are the ones that are within the settlements.  Again just another way slow you down.   Sculpting: what can i cay about this. EXPENSIVE stay close to the water level.  from the water level up to the first green level are free after that the cost of belief go up very quickly. dont even think about moving the top of a mountain 2K+ just to peal the top layer off the peak.on a scale of 1 to 10  FUN = 3WORK = 12this game has turned out to be a JOB constantly waiting on somthing to doSorry but i have to give this agame a thumbs DOWN ",42,1,0,1,5,0,5

And waited. And finally i'm still waiting after around 4 years this game has gone no where. Very disapointing. I think one of their biggest mistakes was creating a phone game of Godus, that only wasted time they could of spent on creating a truly special pc game.

								I will start with how much fun this game is in the beginning. i love the giant sandbox attitude with all the little treasures and what not. it has a fun look and is mostly easy to navigate. What I don't like is after you get going you then hit the point where the land-scaping becomes a chore and a trial of patience, well that is where this game takes a dive. When I play a game, I like to play it not wait to play it. Such a great idea and could still be something great and fun if the spiritual belief system stops behaving like a fremium that stops you from playing. For example, why do I have to wait minutes, hours or even days to get enough belief to clear or add landscape? If they changed that one crucial issue and let you sculpt land without the belief system (or balance the cost of landscaping) then I would recommend this game to everyone. Right now with the game as it is, I feel duped and it doesn't seem to be changing no matter how many people say they don't like the hurry up and wait system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Alright, let me phrase this by saying I bought this game about a year ago. At that time, Godus was fairly promising. Sculpting the land, building dwellings, it was a relaxing game that I didn't need to focus on too much. I like that sort of thing from time to time. I uninstalled after a while and decided to come back to it today. Yeah. Big mistake.When I started playing this game, it had a few hiccups. The major problem being with a 'card' system. EVERY new power has to be unlocked with substance cards- which you find in chests around the world. Problem is that these are completely random. So you can be stuck with no where to go.Of course, this was six months ago. The new update should have changed something right? Nope.It made it worse. It added a shop system, simalar to farmville or anyother mobile game. While no mini transactions are happening (yet) this makes the card system even more painful to sit through. Your ability to progress is still based on random luck of the draw. The store card packs are also random, from what I can tell, so no luck there. Its incredibly frustrating.To make matters worse- A part of the games abilities lie with faith, which is generated by your followers. It can take up to 20 mins for some of the houses to generate a little bit a faith. Again, this hints to a mobile game like structure, play for a bit then come back later. Not the sort of thing that I want to have Ton my PC.Upon some investigation, I've discovered that all of the problems that I have with the game are things that other players have voiced to developers. Awesome, I thought, that means it may get fixed. Then I see troubling statements, voices being ignored, people being shoved aside. he developers don't seem to care about the players of this version, or these issues would have been fixed ages ago. If you are even considering this game I suggest that you give both the reviews and the forum posts (that AREN'T dev. created) a glance. TL;DR Game looks promising but is delivering false expectation, alongside developers that don't care.			",36,26,0,10,19,0,4

								I would not recommend this game.  At this point in time, there is little to do.  Clicking landscapes to make more room for people to build houses, in this day and age, feels like a constant kick in the teeth towards humans.  I know we use resources to build and I know we consume too much...It is no reason to make a game that constantly reminds me of that.  Another example of how Peter 'If only he knew' releases a game that is over hyped and totally boring.			",68,0,0,2,6,0,13

								If you are looking for an actual game, look elsewhere. This game (as it is) is more about clicking to terraform, waiting for belief (the resource required to terraform), and even more waiting for your population/agriculture to grow. There is actually very little to do in this game besides watching a little bar on your screen filling up. There's no endgame in sight, and there's no real goal except to sit there and watch that damn bar go up.TL;DR: Don't buy until they actually have a game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I've only played little over an hour and a half of this game, but even with that limited exposure to 'Godus' I can safely say that you should not waste your money buying it. With a bare bones user interface, and almost no direction, you might be thinking 'exploration and creativity are all this game takes to start unfolding,' not so. There is no exploration, as your view of the world, despite being a god, is limited to a measly square of the world. It's a point and click god game that leaves you feeling bored and tired as you cater to the needs of your uninspiring followers, who do nothing to progress their own virtual lives. All you do is watch your tiny, powerless people build house after house after you have decimated the landscape for them. Only then to have them sit inside and do nothing while you continue to warp the world around them so that the lazy, dull cancer that is their existence spreads. Perhaps if you had more control over your followers, to say, customize them and their civilization. Give them specializations like seafaring, or farming, add some variety to the nothingness that makes up their being. But no, you must simply keep clicking, and keep making “progress.” But tedium seems to be part of the design. At around the hour mark (sooner or later depending on how well you can use the wonky “Sculpt Land” controls to keep advancing), your civilization unlocks commandments, but that’s not all. In addition to these commandments, which change depending on how you play the game (a touch that actually adds some charm and humor), you unlock the Upgrades Store. What is the currency for the upgrade store? Not faith, which you need to use your god powers, but golden crystals. I fear that these golden crystals will require actual money (on top of the $19.99 it already cost to get early access). And considering how slow and tedious it is to make progress, of course there would be “power ups” you can buy to speed things a long, right?Another thing to remember is that Multiplayer has been promised for ‘Godus’. So that means that even if you don’t use the in game store to power up your virtual world, there is nothing stopping other players from doing so, and then stomping all over the world you made.The gameplay is mind numbingly simple, akin to a mobile game like ‘Clash of Clans’ or worse, ‘Farmville’. All you do is point and click, and do your best to keep getting the sweet crack that is your next reward and next advancement stage. Like a mindless drone, you just keep clicking, and spreading your little people across the face of a beautiful world (which you can’t fully appreciate because of the limiting square), waiting for your next power to unlock. As it stands now, ‘Godus’ looks more like a shameless cash in, wrapped in a beautiful minimalist art design, but nothing more than shallow gameplay that leaves you feeling more like a zombie, than a god. Who knows, this might all change come release, but considering its already in Beta, I have my doubts. Summary Good:Gorgeous Art Design and Good SoundSome funny writingBad: Simplistic gameplayReal money in game storeWorld Sculpting is wonky, and can lead to destruction of settlementsFollowers do nothing on their ownTedious and repetitive game mechanicsA mobile game pretending to be a full featured PC GameScore: 4 / 10 - Bad			",87,18,0,23,10,0,25

								Update Aug 10 2014: Why do so many developers feel they need to copy farmville?  The game is even SLOWER to play but wait! You can use gems in the game to speed things along!  I feel bad for anyone playing on a tablet.  We can sacrifice villagers for gems if we wish, so no worries for the PC... the game actually feels worse... a grind.  Prettier way to present god abilities but still pretty much the same engine.  They may have added more later in the game but it really is not looking worth it.  5 minutes to build a hut?  I just want to build my dungeon, erm, I mean my town.Old:Bit of populous-like play.Find ""cards"" as you perform tasks (cards? really? how about a scroll or tablet?), get new skills...The fake in-game social media type opponents is interesting and all but again gives that ""breaking the fourth wall"".Mainly form earth to uncover treasure boxes.The people seem to lack character, not endearing enough to save their little lives?Darwinia is better.Black and White is still leagues ahead of this.The INSANE click fest for collecting mana is thankfully fixed with areas to focus the ""spheres"" of mana.I just cannot but my finger on it but the game is rather forgettable in it's present state.I really wanted to like this game, never want to miss an opportunity to play a ""god-game"" but this one is still rather lackluster.

Early Access Review
Sadly, this is probably not the God game you're looking for22Cans promises a great deal with this game, but has so far sadly fallen short in almost every way; a quick run-down through their key beta features reveals a list that sounds promising, but has be missed at almost each turn:You can sculpt the entire world and make it truly unique to you.True to their word pretty much the entire world can be 'sculpted'. However, your ability to alter your surroundings is severely limited. The world is made up of multiple layers stacked upon one another similar to a layered cake. Each layer can be dragged and poked to either cover or reveal the layer below, on occasion revealing a treasure chest (that provides you with stickers or gems - more on both later) or other curio, enabling you to clear space for buildings, fields, mines, and so forth. The system does not however allow you to create your own mountains - you cannot create new layers, only alter or destroy existing ones. Further, each modification takes a certain amount of belief, often leaving you with little to do whilst waiting for your villagers to pray, unless you want to spend gems to purchase more of the stuff.Be adored and worshipped by tiny, devoted Followers. Watch them live, learn and love in a fully simulated world.Admittedly the game is only roughly 51% complete at present, but even with the living followers advancement researched (if you don't research it, the followers will stay in their homes until they are needed to build something) your followers are far from lively. True, they will pop out and form small groups, but it is a far cry from the simulated world we are promised. Additionally, due to the games mechanics, the feeling of God-hood is terribly underwhelming and your ability to interact with your followers begins and ends with sending them to do tasks or sacrificing them for gems.Create villages and towns, grow their population and sculpt the very lands on which they live Building works thusly: First you sculpt a flat area of land revealing a plot upon which you can construct a house. A builder from a nearby Abode will be galvanised into constructing it (which can, I kid you not, take up to 18 minutes real-time before you discover farms, or of course spend gems to speed construction) before populating it with followers and another builder. You will then flatten more land nearby revealing more plots upon which to build house (again, with absurd time penalties). Once you have a few houses nestled together you can combine them into a village using an ever increasing amount of belief. These villages can be specialised to either farming, building, or mining. The first village is always a farming village and has the charming side effect of increasing building construction speed by a factor of ten, making them far faster to build whislt additionally requiring newly accessible wheat to be spent to obtain them. Villages can then be expanded by building more buildings around them and repeating the village construction miracle (for yet more belief). These will then be populated accordingly after an extended period of time (I am currently waiting for a 4 hour 34 minute timer to tick down so that I can get more farmers...fun!). Fountains, shrines, and more can be placed within your civilization but only through the expenditure of a significant amount of gems.Lead Followers from your Homeworld and set sail on Voyages of Discovery to uncharted landsGuide your Followers as they embark on regular Voyages to new and undiscovered lands that hold great rewards.These voyages are a set of logic puzzles set within the Godus universe and are divorced from the mainland. Progress is absurdly easy and you can burn through the vast majority on the first attempt - though should you fail one you will have to wait an inordinate amount of time for reinforcements to crew your ship (unless you wish to spend gems).Nurture the growth of a civilization as it rises from the dawn of the primitive age and advances throughout the ages of humanity.Possibly the game’s most absurd feature is the sticker resource. These small discs can be found throughout the land or obtained for completing voyages, or of course bought with gems (do you see a pattern emerging?) and represent a certain kind of advancement, whether it be technological, societal, or philosophical. These can then be affixed to advancement cards that are unlocked at certain population, wheat, and mineral milestones. The quantity and type required differs from one advancement to the next, but all require a significant investment. These advancements and the order in which you take them can be reviewed at any time in the timeline, though it is so painfully linear that why you would want to is quite beyond me. Do not expect to find Civilisation like research trees here.Meet the Astari - a fun loving, party going little tribe who worship the pursuit of happiness These little fellows are supposed to provide a measure of comedic relief early on, distracting your followers from their duties and generally being quite benign. As the game progresses this role changes and you will find yourself preventing them from stealing followers from you, as every hour you can lose 10% of your population if your happiness is lower than the Astari's. Of course, this leaves you with empty houses that can be re-filled with - yes you guessed it - gems!Cast miracles of both beauty and destruction - choose how to show your divine power, whether that be by growing forests or launching meteors.At present there are a few miracles in the game, and each one require a moderate investment of belief to activate. Their scope is limited at present and it seems that there are more to come.22Cans has been open in stating that the game is being developed for both PC and mobile simultaneously, and it shows. At present the game has the feel of Farmville and its ilk. Everything you do is gated: want to build something? Wait 10 minutes. Want some belief? Wait 5 minutes. Want some wheat? Wait 90 minutes. Of course, these gates can be overcome through the use of gems that are found in chests, rewarded for completing certain tasks, or for sacrificing your followers. Sacrificing has several effects, primarily depriving you of a follower for an extended (30+ minutes) period of time, but also by decreasing your followers’ happiness. This is important as unhappy followers are more likely to leave your settlement to be with the Astari. Gems can be used to fast track almost everything in the game, and can even be exchanged for belief and stickers should you be overly frustrated by the slow pace of acquisition. The company has publicly stated that the 2.2 patch feels very mobile orientated, and I hope that they can make a unique and moreover enjoyable experience for the PC in future patches, but at present this does not seem plausible. Godus is most definitely not worth the investment of time or money in its current iteration and I would encourage anybody to think thrice before purchasing it. A shame really, but there is little fun to be had here, especially for fans of the God genre.			",130,42,0,32,32,1,21

								This game was fun while in early development as limited as the features wee. They were definitely on the right track to make a successful legacy to populous.As development progressed it started shifting towards the mobile gaming platform. That carried into the PC version as well and started to feel quite gimmicky and lost a lot of its fun factor.There were a lot of promises made that have not seen the light of day and all development has ceased for the past year. 22 Cans has also stopped all communication with its player base for a while as well now.I do not recommend buying this game. It is incomplete and all development and communication has stopped.22 Cans seems to have launched a new company called BOSS GAMES recently that I shall steer clear of as well.

								Avoid at all cost!After one and a half hours, all I've managed to do is deforest and flatten what was once a beautiful, wooded hillside, bust some rocks and watch little stick figures run around randomly building offensively ugly ... houses, I guess, for want of a better word. They look like blocks of concrete, instead of the tent and wood structures one would expect of this time period and they all look basically identical. Oh, and the stick figures died rather frequently while trying to crawl up a mountain I hadn't flattened completely ...I have never before encountered a game, where everything you have to do in order to proceed makes the game look much, much uglier than it was before. There is no apparent end in sight for the devastation one has to wreak upon the landscape, and the final straw for me after entering the game again after a couple of days, is the ridiculous amount of clicking I have to do just to collect the belief of my followers - like some beggar on the street knocking on every door, rather than the god I am supposed to be.Did I mention how ugly you have to make the landscape in order to proceed? I have no idea how long it takes to be able to make the towns look as pretty as they do in some of the screenshots with buildings surrounded by trees, but I simply don't have the energy or the patience to find out.I made the mistake of buying this while it was 50% off, but if there was any way I could get my money and time back I would be a much happier individual.

								Currently in beta, Godus boasts a very stylized and fun looking environment that has a surprisingly large amount of player interaction. The positive aspects stop there unfortunately. This game seems to have the ambition being the next Black and White, perfect for people who have a god complex and enoy city builders, but it is anything but. Already a year into beta, few things have changed in terms of gameplay. It is overly simplistic, repetitive, and linear, hardly the attributes one would want in a game of this genre. Godus is a games of could-bes, it has all of the potential of being something great, however it has a long way to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game has come a long way since the first early access release.  However, it is still nothing like I expected.  If you are looking for something like Black and White you will be very disappointed.  The game can't decide whether it is a city builder or a god game.  It is simply mediocre at both.  Frankly, this game falls flat on its face.  I keep trying each new build expecting the devs to listen to player criticisms and make meaningful changes, but this has been half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so far.  Hopefully it gets better over time.  Example of why this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thus far:  I had to leave my game on and go do laundry and clean my house to wait for belief to accumulate.  Thanks Peter.

								I've only played little over an hour and a half of this game, but even with that limited exposure to 'Godus' I can safely say that you should not waste your money buying it. With a bare bones user interface, and almost no direction, you might be thinking 'exploration and creativity are all this game takes to start unfolding,' not so. There is no exploration, as your view of the world, despite being a god, is limited to a measly square of the world. It's a point and click god game that leaves you feeling bored and tired as you cater to the needs of your uninspiring followers, who do nothing to progress their own virtual lives. All you do is watch your tiny, powerless people build house after house after you have decimated the landscape for them. Only then to have them sit inside and do nothing while you continue to warp the world around them so that the lazy, dull cancer that is their existence spreads. Perhaps if you had more control over your followers, to say, customize them and their civilization. Give them specializations like seafaring, or farming, add some variety to the nothingness that makes up their being. But no, you must simply keep clicking, and keep making “progress.” But tedium seems to be part of the design. At around the hour mark (sooner or later depending on how well you can use the wonky “Sculpt Land” controls to keep advancing), your civilization unlocks commandments, but that’s not all. In addition to these commandments, which change depending on how you play the game (a touch that actually adds some charm and humor), you unlock the Upgrades Store. What is the currency for the upgrade store? Not faith, which you need to use your god powers, but golden crystals. I fear that these golden crystals will require actual money (on top of the $19.99 it already cost to get early access). And considering how slow and tedious it is to make progress, of course there would be “power ups” you can buy to speed things a long, right?Another thing to remember is that Multiplayer has been promised for ‘Godus’. So that means that even if you don’t use the in game store to power up your virtual world, there is nothing stopping other players from doing so, and then stomping all over the world you made.The gameplay is mind numbingly simple, akin to a mobile game like ‘Clash of Clans’ or worse, ‘Farmville’. All you do is point and click, and do your best to keep getting the sweet crack that is your next reward and next advancement stage. Like a mindless drone, you just keep clicking, and spreading your little people across the face of a beautiful world (which you can’t fully appreciate because of the limiting square), waiting for your next power to unlock. As it stands now, ‘Godus’ looks more like a shameless cash in, wrapped in a beautiful minimalist art design, but nothing more than shallow gameplay that leaves you feeling more like a zombie, than a god. Who knows, this might all change come release, but considering its already in Beta, I have my doubts. Summary Good:Gorgeous Art Design and Good SoundSome funny writingBad: Simplistic gameplayReal money in game storeWorld Sculpting is wonky, and can lead to destruction of settlementsFollowers do nothing on their ownTedious and repetitive game mechanicsA mobile game pretending to be a full featured PC GameScore: 4 / 10 - Bad			",87,18,0,23,10,0,25

								Update Aug 10 2014: Why do so many developers feel they need to copy farmville?  The game is even SLOWER to play but wait! You can use gems in the game to speed things along!  I feel bad for anyone playing on a tablet.  We can sacrifice villagers for gems if we wish, so no worries for the PC... the game actually feels worse... a grind.  Prettier way to present god abilities but still pretty much the same engine.  They may have added more later in the game but it really is not looking worth it.  5 minutes to build a hut?  I just want to build my dungeon, erm, I mean my town.Old:Bit of populous-like play.Find ""cards"" as you perform tasks (cards? really? how about a scroll or tablet?), get new skills...The fake in-game social media type opponents is interesting and all but again gives that ""breaking the fourth wall"".Mainly form earth to uncover treasure boxes.The people seem to lack character, not endearing enough to save their little lives?Darwinia is better.Black and White is still leagues ahead of this.The INSANE click fest for collecting mana is thankfully fixed with areas to focus the ""spheres"" of mana.I just cannot but my finger on it but the game is rather forgettable in it's present state.I really wanted to like this game, never want to miss an opportunity to play a ""god-game"" but this one is still rather lackluster.

								What started out as an exciting new labor of love from the famous Peter Molyneux has slowly turned into a small gasp which has many wondering if we will ever see what was ultimately promised. Slow development, little communication from the developers, and rumors that 22Cans is running out of money are what fans are currently experiencing. All this plus the fact that the current state of the game simplifies down to just endless and repetitive mouse clicking. If you are one of the customers who spent the 20.00 to become part or Early Access you have reason to a bit concerned.			",139,68,0,39,36,5,49

								This game has immense potential but requires drastic change before I can consider recommending it.  As many others have said, Godus involves a mind-numbing amount of clicking and not much else.  Some changes the developers have made thus far have actually been harmful.  THe control scheme needs to be overhauled, and any micro-transaction systems that do or may exist need to be omitted entirely.  Different locations or procedurally-generated maps would help immensely, because every game I've seen played ends up essentially the same.  Could be good, but only after some much-needed improvements.  Don't buy unless marked down. ",215,46,1,56,16,3,24

Early Access Review
								In All honesty the biggest disappointment since Spore. I supported the kickstarter because they are a local firm and peter has a history of classic games.But the design of this game is all over the place and essentially they promised too much, didn't plan well enough and ran out of money.They have recruited another kickstarter backer who is trying to sort it out and turn it into something worth playing but I suspect it's taking a long time because most of the resources at 22Cans have moved onto other projects to try and keep the company a float. In all honesty I'd take a lot of persuading to by anything else from them and certainly can't recommend Godus as it is.Will it be a worthwhile game some day, maybe but by the time it is will any of us still be interested.

								Currently in beta, Godus boasts a very stylized and fun looking environment that has a surprisingly large amount of player interaction. The positive aspects stop there unfortunately. This game seems to have the ambition being the next Black and White, perfect for people who have a god complex and enoy city builders, but it is anything but. Already a year into beta, few things have changed in terms of gameplay. It is overly simplistic, repetitive, and linear, hardly the attributes one would want in a game of this genre. Godus is a games of could-bes, it has all of the potential of being something great, however it has a long way to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game has come a long way since the first early access release.  However, it is still nothing like I expected.  If you are looking for something like Black and White you will be very disappointed.  The game can't decide whether it is a city builder or a god game.  It is simply mediocre at both.  Frankly, this game falls flat on its face.  I keep trying each new build expecting the devs to listen to player criticisms and make meaningful changes, but this has been half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so far.  Hopefully it gets better over time.  Example of why this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thus far:  I had to leave my game on and go do laundry and clean my house to wait for belief to accumulate.  Thanks Peter.

								1. Tried to start new world over, all previous sticker decisions on the same world carried through, builders wouldn't build without crops which I couldnt possibly get from starting position. 2. Discovery mode super super clunky and dull. Once you complete the 7-8? islands it was not transpartent how one might go back and get three stars.3. Belief harvesting even with settlements is aggravating and adds nothing to the gameplay experience. I ended up way way way overbuilding farming settlements which meant, joy, I had to spend way too much time harvesting crops manually...Things I liked:I loved the visuals of the game but it seems that the attention to executional detail is abscent from 22Cans.

								With omnipotency comes shifting dirt?  Godus has the visual appeal and some infrastructure that can provide for a unique expierence.  And a unique one it is, however unique doesn't equal good.  You would think that being a ""God"" you could do more than just shift layers of Earth or set random trees ablaze, however that's all Godus has become.  Even it's ""mini-games"" are just doing that, shifting layers of Earth.  As a suggestion, there is a large focus on the building of civiliation.  Perhaps there could be elements of building and shaping land features out of nothing, instead of just moving steps to allow citizens to move.  And provide real danger such as volcanos and animals.

								I'm one of those peeps who generally hates it when someone writes an indepth review based on little more than a few hours of gameplay (typically does not represent well the entire game). However, this game is just outright ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to play.. There has been a 'big update' (on which other reviews rip into) but still, I can't see it changing the 2 hours of gameplay that I seriously fought to like, and just could not! Plus the devs have released a second game that was given to us owners for free, only to be charged in game $5 if we wanted more than a few hours of gameplay... The hell?! Lately one of the devs has finished the job and I heard very few, if any, are left to work on the 2 games... What?!?!You seem interested in this game? Just don't, go get Northgard instead.

								Good game, its fun and simple and easy to play. But theres a lot of bugs with no resolution in sight. It crashes almost constantly and is just a pain to keep up with. Wouldn't suggest spending the money on it.			",37,7,0,11,7,0,1

								4 years laterm and the game still won't even close without crashingI could go on for pages about every feature that was promissed but not deliver, or about the fact that the last official update to this game happened a year ago, and by update I mean a second game... But what is most surprising is that after 4 years in development still you get an error message saying that the process as stopped when you click the ingame quit button. If you can't fix that how one earth will you be able to do anything?			",157,30,18,20,64,2,51

								For the love of god, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.If you are under any impression that this is a cute verson of Black and White or even Populas, you are going to be very dissapointed. This game hasnt been updated in over 3 months or more. No prescenes of the developers on the forum (your more likely to get better feedback sticking a fork in your eye). The Early Acess money raised has gone to pay off the Cube Winner.Peter has announced there will be a Store and that the mobile version will be free 2 play.  Even though backers and early access people are completely against this and of course they dont mention this on the store page.The game itself is a bland 1 hour demo at best at the moment. From the moment you look at the interface and interact with the game, you can see every effort is screaming WE ARE DESIGNING THIS GAME FOR MOBILE. The ways to meaninfully interact with your 2 bit villages  is flicks of your finger and a horrible looking spell or 2. There is no stimulating way to go around designing villages. As villages start building homes on any space you make big and clean enough. In the end your left with this ugly congo line of unused shacks.Seriously Im glad only pays $10 when this was on special. (Irony of early acess games being on special aside)If you really want to throw money at a early access there is a bunch of other games that way more well developed , starbound springs to mind or just buy a few hats for dota 2. I would recommend cancer before recommending this game.DONT BUY THIS RANCID PILE OF LIES. This Public service announcement was brough to you by Epic_Bubble.(If there was a return system on steam this would be the first dribble to be returned)			",80,30,0,12,16,1,23

								I waited a long time before posting this review, hoping they would deliver on the update they promised 5 months ago. However, I have come to the conclusion that this game may never be finished. In its current state, this game is not worth paying for. Its fun for a few hours, but it not a ""god"" game at all. It is at best a mobile game.

								At first Godus is a fun and interesting game to play. After that, there's basically nothing new. You can unlock new tools, but they don't do anything to improve the quality of your gameplay. After maybe the first 30 minutes the game turns purely into you ripping about landscape to try and get as many houses as possible to fit into a small spot of land, which is actually really boring.

Early Access Review
								Godus 2.0Well I reviewed this prepatch and since this has finally been updated I think it is only fair that I provide a new perspective on this game. In its current form Godus is a badly told joke, the build up has you eagerly anticpating the punchline, it has all the right ingredients theres the talking monkey, the shopping cart and the disgruntled cleaner all lined up waiting to mesh and put a big smile on your face...But it never comes, I want to be smiling at this game, I want to enjoy it; but i really cant. There have been many changes for the better in 2.0 but this game simply lacks soul. ControlsGodus still requires you to click everything, 2.0 brought in the possibility to drag to collect your belief or to sculpt but this still results in you clicking on everything constanty. The result is in 5 minutes you honestly feel tired. Scrolling by keyboard creates an odd motion blur that actually manages to make you feel ill whilst also feeling sluggish. Fortunately controls are relatively intiutive however and the layout is crisp and makes good sense. So its not all bad but it really does need a lot more work.GameplayIn its current form this is tied so closely to the controls that it is honestly difficult to find a way to seperate them. So what to say? Progression has been improved, moderately, you can see where your civilization is going although sometimes it feels too forced. You move through progression cards as your population goes and regardless of what you are doing this will ping incessently until you finally concede that you will have to click on them, only to be dragged through a semi tutorial that you cannot seem to escape. Sculpting is much improved upon now that it is possible to drag terrain and sculpting costs less belief but it still only lets you drag one layer at a time at first which makes sculpting infuriatingly slow, this wouldn't be so bad if the game had more character at the moment but considering this really is the most important element at present it needs to feel better than it does.I feel I do owe it to point out the good which has come in 2.0 as well and I pray (haha.) that it is a sign that perhaps more is coming. Followers do now, not only wander around but also, show some signs of socializing; It is wonderful to see a follower light a fire and others come to join them. Having had only a couple of hours to poke at 2.0 there were few other unique interactions although i acknowledge others may already be in game. Personally I would like to see more happen in this regard; followers with a life of their own and not some blue army of conformists. GraphicsTo my mind this remains Godus's most redeeming feature, I like the style, it looks like it has potential and gives the game a great sandbox feel; if only the gameplay could match it. There are a few irritating bugs but mostly they are minor, one which persists from prior to the patch which requires attention is when scrolling the horizon becomes visible exposing the blackness of infinity at the edges of your monitor this is particularly noticable when scrolling and feels like it could be really easilly remedied.Where to from here?Well it is hardly fair to lay into an Beta but I think many customers will equally mirror the exasperation felt having spent so many months being provided with so little feedback. There is a glimmer of a great game here but it does feel more Alpha than Beta and does not feel ready for early access. Personally I hope to see several changes come about in future:- Belief needs to naturally be collected no more clicking! Please, please 22-cans pay heed to this, we have all had enough of Farmville and Simpsons Tapped Out. We are not using a mobile phone app we beg you, our fingers beg you, no more clicking.- Personality; simply where is it? I don't really expect this to emerge immediately it is more a mark of polish in finishing off a game but some minor concessions would at least let fans (of which lets face it any one buying the early release clearly will be) really want to see. - Sculpting needs to be more natural from the beginning and do we really need to create a completly featureless world? I played Populous and Populous, I know what this comes from but its 22 years on, lets have some life in the world. At the very least trees should start to grow amongst houses after clearance.ConclusionThis is a game that is very far from completion, 22-cans state that this is currently at 49% completion. The result is a game which feels like it came off a demo disk. You can begin to see the shape of something which could become a fantastic god game but this will most likely require several complete overhauls before it even begins to take shape from the crude wooden soulless block it currently resembles. As an avid fan of many of the games Peter Molyneux has produced I will watch this game intently but in future 22-cans should steer well clear of early access games until they are genuinly prepared to engage with the community to which it is exposing itself.

								Game has not updated for 4 months now. Virtually no communication from the developers. Game is still very barebones with little content. Further, a comment by the lead Dev suggest the business model may change and add microtransactions, DLC spam, or possible both (no info was given on what the changes may be).The game has potential to be very fun but right now you're much better off saving your money and checking back later to see if this game ends up progressing in a positive direction (assuming it progresses at all).review from 2/21/2014			",186,46,1,51,35,4,44

								While I understand that the game is no where near its completed state, I just can't fathom how this might actually become fun.  At this point my game experience only consists of me flattening all the land on my own.  My people don't bother to cut tree or break up rocks on their own, forcing me to excercise my boring and nigh-useless power, on their well being.  Another issue is the whole sculting process.  They claim that land-scuplting is 90% complete, but I found the experience to be buggy, and some clicks started to scult land nearly a full inch away from my cursor.  While I should just say that we should give it time.  I sadly wont.  As other reviews have said this game is designed for microtransactions, and is destined to be a pay to win (or advance) style of game.  Let it be known that I don't have problems with free to play micro-transaction based games... And sadly, this is not free to play.			",530,557,30,146,159,4,117

The ui is all over the place. I get generic system popups that for some reason hide the mouse cursor and I have to use the arrows and enter to make a choice. I got a card that I tought said it auto collected faith but I guess I misread because I still had to mindlesly click the pink bubbles. At this point I don't think this game will ever really be finished.

								It may be a good game some day, but it isn't remotely there yet. They've forgotten to put anything fun in yet, which is worrying for what is supposed to be a game. Even an Alpha is supposed to have that much. Generally it's well polished, with amazingly few bugs for this point, but with nothing worth doing it isn't worth the time or money yet. I'm refusing to play again until it is done, and hopefully I will get a good game out of the Kickstarter. For now, I'd have been better off getting several more indie bundles for the price.

								December 2015 UpdateNo updates for three months, this game is as good as dead. As their Early Access spiel states, if you buy this game, ""...you are part of our development team."" That is blatantly not true, as I wouldn't have left the game to languish if I was, nor would I have stopped providing updates to my players. Even the 22cans Twitter account has been silent for over a month, save for a video of book signings in November 2015 for a Kickstarter reward promised to backers in September 2013.Don't buy it on sale, don't get it in a bundle, just... don't. Your money is better spent anywhere else.** V2 Update **Less clicking, more of a drag...While many of the mechanical issues with the click-laden gameplay have been redressed in the so-called V2.0, there is still a lot left lacking. V2 does reset your game save, which means existing players need to endure drawn out tutorials that introduce the game's basic interactions. Irrespective of my status as an existing player, these still come across as patronising and take way too long to get players into the meat of the game. If a tutorial has to rip you out of the game world to hand-hold you through something that should be intuitive, something's not quite right.This is just the start of how Godus continues to diappoint. The game is a lot easier to manage and control, but still takes far too long to offer progression to the player. You'll quickly build up your civilisation, obtaining the first few cards and finding all the stickers required to activate them, but you soon hit a wall when belief comes into the picture. As in the first version, belief is used to sculpt the land, place statues and expand your people, but it's far and few between. Even the between-session regenerated belief is easily used in a few seconds, leaving the player frustrated at not being able to sculpt their world and progress their civilisation.Whether it's the sour taste that V1 left behind or just a feeling of desperation that V2 exudes, I'm still not convinced that this can be called a ""regenesis""; ""rehash"", maybe. It feels like Peter Molyneux is really trying to relive past glories, rather than taking a real rethink of the god game, trying to understand what made older hits like Populous fun and coming up with a true 21st century version.Myself, I just hope those Kickstarter dollars don't run out before 49% complete becomes 100%.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having watched a couple of Let's Play videos on YouTube and having played the original Populous back in the day, I was interested by the premise of the game and the new Molyneux take on the God sim. What I should have taken more notice of, however, was the number of the videos I watched that involved the person playing trying to quieten their mouse clicks.Building your initial encampment and uncovering new resource cards is a fun distractions for a while, until you start to see the issues with the core control mechanisms. The dragging of land to reform it doesn't work anywhere near as intuitively as it could, which means you resort to clicking to terraform. Lots and lots and lots and lots of clicking. Seriously, the retail version should come boxed with it's own titanium-reinforced Godus mouse, because after a few play sessions, any normal mouse will have given up the ghost. That's unless your RSI hasn't already kicked in by that point... Collecting faith from your followers is another click-happy nightmare of an exercise, made slightly better by being able to create settlements that collect it centrally, but these often don't encompass all of your buildings and you end up having to collect the outlying faith manually.Followers are also driven to build new abodes, which it's beneficial to have as large as possible. The biggest issue with this is that followers will build in any space you clear, so often they've built smaller houses before you've had a chance to finish clearing an area. Then, the only solution is to destroy their houses to make them re-build them bigger!There are other issues, such as the inability to rotate the camera in full 3D and keep the viewing angle you chose. If you rotate your view and then scroll the play area, the view resets to the default orientation, which can be quite irritating when you're trying to stay focussed on one area of activity.On the plus side, the graphics are very pleasing on the eye and the game engine runs smooth on both Windows and the Mac. There is promise here, but until the core terraforming mechanics are reworked into something more fluid and the mouse-clicking is heavily reduced, I'd avoid it for now.			",832,273,31,88,82,6,108

								If the beta version of this game is anything to go by it is still boring to play. I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless they are still enthralled by tick-tack-toe or are amazed at the subtleties of snap.

								I want to like Godus and I try to like Godus, but Godus doesn't want me to like Godus.It starts off nice, nothing too demanding, then you get the voyages which, to me, add nothing but annoyance. They aren't puzzles that are rewarding to solve, they are just irritating AI and awkward camera movements that allows everyone to walk to their death.I feel nothing for doing the voyages, but the game feels the need to force them in my face, and every time they get irritating I finish playing and have no interest in playing anymore.The game could be alright, it could be a nice casual game.

								Played a little into it and I had to put it down it just feels like a mobile game that has been ported to the pc. They have long, 5 minute wait times for belief points. Just so you can once again click and drag land to flatten it so you can build more huts and wait some more and do it all over again, and again, and again, and again. Expanding the land over time its monotonus, and highly repetative it honestly feels like a mobile game but without microtransactions. You earn cards based off of how many followers which then require you to, you probably guessed it, flatten land then wait for 5 minutes and flatten more land! Sounds Exciting doesn't it? Of course not, all I can say is just avoid this game, at least for now. It may get better seeing as it's just in Beta but it's not looking like it will even do that well in the future, especially if it stays the same as it is now.			",68,8,2,18,11,2,9

								There might be a decent game here eventually, the idea of being able to develop a ""Homeworld"" and then go play in other worlds is cool. Even the whole advancing through different ages is cool. However the screen shows way to little of the game world even with a high resolution. Also the game is way to much of a click fest, and the terrain sculpting isn't even fun.

								     I came into this game expecting to feel the freedom to rule over my people peacefully as some sort of deity. While I could do this, I couldn't help but feel that even as an omnipotent god, I was caged. While the card and sticker system would work great for, say, an mmo or pvp version of Godus, it is actually very limiting. Yes, yes I know, ""It's a game that's suppose to be challenging!"" I absolutely agree. Why not try challenges an all-knowing, omnipotent Deity would find challenging. Perhaps sacrificing people to the pit of doom can actually raise demons and vengeful spirits who attack your settlements. Maybe the settlement you have your people on is home to a giant treasure chest, the only way of reaching it is by killing off your settlers.      Another thing that bothers me is the idea of moral choices. When I was think of playing as a god, I think of far more ethically questionable circumstances than Godus currently provided to me with. I had hoped that Godus would, instead of challenging a god with RTS tactics; rather more subtly challenge them with choices that can promote or hinder their rule over their soceity.      Also, because of my limited time playing I can't say this is not already part of Godus, but, how about a system that not only ""tracks leashing habits,"" but also includes things such as, ""a rise of atheism,"" or ""Because of your cruelty, your settlers now praise a new deity to spite you!""     That's all from me. I understand the game is definitely a grind at first, however I had no motivation to keep playing when I realized that even as a god, the game limited my omnipotency.

								Absolute waste of money. Even if they release a demo I'd advise against trying it out.This game is so broken. I was fooled into buying this due to it's apparant resemblence to Black and White. But no, it doesn't.The entire gameplay is to wait until pink bubbles containing ""believe"" to pop up from your followers house, then click on it.Rinse and repeat until you have enough ""belief"" points to do something.Oh, and that ""something"" means placing just a single Settlement so you save yourself like 10 clicks on the next round.Wait some more, then click a lot more, then you'll finally have enough ""belief"" to sculpt a staircase for your followers to get anywhere, or to dig up that card underneath the mountain.Once you have done that. You'll have to wait again for the pink bubbles to come up. Then some more click-fest.I mean, please, it's 2014 now and virutally all gamers are already very familiar with using a mouse.We do not need a game to teach us how to point and click.Pro-tip: Buying a settlement for 2000 belief will save you somewhere like 5 clicks on the next round. But note that the 2nd Settlement costs 4000 belief.On average, your followers' houses generate roughly 40 belief per bubble. You can work the math while you're waiting. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It may be a good game some day, but it isn't remotely there yet. They've forgotten to put anything fun in yet, which is worrying for what is supposed to be a game. Even an Alpha is supposed to have that much. Generally it's well polished, with amazingly few bugs for this point, but with nothing worth doing it isn't worth the time or money yet. I'm refusing to play again until it is done, and hopefully I will get a good game out of the Kickstarter. For now, I'd have been better off getting several more indie bundles for the price.

Save the money, don't waste it on early access in efforts to help the devs. Wait and see if it actually finished, which I doubt it'll grow much more.It's been months without any update, and now they are saying the next update will be another month or so. Trash game. They are more focused on finishing the mobile version to sell more copies and rob from people instead of finishing the steam version. Don't buy this game, and don't support these developers. I've seen other kick starter games that produce must more advance games make significantly more progress than this simple ""god"" game.

								December 2015 UpdateNo updates for three months, this game is as good as dead. As their Early Access spiel states, if you buy this game, ""...you are part of our development team."" That is blatantly not true, as I wouldn't have left the game to languish if I was, nor would I have stopped providing updates to my players. Even the 22cans Twitter account has been silent for over a month, save for a video of book signings in November 2015 for a Kickstarter reward promised to backers in September 2013.Don't buy it on sale, don't get it in a bundle, just... don't. Your money is better spent anywhere else.** V2 Update **Less clicking, more of a drag...While many of the mechanical issues with the click-laden gameplay have been redressed in the so-called V2.0, there is still a lot left lacking. V2 does reset your game save, which means existing players need to endure drawn out tutorials that introduce the game's basic interactions. Irrespective of my status as an existing player, these still come across as patronising and take way too long to get players into the meat of the game. If a tutorial has to rip you out of the game world to hand-hold you through something that should be intuitive, something's not quite right.This is just the start of how Godus continues to diappoint. The game is a lot easier to manage and control, but still takes far too long to offer progression to the player. You'll quickly build up your civilisation, obtaining the first few cards and finding all the stickers required to activate them, but you soon hit a wall when belief comes into the picture. As in the first version, belief is used to sculpt the land, place statues and expand your people, but it's far and few between. Even the between-session regenerated belief is easily used in a few seconds, leaving the player frustrated at not being able to sculpt their world and progress their civilisation.Whether it's the sour taste that V1 left behind or just a feeling of desperation that V2 exudes, I'm still not convinced that this can be called a ""regenesis""; ""rehash"", maybe. It feels like Peter Molyneux is really trying to relive past glories, rather than taking a real rethink of the god game, trying to understand what made older hits like Populous fun and coming up with a true 21st century version.Myself, I just hope those Kickstarter dollars don't run out before 49% complete becomes 100%.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having watched a couple of Let's Play videos on YouTube and having played the original Populous back in the day, I was interested by the premise of the game and the new Molyneux take on the God sim. What I should have taken more notice of, however, was the number of the videos I watched that involved the person playing trying to quieten their mouse clicks.Building your initial encampment and uncovering new resource cards is a fun distractions for a while, until you start to see the issues with the core control mechanisms. The dragging of land to reform it doesn't work anywhere near as intuitively as it could, which means you resort to clicking to terraform. Lots and lots and lots and lots of clicking. Seriously, the retail version should come boxed with it's own titanium-reinforced Godus mouse, because after a few play sessions, any normal mouse will have given up the ghost. That's unless your RSI hasn't already kicked in by that point... Collecting faith from your followers is another click-happy nightmare of an exercise, made slightly better by being able to create settlements that collect it centrally, but these often don't encompass all of your buildings and you end up having to collect the outlying faith manually.Followers are also driven to build new abodes, which it's beneficial to have as large as possible. The biggest issue with this is that followers will build in any space you clear, so often they've built smaller houses before you've had a chance to finish clearing an area. Then, the only solution is to destroy their houses to make them re-build them bigger!There are other issues, such as the inability to rotate the camera in full 3D and keep the viewing angle you chose. If you rotate your view and then scroll the play area, the view resets to the default orientation, which can be quite irritating when you're trying to stay focussed on one area of activity.On the plus side, the graphics are very pleasing on the eye and the game engine runs smooth on both Windows and the Mac. There is promise here, but until the core terraforming mechanics are reworked into something more fluid and the mouse-clicking is heavily reduced, I'd avoid it for now.			",832,273,31,88,82,6,108

Early Access Review
								No.Very disappointed that I spent anything on this game in the first place.About 20 years ago, when I was first learning the awesomeness of strategy games and computer games like Civ 1, Warcraft 1, etc--I remember playing a game on SNES called Populous and being completely taken in by it.  I loved it and spent countless summer days and nights indoors tanking hours into it.Fast forward to about 4 years ago when this game was announced and backed on Kickstarter--I couldn't wait to get my hands on a ""god game"" by one of the minds involved with Populous that I enjoyed so much as a kid.  Everything the game promised sounded so cool, and there are not many ""god game"" type games anymore, so the wish for that nostalgia was overwhelming.  It fell short of any modest expectations I had, even for something in early access.  The game is a clickfest, should have just been a trash mobile app from the start (don't worry they pursued that as well), is rather bland and now, most recently, a different version of the game has been announced called Godus Wars that has features that should have just been included in the original to begin with.There are early access games out there that I have enjoyed supporting and there are those that I completely regret.  This game is one of those that I completley regret.If you read my rambling this far, do yourself a favor and just read the other reviews too.  You don't have to take my word for it.  Google it, read about it, check out how much time has passed where this game has gone completely nowhere.Don't waste your time.			",156,17,0,46,27,0,46

								After all the updates.. this game is still as boring as it was when it was flawed.. 1st - The card idea (as much as the game developer loves it) is dull and I am sorry but I don't want to collect any such thing.. 2nd - what I want to do is have people who live in huts, develop as a society, meet another society and have interactions with that society (peaceful and war) as well as interactions with me (as the ""God"" in this game).. I want to be able to affect my people, to be able to make magic stuff (like the magic stuff in the bible and stuff..) and 3rd - I don't want to have any weird large creatures like the ones in Black and White.. the only issue with Black and White was the stupid creature idea, the fact that you were too weak as god and you had to rely on your people all the time, and the fact that the people (unlike the creature) were ultra un-interactive and ultra stupid.. Finally, the only thing that one needs to make a good game is create some sort of artificial intelligence for ""the people"" to evolve as a society, basic physics mechanics for the world and super powers for you as god (if one can cover all the magic stuff in all religious books, science fiction, movies and other games - that should be enough!)... and from then on, one can develop the game further.At the moment, I don't feel like a God.. I feel like a dad of idiotic children who reproduce all the time and expect me to do everything.. and I have to babysit them instead of making natural disaster, affecting war and peace, and doing other ""god stuff""...

								It really saddens me to have to do this, but I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this game! When Molyneux first announced his return to the God genre on Kickstarter I was over the moon, some of my earliest gaming memories are sending my armies marching in Populous II. Unfortunately the guy who invented the genre has seriously lost his way.Godus is a free2play mobile game that Molyneux has the gall to try and sell for $20 on steam. Like all God games the most important aspect of the game is your ""God Powers"" and these are possible thanks to the belief of your followers, unfortunately you have to click to collect this belief. Click EVERY house, or if you build a settlement then you can click the single ball of belief in the cenre... Great just build lots of settlements right? Wrong! Building settlements (unlike everything elses so far) requires gems, and where do you get gems? You BUY them for more of your hard earned cash money - never mind that you've already paid for the game.OK, so the clicking around is annoying, but the gameplay is fun right? Nope. The basic premise of the land is that you are helping your settlers progess through the various stages of civilization by building enough homes and gathering enough resources. Your followers will only build on flat land and the more flat land the larger the settlement building. As your followers civilization advances they need larger and larger buildings. So you spend almost the entire game trying to flatten land. That's the bulk of the game - flatten land so that you can have more followers so you can get more belief so that you can flatten more land.This is a game that might be an amusing f2p tablet game, it is absolutely not a $20 PC title or the triumphant return of the God genre that all the backers on kickstarter were promised. I feel furious that I invested good money on this title.			",168,43,2,15,22,1,53

								This game's fun- for the first few hours. It's pretty cool, shaping land, building house, fighting ""people"". But, then you need 200 people for the next upgrade card. So, you work hard, shape more land, only to find out it's just Land Expansion. You don't need anymore land, you wnat to just go to the Bronze Age. Again, you need 300 more people. That Settlement power now costs 70 gems (after only making three cities). What're you going to do? There's no more gems around, you spent them on useless pickaxes. Click on the Gem counter, and it tells you a store is in progress. I bought a full game, not a free IOS app.			",105,41,0,8,21,2,9

								When you buy an Early Access game you expect there to be problems, it's the nature of the beast but this game although in principal is good, is a poor game being developed by a seriously bad dev team! When the testers report bugs, devs are meant to acknowledge and fix them and keep in contact with the community - sadly they have a poor record of doing this, even taking 3 months away and leaving the testers high & dry. When Godus refused to work for me around 2.03 I found this out for myself, rather than making a fix so we could play for what we paid for I was left until the next patch with no solution, no serious game developers treat their customers like this!It seems 22Cans are doing this on a wing and a prayer, with no experience, no concern and no interest in feedback, too much changing what was bearable and not fixing bugs, took them months after bringing in the ludicrous stickers to do something worthwhile but they'll probably change that negatively too!Don't get me started on the voyages, what a train wreck -  save your money!!! :(			",61,11,1,29,33,3,26

								I have played God & Builder Games since the original Populous came out.The Game is now 51% ""finished"" and it is still a huge disappointment.You can see that the Designers use Time as a Weapon against you - which means that everything takes forever to build, forage or create. Of course you can speed up these endless Procedures by by using Gems (which in the Mobile Version of the Game can be bought - don't you love those scamming Free-to-Play-Games?).It can literally take Hours to finish a Building, harvest enough Grain or accumulate godly Powers to move along. Therefore ""Godus"" should be renamed to ""Waitus"". It is boring as F############!!!The Exploration Mini Games fell utterly disconnected from the Main Game - there only implemented to either teach you Game Mechanics or give you something to do while you ... snorrrrr ... wait!!!!While in other Builder Games you have a decent Civilization after a few Hours of Playing and actually something interesting happens, but in Godus you might just built your first bigger Settlement and have to wait for another Hour or two to harvest enough Grain for the next Round of Expansion.After so many Months this Game still hasn't discovered what it is all about. The Mechanics are stretch to utter Blandness and Boredom. It shows that they use Time to bore you out of your Skull to make you buy Gems on the Mobile Version - sadly the same Trickery spoils the PC Version as well.The Game is a giant Chore. You are not a God, you are a ""Waiter"" at the Mercy of your own Patience and the willfully boring Mechanics of the Creators.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I expected more update with the dev team and not there video update.. I gave the neg rep for the reason of that the game devs are a bit rockey since they promoted out the wazoo as well as are self bloughting... They have not released any game updates at all since novmember only update is there video.. I wish I could interact with the followers but in all atm you will be flatting land or get to the 17k peak of flatting mountians (which are a pain atm due to lagg as well hard to control). The game has a lot of promise I do believe the Devs will be the downfall of this game if they do not release an update with in the couple of months of begining of 2014...

You can also click and drag all over them, which is a little faster, and you can ""enjoy"" the sound it makes, because you can play ""auld lang Syne"" and some other tunes... which you will be doing every 5 minutes... for about 2 minutes...When Building Settlements for Mining/Farming you'll need (at this stage) a flat surface, so you have to drag loads of ground until you get enough room, this costs, depending on the layer you want to build on, a lot of believe. with a lot I mean something about 100-150k on mountains. Smaller houses generate about 50-100 believe every few minutes, the bigger houses tend to let you wait for much longer, and get about 200... so for this there is  actually no point in building the bigger ones. Also, your Settlement will cost about 50k for itself. plus about 80k for 4 Shrines.  So yeah, altogether, next to the (right now) tidious task of sculpting, you need about 300k believe, which is the equivalent of 6 or more hours of waiting. Well, it would be, if you wouldn't need to harvest believe regularly, because at some point the house is full, and won't generate any more believe.If you actually sculpted your way to a little Settlement... your followers will have to go there. They can climb up or down only one layer, and they're pathfinding abbillities are... to be honest, even worse than mine... Also.. Every other game since... I don't know, 1992, uses Shift to add more Units to the group you are controlling and a right click to send them somewhere... Here you have to hold your mouse while hovering over a unit for about 2 seconds, go to the next, hover, go to the next and hover.... and so on, then place the mouse where you want them to go, and release the button. As you might want to have about 10 builders go and build a house... it stresses my finger very unnecessary. Also, it happens very often, that the game registers a release of the button, although I'm sure i held it. Farming Settlements tend to do this: every farmer you send to a field, generates about 10 Wheat. Which means: if you have 60 Farmers, your Wheat rise and fall arround 600 (+/-30 maybe). It doesn't seem to work, like waiting for your ressources... you actually have to build more Settlements to get to 700... not to get there faster, to get there alltogether. And yes, this means again, spending 6 hours and more on gathering believe etc. You will  get new Abillities when you reach a certain number of followers, wheat or ore. You get Followers by bulding massive ammounts of houses, wheat and ore by farming and mining Settlements, and yes, mining works from what I can say the same as farming. Also, the moment you get Mining, you can't build houses, because they'll cost ore...so you have to wait for believe and build a settlement where you already built some houses... These new Abillities come in the form of Cards, representing for example +1 follower per house, 30% more radius on farming settlements, sculpt 3 layers at once (you won't believe how tidious it gets scultping only one) and so on... but you have to unluck these cards, by paying stickers which you find hidden on the map (by far not enough) and on the voyage of discovery, some kind of mini game. So you have to WAIT for hours to get the card, which isn't that much for the most part (11 instead of 10 followers in the big house?), then you have to search for those stickers. And you know what? if it is actually a bigger house (not a +1 version, a new aboude altogether) you will have to tear down the buildings in your settlements, to get the new big one. and often, if you kill a building outside a settlement, there will be a blue builder, who will build a new, smaller house the spot where you wanted to build bigger Which costs even more time and effort to stop. The Voyage of discovery is a mini game, where you can win stickers. You can send 10-30 followers (if they die, you will have to replace them... with believe... about 10k for 10 followers) per level. Your followers will have to walk from the boat on which they arrive to a temple, in some levels there will be walls you can't pass, giants who kill your followers, or swamp that either kills or slows them. And yes, swamp looks the same, as far as I can tell, but I am never sure what will happen if they step on it. You will have to sculpt a way for your followers to the temple, avoiding those traps, while on a strict time limit (I mean really, really strict), sometimes (but really not every time) you can use 1 Spell (very limited believe) and or a shrine. In an earlier version of the game, I played through the Journey, and after that you could always repeat them, to get infinite Stickers, right now, I can select the Temple where the Journey starts, but it won't get me there...So I had to edit the savegame just to be able to get bigger houses etc.In an earlier Version, it was possible to start the game, collect believe, close, set your System watch to another time, start again, collect again etc. This was ""fixed"", which means... not only clicking like hell, but also waiting for hours.The game actually continues while closed, but I can't decide if thats actually good or bad.I am not really sure if farming etc works like I described. But from my point of view, even if you have enough Farmers and Fields, it takes a lot of time, until your wheat is collected. I actually let the game run and went into town for 5 hours, just to come back to a plus of about... 70?. Inaccaptable! But if you close the game and start it at a later time... your wheat won't have changed. So you have to let it running. Believe on the other hand will be generated while the game is closed, Which is nice. Also, on the map there are several temples/Shrines, which your follower have to restore. For that, you simply send builders. Oh wait, did I say simple... again, they have to find their way.... Also, they get tired, and go back home, so the buildtime will increase. If it says 2 hours, calculate at least 4, if the builders homes are a little further away, or even behind some kind of mountain. Also... I actually found a temple with a build time of 6 0r 7 days with one  builder... at least there's the possibillity of sending more (every one has it's own maximum number of builders) that one was able to be used by 10 or so. And with all them sent, it went back to... 2 days... still too much. At least... As far as I can tell... if the game is closed, workers won't get tired, so 2 days will actually be 2 days... and not 4-5, which it would be if you let the game running...So... closing the game sometimes speeds up the game... sometimes doesn't... Also, from time to time there is a storm, which for now seems to be only optic. But in an earlier version it damaged your buildings and you had to manually set your builders to repair them (damaged buildings didn't generate believe). Such storms don't appear that often, but at least once per hour (from my feelings, never stopped it). They didn't seem to appear when the game was closed, and I really really hope, they won't reeinvent that damage, because it makes a tidious game even more tidious...So... as you can see. I really am not very impressed by the game. It might have potential, but it seems like they want to have a lot of microtransactions, so you can play at least at a decent pace... right now, it seems like playing for a longer time actually is discouraged. Oh...also... the journey of discovery actually came instead of some kind of multiplayer where you fought an AI player. Fighting meant: who gets more followers in 9 Minutes, who mines more diamonds (disappeared from the game) which was a little more fun than JoD.			",178,52,5,46,49,2,67

								This game is not worth buying. If you think this is gonna be a game where you build some kind of empire or civilization you're only half right. This game is a more complex version of Simon says. You can't decide where any of the buildings go and the people just walk around waiting for you to move something so they have more space to build stuff. I think the idea behind this game allows the player to see the world from the perspective of a god, but the only way that can work is if you have first hand control of everything that is going on and in this case you don't. I understand that this game isnt finished yet, but the way I see it, this game needs to be completly remade to work. I firmly do not recommend this game.			",99,9,5,11,17,0,10

								If I were reviewing this in the same format as Kotaku , then I'd say NOT YET.  You see Godus has alot of things I usually find appealing.  I am God ..and I have the freedom to create a civilisation as I see fit.  Except here..I don't , not as such.   In Godus , control over the populus goes about as far as how much space I provide on the land to allow the houses to grow in up to 3 levels.  Other than that Godus is a grid management sim with some freedom in the form of land sculpting. This is somewhat ammsuing if it were not for what is in essence Godus's biggest downfall.  Clicking.  Lots of god damn clicking.  But you've heard all about that by now. Don't be fooled , there is an idea here in Godus but the execution is terrible.  I played for 3 hours straight and ended up with incredible cramp.  `ahhh but you did play for 3 hours straight ` hear you say.  Sadly yes , it's addictive . Painful but addictive , and the other problem with this game is its all seemingly just to complete a card collection. I've done this before , now where was it...Oh thats right , any cow clicker on Facebook!   So the devs say this current Beta buil represents 40% ish of this final content.  Lets hope the remaining 60% ish , is somewhat more enlightening.  Or just scrap this on PC and sell it on Android and Itunes.			",417,66,45,64,76,6,75

								Ridiculous amounts of clicking/click n' drag. If you had any kind of RSI problems before this game, it will only make it even worse. Spend hours flattening and shaping land to build ever expanding areas to then be♥♥♥♥♥♥blocked by a gem requirement that is very limited in your world. To top it off after you spend a bunch of time making a large flat area to build the biggest houses possible, the game switches to wanting you to make farmer fields instead of houses. This game looks like it could maybe be something worthwhile in the future. However, as it currently is, I can't recommend picking up this game unless you literally have nothing better to do than drag terrain around.			",104,35,1,20,11,2,26

								First, a caveat that this review is for the early access game.When telling friends about this game I refer to it as Clickus, because I feel like all I ever did in this game. The game was initially fun when I was building up settlements, earning followers, unlocking some new stuff, etc. However it quickly becomes a tedious click-fest. Worse, the more followers you get the more tedious clicking you have to do, which acts as a huge disincentive to continue playing. I want to believe that this is just because it's early access game and that it will be sorted out by the time they do a general release, but I'm not very hopeful. All the clicking (and double-clicks and click-and-drags)  seems to be so fundamental to the game's design that it's hard to see how that would change.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This looks like it has a lot of potential, but as advertised by the developers, its only at 40% completion.  As I played it, it seemed like it would be more suited for use on a tablet or another device where the interraction is touch based.  There's really no competition in the game, just you moulding the ground to dig up cards or to make the biggest, flattest area possible to place villages. At this point, it needs balancing.  There is no compelling reason to keep hills, trees or rocks and the player is compelled to flatten everything.  I think it would be usefull to give players reasons to keep hills and trees in the early game, reasons such as hunting or shelter or something of that nature.  Its a bit tedious to click on everything to gather resources or mould the landscape.  Am interested in seeing where the game goes.  It is a very early look right now.At this point I can't fully recommend it.  Will revise when an update comes out.  Am interested in continuing to beta it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Build more buildings to make room for more villagers and then click on those buildings ad nauseum.			",259,57,2,68,32,0,46

								early acess or not, the game is very boring... this coming from a die-hard black and white, populous and other ""god"" game turbofan. main problem is it has no point. there is nothing compelling here, and no reason to grow/evolve your civilization.  pete promised massive online multiplayer on a  persistent unified world... and it seems he has thrown that out.  all that is left is a sandbox without any ""toys,"" and i don't see that changing anytime soon, or ever.  development has been a crawl for this game and any changes that are done are to things that are ancillary or cosmetic. the term ""THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME""  does not apply here, as the game has lacked anything compelling since day one, and all changes done have done nothing to address it.

								This game is not worth buying. If you think this is gonna be a game where you build some kind of empire or civilization you're only half right. This game is a more complex version of Simon says. You can't decide where any of the buildings go and the people just walk around waiting for you to move something so they have more space to build stuff. I think the idea behind this game allows the player to see the world from the perspective of a god, but the only way that can work is if you have first hand control of everything that is going on and in this case you don't. I understand that this game isnt finished yet, but the way I see it, this game needs to be completly remade to work. I firmly do not recommend this game.			",99,9,5,11,17,0,10

								Godus at this stage of development is a deeply disappointing waste of code that that utterly fails to live up to the promise of its creator. Godus is a tediously slow game and by far the worst creation associated with Peter Molyneux's  name. The game is achingly slow to progress due an obnoxious pay-or-wait mechanic identical to that which infests mobile gaming; the very same mechanic that Molyneux complained about in the mobile conversion of Dungeon Keeper. More gallingly, the Godus devs insultingly try to paint this abhorrent mechanic as a positive feature that allows players more freedom rather than something that ruins the flow of the game and degrades it into nothing but a Skinner Box.

Building Settlements has turned into population micromanagment nightmare and has a smaller coverage compared to the old system. While I do enjoy the new look of the redesign. I really think too much sacrifice was made has turn this game to something really not used to be. At its current functionality, this game feels very Pre-Alpha than a Beta. Would not recommend.

								Simple graphics and interesting mechanics belie a game that has been abandoned by its authoring studio. with virtually no contact from developers to customers beyond ""we're still working"" notes on twitter, Godus remains firmly in the Alpha stage for the forseeable future. if 22cans is still working on this game, nobody has seen any evidence of it since october 2013. I'd be surprised if anyone at 22cans is doing anything other than Xeroxing resumes and getting out before the paychecks start bouncing.I have no problem with companies releasing Alpha and Beta code to Early Access, but when said companies are led by an industry veteran and seem incapable of communicating release dates, work done, or making rational design choices, I can't help but feel taken advantage of.

								After another update, this game continues to disapoint, timers are insanely long. The Astari, are the most annoying feature that anyone could dream up, everything in this game is designed to force you to log in every few hours. The designers seem to think that my PC is a damn IPad, this is not the game they promised during their kickstarter campaign.I will continue to try out the new features, but i am certain it will continue to be a joke of a game.Very little has changed from below, except they have put more blocks in place of your enjoyment.After having high hopes with the new patch i gave godus 2.0 another go, i really wish i had not bothered.now instead of too much clicking its click and drag, click and drag. Dull, boring mechanics make this game a chore to play, there is no point in progressing, the more powerful you become the more clicking and dragging you have to do. The ridiculous sticker system, that replaced the previous resource system is a total joke, it changes nothing you just have a little more freedom in which totaly pointless upgrade you can have for your villagers. Homelessness and lost villagers are a pointless addition, they never seem to die, so who the hell cares if they are homeless. Sculpting is slightly better, but still a chore, everything takes too long, why cant i sculpt more than one level at a time? Maybe i get the ability in the future, but i will never find out as i will wait till there is another major update before attempting this game again.Voyages, another totaly pointless addition, if i wanted to play lemmings i would play lemmings. Why the hell would i as a god, need to sculpt a path to a temple that exsists on another land mass for no reason what so ever. in 25 seconds??  It`s another chore especially when your villagers are so dumb they can not manage to go up a clearly accessable path until you make it slightly wider and then some still can not manage it.What ever you do, do not buy this game, if it interests you then wait for another major update. It is not worth any amount of money yet.			",398,127,2,91,78,6,114

The god battles aren't even potrayed as being between gods, but between you and some annoying person on an IM/Text system battleing you before thier parents get home, or before her mom had dinner ready. I forget what idiotic thing it said. This is not a god game, because you do not feel like a god, nor does interactions with other ""gods"" feel like it has anything to do with being a god. If you are looking for a Black and White like game stear clear of this one. Unless they start over from scratch this game will never be what I, and I assume many others, would expect from a god game.			",143,18,0,33,9,1,7

								Click....clickclickclick....click....click and drag.....click...clickclickclick.  I normally love these types of games, I totally adore Molyneux and I'd been eagerly following this since Kickstarter.  It's not really showing any potential in the actual content anymore.The graphics are pretty and remind me of ""From Dust"".  I only played it for half an hour but my wrist can't take anymore.  My minions don't do anything but hide in their houses and come out when i poke them to build more, I can't even choose where they build.  The pop ups for the cards is irritating and overall you are left feeling rather adrift, haunted by the infernal noise of your own clicking.  I want to say happy things about this game but unfortunately all I can say is its visually appealing while you give yourself carpal tunnel.			",132,43,1,17,21,0,16

								I wouldn't recommend the game, not because its a bad game, i wouldn't call it a good game, but definitely not a bad game, its distracting is probably the best compliment i can give.In it, you attempt to grow your civilization by making them nice flat land to build houses on.  Almost all of your interaction with the game involved flattening land, it does get a bit boring, especially since all of your villagers and their houses are more or less identical (there are different tech levels of buildings, but nothing at each tech level to make anything stand out).  There isn't any kind of personal feel, and you don't really have anything to do with your villagers except gather belief from them.The ui is also a bit wonky, i call it a reverse port when i think about it.  The game was obviously meant to be released on tablets, its a bit odd that they released on pc first, it takes full advantage of all the niceties of using a touchscreen, but makes no effort to cater to those of us using a mouse/keyboard.  It feels kind of like PC was an afterthought, even though it was released here first.			",431,129,8,118,93,8,114

								Right now, this game has nothing to do with the Populus you played 25 years ago. It's a click orgy and feels like was developed for tablets only. There are no menues of any kind, so you have to learn mouse-gestures - no support for the right mouse button either! It feels very much like it was developed for tablets only.The game pace is terrible slow. Most of the time you will just sit around and waiting for the pink bubbles (your mana points, which allow you to do things like terra forming etc.) to pop up above each of your settlements, which you then have to collect by clicking on them. Let me repeat that: if you have 200 settlements, you have to click 200 different pink bubbles to collect your ""mana points"" and progress in the game. So most of the time you end up just sitting around doing nothing and just wait for the next bubbles to click on, which is as much fun as watching paint dry - except that paint will dry much faster than this game progresses. It's just a huge disapointment for me. Save your money or pick up the original Populus on GOG instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I just thought I'd come back to this review, edit it, and still warn people to stay away. Even now, a year later, after all these updates, this game is nothing but a horrendous cash-grab.I just want to start off by saying that 22Cans has decided to use your money you invested in Godus, to fund a new game. Yes, not only did they use your Funds before to fund their Tablet pay2win version of Godus, they're essentially giving up on both and funding a new game. This game is rarely updated, when it is, its nothing even worth mentioning. The Developers rarely respond or listen, it appears the only threads they will respond to are negative threads.About the game itself. It is essentially a village and landscaping simulator. You manage your villagers and landscape the terrain so everything is flat so your villagers can expand. They generate faith which appear and purple bubbles on their houses which you must click to collect. The entire game is clicking, you have to click on houses to make villagers come out, click on faith bubbles, click on terrain, trees, rocks. When the game first came out, the more you play it the more you see they made it to compliment a touch-screen tablet. While they denied this, guess what happened... A tablet version of the game comes out, which gets more developer attention than the PC.While you're doing all this clicking and expanding your villages you unlock god powers. You're thinking, awesome, Populous. No, these god powers are expensive, boring, and do really do anything to help you at all, they just compliment your village expansion and clicking abilities.We were originally promised a civilization game where you would expand into space age. They have just stated that they downsized their team to fund and develop their new game because they are almost done with Godus.. Well, its been this long as we only have 2 ages, were not even out of Before-Christ eras yet. Say goodbye to Space age, it will never happen.They originally promised us an earth-like planet where everyone else would be connected to and playing. They said you could be randomly sculpting your land, then suddently run into another god and their civilization. You could make war with them, or joing them and build together. This is no longer happening. I cant imagine how many people were scammed because they bought the game solely for this. I bought the game solely for this, because honestly, I wanted to wreck stuff with my god powers. Now we get ""Hub-Worlds"" where you'll essentially battle against a few other gods at super speed. Basically match-making games that will end and return you back into your singleplayer game.I seriously advice anyone to stay far from this game.			",65,11,2,5,13,1,5

It's very buggy - you can no longer find chests that contain the stickers you need to gain/improve god powers.  Since the latest updates, I've not been able to progress as much as in previous versions.  They added ""voyages"" which are required to get cards and stickers and I really don't like them; many other users seem to agree...			",44,64,0,18,13,0,4

								There's potential in this game but that's all you can usually say for, a Molyneux title.Aside from the unnecessary terrible UI design and the horrible pacing for new players, the game is supposed to be 49% complete and still features MAJOR issues with the graphics engine (there were at least 30 restarts in 20 minutes trying to fix some apparent random tile clipping [flashing black, non-rendered, normal rendered, repeat) which typically happened any time I'd open my borders.I don't think this was a smart move to release early and I'm not who the hell the target audience is worth.  It needs a lot of work and Molyneux needs to learn to keep his ego in check. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game that soured me on Kickstarter. Simply: It's a free to play/pay to progress game. Unfortunately, it was presented on Kickstarter as a traditional game, everyone's money collected, before it was revealed that you pretty much have to pay to progress in the in game store.If you want to do a free to play/pay to progress, fine, make that. But give that away for free and make your money from its paywalls. Don't sell it to people as a traditional, playable game, collect their money and then pull a bait and switch.Don't waste your money buying it now. Soon after release, they'll drop its price to the ""free"" it always should have been so they can get more players to spend in their online store. Wait until then before picking it up.

								Current build not playable, It's looking good so far (Can already tell it will be a Highly addictive Game), however, I am crashing to desktop every 5 to 10 minutes, happens in either full screen or windowed.Second to this;Stuck in ""Settlement tutorial"".Asking me to ""click on the builder settlement card"", Nothing happens when I click, and I cannot progress forward through the tutorial, nor can I go back to the game.Tutorial is unavoidable. Even clicking the X to close the window that says ""SHOW ME"" opens the tutorial anyway.I am stuck. I'd say restart, but there's not much point if the game is this broken currently. It will only keep happening again until it is fixed.The game is playable for a maximum of 45 minutes...It really needs fixing.DO NOT BOTHER buying this yet, it is not even remotely ready for play.It may take another 3 months for them to fix this, their track record for ""updating"" isn't going too well.

								Don't buy this game. Seriously. I bought it in the first version because I wanted to support the idea of an new god game because I loved B&W 1-2 so much. I played it 20+ hours because I always hoped that this boring non stop clicking just the beginning is because every start is hard. But it didn't changed. It's now 3 months ago since the last update, and I personally think the update made it even worse. I haven't even played it anymore since then because it was even more unenjoyable. If I could, I would try to get my money back. 20€ for a mobilephone game but without less possibilities than the most android/iOS games. Don't buy this game if you want to play a god with a world to control. You can get for less money Black & White which is a million times better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As it is now Godus is not very fun. Collecting cards, as it is now, is not fun. Clicking every single house for belief, also not fun. Clicking trees and rocks to collect belief, still no fun. The god battles aren't even potrayed as being between gods, but between you and some annoying person on an IM/Text system battleing you before thier parents get home, or before her mom had dinner ready. I forget what idiotic thing it said. This is not a god game, because you do not feel like a god, nor does interactions with other ""gods"" feel like it has anything to do with being a god. If you are looking for a Black and White like game stear clear of this one. Unless they start over from scratch this game will never be what I, and I assume many others, would expect from a god game.			",143,18,0,33,9,1,7

								So this is me now re-reviewing this game after it's re-regenisis. Having a considerable amount of hours put into (pre and post re-release), I would like to think that I have a justified conclusion about where I stand with the game now and 22cans.So, firstly, the pro's. Yes, it's been revamped. We now don't have to click as much, in fact, little to none. We click and drag. The population now has a bit of charm and mobility, creating friendships and being active around the world, and the voyage quests put a breathe of fresh air into the game. This is, however, meant with some poor AI and pathing problems, and a general lack of pace.Belief now struggels to get into the 10,000 mark whilst sculpting, and although the bottom layers (sand under water and on land to the first grassy layers) are free, it simply isn't enough to continue scultping as you will, like the original release of the game.Belief was always a major problem for myself, I think it's the most boring resource collection in any God game. This was felt unanimously in the early access community, but instead of the mechanic being altered, we are now propted to do it differently. With the clicking and the dragging. Followers get lost, dazed and confused constantly, and a recent update doesn't seem to tackle the issue, but prompt you to look at them. A beacon will flash continuously, over and over again, alerting the player to simply look at them. The update has not fixed the issue of poor AI, but instead taunts the player to attempt to sculpt steps adlib with the previously stated little to none belief that can be collected. The poor AI also leads to some horribly frustrating incidents aside from step scultping.The voyage quest are, as I stated at the start, a nice feature but the poor pathing issues lead to incidents that leave the player gobsmacked at the utter stupidity of his believers. Numerous times have I created a lovely path for my bold travelers to safety and victory, only to look back at there progress witnesses them entering a wall of death in a swamp. Or whatever that little black, spotty bit of land is called. I have no doubt that a new update will have tutorials and directional arrows to your destination, however. The common theme of this update is a general ignorance from 22cans to realise the true problems fans and customers are having with the game. ""The beliefe mechanic is a bad mechanic as it prompts to player to click too much and has no depth whatsoever to the game"", the Steam community would say. To which 22cans would say ""Ah, we'll click and drag"".The biggest critque of this re-review is 22cans itself and inabilty to connect with the early access community in order to develope a game that was worth the money in the first place. Putting your head in the sand whilst everything goes wrong and not communicating for 3 months is at the very least an immature way to create a game, or in a broader context, to handle a market. In a day of where I can communicate with a friend in the States, Australia or Japan from my humble house near Glasgow, I feel a lack of communication has no excuss. Clicking causes stress on the joints, but dragging is a drag.Buy if you wish, but I've uninstalled.			",56,15,1,11,5,0,4

 Are you looking to pay $20 for the Simpons Tapped Out? If so, then look no further.How is this game like Simpsons Tapped Out?In the STO you collect money from towns people.  In Godus you collect belief from followers.  Belief == MoneyOnce you get enough money, in STO you build buildings that collect large sums of money at an easily tappable location.  Likewise in Godus,once you collect enough Belief, you create Settlements that gather large amounts of Belief in an easily tappable location.In the STO you have to complete towns people missions in order to gain XP to advance through the levels.  In Godus, you need to use followers to complete ""missions"" in order to unlock resources and land expansions that enable you to advance through the ages.All of this is extremely tedious if playing on PC, which I'll assume you plan to do, given this is the Steam forums.Add to this the lack of developer feedback/interaction with the community, the lack of regular game updates, and the censorship of the game forums (particularly when the game is on sale), and you have a game that should not even be listed on Steam, let alone one you should consider buying.[tldr;] Godus should be a free to play mobile/tablet game.

								Do not buy into this game. You will be ""empowered"" to be the most lame excuse of ground-levelling god so your followers can decide to build things you have no say in. There is almost next to no control over your followers and progression is painfully slow and unrewarding. It takes a little more than digging for a stupid card to keep me interested. The ""regular updates"" the developer promised are so slow, it's almost a joke.  I bought this for 9.99$ during the Steam Winter sale, and regret every penny of it.0 cans out of 22 cans, shameful display, and I feel dumb for falling for the developer's PR bait on YouTube and online.UPDATE: The mobile title has been released, with typical P2W mechanics we all see in other titles. So much for ""aesthetic"" microtransactions, eh?  I regret backing this game, and every time I try to play it, it only stays on my computer for an hour before I fear for my sanity, so I delete it again.			",54,5,0,22,7,1,15

								This game, still in beta, is probably not worth the $$ you'll spend on it at this time. Virtually no in-game documentation to help you learn what it is you need to do to start can lead to a complete loss of ""faith"" before you get to the point in the game where your followers start generating it for you. There is no in-game way to quit and start over (you have to delete your saves files), and there some goofy scripted ""p-v-p"" battle zone that is actually player vs AI battle zone. Additionally, once an area is cleared, there is no way to put trees or other beautiful things back into it and lots of times the silly followers will start building as soon as an area is available instead of waiting for me to finish.  I wish there was a ""building"" menu for me to select from the different buildings that my followers know how to usein order for me to more beautifully place my buildings. I guess I thought it would be more like SIMS and less like click, drag, pull and hope for the best.  Oh and like others said, lots and lots of random clicking. I wish there were preiests who could go to outlying places and ""collect"" the faith for me, so that then I just needed to click on the wandering bubble of faith, or the priest would go every 10 minutes or so and deposit faith in a church or temple.

								(This applies to version 1.3.1 of the game, and may hopefully one day prove invalid when an improved game comes along. No luck so far though).Avoid this disappointing dull click-fest that goes nowhere.Peter Molyneux, who created some of the best games I've ever played, should be able to do better than this. The game, in its present form, is shockingly unengaging and crashy, even for a beta. It's tedious beyond words and has been given an early beta release before even basic elements of the interaction or incentives of playing seem to have been considered. Don't expose yourself to the boring and shoddy half-finished work of someone whose previous titles were great. Wait. And hope it gets better somehow. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well to start I have nothing against cow clickers, I do have something against paying for one, this is a game that one should not have to pay for at all.  If one is to pay for it one should not pay full price, get when it is on a sale if you must see what it is like.  I got it during a steam sale myself. I still feel I may have over paid.I do however see the potentail this game has, I do however have doubt that such potenial shall be reached.  I also must admit that this is not a game for all people, I some how enjoy it.  Mind you I am normally enjoying some wine or beer while playing it, thus making use of the mindlessness it is in full.  Hardly use my brain power but am able to suck myself in to my computer for hours.I do wonder why I still bought this game even after seeing so many people not recommend this game, then I realized I never take good advice.

								Steer clear of this game!  (For now)If you've played Populous series which made by the same dev and think it's gonna be its successor, think again.Imagin you put Populous as a base game and stripped everything that made the series enjoyable out of it.  Yep, you get Godus.  Plain and simple.The game has one home-world. No shaman for you.  and to do something you need to generated god power by waiting. I'm not talking about 10-30 seconds waiting in Populous. It's more like in some social media games (Face**cough) and you have to *PICK IT UP ONE BY ONE WITH YOUR HAND*To build a building you have to wait 5 mins for the smallest building.  You can speed things up with more followers or *CASH*.  And your followers can't be outside for too long or they're DEAD. except you build a power node which cause powers and only one can be built at a time.  The game is 40% of what the dev's planned.  (If you believe them)  If you're interested I'd say wait for some hugh improvements that need to be made before buying this.			",153,25,0,19,17,0,20

								Sadly this game has taught me to avoid Kickstarter or Early Access in future.  The original pitch promised 'The Regenesis of the God Game'.  It was pitched first as a desktop game, with stretch goals to support mobile, and then we were told that it would be seamless across all platforms, but what have we got?  An f2p click-fest totally unsuited to a desktop platform.  Nothing in this game even remotely matches the promise in the original pitch:""During GODUS’s development there will be many instances where specific decisions need to be taken and choices made. As a valued supporter we see you as part of the Project, so you’ll be able to suggest, comment and vote to determine many elements of the game. As you’ll discover, designing games is intriguing.""So, when's that going to happen then?There has been no communication from the developers for months, though we were promised weekly updates.Many people backed this game at a higher level to include multiple copies of the game to get it on desktop and mobile platforms, only to find it's going to be free to play..If ever there was an example of how *not* to launch a crowdfunding project this is it.

								Time Played: 16hrsIt's a beautiful-looking game as you can see in the screenshots, and it's a beta so there's tons of functionality that's yet to be made available. I understand and could forgive that if it weren't for one detail: the controls are AWFUL!To sculpt the land you have to peel one layer, maybe 3 square cm at a time. I've recently unlocked a card that'll allow me to do 3 layers at a time with presumably a slightly larger area (I hope!), but I've not found the stickers to activate it yet (one of the bugs: the glowy effect to indicate a chest has disappeared). There's another card later on that allows me to sculpt 8 layers at a time but I'd guess that's a good 100hrs away still. Then beyond that is another card that allows 9 layers.To put that into perspective .. as far as I can tell layers go from -18 (below sea level) to +44 (above sea level) ... at least, that's the range I've seen so far. The highest I can currently build in is layer #16, so high ground has to be be levelled at least that far ... 1 layer, 3 square centimetres at a time! Landscaping is starting to get a bit tedious ...Oh! Also the further you are from sea level, the more Belief it takes to sculpt the earth, so forget trying to level that mountain until you're many hours into the game!Talking of Belief, this is generated constantly but has to be periodically harvested from your followers' buildings. This again gets fairly boring and is worse than it sounds ... since it's so costly and time-consuming to sculpt the terrain you'll find your followers sprawl further across the landscape as time passes. Right now at 16hrs it takes 10 seconds (I timed it!) to scroll from the top to the bottom of my region, but I can just about see one side to the other in a single screen. Harvesting all my Belief takes just over a minute (I have ~220 buildings atm).If they can just make the controls more friendly and less tedious they'll improve the game considerably.

								I'll start this with the negatives- it is no where near what has been promised for it, it is barely the game advertised and is ridiculously overpriced. In my opinion, it is what I would expect from a mobile game for £2/3.However, I have spent a large amount of time in this game because it has its adictive moments. I enjoy building up a town and it has been enjoyable to play with the knowledge of it being an alpha game.For me to be able to happily recommend this game it needs fixing, it is full of bugs, difficult to start a new game and in places not playable. Please fix this, it has the basis to be a fun game...			",95,27,10,10,33,2,8

								I've played this Game at various stages of its development, the original version released looks amazingly promising and i really got excited about it!But then i left the game to see how it developed. a year later i returned after following the development and i was somewhat disappointed. no actually i was VERY disappointed... i mean i originally thought their development method was a bad idea by adding features, releasing them then changing them or removing them entirely. it just seemed to me that the Game had no direction and they were adding random stuff to try and make it seem new.like the original game had Combat, then an update or two later it was removed. Settlements have been changed more times than my underwear. Modding is not even Modding. Sculpting is about as Zen as polishing a poop.Got to be honest, wait another 2 years and see how much has changed. i doubt it will change much.			",28,17,0,17,21,0,10

								So, Godus.If my memory is correct, this is the first game I bought when i first entered Stony Brook University as an international students. I used to spend most of my weekends on it, watching my little followers living great lives. After the first semester I have declared my major and the major department moved me into many difficult courses as requirement (for example organic chemistry;Search the ""CHE 321 Stony Brook"" online, it is so difficult that i somehow find it amazing: how can people overcome it), and i deleted this little so i can stuff more lecture videos in my laptop. In the winter break in 2014 i find myself having too much spare time so i installed this game again on my laptop. And i was impressed! The makers have modified so many items (like combine little house togethers, attacking the hostile village using meteors and mining system), most of them are great, but some of them like the expedition using a little ship system, really suck. Though many modifications have been made, it is still in ""early access"" category (the game ""Planet Anhilliation"", which used to be in the ""early access"" in the same time as ""Godus"", have benn officially released a long time ago).But the reputation of this game has fallen a lot, it used to be in the ""Feature Items"" list! Now it got an ""User Reviews"" as ""Mostly Negative"" for many reasons: boring game mode, premature system, a lot of bugs...I don't think i will recommend this game, it represents a really great idea, within such a premature system. The only thing I hope now is that it can get better so next time i check on this game, i can confidently recommend this game to my friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I had extreme high-expectations of this game! And Oh no, I was not disproved. My expectations where met with flowing graphics ands gameplay and smart AI manoeuvring around the land, b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l.But then I started to re-think this, the game caused me to start again, after my first world which I crawled across the ground to achieve, reached their bug and had to restart, (Their bug being an entrapment stopping people from playing the game too much so they can still ""enjoy"" it, notice the """"...)So that's my first attempt over and done with, not much I can do? Sure, let's move on.Second attempt at the game:Did good, got past where I was from my first attempt after an entire day of slavery, to then discover 'The Pit Of Doom' now ofcourse the game is ""balanced"" once again, notice the """"- After sacrificing about 10 people, later into the game I was hooped into a Catch 22, which I could not leave, and ultimately lost. Need gems to get hapiness? use your people, that you can't control, because you don't have belief, because they've left your houses, because you don't have enough gems...See the problem?THIRD ATTEMPT:Okay, third attempt, here we go; what can go wrong this time right?So I've got past where I was in the prior attempts, yes, it was enjoyable in the mere 10 minutes I had not played after slavering 10 hours to get back to my point where I died before...""There's things in the mountains you should try and discover!""-Okay, let's give that a go. ...And no. There IS NO CAMERA FUNCTION! I've tried 60+ minutes trying to slice an edge of a mountain, an edge. A freaking edge. and there is a massive mountain to remove, it's not possible, not, possible. They've released the Patch to add 'The pit Of Doom' but cannot add a camera function? Please, call that a patch? I call it making the game harder to play.So, the game isn't completeable hardly, it takes many hours to even attempt, it doesn't have it's replayability as it says. Oh and, well- did I mention you'll get far and then be forced to re-try?--------------------------The bottom line is, get far in the game, well done; you'll still have to retry when they patch it again, or? Complain like me and get stuck? Bottom line is you'll still have to retry it all when they patch it again.See the pattern here?--------------------------P.SI'm listening to all this ""commentary"" and well, they're always saying ""You've always got things to do! never a need to just leave the game""-Well then, what happens when I'm building my abodes, going on a adventure thing, and they die, and now I'm waiting 1 hour for people to arrive at the boat, during that 1hour, what, the freaking hell, do, I, DO.------------------------------------------P.P.S -If I knew all of this,I wouldn't of purchased the game!!

								Previously I'd given this game a thumbs up. A few months ago it was pretty fun. You terraformed terrain, expanded your civilization, and amassed belief from your minions to do cool things. But it's become apparent recently that 22cans is not designing a PC game. They're designing a mobile game, and releasing it on PC so they can charge people up front to fund the mobile version.Have you played one of those mobile games where you start out building things and everything is fun, and then by the second day everything takes 4 hours to complete and you can pay to speed it up? And then by the third day everything takes a week to complete? Yeah, that's what Godus is now. You can get ""gems"" which are a special currency that allows you to, you guessed it, speed things up.The progression system is absurd now. You progress by unlocking cards. And then buying the cards. That's right after you unlock the card you have the privilege of buying it. With stickers. That you receive when you A. buy them with gems, B. get lucky opening chests or C. play the tedious voyage minigame (more below).You know that game you were playing, called Godus? I don't think you really wanted to play that game. I mean, you said you did, but I decided you were going to play lemmings. I mean, go off and play this minigame called ""Voyages"", which is essentially lemmings. If you win you get stickers! If you lose then your lemmings die and you have to wait a few hours to try again. Or you can just buy the stickers with gems. When you really just wanted to play Godus.In a previous alpha there was a pseudo-PvP feature where you'd build a small civilization head-to-head against an opponent and then get some goodies when you finished it. That was great! It was a microcosm of Godus in a self-contained bubble. But now that's gone and replaced by lemmings. Honestly, if I wanted that I'd just go play lemmings.So, Godus has jumped the shark. I'm pretty sure we all should have seen it coming, since Peter Molyneux has done this a dozen times before. But it's pretty disappointing since Godus USED TO BE FUN. And now has been ruined. Probably forever.			",211,40,4,34,49,2,54

								Time Played: 16hrsIt's a beautiful-looking game as you can see in the screenshots, and it's a beta so there's tons of functionality that's yet to be made available. I understand and could forgive that if it weren't for one detail: the controls are AWFUL!To sculpt the land you have to peel one layer, maybe 3 square cm at a time. I've recently unlocked a card that'll allow me to do 3 layers at a time with presumably a slightly larger area (I hope!), but I've not found the stickers to activate it yet (one of the bugs: the glowy effect to indicate a chest has disappeared). There's another card later on that allows me to sculpt 8 layers at a time but I'd guess that's a good 100hrs away still. Then beyond that is another card that allows 9 layers.To put that into perspective .. as far as I can tell layers go from -18 (below sea level) to +44 (above sea level) ... at least, that's the range I've seen so far. The highest I can currently build in is layer #16, so high ground has to be be levelled at least that far ... 1 layer, 3 square centimetres at a time! Landscaping is starting to get a bit tedious ...Oh! Also the further you are from sea level, the more Belief it takes to sculpt the earth, so forget trying to level that mountain until you're many hours into the game!Talking of Belief, this is generated constantly but has to be periodically harvested from your followers' buildings. This again gets fairly boring and is worse than it sounds ... since it's so costly and time-consuming to sculpt the terrain you'll find your followers sprawl further across the landscape as time passes. Right now at 16hrs it takes 10 seconds (I timed it!) to scroll from the top to the bottom of my region, but I can just about see one side to the other in a single screen. Harvesting all my Belief takes just over a minute (I have ~220 buildings atm).If they can just make the controls more friendly and less tedious they'll improve the game considerably.

								I had high hopes for this, having played Populus back in the day I had faith that a modern day interpretation would be a sure fire hit!Oh, how wrong I was. This is my current view on the game after the few patches.* Game feels like a chore, a free to play click fest... which I paid for! They have reduced the clicking, but there is way too much manual work that just isn't fun.* They stopped work on the PC to focus on mobile, leaving us with a broken mess.* Follows are broken and often just plain won't go where you want them too, having to unlock another part of the map by poitning a follower at a specific location and seeing them fumble about is depresssing.* Not much too do, and if you need to start again its really reaaly dull - which you will when they release an update that requires you to delete the save state.* kickstarter backers where giver a royal kick in the teeth when Godus went on sale when it was launched on steam early access.* Large vacums of no updates or community interaction by 22cans, then a load of promisses which are underdelivered.* Early adopters are basicly free Q&A and R&D for 22cans who are making the game up as they go along.What a mess.

								Godus is the biggest regret of a purchase I have ever made (as far as video games are concerned, at least, but it's pretty high up there for money spent on♥♥♥♥♥♥.Firstly, had I actually been aware of Molyneux's reputation, I wouldn't have touched the damn thing with a 10ft pole. His RPS interview reads like a whiny child got caught doing something bad, and when attempts to reprimand him and hold him responsible are made, he alternates between denying everything, admitting fault and trying to guilt people into feeling bad for him, and accusing the accusers of being horrible, spiteful people. This is the pattern of an emotionally manipulative jerk, and I have zero tolerance for people like that. I wish I had never handed him a cent.The game is late, broken, missing features, has no fun mechanics at all, and feels like a huge waste of time. In fact, that's the only reason I have so many hours logged (and boy do I wish I was doing some other time-wasting activity for that massive chunk of my life.), because I had nothing left to do and needed a mindless time-waster to occupy myself with while I zoned out and tried not to think very hard about anything.I really did want to like Godus. I love terraforming games (the multiplayer map from Wesnoth that has terraforming, for example, is my favorite of all the maps and gameplay modes available, and I still find myself going back to Minecraft every once in awhile for something a little more simple.) and this promises terraforming. Does it give me that? Sorta. I guess. With a catch. With several catches, actually. You can only terraform if you unlock these collectables and collect this collectable from these collectables made by those collectables, and collect those collectables to unlock more collectables and so on and so on and so on.Call it Sticker Collection Simulator: 3015 (because that's when the game will finally ♥♥♥♥ing be done, if they don't abandon it outright first) and that would be a more honest and accurate title for this complete pile of garbage.Do not buy it. Do not think hopeful thoughts about it. If you ever see Molyneux so much as sniff in the direction of a game you think you would like, run screaming as fast as your strangely shaped nerd legs can carry you in the opposite direction and pray it never finds you.

								I generally resist writing reviews for ""early access games,""  but I've seen enough of the Godus development process to decide that I don't like where it's going.  The gameplay is generally very, very, shallow, and involves endless clicking and micromanagement.  There are few, if any, strategic or consequential decisions.  Building a sprawling city tends to involve less urban planning and more just, flattening land.  In the end I don't feel the same kind of joy that I used to feel designing a sprawling, living society.  The god ""powers"" are also fairly lacking.  If you want a fairly short but extremely good looking and marvelous taste of what a great god game can look like, try Black and White 2 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								game is still early access as of time of writing, but as far as I can tell the Devs don't care what their customers have to say anyway, so I wouldn't hold my breath for improvements.all I get from this game is a lot of ""you're gonna have a lot of fun ... someday ... if you play exactly as well tell you to, doing nothing fun along the way."" and I don't think it's true at all. I don't think I'm ever going to have any fun with this game if every time there's a chance for something fun they go ""no, no, we're not doing that- go do this. then do 10 other things in exactly this order because that is the only way to play. also it's going to take a few days of waiting around before you can do those things. grab a book.""of course you could use the gem system to speed things up, but I, just like everyone else as far as I can tell, don't want to. the gem system doesn't fit in this game at all and as much as they tell me not to ""be afraid"" of  it (I'm more annoyed than afraid, but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess), I am thouroughly disinterested in using it. again, it's optional, but only if you're okay with not actually playing the game for more than a few seconds at a time between sessions of waiting.the whole game feels like a tutorial that can't be skipped and I'm left sitting there wondering if I'll ever get around to actually playing a game at some point in the Godus experience instead of just going through the motions (spoiler: I wont!).... then I get frustrated and go play a real, playable, fun game, that lets me play pretty much however I like. lately Prison Architect, Banished or Don't Starve.to close: obvious mobile game is obvious, and absolutely no fun at all. buy something that's actually worth the money.

								Godus is obviously designed as a ""free to play"" tablet game. The gameplay is about 1/10th clumsy clicking-and-dragging and 9/10ths waiting for things to pop up that you can click on. The only way to advance the game is performing a few actions, then waiting. Waiting and waiting.  You will need to leave the game running in the background on your PC for hours in order to get 5 minutes of advancement.It's meant to frustrate you into purchasing the stickers and gems that will eliminate the waiting, but the PC version doesn't have these microtransactions.  Instead, it replaces them with hours and hours of pointless waiting.According to the developers the game is ""51%"" done at this point, but unless they're going to completely redesign it, it is  a complete waste of money.

								I backed this on kickstarter thinking that it would be a PC game with a mobile port, but it turns out it was the other way around. Every system in this game requires waiting for excruciatingly long periods of time. On the iPad, a game that you play for five minutes every hour makes sense, but if you make a PC game that basically requires that you stop playing to progress, then you have failed to make a good game.Some of the more irritating aspects for the controls etc. will, I'm sure, be cleared up in updates, but the fundamental problem with Godus is that all the interesting parts of it are gated behind a long waiting period. Want to sculpt the world? Wait for your belief to accumulate.Want to expand your region? Wait for several hours for the beacon to be activated.Want to build a new structure? Wait 30 minutes for your wheat to grow so you can make a builder.This is a bad PC game, pure and simple. The ""fixes"" that have been put in to replace the micro-transactions in the iPad version actually slow your game down. The mouse controls are sluggish and unresponsive. You will find that 30% of your population has left because you had the audacity to go to bed one night rather than sit at your PC all night.Everything that is wrong with Godus is linked to the fact that it has been built for playing on an iPad. The only way that Godus can become a good PC game is if they develop the PC version independently of the iPad version. I am sorry I kickstarted this.DO NOT BUY			",1563,632,38,216,158,16,265

There is no way to restart to game, and I am stuck on the first island. This game could be good, but it needs a LOT of ironing out.			",29,6,0,0,14,0,6

								This game is the same as on iOs. but with no ability to buy gems.So game flow would be something like. Build something spend all mana, spent all gems. and then shut the game off for 1 hour and then play back again. Because of you won't have any chances to earn some resources. Not to much stones to collect them. People die fast on trip. and different building is quite expensive.			",240,64,9,39,37,1,31

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEStill in early access this game has reached a standstill. In my opinion, 22Cans is a pretty terrible game dev team. Before godus, they created 'Curiosity'; A game where you would tap on a cube to break into it, and the person who destroys the last segment, was promised a ""Life Changing"" Reward. Now over a year later the guy who won the game has still not recived his 'Life Changing' Reward. 22Cans seems to have forgotten him.

								Even if this game was on sale and dropped down to 50 cents, it wouldn't be worth it. Peter Molyneux is a scumbag that lured in people with a promising kickstarter, then used all that money to create a money-scraping iPhone/iPad version, while dumping the PC version to modders. And then, 2 years later, they release another version of the game, just to get even MORE money. This game is False Advertisement at it finest, but nobody is able to get a refund because the scumbags at 22cans used Early Access as cover. They've even admitted that 90% of, if not all, of the kickstarter promises will not be fufilled. TL;DR: 22cans is full of thieving scumbags, this game is abandonware, don't touch with a 10ft pole.

								I can't suggest this game. I have been following this game from pretty much the start and no matter what form it takes or no matter how many changes, it just isn't a good game, not at all.The game concepts seem intresting on the surface however they are poorley executed, often you can be left wondering if the developers think about a concept before putting it in, and if they even know what game they are trying to make.One example would be belief, which is your Mana or power to cast God Spells and other goodies. Houses produce is but it runs out far, far too quickly because every action, big or small, consumes it and once gone the only way to get it back is by going on some aannoying voyage which is some kind of mini-game that I HATE. They are annoying, pointless, time consuming. Or wait around twenty mins for your belief to respawn at the houses. Oh and construction takes 15 mins to build a single house in some cases, longer for becons and temples. But wait, there is a way to speed this up! You can click and hold on some of your builders to send them to construction site, oh wait this too consumes HUGE ammount of your power!! All this hampers the ability to create the world you want, how can you without enough prayer power to actually do anything?How can you build a cilivization when it takes so long to build anything?Why, if I am trying to progress this civilization through the ages am I going on pointless voyage mini-games that take me away from the civilization? Is this a long real time game like The Lost Tribes games?Or is it meant to be fast, and exciting?It seems like this game is suffering from an identity crisis one that cannot be resolved no matter how many times you press the restart button. I wanted to like this game and God (excuse the pun) knows I tried. But I am afraid that unless this game seriously starts to pull its act together intrest which is already pretty low will ne non-existent and when the game is finished, when this finished product if polished and shined, there wont be anyone intrested in playing.

								This is a review based off a conversation I had with friends, trying to explain my frustration with the game.  I played Godus again.  Nearly 3 hours of it.  The game is terrible.  All they needed to do was remake Populus with some cleaner graphics.  Instead they went a different route.  It's still not commercial yet, but I don't see how they will fix it.  Remember them saying they wanted to make it for PC and mobile?  They've added a pay-to-win system.  You can go buy jewels or diamonds or some bull like that, and trade them in for belief and stickers.  You can't do anything without belief.  You need stickers to upgrade your powers."".... so its just like a God version of every other ♥♥♥♥♥ game""Exactly.  But it's ok (I said sarcastically).  Because on the PC version you aren't allowed to buy diamonds.  Instead you get some while you explore or you can sacrifice a villager to get a diamond.  Of course, you need at least 100 belief to sacrifice a villager...  and it cost 5 diamonds to buy 1000 belief...  So you need belief, so you can sacrifice a villager to get diamonds, so you can buy belief, so you can sacrifice a villager, so you can buy belief...  It's an overwhelmingly broken system.  I mean, at least on mobile I can purchase diamonds and play the game (Please note, this is not a suggestion to allow diamonds on PC, I just want to play the game at a reasonable speed).  I haven't even gotten to the gameplay.  So besides the fact you will literally never have enough belief, stickers, or diamonds...  There's another group of people (the Entarie, or something like that) who are just too happy.  You need to convert them or destroy all of them.  I've turned their entire city into a swamp, I've nailed it with meteors, I've crushed them using ""The Finger of God.""  and they are having the time of their lives.  It seems to be some stupid system where it takes the average happiness of all your people vs the average happiness of all of theirs, but there is no way to make them unhappy.  So every hour or so 1/4 of your population leaves and swims to their side of the map.  Then you repopulate your houses, throw some meteors, and try to make a settlement before the next hour rolls by and you lose another 1/4 of your population.It's insane.  I had them down to 4 people and they were happier than my 300-ish villagers.I'm going to uninstall it and wait until the next big update comes out.  V2.2 is not good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This might end up being a decent game once it's finished, but right now it's pretty terrible, despite the fantastic animations and puzzle feel which I like. The main issue I have with it is due to the rather new addition to the game mechanics of 'The Astari', which punishes you by the hour in terms of removing population from your civilization, even when away from the game. This, in my opinion, makes that the main focus of the game and makes it not enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Edit; Well i thought I'd check in with Godus again. Its been quietly updating (rarely) as I left it installed.I'll put it this way. FROM DUST, has more strategy than this. FROM DUST has better tribal management than this. FROM DUST has better sculpting/world physics than this. FROM. DUST. That should say everything -.-Ignore my last line saying buy it on offer. Don't buy it at all, especially as two of the Godus devs have jumped ship already and its still not complete.I'll keep it short and simple because atm Godus is still early access and the review will be due to change on release.Very little has changed in regards to User Feedback on Godus. A few tweaks have been made to the basics of the game, but it is still very much an iOS ported game.Gameplay is too.. erratic. I wouldn't say it is slow, the pacing is nice. It is just that you can do things a lot quicker than the timers complete.For example, you set a few building plots going. 15-30minute timers each. So you stay in game thinking you'll find enough to do. 5 minutes later you are out of belief. When you unlock Voyages this extends the time you can spend active while waiting for timers, doing what are effectively ""sticker missions"" with a few gems thrown in as a reward. But even the voyages don't fill in the time nicely and once you've used up all your available voyages that is basically the game done with for the entire day.Sure you could quit the game and return in an hour, collect the belief accrued, tweak some more terrain, but the core actual gameplay is done with until the voyage timers complete. The mechnics are very skewed to trying to get players to become impatient and abuse the Gem Store by sacrificing villagers and buying belief packs to continue actively playing.Which is what this WHOLE reviews boil down to.Godus is 25% Active gameplay and 75% Passive gameplay (read, waiting around.)Godus dictates -when- you can play it, not the other way around. Which doesn't fit well as a casual game (You want to be able to pick up and play when you can), it doesn't fit well as a pure PC game (PC gamers generally like to remain active, passive waiting for the majority of the game implies your time can be better spent doing something else.)Sure you can multi-task have Godus running in the background, but then you don't want to play any other game because Godus wants your attention every half hour and theres only so much general browsing you can do during those timers.Avoid Godus in its current state, if they refine the timing of the game and make it significantly more active/interesting during the passive down time, then it may be worth a look.Even on release I would be inclined to say avoid it at full price. If you see it on a steam sale at 75%-80% off go for it.			",316,74,13,61,70,7,59

								Conceptually the game is a very interesting idea. It just moves way too slowly in my opinion such that I quickly lose interest. You basically have to wait 20 minutes for faith to regenerate every time you want to do something, and even then it's really limited. Very little about the game revolves around anything 'God-like' other than a very small number of powers. It just feels kind of one-dimensional. Especially with the change that sculpting the land is now a more minor component. There just isn't enough content to keep you engaged.Plus, I find the gathering of stickers a huge pain. You spend all this time working towards these achievement cards, only to realise that you need all these 'stickers' to unlock them. The stickers are a pain to collect. There simply are not enough chests.Also, every time I close the game, it continues, which is fine. However, the Astari always accumulate way too much happiness (despite the fact that I placed swamps outside their shrine, and when live in-game they tend to die in it and become unhappy each time a festival happens) and steal all of my followers - wasting all of that time you spent. So the game punishes you for not playing, which just makes you want to play even less. Plus, even if you do gain Astari followers they are completely useless - so what's even the point?There's a lot of potential here for a really great game. However, the flaws are really numerous at this point.			",2,1,0,2,11,0,3

								At it heart, this is a browser game. I should have read some more reviews before dropping 20 bucks on it, because this is basically a glorious screen saver. It tries to advertise creativity, strategy, resource management and whatnot and the designer commentaries try to convince you that there will be something you can do later. I can't imagine this will get better when I unlock more stuff, the base gameplay mechanic is wait-for-building-to-fill-up.Thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Edit; Well i thought I'd check in with Godus again. Its been quietly updating (rarely) as I left it installed.I'll put it this way. FROM DUST, has more strategy than this. FROM DUST has better tribal management than this. FROM DUST has better sculpting/world physics than this. FROM. DUST. That should say everything -.-Ignore my last line saying buy it on offer. Don't buy it at all, especially as two of the Godus devs have jumped ship already and its still not complete.I'll keep it short and simple because atm Godus is still early access and the review will be due to change on release.Very little has changed in regards to User Feedback on Godus. A few tweaks have been made to the basics of the game, but it is still very much an iOS ported game.Gameplay is too.. erratic. I wouldn't say it is slow, the pacing is nice. It is just that you can do things a lot quicker than the timers complete.For example, you set a few building plots going. 15-30minute timers each. So you stay in game thinking you'll find enough to do. 5 minutes later you are out of belief. When you unlock Voyages this extends the time you can spend active while waiting for timers, doing what are effectively ""sticker missions"" with a few gems thrown in as a reward. But even the voyages don't fill in the time nicely and once you've used up all your available voyages that is basically the game done with for the entire day.Sure you could quit the game and return in an hour, collect the belief accrued, tweak some more terrain, but the core actual gameplay is done with until the voyage timers complete. The mechnics are very skewed to trying to get players to become impatient and abuse the Gem Store by sacrificing villagers and buying belief packs to continue actively playing.Which is what this WHOLE reviews boil down to.Godus is 25% Active gameplay and 75% Passive gameplay (read, waiting around.)Godus dictates -when- you can play it, not the other way around. Which doesn't fit well as a casual game (You want to be able to pick up and play when you can), it doesn't fit well as a pure PC game (PC gamers generally like to remain active, passive waiting for the majority of the game implies your time can be better spent doing something else.)Sure you can multi-task have Godus running in the background, but then you don't want to play any other game because Godus wants your attention every half hour and theres only so much general browsing you can do during those timers.Avoid Godus in its current state, if they refine the timing of the game and make it significantly more active/interesting during the passive down time, then it may be worth a look.Even on release I would be inclined to say avoid it at full price. If you see it on a steam sale at 75%-80% off go for it.			",316,74,13,61,70,7,59

								Previously I'd given this game a thumbs up. A few months ago it was pretty fun. You terraformed terrain, expanded your civilization, and amassed belief from your minions to do cool things. But it's become apparent recently that 22cans is not designing a PC game. They're designing a mobile game, and releasing it on PC so they can charge people up front to fund the mobile version.Have you played one of those mobile games where you start out building things and everything is fun, and then by the second day everything takes 4 hours to complete and you can pay to speed it up? And then by the third day everything takes a week to complete? Yeah, that's what Godus is now. You can get ""gems"" which are a special currency that allows you to, you guessed it, speed things up.The progression system is absurd now. You progress by unlocking cards. And then buying the cards. That's right after you unlock the card you have the privilege of buying it. With stickers. That you receive when you A. buy them with gems, B. get lucky opening chests or C. play the tedious voyage minigame (more below).You know that game you were playing, called Godus? I don't think you really wanted to play that game. I mean, you said you did, but I decided you were going to play lemmings. I mean, go off and play this minigame called ""Voyages"", which is essentially lemmings. If you win you get stickers! If you lose then your lemmings die and you have to wait a few hours to try again. Or you can just buy the stickers with gems. When you really just wanted to play Godus.In a previous alpha there was a pseudo-PvP feature where you'd build a small civilization head-to-head against an opponent and then get some goodies when you finished it. That was great! It was a microcosm of Godus in a self-contained bubble. But now that's gone and replaced by lemmings. Honestly, if I wanted that I'd just go play lemmings.So, Godus has jumped the shark. I'm pretty sure we all should have seen it coming, since Peter Molyneux has done this a dozen times before. But it's pretty disappointing since Godus USED TO BE FUN. And now has been ruined. Probably forever.			",211,40,4,34,49,2,54

I was fine with the old world on Death Mountain (The huge mountain areas that surround most of the plains at the beginning). Now, the game constantly flickers, has stupid gems, which is the equalivent of  Clash of Clans gems, it crashes, it has a broken exit menu, etc. I was excited for this one and the enjoyment in it dropped from 89% to 26%. Another thing is that the game is stalemate for now. It hasn't updated since September...			",31,4,0,3,18,0,1

								This is a review based off a conversation I had with friends, trying to explain my frustration with the game.  I played Godus again.  Nearly 3 hours of it.  The game is terrible.  All they needed to do was remake Populus with some cleaner graphics.  Instead they went a different route.  It's still not commercial yet, but I don't see how they will fix it.  Remember them saying they wanted to make it for PC and mobile?  They've added a pay-to-win system.  You can go buy jewels or diamonds or some bull like that, and trade them in for belief and stickers.  You can't do anything without belief.  You need stickers to upgrade your powers."".... so its just like a God version of every other ♥♥♥♥♥ game""Exactly.  But it's ok (I said sarcastically).  Because on the PC version you aren't allowed to buy diamonds.  Instead you get some while you explore or you can sacrifice a villager to get a diamond.  Of course, you need at least 100 belief to sacrifice a villager...  and it cost 5 diamonds to buy 1000 belief...  So you need belief, so you can sacrifice a villager to get diamonds, so you can buy belief, so you can sacrifice a villager, so you can buy belief...  It's an overwhelmingly broken system.  I mean, at least on mobile I can purchase diamonds and play the game (Please note, this is not a suggestion to allow diamonds on PC, I just want to play the game at a reasonable speed).  I haven't even gotten to the gameplay.  So besides the fact you will literally never have enough belief, stickers, or diamonds...  There's another group of people (the Entarie, or something like that) who are just too happy.  You need to convert them or destroy all of them.  I've turned their entire city into a swamp, I've nailed it with meteors, I've crushed them using ""The Finger of God.""  and they are having the time of their lives.  It seems to be some stupid system where it takes the average happiness of all your people vs the average happiness of all of theirs, but there is no way to make them unhappy.  So every hour or so 1/4 of your population leaves and swims to their side of the map.  Then you repopulate your houses, throw some meteors, and try to make a settlement before the next hour rolls by and you lose another 1/4 of your population.It's insane.  I had them down to 4 people and they were happier than my 300-ish villagers.I'm going to uninstall it and wait until the next big update comes out.  V2.2 is not good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I highly recommend passing on this game. It states from a very early point that you need to spend your ""free time"" hunting chests and doing voyages. Well within the first 15 or so hours I no longer had a Voyage available (how bout archiving the old ones for those of us that just got in), and the chest respawns had slowed to a crawl or were under abodes/settlements. Further the happiness system seems shot, I beautify all of my followers and swamp the Astari, I'm at max happiness they are at 0, and yet when I turn the game back on I've lost 3 followers because they are happier than me again. And then to really top the whole thing off, there seems to have been some update this week which has burned my copy of the game. They had finally put in a new Voyage, and after beating the first level my game crashed. Now whenever I try to launch the game, either from my desktop or from Steam, I get a popup box that says its launching but keeps disappearing and reappearing; the game never launches even if I let it go for an hour. All in all I would pass on this game, if not entirely then at least until it has a full release and doesn't have aweful bugs. I wish I could get credit or a refund back because this whole ordeal has been a serious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥			",0,1,0,4,2,0,2

								There are a lot of problems with the game on both Mac and Windows after the latest update. On the Mac, it freezes when I click ""Hide Tutorials"". It also kept crashing I had to re-install it. Even with maxed out graphics settings, it looks very bad quality and pixelated, like its a very low resolution. I wish I didn't have to update it. It was fine before the update.On my partner's Windows PC, it was detected as a virus when he opened it after the update. It doesn't even start for him. It just stops responding.UPDATE: Leashing also doesn't work properly now (takes several tries to get it to work), after the 2.4 update. I don't know if hide tutorials as been fixed but the horrible graphics on large display mode has not been fixed. I miss the beautifil non-pixelated graphics. Still crashes a lot on the mac.UPDATE: I cannot play this game at all. Crashes on start up. What a waste of money for a game I cannot even play.			",255,115,15,22,30,2,34

								game is still early access as of time of writing, but as far as I can tell the Devs don't care what their customers have to say anyway, so I wouldn't hold my breath for improvements.all I get from this game is a lot of ""you're gonna have a lot of fun ... someday ... if you play exactly as well tell you to, doing nothing fun along the way."" and I don't think it's true at all. I don't think I'm ever going to have any fun with this game if every time there's a chance for something fun they go ""no, no, we're not doing that- go do this. then do 10 other things in exactly this order because that is the only way to play. also it's going to take a few days of waiting around before you can do those things. grab a book.""of course you could use the gem system to speed things up, but I, just like everyone else as far as I can tell, don't want to. the gem system doesn't fit in this game at all and as much as they tell me not to ""be afraid"" of  it (I'm more annoyed than afraid, but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess), I am thouroughly disinterested in using it. again, it's optional, but only if you're okay with not actually playing the game for more than a few seconds at a time between sessions of waiting.the whole game feels like a tutorial that can't be skipped and I'm left sitting there wondering if I'll ever get around to actually playing a game at some point in the Godus experience instead of just going through the motions (spoiler: I wont!).... then I get frustrated and go play a real, playable, fun game, that lets me play pretty much however I like. lately Prison Architect, Banished or Don't Starve.to close: obvious mobile game is obvious, and absolutely no fun at all. buy something that's actually worth the money.

								Plays like a cheap mobile game. Often extremely frustrating, and invited the player to dip in and out of gameplay with timed builds which only ought to have a place in small heavily micro-transaction based mobile games. The aesthetic is nice and there is a limited satisfaction to watching your village grow, but the gameplay itself remains extremely repetetive, dull and short.			",221,62,14,30,35,4,58

								Godus is obviously designed as a ""free to play"" tablet game. The gameplay is about 1/10th clumsy clicking-and-dragging and 9/10ths waiting for things to pop up that you can click on. The only way to advance the game is performing a few actions, then waiting. Waiting and waiting.  You will need to leave the game running in the background on your PC for hours in order to get 5 minutes of advancement.It's meant to frustrate you into purchasing the stickers and gems that will eliminate the waiting, but the PC version doesn't have these microtransactions.  Instead, it replaces them with hours and hours of pointless waiting.According to the developers the game is ""51%"" done at this point, but unless they're going to completely redesign it, it is  a complete waste of money.

								This game is the same as on iOs. but with no ability to buy gems.So game flow would be something like. Build something spend all mana, spent all gems. and then shut the game off for 1 hour and then play back again. Because of you won't have any chances to earn some resources. Not to much stones to collect them. People die fast on trip. and different building is quite expensive.			",240,64,9,39,37,1,31

								Ok I will start by saying this. I can tell the developers did try with this game, though not hard enough. I bought this game for $4.99 during a sale and honestly that is as high as you should want to pay for this game(in its current state.) It trys a bit too hard to be like all the other civilization games out there and kinda makes you have to wait for EVERYTHING.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pros: The game seems like a nice way to spend some free time, getting your followers the biggest and best villages possible, and can easily make cool looking areas.  It has possibilities as to where the over all gameplay can go. The story is a fun read if you can get all the story chests.And over all the ability to make the world to your liking is a cool aspect.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cons: The game is a slow climb and will eventually start getting a bit boring after sitting there for hours to get things done, and to top it off the bugs kinda kill the fun you ""could"" have.Its crashes ALL the time(I understand its an early access game) but when it happens every 20-30 minutes and makes your collecting harder to do its time to fix something.The gameplay is TOO repetitive. You can't get all of the story chests if you end up getting the skill that allows for 2 stickers in 1 chest.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So my final thoughts on this on this game is this. If you want to buy this game then WAIT TILL ITS DONE. The early access version of this is far too bugged and needs much more work. If you do buy this as early access then at least make sure to heed the warnings.			",51,10,0,18,15,0,2

								I have put 80+ hours into Godus and without a doubt I can say do not buy this game. While i'm still hopeful Godus will become what we were told it would be I recommend not putting money down on this sorry excuse for a game. While of course there are parts that are enjoyable,  in between spans  hours of waiting. Also the main selling point of the multiplayer at the moment is none existent. Maybe in 6-12 months everything will have turned around and the game will be great, but I only hope this because I was blinded enough by the idea of what it could be, to put the money down. Until then, if ever, keep your distance.			",58,11,0,11,14,1,22

I can only think of the other top games that I could have got instead... This game belongs in the Under £4 section and like others have said it also belongs on Facebook where the teen girls and couch potato mothers can sit and click endlessly at the screen...Its BORING...Thats all there is to it... click click click , move space for more buildings and click click click...

								Even if this game was on sale and dropped down to 50 cents, it wouldn't be worth it. Peter Molyneux is a scumbag that lured in people with a promising kickstarter, then used all that money to create a money-scraping iPhone/iPad version, while dumping the PC version to modders. And then, 2 years later, they release another version of the game, just to get even MORE money. This game is False Advertisement at it finest, but nobody is able to get a refund because the scumbags at 22cans used Early Access as cover. They've even admitted that 90% of, if not all, of the kickstarter promises will not be fufilled. TL;DR: 22cans is full of thieving scumbags, this game is abandonware, don't touch with a 10ft pole.

								Buying this game three years ago I was very hopeful to see a new take on the classic game POPULOUS, a interesting game whereby the players are able to influence their followers to beat the opposing team via terrain manipulation and other powers. I was truly excited to see the modern version of this game as I had, at the time, seen games where RTS games featured planetary conquest. After seeing this I was very excited to see what GODUS would feature and the idea of an MMO.At first I thought the game was fun in the first few sessions but as time went on it was pretty obvious in about 3 hours of gameplay I found that the gameplay was rapidly degenerating into busy work and boredom. I gave the game a few more tries and then set it aside to wait for the game to be worked on. I thought that the art work and the promises assuring, along with Molyneux being in charge it was bound to get better. Oh was I wrong.Well three years later, two major patches later,  and I can tell that nothing substantial has been added. The war mechanic was fun for about an hour and then becomes really dull. It just made the game all the more disappointing as it just reinforced the simplistic garbage that is made for phones.I also read on the game's RECENT NEWS tab that there is no release date and that it isn't clear who is still working on this project anymore as the lead developer decided to leave. The fact that the game isn't finished four years later is just unacceptable. I certainly hope the developers will finish this game in whatever state it is and move on to something else to which I wish the best of luck after all this Godus debacle.			",61,11,0,8,20,0,21

								I have played a good chunk of hours with Godus. At first, it is highly addictive. You get to discover new areas, sculpt land to live on and watch your cities grow, but thats about all you can do. The first 10 hours is just grinding and following along with the guided story after that more grinding to get to that 'just out of reach' next tech level to advance the story only to find out you need three or four more 'level-ups' before any progress can be made. I bought this game when it was first released hoping for a decent population control sim with RTS subtleties. But thats about it, horrible AI and an unrewarding leveling system that stresses grinding and saving is not fun.			",51,2,1,10,12,0,6

								Godus v2.0 still sucks. Its supposed to feel ""delicious"" now but I disagree. They definitely improved it thats for sure but its still not worth 20$. You don't have to click on every house for belief now but instead drag your mouse over all of them collecting the belief. This is better than before but if it auto-collected for you that would make it a LOT better. Then I'm not really sure who they hired but they have quite a few spelling mistakes in this game. I excuse civilisation because that is real spelling of the word but if you look on your adobe's they say they PREY to you.My followers are preying to me? I am(as dictionary.com says) an animal hunted or seized for food, especially by a carnivorous animal? If so call the police because we have a cannibalistic carnivorous animal who wants us to buy his game. The game is only worth about $5.00 on a good day. You might have more fun with a mobile game though.Edit: It's close to a YEAR later and hardly any significant progress has ben made. In fact the team has almost fallen apart by this point. A reminder why to not EVER buy early access games unless you find them enjoyable already.Edit: Its close to TWO YEARS later. Hardly any progress has been yet made. They have now scrapped Godus and are working on ""Godus Wars"".Edit: It's THREE YEARS later and the game is still garbage and now has nobody working on it. Godus Wars was a failed attempt to sweep the bad reviews of this game away.			",48,4,0,9,21,0,18

Early Access Review
								I bought this game shortly after it was announced on Steam. It has gone through many stages since then. Early on, it had alot of potential. Each major development reduced that potential however.First, development focussed on ""sculpting"". This was altering the terrain to make it pretty. Build mountains / valleys. Unfortunately, there was no benefit to this. The only time scultping was beneficial was to make ""parking lots"" so people could build houses. Trees, rocks, hills, rivers, lakes, and valleys did nothing but reduce how many houses would be built; obsticles to be removed. The game rewarded the player for making the world mundane.Second, development wanted to add in progression. It was decided to implement this by having players collect stickers from chests scattered around the world. To collect stickers, one had to find a chest that was either buried, on a hill, or hidden in trees or rocks. More forests were cleared, hills were flattened, and buried treasure dug up and the holes again filled in. Thousands of clicks for the simple task of a never-ending fetch-quest. Mandatory to progress.Third, development pushed toward collecting more IRL money. ""Gems"" were added and could be purchased to speed the now reduced belief generation, produce random stickers, or make ""sculpting"" more efficient for a short time. Spend real money to make mundane gameplay faster, not more interesting. The games slipped into the realm of ""Freemium""; but you had to buy it first.Forth, ""cities"" were added. These were ""miracles"" that clumped existing houses together. Some cities produced ""resources"". The resources could not be spent and were not produced, they simply existed once built. Instead, they worked like level requirements or keys to unlock more levels of progression. IE ""To advance, you need 4 farms"".Currently, game development is all but abandonded. I expect this to end similar to StarForged. The heads at the dev studio will declare the game finished and leave the 1/2 finished game.To those looking for a good God Game, I would suggest Black & White or Black & White 2. Not this ""Freemium"" excuse for a game.			",113,9,0,15,36,0,39

								I had a lot of fun with this game before the big ""game changing"" patch. Such a huge letdown and a failure to be quite honest. I don't even think they support this game anymore, and if they do, they don't care what their community thinks.If you can get the game on sale for maybe $1.99 go for it, otherwise don't bother.Game had such potential too, it's shameful.

								Peter Molyneaux Must Die!Virtually speaking of course.Godus was so much fun early on, and even later into then development, and then poof, it was like it was magically♥♥♥♥♥♥raped into oblivion as the red-headed stepchild of satan himself. And I dont even believe in satan.I dont know what happened to the game, or why Peter/22 cans betrayed his PC following, but it looks heavy of scam from my view across the pond. With apparently no word or open statement, I dont think this man or his company can be trusted. I would urge Steam to ban him from releasing anything EA on steam ever again, or at the very least, call for a boycott of all their products from every PC gamer on the planet. Probably wont happen, but here's hoping...There is no point in writing this review now, I am doing it more for the therapeutic effect, because every time I see Godus listed in my Steam Library a small kitten in Persia dies. 'nuff said.			",11,0,0,7,7,0,17

								This game is the reason I now don't buy Early Access games. It had great promise and looked really exciting when I got it, but the developers are incredibly slow, and it seems to be getting to the point where they'll abandon it. Features sometimes change so drastically that they reset your save files and force you to start over, but the overall level of development is still around the same as it was years ago.Not worth buying!

								game is still early access as of time of writing, but as far as I can tell the Devs don't care what their customers have to say anyway, so I wouldn't hold my breath for improvements.all I get from this game is a lot of ""you're gonna have a lot of fun ... someday ... if you play exactly as well tell you to, doing nothing fun along the way."" and I don't think it's true at all. I don't think I'm ever going to have any fun with this game if every time there's a chance for something fun they go ""no, no, we're not doing that- go do this. then do 10 other things in exactly this order because that is the only way to play. also it's going to take a few days of waiting around before you can do those things. grab a book.""of course you could use the gem system to speed things up, but I, just like everyone else as far as I can tell, don't want to. the gem system doesn't fit in this game at all and as much as they tell me not to ""be afraid"" of  it (I'm more annoyed than afraid, but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess), I am thouroughly disinterested in using it. again, it's optional, but only if you're okay with not actually playing the game for more than a few seconds at a time between sessions of waiting.the whole game feels like a tutorial that can't be skipped and I'm left sitting there wondering if I'll ever get around to actually playing a game at some point in the Godus experience instead of just going through the motions (spoiler: I wont!).... then I get frustrated and go play a real, playable, fun game, that lets me play pretty much however I like. lately Prison Architect, Banished or Don't Starve.to close: obvious mobile game is obvious, and absolutely no fun at all. buy something that's actually worth the money.

								This game is the same as on iOs. but with no ability to buy gems.So game flow would be something like. Build something spend all mana, spent all gems. and then shut the game off for 1 hour and then play back again. Because of you won't have any chances to earn some resources. Not to much stones to collect them. People die fast on trip. and different building is quite expensive.			",240,64,9,39,37,1,31

NOTE: As this game develops, I will try to revise this review from time to time. Much has changed, but some things are kind of still abysmally (and frustratingly) the same. I actually have hardly played it since the Summer 2014, due to slow development and frustrating game play, so keep that in mind when reading this review; I might be a bit emotionally biased.ReviewI currently cannot recommend this game to the casual player, or... really, any player. Not in it's current state. If you are not prepared to play an unfinished game, in any phase of development, and all that comes with participating in Beta testing, this is not the game for you. If you don't want to give feedback or suggestions about the development of the game, this isn't for you. If you want a finished product, with few bugs, and a well tested gameplay, this is absolutely not for you. If you want a game that reignites the nostalgia of the classic ""god games"" of a bygone era, then I am very sorry to inform you: This is NOT the game you're looking for. At least, not right now. Wait a bit longer, at least until the official final release - if that ever happens - and then come back and see how it's going. {I'll be repeating this mantra throughout my review}IMPORTANT NEWS: December 2014: The head of development for 22Cans (Peter Molyneux) has recently expressed disappointment in this unfinished game - essentially blaming everything from Crowdfunding, Steam Early Access, and the Player Community, instead of himself - and has astoundingly announced that the company will begin work on a new game, and basically relegating this unfinished game to the sidelines. It will, for now, be manned with a skeleton crew (of skilled designers and programmers) to moderate and develop it further; they're still working out the details, and it's all just barely in the works, but that's the latest news.The {amazing} community managers, whom were very adept at their jobs, were doing a phenomenal job in the last few months, really stepping up to the task of vastly improving communication between the company and community involvement, which was bringing some much needed life back into it. So the shocking and dubious news that things were about to change, and fast, was a bit of a surprise (even to the CM's) and that caused even more strife and turmoil amongst the already near mutinous community. As such, as it seems to go with 22Cans, the above announcement has had an apparent rippling effect; both community managers have announced they will be moving on to new positions, and a couple of the Dev team as well have also bowed out. That is very sad news, and doesn't bode well for things to come.The only shining light is the small crew that may be taking the charge going forward. It appears (from discussions) they have some realistic aspirations, seem reasonably levelheaded, and  so maybe there's hope yet. Where have they been during all this craziness? Well, all that aside, time will tell where this crazy train will take things. The small crew, mentioned above, that may actually give some solid efforts to bring this thing back on course. Here's to hoping - though I'm not holding my breath just yet. Honestly, who knows what this game is or will be? It's still definitely a mobile-like game, and is terribly slanted towards a very ""F2P"" style game - despite being sold and hyped as a crossover game - and has yet to be fully realized on the PC. It'll take a big shift in design to get it aligned with a more typical desktop platform game, and frankly this may never happen.For now, I would still highly suggest a ""Wait and See"" approach to this game. Instead, go check out something more 'feature complete' and come back perhaps later next year to see how it's going.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW “GODUS is a great idea made in a culture of openness and co-operation.""Sadly, this has not been the case. The community has not been as big a part of the project as promised, and have all but been shut out by the developer. The game itself - which has limited playability in it's unfinished state - has not had an update since October 2013, not even a single bug fix.The screenshots are so beautiful, but don't let that fool you. One only has to sit down and play it to experience in person just how mind-numbingly incomplete, and frustrating, it actually is. While I enjoyed the initial gameplay, it quickly turns into a slow paced click-fest that results in severe carpel-tunnel strain and finger stiffness - and that's only after the first hour.  Granted it's still in the ""Beta"" phase, with much still in development, it feels more like an Alpha release; still needs lots of testing and additional content. It has severely broken AI pathing, incomplete replaybility, and lacks the multiplayer capability that's promised, among other issues. This is supposedly all being fixed, but we have no idea since the devs have kept pretty closed on the details. I liked the aesthetics, the look and feel of the game-world graphics, but that is just one of the few things good about this game. There is so much potential in the idea of the game that it feels unrealized; like they just decided not to follow through with things they planned, or things suggested through the feedback support throughout alpha testing and early access. The gameplay also makes the player question their role as “God” since it seems you do everything for the “populous” except build houses; very little of the actions feel “Godlike” and feel more like micro-managing a landscaping game combined with a baby-sitting simulator. Limited gameplay, poor mechanics, and questionable player actions makes this a tough game to love – and yet it somehow still manages to make you want to love it. I'm very conflicted.Very little info about the progress has been shared with the Backers or Early Access players (read: essentially none) despite the above quote and premise of what the Kickstarter campaign promised, or what most ""Early Access"" Betas are about; constant development, testing, and community interaction. Supposedly they are working on a major re-design of the fundamental game play, but extremely little has been shared. Also, the Devs supposedly know of the mounting criticism, hostility, and over-all dissatisfaction with the entire project process, but have done very little to alleviate it or address it. We're not certain how much they're allowed to share - controlled by the powers in charge, potentially (likely) through job contracts and NDA agreements - which seems a bit oddly strict for a crowdfunded early-access game. The lack of meaningful communication from the devs themselves is understandable, if the former is true, but the marketing, management and executive PR folks are doing a poor job of informing the early-beta community; instead they avoid talking directly to us, and go on PR stunts to drum up interest in a failing enterprise. At this time in the development, I cannot say I can recommend this game as it currently stands. I DO NOT recommend this Early Access game at this time for the casual player. Time will tell if my mind will be changed by the updates. If the last four months of untested redesign is a waste, or if it will be a game-changer for the better, will be seen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL:DR; NOPE ",176,113,2,35,30,1,46

								I used to love the concept for this game however it never lived up to my expectations. There was a Lack of communication from devs, with no actual game updates in a very long time.The game itself is more unstable and has less features than when I originally brought it. It has become a barely working 'dig/sculpt for cards' game with a lack of things to do to bring me back to play more.This game had potential but it seems asthough it has been abandoned and is not worth the price in it's current state - a state in which it may not ever leave and often wont even load properly.

								I have played this game for several hours and had a lot fun doing so.But in the mean time the game is better suited to give to a friend you never want to see again.Pros:- Nice design- Gameplay although slow has its appealCons:- Very few things to do after the initial setup- Only 1 voyage although it says that it will be updated (I am already waiting for several months)- Every time an abode catches fire it can never be extinguised and it will ignite other abodes destroying everything in the proces. - Even if all houses are destroyed the fire still remains ""underground"" and will ignite other abodes placed on those spots. This meant that after several hours of gameplay you not only lose your civilization you had the patience to build but you cannot restart it using the resource you have collected.- A lot of other bugs in general, non as gamebreaking as the previous ones mentioned but there are still some ctrl + alt +del problems.It is a great game and I have had my fair share of fun. Before the previously mentioned bug appeared I would not recommend this game to any one in its current state (beta v. 2.4). If the bugs are fixed and more gameplay is created it might be worth the 19.99 euro. But currently I would not even accept it as a free gift.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have played a good chunk of hours with Godus. At first, it is highly addictive. You get to discover new areas, sculpt land to live on and watch your cities grow, but thats about all you can do. The first 10 hours is just grinding and following along with the guided story after that more grinding to get to that 'just out of reach' next tech level to advance the story only to find out you need three or four more 'level-ups' before any progress can be made. I bought this game when it was first released hoping for a decent population control sim with RTS subtleties. But thats about it, horrible AI and an unrewarding leveling system that stresses grinding and saving is not fun.			",51,2,1,10,12,0,6

Early Access Review
NOTE: As this game develops, I will try to revise this review from time to time. Much has changed, but some things are kind of still abysmally (and frustratingly) the same. I actually have hardly played it since the Summer 2014, due to slow development and frustrating game play, so keep that in mind when reading this review; I might be a bit emotionally biased.ReviewI currently cannot recommend this game to the casual player, or... really, any player. Not in it's current state. If you are not prepared to play an unfinished game, in any phase of development, and all that comes with participating in Beta testing, this is not the game for you. If you don't want to give feedback or suggestions about the development of the game, this isn't for you. If you want a finished product, with few bugs, and a well tested gameplay, this is absolutely not for you. If you want a game that reignites the nostalgia of the classic ""god games"" of a bygone era, then I am very sorry to inform you: This is NOT the game you're looking for. At least, not right now. Wait a bit longer, at least until the official final release - if that ever happens - and then come back and see how it's going. {I'll be repeating this mantra throughout my review}IMPORTANT NEWS: December 2014: The head of development for 22Cans (Peter Molyneux) has recently expressed disappointment in this unfinished game - essentially blaming everything from Crowdfunding, Steam Early Access, and the Player Community, instead of himself - and has astoundingly announced that the company will begin work on a new game, and basically relegating this unfinished game to the sidelines. It will, for now, be manned with a skeleton crew (of skilled designers and programmers) to moderate and develop it further; they're still working out the details, and it's all just barely in the works, but that's the latest news.The {amazing} community managers, whom were very adept at their jobs, were doing a phenomenal job in the last few months, really stepping up to the task of vastly improving communication between the company and community involvement, which was bringing some much needed life back into it. So the shocking and dubious news that things were about to change, and fast, was a bit of a surprise (even to the CM's) and that caused even more strife and turmoil amongst the already near mutinous community. As such, as it seems to go with 22Cans, the above announcement has had an apparent rippling effect; both community managers have announced they will be moving on to new positions, and a couple of the Dev team as well have also bowed out. That is very sad news, and doesn't bode well for things to come.The only shining light is the small crew that may be taking the charge going forward. It appears (from discussions) they have some realistic aspirations, seem reasonably levelheaded, and  so maybe there's hope yet. Where have they been during all this craziness? Well, all that aside, time will tell where this crazy train will take things. The small crew, mentioned above, that may actually give some solid efforts to bring this thing back on course. Here's to hoping - though I'm not holding my breath just yet. Honestly, who knows what this game is or will be? It's still definitely a mobile-like game, and is terribly slanted towards a very ""F2P"" style game - despite being sold and hyped as a crossover game - and has yet to be fully realized on the PC. It'll take a big shift in design to get it aligned with a more typical desktop platform game, and frankly this may never happen.For now, I would still highly suggest a ""Wait and See"" approach to this game. Instead, go check out something more 'feature complete' and come back perhaps later next year to see how it's going.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW “GODUS is a great idea made in a culture of openness and co-operation.""Sadly, this has not been the case. The community has not been as big a part of the project as promised, and have all but been shut out by the developer. The game itself - which has limited playability in it's unfinished state - has not had an update since October 2013, not even a single bug fix.The screenshots are so beautiful, but don't let that fool you. One only has to sit down and play it to experience in person just how mind-numbingly incomplete, and frustrating, it actually is. While I enjoyed the initial gameplay, it quickly turns into a slow paced click-fest that results in severe carpel-tunnel strain and finger stiffness - and that's only after the first hour.  Granted it's still in the ""Beta"" phase, with much still in development, it feels more like an Alpha release; still needs lots of testing and additional content. It has severely broken AI pathing, incomplete replaybility, and lacks the multiplayer capability that's promised, among other issues. This is supposedly all being fixed, but we have no idea since the devs have kept pretty closed on the details. I liked the aesthetics, the look and feel of the game-world graphics, but that is just one of the few things good about this game. There is so much potential in the idea of the game that it feels unrealized; like they just decided not to follow through with things they planned, or things suggested through the feedback support throughout alpha testing and early access. The gameplay also makes the player question their role as “God” since it seems you do everything for the “populous” except build houses; very little of the actions feel “Godlike” and feel more like micro-managing a landscaping game combined with a baby-sitting simulator. Limited gameplay, poor mechanics, and questionable player actions makes this a tough game to love – and yet it somehow still manages to make you want to love it. I'm very conflicted.Very little info about the progress has been shared with the Backers or Early Access players (read: essentially none) despite the above quote and premise of what the Kickstarter campaign promised, or what most ""Early Access"" Betas are about; constant development, testing, and community interaction. Supposedly they are working on a major re-design of the fundamental game play, but extremely little has been shared. Also, the Devs supposedly know of the mounting criticism, hostility, and over-all dissatisfaction with the entire project process, but have done very little to alleviate it or address it. We're not certain how much they're allowed to share - controlled by the powers in charge, potentially (likely) through job contracts and NDA agreements - which seems a bit oddly strict for a crowdfunded early-access game. The lack of meaningful communication from the devs themselves is understandable, if the former is true, but the marketing, management and executive PR folks are doing a poor job of informing the early-beta community; instead they avoid talking directly to us, and go on PR stunts to drum up interest in a failing enterprise. At this time in the development, I cannot say I can recommend this game as it currently stands. I DO NOT recommend this Early Access game at this time for the casual player. Time will tell if my mind will be changed by the updates. If the last four months of untested redesign is a waste, or if it will be a game-changer for the better, will be seen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL:DR; NOPE ",176,113,2,35,30,1,46

On steamcommunity.com is a post, how to fix that problem by copying some files into a folder which not exists on my OS. However, I not recommend to buy this game.

								In the game Godus you are a God to a, at the start, a small group of people. So far I have not gone as far as the game could so far. The game is okay it runs on real time which is not so bad. The game does have a very lack of updates and is currently somewhat boring.  I wouldn't recommend getting this game until it is fully relased (if ever). If you get be prepared to wait a while for an update and for the villagers to  build, explore, and craft shrines. The NPC's are okay in the mini-temple games.			",93,27,0,19,18,3,20

								Godus is primarily developed as a mobile Pay-to-Win game making use of waiting mechanics and shallow tap and drag based controls. The Steam release for PC/Mac adds no further strategy or interest. Bearing in mind that Godus has been in development for over a year, and that no major features have been added in the last six months, it's hard to justify what 22Cans have been doing, or plan to do in the future with the PC Port.I recommend avoiding this title, at least until it comes out of Early Access or shows some progress towards improving the PC version. At this moment, it's a dull experience, lacking in game play, and there's not much enjoyment to be had.			",15,5,0,1,3,0,2

								By reading the description of the game, and by watching the trailers I was tempted to buy the game. However I have been playing the game for 6-7 hours, and still haven't exceeded the point where you still look for cards in the dirt, and contest a rather easy AI. The controls are rather dull as well. I hope they set this game right, because it has a lot of potential. Until then, you should spend your money on something else.			",28,1,1,3,6,1,4

								Godus. Looks and sounds a lot like the old classic ""Populus"", but it's incomplete to the point of being a proof of concept rather than something anyone should be forking out money for at this stage. There is no clear plot or purpose and the novelty of the terrain sculpting soon wears off.Do yourself a favour - buy Banished instead. Revisit Godus and consider paying money for it IF the devs can get it together (not looking good right now).			",53,10,0,2,14,0,15

								I seriously feel bad for my coworker who actually purchased this game (I am on his Friends and Family). I have often facetiously accused Bethesda of not having a QA team in Elder Scrolls games, but this is the real deal when it comes to bug riddled death traps. I will frequently get progression blocked because they ask for me to do something (like farming) before they gave me the technology to do so. Luckily it reassesses my ability to do what it asked for on game startup. Will need to reboot my computer to kill off lingering processes that do not show up on task manager (the game freezes every time I quit through the game menu and after force closing to escape the freeze, the music of the game will play until the machine shuts down, for example). I could probably have programmed a better game in a week with no programming knowledge than they have in the year+ they have been at it (the game was 40% complete when my coworker purchased the game last year and it is now 49.5% done, so they obviously just wanted to pocket the money and run with zero effort put into the game). No self respecting company would let anyone outside of QA see this disaster. If you buy this, I guarantee you will be disappointed.			",39,5,0,7,0,0,4

								    (HUGE RANT ALERT, SKIP THIS [paragraph?] TO GET WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR)I have had this game from the moment it was put on steam.  Please steam, take this pathetic piece of **** off the market. It is a ♥♥♥♥ing iphone game for PC (20$ when I bought it). Litterally. You have to wait hours for buildings to build, those buildings produce belief which is required to build more buildings. There is no purpose to this game nor is it remotley fun. You hunt the hell out of some chests to build a ""better"" house, but you can't upgrade your previous 300 houses to the better house. So you end up just covering Saudi Arabia before it became a desert with ugly♥♥♥♥♥tents, then right next to it you have 40 story masions with massive statues celebrating how great a god you are. Very Social Class. Much disapoint. pathetic path finding. Get godus for free on iOS and play the same game. (might be 2.99$ now, I got it free and played the same game.) This game is pathetic, has no purpose. Your godly powers include- shaping the land, shaping the land for another 3 hours, logging in every day in 4 hour intervals to collect belief to shape the land more. Oh and when you don't want to wait hours for your pathetic slobs to build a 400 ft. statue of you, instead buy their second currency to Clash Of Clans rush that B. Its basically a f2p game that your pay to for. It says I have 3.9 hours, in reality I have actually clocked in 17.3 hours. (Steam gets weird with stats on your new computer :/ )    Its an iPhone game on steam. If you want to play it, download it on your phone. Its cheaper, and seems more optimized. It contains all of the same features. I have played 17.3 hours of this game, you could consider me a Gamma Tester, (Pre-Alpha Alpha) It has been the same pathetic trash since it started with no real features added. Just aesthetics and bug fixes.                                                                             GamePlay   Wait hours for your buildings to build, buy the currency with US dollar to rush your little scrubs. Spend 4/5 of the game shaping the land for your people and the other 1/5 shaping more for this game's pathfinding. Experince why clash of clans isn't on steam. Chest hunter simulator, spend more then your willing to constantly shape the land to find chest containing cards that you can buy with US dollars. Then use those cards to unlock another card that unlocks better buildings that you can't use until you shape the land more.                                                                                 The GoodGives you plenty of time to masturbate while your steam friends think that your playing a single player game. Looks nice under steam's uninstalled list. Has steam workshop that completely screws the game into a playable experince.  Cheaper and better on iOS market.                                                                               The BadEverything. The game itself. Pathfinding. No objective in the game. Not fun. Costs money to play. Not unique.  Will never come out of testing stage. Chest hunting. Wait for belief to be produced. Every update start over your entire world. Is an iPhone game for PC. ",132,15,0,13,25,0,18

								I wanted to like Godus. Honestly, I did. In its current state, however, it is extremely repetitive and dull. There is little customization, since not only is terraforming the land a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but your communities seems to thrive best on flat as possible land. If you want to progress, your goal is to make things as low and flat as possible, since you want to unearth trinkets to make more (ultimately useless) things, such as bigger houses that don't change gameplay in any way. Also, the only way to DO anything is to click every single house multiple times to get your creation points. Without these points, you can do nothing. There is no point to the clicking and having it autofill would make it go from abysmal to just bad, but nonetheless, let the pointless clicking commence! It is the only way you'll play it for more than an hour, anyhow. Filler at its worst. I know it's just beta right now, but even for an alpha this would be pretty pathetic. Where exactly is the 'game'? Coupled witht he fact that the devs don't seem to be actively letting the public know what's going on or updating this title, it is a very depressing turn of events and my expectations for Godus are hopeful, but realistically as low and flat as the lands that I am required to build ad infinitum.

								I reviewed this game two updates ago so I felt it was time to re-evaluate and review this game again. In my previous review, I said not to buy this game until it's been fully released. Now, I'm telling you not to buy this game at all. The recent updates have made this version of the game some where hybrid crossbreed with the mobile version. The microtransaction element is there, the long wait times for building projects is there. Between those aspects and the godawful voiceover ""tutorial"", this game is now nearly unplayable. I have builders building houses and I have to wait EIGHTEEN MINUTES for them to finish. That's absolutely ridiculous. This is a PC game, guys, not a mobile game. If you're going to make two versions then either make them vary by platform or just be honest with us and only release it for mobile. Ambitious game, AWFUL execution.			",118,43,1,17,37,3,25

								""You just expand, unlock and explore. Its pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone""Since my last review, the game finally updated. My last review was fairly aggressive purely because the game was unplayable for me, therefore was absolutely useless while I couldn't play it. Now, it works again, so I feel I can review this once more.Firstly, this game is not for everyone. Many state this is a zen like experience, I see it as a demi-phone game. Theres lots of clicking, regardless if they say they improved it. A positive thing is they removed the Gems, which led to a incompleted store to buy gems with real money. Even though, you payed around $20 for the game. The games graphics are simplistic and clean, but doesn't look terrible, and there really isn't any music, just some sound effects.There really isn't much to this game to tell you the truth. I guess the timeline still has stuff I haven't seen but they don't seem to change the gameplay to much anyway, You just expand, unlock and explore. Its pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone, I don't mind this game to much, but I tend to have more free time than the average gamer.Will also note that the game seems to still crash after about an hour of constant gameplay.3/10			",387,86,8,53,61,1,57

								This is nothing more than an overhyped mobile clicking app. Theres no real gameplay mechanic other than clicking orbs over houses. If you're looking for a tedious repetitive task that you have to perform for hours on end with little or no tangible results to show for it, I'd thouroughly recommend getting a remedial office job instead, at least that way you wont be out of pocket.I may have been a bit too positive about this game in the review so far...It's probably best to look at it this way; Buying this game would be the equivalent of getting naked and paying £15 to be covered in honey and then have a bee's nest thrown at you all whilst standing on burning coals and being hit in the face with various large peices of furniture, such as, but not limited to, sinks, lamps, chairs, desks, and bedside tables. If you're a masochist and this has sounded just like your cup of tea, you'd still be wrong, for while this is agonisingly dull, it's still just that, dull. It evokes no emotion other than sheer boredom and apathy, so in short, the only way you could enjoy this game is if you either did not have the mental capacity to press more than one button, or you were in a coma...or dead. In fact, I think people with the mental capacity to only press one button, would slip into a coma playing this game, and people in a coma would die.In short, there should be a health warning attached to this game [ Will cause premature death ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The idea and concept behind this game are wonderful, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Ill admit I havent played this game a tremendous amount. The game starts out a bit slow, which is fine, but must be mentioned as this could turn off some. As you will see others say, this game has mouse clicking that could only be rivaled by minesweeper. The Double click option to add or subtract land an area is novel, but doesn't work all the time ending in a decent amount of wasted faith. Whats faith you may ask, its what you get when you have more people or destroy rocks/trees. You need it to make any moves which is what can slow down the game substantially. Make too many moves and you better get a recliner and go take a bio break because its going to be a bit before you make moves again. I have no problems with a slow paced game, but at times watching a snail race would be more exciting than waiting for your villagers to have faith bubbles show up before you can move again.The multiplayer is a joke and even more minesweeper like. The whole premise is that you need to claim more land (ie have more houses down) to have the higher population count before the time runs out. You are matched up to some other random person and the battle begins. multiplayer is a pointless extra which doesn't add anything to the game imo. A co-op mode would have been a tremendous amount more fun as long as it didnt have to be turn based.I know its still in development, but its updates are soo few and far between its almost a slap in the face to their fans. By comparison, go look how fast Castle Story and Craft the World fix bugs and how often they patch and update their games. Those are phenomenal games still in development by separate companies who both seem to appreciate their fans and genuinely want to give them the best gaming experience possible.So, whats it worth? $20 USD - not a chance. Honestly with the way things are going this game is more of a $5USD as it does provide some entertainment, but it has flaws on almost every edge. I hope the devs eventually step up and improve this game, but as it stands its a sincere flop.			",73,11,0,6,16,0,8

								Even after that big patch, this game is still a disapointment. Mechanics of the game seem good at first, then become a burden. Prepare your clicks, because you're gonna do a lot of them. The progression system, based mats you find in chests, is flawed. And it brings the dreaded shadow of micro transaction system. Devs are saying there won't be any, but the game is pretty much designed to make it feel like a necessity. What you will find in this game is half waiting, half clicking. Click to get belief (res for doing things in the world), click to send builders, click to sculpt the world. Get yourself some patience, a strong mouse, and dive into the emptiness of this game.

								There have been many complaints regarding the clickity click nature of this game. I used to handle this by using a macro that clicked really fast. This allowed me to sculpt the landscape with relative ease, levelling entire mountains!The update that has been rolled out has made that imposisble, now most interaction requires dragging. Furthermore I have had various freezes (where I could not see anything anymore except ocean) and gotten stuck in tutorials because I did not know what to do or how to do it, without hints on the screen, or because I was whisked away to a 'lost followed' unable to complete the tutorial.Tl;DR wasn't too bad but I could work around it, but now it got worse and I can no longer work around it. As a programmer I am a god, but this game is taking away my ability and will to excercise it within the- apparently now more restiricted- confines Godus.			",121,23,0,16,28,0,14

								All things considered, this game is currently a steaming pile of garbage.  I've seen worse games recover, but as it stands, this is hardly a proper beta.  Plays more like an alpha, and I believe there's some secret area for Kickstarter backers to 'communicate' with the developers.  I would save your money and wait until it's fleshed out, because it seems like they're misinterpretting all the feedback anyways.It has enormous potential, but I fear it will end up being not fun because of certain mechanics that are stubbornly being forced into the game.  So much potential, such garbage.			",183,26,1,25,13,0,33

								Game plays more like Curiosity than Black & White, or any other god game for that matter.  Click the ground, keep clicking the ground, then click the ground some more.  As a powerful deity, your abilities are limited to barely more than that of a typical bulldozer and the secret to winning seems to be nothing more than digging up treasure chests and flattening the ground.  Game length is artificially lengthened by timers everywhere.  Follower starts building a house?  Minute and a half before it's finished.  Waiting for a house to spawn a new follower?  Watch the countdown clock.  These aren't even progress meters or anything else that might make sense, they are literal timers ticking away the seconds.  I'm fine and dandy with stuff taking time to complete, but compared to other games with building involved, Godus crawls at a snail's pace.Maybe there will be some actual gameplay in the final release, but for now, skip this and play Black & White if you have a hankering to rule over a society.

								The game has a lot of potential, but is such a dissapointment. This plays like a pay to play game, You have to wait for followers to generate beleif before you can do anything and it takes way to long.  Beleif is what allows you to alter the ladnscape and bassically every task in the game. Its riduclous. It was said best when it was described as watching ""moss grow"". You wait to get beleif for hours, you wait to for new houses to be built for around 20 minutes. All i feel like I do in this game is wait. I just want to play.I buy games on PC so I don't feel like i'm playing some pay to play game for my iPhone or Android. Hope they make some big changes, its just not worth playing for now.

And instead of changing anything to what people have been telling them to do, they installed the Developer Commentaries, which is basically some guy moaning on about how much he likes it.

								After 80 minutes into the game, I made a little headway in terms of progression, got my guys to a decent population number and made a bit of general progress. However my progress is halted by the fact getting resources to unlock cards and sticker packs is hard if you don't spend gems. Gems are a finite resource. You can't exactly grind a bit and come back to spend them. Gems are the microtransactions in the mobile version. Thankfully they aren't here, but they're also hard to actually get.Anyways, 80 minutes in, the game crashed out, and I was genuinely apathetic as to whether or not my game was saved - whether or not it'd be there when I went back. I just didn't care. Couldn't give a toss. I felt no sense of achievement for what I'd done and using the controls and UI was more of a fight than anything else.What a waste of time. Still, at least I got it while it was on sale on Humble, so some of the money I spent on it went to charity.			",49,14,2,3,18,0,7

								Honestly I just don't see the point of this game. It's awful at explaining progression and doesn't seem to have any strong overarching theme or plot. The currency and action systems are incredily vague and your actions seem relatively limited to land sculpting. At the same time, your accomplishments are nearly impossible to quantify in a satisfactory manner. There doesn't seem to be any challenge except to your patience. Simply put, I heavily regret buying this game.			",10,7,0,1,7,0,8

								Godus is primarily developed as a mobile Pay-to-Win game making use of waiting mechanics and shallow tap and drag based controls. The Steam release for PC/Mac adds no further strategy or interest. Bearing in mind that Godus has been in development for over a year, and that no major features have been added in the last six months, it's hard to justify what 22Cans have been doing, or plan to do in the future with the PC Port.I recommend avoiding this title, at least until it comes out of Early Access or shows some progress towards improving the PC version. At this moment, it's a dull experience, lacking in game play, and there's not much enjoyment to be had.			",15,5,0,1,3,0,2

								I seriously feel bad for my coworker who actually purchased this game (I am on his Friends and Family). I have often facetiously accused Bethesda of not having a QA team in Elder Scrolls games, but this is the real deal when it comes to bug riddled death traps. I will frequently get progression blocked because they ask for me to do something (like farming) before they gave me the technology to do so. Luckily it reassesses my ability to do what it asked for on game startup. Will need to reboot my computer to kill off lingering processes that do not show up on task manager (the game freezes every time I quit through the game menu and after force closing to escape the freeze, the music of the game will play until the machine shuts down, for example). I could probably have programmed a better game in a week with no programming knowledge than they have in the year+ they have been at it (the game was 40% complete when my coworker purchased the game last year and it is now 49.5% done, so they obviously just wanted to pocket the money and run with zero effort put into the game). No self respecting company would let anyone outside of QA see this disaster. If you buy this, I guarantee you will be disappointed.			",39,5,0,7,0,0,4

								The idea is there but the exuction is not. Like the other reviews have said, it feels like a Facebook game more than anything else. I do not have a problem for the belief system, but the time it takes it to gather belief is a little slow considerin that this is a game that is not a Facebook game. The Terra forming works well. But that costs belief, and in order to get more belief you have to advance and expand your population. BUT in order to that you need belief to expand the land, etc. It is a cycle of things  and if you run out of belief... then well you have to wait a little while to progress. And there is nothing you can really do in the game to pass the time.			",28,5,0,5,3,1,4

								This is by far the most boring game in my library. It one of those purchases you regret everytime you see it, and I got it on sale.    This game consists of clicking, clicking, and more clicking.  The resource in this game is belief, which appears in pink bubbles over houses.  You can never get enough belief, in fact you will have to click all the houses every couple minutes to get more.  There is one feature, a town statue, that lets you click one object to collect all the belief in one area, but after about the 4th town you place it becomes near impossible to place anymore as you cannot obtain gems to do so.  Just don't buy this game, it is the most boring, and yet frustrating thing I have ever played.			",204,24,7,22,25,1,13

								This is nothing more than an overhyped mobile clicking app. Theres no real gameplay mechanic other than clicking orbs over houses. If you're looking for a tedious repetitive task that you have to perform for hours on end with little or no tangible results to show for it, I'd thouroughly recommend getting a remedial office job instead, at least that way you wont be out of pocket.I may have been a bit too positive about this game in the review so far...It's probably best to look at it this way; Buying this game would be the equivalent of getting naked and paying £15 to be covered in honey and then have a bee's nest thrown at you all whilst standing on burning coals and being hit in the face with various large peices of furniture, such as, but not limited to, sinks, lamps, chairs, desks, and bedside tables. If you're a masochist and this has sounded just like your cup of tea, you'd still be wrong, for while this is agonisingly dull, it's still just that, dull. It evokes no emotion other than sheer boredom and apathy, so in short, the only way you could enjoy this game is if you either did not have the mental capacity to press more than one button, or you were in a coma...or dead. In fact, I think people with the mental capacity to only press one button, would slip into a coma playing this game, and people in a coma would die.In short, there should be a health warning attached to this game [ Will cause premature death ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The idea and concept behind this game are wonderful, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Ill admit I havent played this game a tremendous amount. The game starts out a bit slow, which is fine, but must be mentioned as this could turn off some. As you will see others say, this game has mouse clicking that could only be rivaled by minesweeper. The Double click option to add or subtract land an area is novel, but doesn't work all the time ending in a decent amount of wasted faith. Whats faith you may ask, its what you get when you have more people or destroy rocks/trees. You need it to make any moves which is what can slow down the game substantially. Make too many moves and you better get a recliner and go take a bio break because its going to be a bit before you make moves again. I have no problems with a slow paced game, but at times watching a snail race would be more exciting than waiting for your villagers to have faith bubbles show up before you can move again.The multiplayer is a joke and even more minesweeper like. The whole premise is that you need to claim more land (ie have more houses down) to have the higher population count before the time runs out. You are matched up to some other random person and the battle begins. multiplayer is a pointless extra which doesn't add anything to the game imo. A co-op mode would have been a tremendous amount more fun as long as it didnt have to be turn based.I know its still in development, but its updates are soo few and far between its almost a slap in the face to their fans. By comparison, go look how fast Castle Story and Craft the World fix bugs and how often they patch and update their games. Those are phenomenal games still in development by separate companies who both seem to appreciate their fans and genuinely want to give them the best gaming experience possible.So, whats it worth? $20 USD - not a chance. Honestly with the way things are going this game is more of a $5USD as it does provide some entertainment, but it has flaws on almost every edge. I hope the devs eventually step up and improve this game, but as it stands its a sincere flop.			",73,11,0,6,16,0,8

								Even after that big patch, this game is still a disapointment. Mechanics of the game seem good at first, then become a burden. Prepare your clicks, because you're gonna do a lot of them. The progression system, based mats you find in chests, is flawed. And it brings the dreaded shadow of micro transaction system. Devs are saying there won't be any, but the game is pretty much designed to make it feel like a necessity. What you will find in this game is half waiting, half clicking. Click to get belief (res for doing things in the world), click to send builders, click to sculpt the world. Get yourself some patience, a strong mouse, and dive into the emptiness of this game.

								There have been many complaints regarding the clickity click nature of this game. I used to handle this by using a macro that clicked really fast. This allowed me to sculpt the landscape with relative ease, levelling entire mountains!The update that has been rolled out has made that imposisble, now most interaction requires dragging. Furthermore I have had various freezes (where I could not see anything anymore except ocean) and gotten stuck in tutorials because I did not know what to do or how to do it, without hints on the screen, or because I was whisked away to a 'lost followed' unable to complete the tutorial.Tl;DR wasn't too bad but I could work around it, but now it got worse and I can no longer work around it. As a programmer I am a god, but this game is taking away my ability and will to excercise it within the- apparently now more restiricted- confines Godus.			",121,23,0,16,28,0,14

								All things considered, this game is currently a steaming pile of garbage.  I've seen worse games recover, but as it stands, this is hardly a proper beta.  Plays more like an alpha, and I believe there's some secret area for Kickstarter backers to 'communicate' with the developers.  I would save your money and wait until it's fleshed out, because it seems like they're misinterpretting all the feedback anyways.It has enormous potential, but I fear it will end up being not fun because of certain mechanics that are stubbornly being forced into the game.  So much potential, such garbage.			",183,26,1,25,13,0,33

								Game plays more like Curiosity than Black & White, or any other god game for that matter.  Click the ground, keep clicking the ground, then click the ground some more.  As a powerful deity, your abilities are limited to barely more than that of a typical bulldozer and the secret to winning seems to be nothing more than digging up treasure chests and flattening the ground.  Game length is artificially lengthened by timers everywhere.  Follower starts building a house?  Minute and a half before it's finished.  Waiting for a house to spawn a new follower?  Watch the countdown clock.  These aren't even progress meters or anything else that might make sense, they are literal timers ticking away the seconds.  I'm fine and dandy with stuff taking time to complete, but compared to other games with building involved, Godus crawls at a snail's pace.Maybe there will be some actual gameplay in the final release, but for now, skip this and play Black & White if you have a hankering to rule over a society.

								After 80 minutes into the game, I made a little headway in terms of progression, got my guys to a decent population number and made a bit of general progress. However my progress is halted by the fact getting resources to unlock cards and sticker packs is hard if you don't spend gems. Gems are a finite resource. You can't exactly grind a bit and come back to spend them. Gems are the microtransactions in the mobile version. Thankfully they aren't here, but they're also hard to actually get.Anyways, 80 minutes in, the game crashed out, and I was genuinely apathetic as to whether or not my game was saved - whether or not it'd be there when I went back. I just didn't care. Couldn't give a toss. I felt no sense of achievement for what I'd done and using the controls and UI was more of a fight than anything else.What a waste of time. Still, at least I got it while it was on sale on Humble, so some of the money I spent on it went to charity.			",49,14,2,3,18,0,7

								Bought this a long time ago and they have made a mediocre game with possibilities now a failure. 15min wait times to build basic structures, waiting times for faith. I understand the game makers are now trying to also make this into a mobile game, but I am guessing they fail to see that when one is playing a PC game they are looking for constant active stimulation and not just slap a couple clicks down and then have to wait 30mins to do anything else.Would this be a fun mobile game? Maybe.Would this be a fun free flash browser game? Sure.An actualy PC game? No.			",16,2,0,3,12,0,5

								This game started out as a PC/Mac game, but now it's a mobile which isn't an issue by itself. The issue comes from when the developer start to make it another one of those ""Oh, you want to do something more then like one thing a day after the start then buy gems from us."" Granted you do not have to do that if you buy it on the PC version but when a large amount of your player base which is the ones who have helped you get off the ground tell you something and your just like meh, I do what I want. That's also where other issues come up, but it's ok make another cookie cutter pay to play game that you just used early access on steam to get the money to sustain yourself until you get to moble to make your real money. This started out as a really cool game, but now it's turned into this cookie cutter muck. Not worth the ten dollars that I spent almost over half a year ago. I wouldn't even play this game if it was free, no matter what the platform that I would be playing on it would be.			",211,29,2,40,42,1,33

So now you play for 20min and than you have to wait... wait... wait... nothing to do. 25Minutes for the 4th house to build. Yeah I could spend gems but I am one of those messi guys who saves up for bad times. The idea of this game looks nice but Can22 doesnt seem able to make a good game out of it. Right now it is more like stupid work... or nothing to do at all. I will test it again since I hope they get something good done any time soon. So far: DONT BUY!			",59,0,0,8,10,0,11

								This is by far the most boring game in my library. It one of those purchases you regret everytime you see it, and I got it on sale.    This game consists of clicking, clicking, and more clicking.  The resource in this game is belief, which appears in pink bubbles over houses.  You can never get enough belief, in fact you will have to click all the houses every couple minutes to get more.  There is one feature, a town statue, that lets you click one object to collect all the belief in one area, but after about the 4th town you place it becomes near impossible to place anymore as you cannot obtain gems to do so.  Just don't buy this game, it is the most boring, and yet frustrating thing I have ever played.			",204,24,7,22,25,1,13

								I wanted to like Godus. Honestly, I did. In its current state, however, it is extremely repetitive and dull. There is little customization, since not only is terraforming the land a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but your communities seems to thrive best on flat as possible land. If you want to progress, your goal is to make things as low and flat as possible, since you want to unearth trinkets to make more (ultimately useless) things, such as bigger houses that don't change gameplay in any way. Also, the only way to DO anything is to click every single house multiple times to get your creation points. Without these points, you can do nothing. There is no point to the clicking and having it autofill would make it go from abysmal to just bad, but nonetheless, let the pointless clicking commence! It is the only way you'll play it for more than an hour, anyhow. Filler at its worst. I know it's just beta right now, but even for an alpha this would be pretty pathetic. Where exactly is the 'game'? Coupled witht he fact that the devs don't seem to be actively letting the public know what's going on or updating this title, it is a very depressing turn of events and my expectations for Godus are hopeful, but realistically as low and flat as the lands that I am required to build ad infinitum.

								I reviewed this game two updates ago so I felt it was time to re-evaluate and review this game again. In my previous review, I said not to buy this game until it's been fully released. Now, I'm telling you not to buy this game at all. The recent updates have made this version of the game some where hybrid crossbreed with the mobile version. The microtransaction element is there, the long wait times for building projects is there. Between those aspects and the godawful voiceover ""tutorial"", this game is now nearly unplayable. I have builders building houses and I have to wait EIGHTEEN MINUTES for them to finish. That's absolutely ridiculous. This is a PC game, guys, not a mobile game. If you're going to make two versions then either make them vary by platform or just be honest with us and only release it for mobile. Ambitious game, AWFUL execution.			",118,43,1,17,37,3,25

								""You just expand, unlock and explore. Its pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone""Since my last review, the game finally updated. My last review was fairly aggressive purely because the game was unplayable for me, therefore was absolutely useless while I couldn't play it. Now, it works again, so I feel I can review this once more.Firstly, this game is not for everyone. Many state this is a zen like experience, I see it as a demi-phone game. Theres lots of clicking, regardless if they say they improved it. A positive thing is they removed the Gems, which led to a incompleted store to buy gems with real money. Even though, you payed around $20 for the game. The games graphics are simplistic and clean, but doesn't look terrible, and there really isn't any music, just some sound effects.There really isn't much to this game to tell you the truth. I guess the timeline still has stuff I haven't seen but they don't seem to change the gameplay to much anyway, You just expand, unlock and explore. Its pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone, I don't mind this game to much, but I tend to have more free time than the average gamer.Will also note that the game seems to still crash after about an hour of constant gameplay.3/10			",387,86,8,53,61,1,57

In fact, I think people with the mental capacity to only press one button, would slip into a coma playing this game, and people in a coma would die.In short, there should be a health warning attached to this game [ Will cause premature death ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								The idea and concept behind this game are wonderful, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Ill admit I havent played this game a tremendous amount. The game starts out a bit slow, which is fine, but must be mentioned as this could turn off some. As you will see others say, this game has mouse clicking that could only be rivaled by minesweeper. The Double click option to add or subtract land an area is novel, but doesn't work all the time ending in a decent amount of wasted faith. Whats faith you may ask, its what you get when you have more people or destroy rocks/trees. You need it to make any moves which is what can slow down the game substantially. Make too many moves and you better get a recliner and go take a bio break because its going to be a bit before you make moves again. I have no problems with a slow paced game, but at times watching a snail race would be more exciting than waiting for your villagers to have faith bubbles show up before you can move again.The multiplayer is a joke and even more minesweeper like. The whole premise is that you need to claim more land (ie have more houses down) to have the higher population count before the time runs out. You are matched up to some other random person and the battle begins. multiplayer is a pointless extra which doesn't add anything to the game imo. A co-op mode would have been a tremendous amount more fun as long as it didnt have to be turn based.I know its still in development, but its updates are soo few and far between its almost a slap in the face to their fans. By comparison, go look how fast Castle Story and Craft the World fix bugs and how often they patch and update their games. Those are phenomenal games still in development by separate companies who both seem to appreciate their fans and genuinely want to give them the best gaming experience possible.So, whats it worth? $20 USD - not a chance. Honestly with the way things are going this game is more of a $5USD as it does provide some entertainment, but it has flaws on almost every edge. I hope the devs eventually step up and improve this game, but as it stands its a sincere flop.			",73,11,0,6,16,0,8

								Even after that big patch, this game is still a disapointment. Mechanics of the game seem good at first, then become a burden. Prepare your clicks, because you're gonna do a lot of them. The progression system, based mats you find in chests, is flawed. And it brings the dreaded shadow of micro transaction system. Devs are saying there won't be any, but the game is pretty much designed to make it feel like a necessity. What you will find in this game is half waiting, half clicking. Click to get belief (res for doing things in the world), click to send builders, click to sculpt the world. Get yourself some patience, a strong mouse, and dive into the emptiness of this game.

								There have been many complaints regarding the clickity click nature of this game. I used to handle this by using a macro that clicked really fast. This allowed me to sculpt the landscape with relative ease, levelling entire mountains!The update that has been rolled out has made that imposisble, now most interaction requires dragging. Furthermore I have had various freezes (where I could not see anything anymore except ocean) and gotten stuck in tutorials because I did not know what to do or how to do it, without hints on the screen, or because I was whisked away to a 'lost followed' unable to complete the tutorial.Tl;DR wasn't too bad but I could work around it, but now it got worse and I can no longer work around it. As a programmer I am a god, but this game is taking away my ability and will to excercise it within the- apparently now more restiricted- confines Godus.			",121,23,0,16,28,0,14

								All things considered, this game is currently a steaming pile of garbage.  I've seen worse games recover, but as it stands, this is hardly a proper beta.  Plays more like an alpha, and I believe there's some secret area for Kickstarter backers to 'communicate' with the developers.  I would save your money and wait until it's fleshed out, because it seems like they're misinterpretting all the feedback anyways.It has enormous potential, but I fear it will end up being not fun because of certain mechanics that are stubbornly being forced into the game.  So much potential, such garbage.			",183,26,1,25,13,0,33

								Game plays more like Curiosity than Black & White, or any other god game for that matter.  Click the ground, keep clicking the ground, then click the ground some more.  As a powerful deity, your abilities are limited to barely more than that of a typical bulldozer and the secret to winning seems to be nothing more than digging up treasure chests and flattening the ground.  Game length is artificially lengthened by timers everywhere.  Follower starts building a house?  Minute and a half before it's finished.  Waiting for a house to spawn a new follower?  Watch the countdown clock.  These aren't even progress meters or anything else that might make sense, they are literal timers ticking away the seconds.  I'm fine and dandy with stuff taking time to complete, but compared to other games with building involved, Godus crawls at a snail's pace.Maybe there will be some actual gameplay in the final release, but for now, skip this and play Black & White if you have a hankering to rule over a society.

								I seriously feel bad for my coworker who actually purchased this game (I am on his Friends and Family). I have often facetiously accused Bethesda of not having a QA team in Elder Scrolls games, but this is the real deal when it comes to bug riddled death traps. I will frequently get progression blocked because they ask for me to do something (like farming) before they gave me the technology to do so. Luckily it reassesses my ability to do what it asked for on game startup. Will need to reboot my computer to kill off lingering processes that do not show up on task manager (the game freezes every time I quit through the game menu and after force closing to escape the freeze, the music of the game will play until the machine shuts down, for example). I could probably have programmed a better game in a week with no programming knowledge than they have in the year+ they have been at it (the game was 40% complete when my coworker purchased the game last year and it is now 49.5% done, so they obviously just wanted to pocket the money and run with zero effort put into the game). No self respecting company would let anyone outside of QA see this disaster. If you buy this, I guarantee you will be disappointed.			",39,5,0,7,0,0,4

								    (HUGE RANT ALERT, SKIP THIS [paragraph?] TO GET WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR)I have had this game from the moment it was put on steam.  Please steam, take this pathetic piece of **** off the market. It is a ♥♥♥♥ing iphone game for PC (20$ when I bought it). Litterally. You have to wait hours for buildings to build, those buildings produce belief which is required to build more buildings. There is no purpose to this game nor is it remotley fun. You hunt the hell out of some chests to build a ""better"" house, but you can't upgrade your previous 300 houses to the better house. So you end up just covering Saudi Arabia before it became a desert with ugly♥♥♥♥♥tents, then right next to it you have 40 story masions with massive statues celebrating how great a god you are. Very Social Class. Much disapoint. pathetic path finding. Get godus for free on iOS and play the same game. (might be 2.99$ now, I got it free and played the same game.) This game is pathetic, has no purpose. Your godly powers include- shaping the land, shaping the land for another 3 hours, logging in every day in 4 hour intervals to collect belief to shape the land more. Oh and when you don't want to wait hours for your pathetic slobs to build a 400 ft. statue of you, instead buy their second currency to Clash Of Clans rush that B. Its basically a f2p game that your pay to for. It says I have 3.9 hours, in reality I have actually clocked in 17.3 hours. (Steam gets weird with stats on your new computer :/ )    Its an iPhone game on steam. If you want to play it, download it on your phone. Its cheaper, and seems more optimized. It contains all of the same features. I have played 17.3 hours of this game, you could consider me a Gamma Tester, (Pre-Alpha Alpha) It has been the same pathetic trash since it started with no real features added. Just aesthetics and bug fixes.                                                                             GamePlay   Wait hours for your buildings to build, buy the currency with US dollar to rush your little scrubs. Spend 4/5 of the game shaping the land for your people and the other 1/5 shaping more for this game's pathfinding. Experince why clash of clans isn't on steam. Chest hunter simulator, spend more then your willing to constantly shape the land to find chest containing cards that you can buy with US dollars. Then use those cards to unlock another card that unlocks better buildings that you can't use until you shape the land more.                                                                                 The GoodGives you plenty of time to masturbate while your steam friends think that your playing a single player game. Looks nice under steam's uninstalled list. Has steam workshop that completely screws the game into a playable experince.  Cheaper and better on iOS market.                                                                               The BadEverything. The game itself. Pathfinding. No objective in the game. Not fun. Costs money to play. Not unique.  Will never come out of testing stage. Chest hunting. Wait for belief to be produced. Every update start over your entire world. Is an iPhone game for PC. ",132,15,0,13,25,0,18

My husband has tried everything, being the computer tech that he is, and says there is nothing more that can be done.  So....................Since I do not cuss and use bad language, I just want to tell you to take this game and shove it!!  Enough is enough....I am not starting all over for the 4th time and losing everything again!  Maybe you guys need to start taking care of bugs instead of updating and expanding the game!

								I really enjoyed this game at first. It was quirky, relaxing, and basically a satisfying God game for the modern PC era.Then, after one of the beta updates, it tanked.Idk, maybe it was angry that I'm a Mac user and wanted to sing the praises of Windows machines. Then again, maybe it crashes the same on those as well. In any case, when it became apparent that no amount of ""hotfixes"" and ""patches"" (however few and far between they were) could salvage the perpetual crashing, I realized that what I was looking at here was ABANDONWARE. If you enjoy the sensation of paying for a fun little game only for it to be ripped out of your hands and your money thrown into a cyberspace void, by all means go for it. Go for Godus Wars, as well. How long before the devs give up on that one?			",50,16,0,9,25,0,7

								Ranting raving review ahead: I'd given this game the benefit of the doubt from day one, thinking that it's still in early access and they're still developing ideas and so on.. But every single update breaks the game more and more. It has become more a mobile idle game that you should not ever turn off for fear of having everything go wrong and being unable to progress any further in the game.  E.G. At the time of writing this every time I open the game up and lose villagers because I closed the game and they got cranky. Which then meant I had hours and hours of wait times pop up and had no villagers to do anything with. I tried Godus, I really tried to stick with you, but every update introduces more mechanics and changes ones that were fantastic for a PC game. Pick a port, PC or mobile and develop it for one, because in trying to develop for both, its broken and will forever be broken. /Rant over.			",139,113,0,24,27,3,9

Although the landscape is interesting that is about the only thing this game has going for it. If you insist on buying this game wait for it to be released on mobile, as all current indications from development appear to be ment for mobile and may be more fun on a phone. As a computer game this is currently a turd and I have been bit by the two big early access turds (Townz and Godus), it won't happen again. I will also add that if this game doesn't become more appealing to play on my computer, that I will not be buying anymore games from 22cans or Peter wtf his name is.			",9,1,1,4,23,0,12

								An example of bad early access. Other projects are being worked on before this is finished and the team has reduced a lot for this product.It actually wasn't that bad to start with but generally speaking it feels a bit like a chore. I would describe it more as a mobile game where you would maybe play it when you have a few minutes waiting around with not much else to do.Generally speaking you can flattern the land, ""inspire"" the people to expand, convert another group (which generally means take forever to deal with them or just wipe them out with god powers) and generally some minor things which are more like keeping the game going rather than having nothing to do constantly.It likely could have been decent but most of the promises seem to be broken or flat out lied about. The game fits a mobile area better where you can pull off timers more since their isn't really enough content. It feels like a mobile ported game which honestly is very rare to have done decently.I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this game for the asking price. Maybe if it was on deal for 90% off and you were ok with the idea of it having little life but even then I would question why you would spend so much. Most of my game time was basically behind timers and while I might have had a little fun it will likely never be finished.			",336,87,7,65,60,4,83

It's just another way to have their ""pay to win"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ without being upfront about it, which is worse!But the crowning glory of crap on this, is that with Molyneux's experience in making decent games, he's ended up as another George Lucas! If you want a good sim, and you want one made by him, look at populus, do not get this.			",193,18,5,38,61,3,57

								Game is terribly un-fun.  I loved populous, Black & White, SIMS, Sim City, etc.  I want to be able to play this game without the interface and the mechanics driving me to stop playing while I wait on timers only to wake up to find that events occurred while I was asleep to make me repeatedly lose followers.  It's an unending grind just to get basic things to function (like building up your followers abodes by flattening land).  It's not the flattening of land that's the grind, it's the waiting to get resources to allow you to sculpt.  You CAN get resources by murdering your followers, but that doesn't make this a god game, it makes this a horrible game.  I want to be a good guy and city-craft and win over my opponents with benevolence.  Not sacrifice my own followers and burn down my enemies.  The essence of the god-game genre should be based on this choice; and there is no choice.  You just wait forever and watch bad things happen to you or turn evil.			",40,4,0,4,2,1,1

								the 2.2 update i find unplayable for one simple reason- it started playing a VOICEOVER of absolute crap nonsense when i opened it the first time. and then YET AGAIN the unskippable tutorial crap. the tutorial by itself is enough to make me want to uninstall, the voiceover made me want to stab the idiot who was responsible for adding an unmuteable voiceover. to make matters worse... if you acctually keep playing, there is a POP-UP in the corner to bug you to spend gems (microtransaction currency) to make your game easier. this is a very unpleasant and unfun game interface, and it is WORSE than earlier versions of the game were.

								It's been in development for some time, and they've added a lot of features,but they haven't added ""fun"" yet. This seems like a great studio, but this game either needs to be scrapped, or completely revamped.			",178,38,2,20,36,4,27

								Land needs to be flattened in order for your followers to build houses. There is utterly no point in having differing levels of land as it simply limits the number of houses that can be built. So you spend all of your saved belief flattening the land (which is eye-gouging-ly boring) so more houses can be built and you get more belief.....so you can flatten more land and build more houses etc etc...ad-infinitum.Discovering chests is a neat idea but the rewards are mostly things you need to expand the amount of land that's 'yours'...so you can flatten it so more houses can be built...The real problem is you don't actually feel very God-like at all. The ability to move land around feels like an unecessary gimmick rather than a core mechanic. Your followers will all act in the same way regardless of how they are treated. Like faithful puppy dogs they will rebuild a house you've just torn to the ground and carry on as if nothing has happened. Your actions have no consequence, which is a terrible indictment for a game purporting to allow you to be a God. ",92,23,15,6,16,1,23
