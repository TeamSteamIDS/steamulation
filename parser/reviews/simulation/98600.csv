												This game is surprisingly linear and constraining for a game about destruction. The limited amount of resources and a timer really don't give you much to work with aside from figuring out the optimal route and sticking to it every playtrough. This is essentially a prettier looking flash game (and not by much). 3/10			",763,347,18,119,94,13,143

												Demolition, Inc. is a unique real-time strategy that's based on causing complete destruction by using your limited resources or, more accurately, your ol' bag of tricks. You see, you're an alien tasked with levelizing cities and the most efficient way of accomplishing your mission is by sabotaging the everyday life of earthlings. That means laying down oil splates on pavements, placing destructive cows to set off chain reactions and various other tools of chaos. It's fun, challenging and beautiful to look at. Demolition, Inc. will provide you with some quick strategic fun!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												I bought Demolition Inc. on sale after seeing the trailer. It looked like a fun puzzle blow up so I gave it a shot.What I really liked about the game is the variety you use to destroy what you need to destroy. The goal of the game is to bring down all the buildings in the area and to raise green areas. How you do it though is up to you and the resources you got to do it. What's exceptional to me about video games is the ability to have ENTIRE control (so when I play RTS I want to be able a single unit from FPS stand point or RTS). Demolition INC sort of let's you do that as you can manually control a few cars. The physics engine while jumping a car off a ramp then slamming into 3 buildings while hitting a propane tank is quite fun.Would I recommend this game as something extremely worth playing? Depends on what you like. If it's on sale I would say buy it for sure.RATING : 6.9/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												This is probably the only good indie puzzle game ever made. A puzzler that doesn't get too obnoxious with ""perfect solutions"", it's nice and freeform and you get to blow things up in an indirect fashion. The music is cool too, kinda like Burn Zombie Burn. Contains a reworked version of Blur's Song #2 that's better than the original if for no other reason than it wasn't pimped to car commercials.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												This is an alright game.Nice and simple way of playing it yet makes you think on how best to employ the best strategy to level the buildings with the tools at your disposal and from what you can find around the level itself.Pretty toonish design of the game adds to the charm of it along with some pretty neat tools to deploy to help destroy the city in as creative a way as possible and makes you consider on where to place said tools for maximum efficency.  Though I do question the physics of the game slightly.  I played one level and crashed 3 cars into a building that was already damaged, yet the building stood firm and defiant and that cost me the level.  Plus having to retry can cause some previous effects from your last try to still be in play and not reset properly after, resulting in the army coming for you straight away.Also I have  been having crashing issues here and there with the game, so beware of that.Music though, quite catchy, pretty good and suits the game very well.As I look at the price currently, it stands at £4.79.  Its a push, but yes its a fair price for it, though get it on sale if possible.  Its a fine game, could be better with more polish and attention, but its workable and it will eat time like no other as you try and find solutions to destroy the target city, so thats a good thing going for it for sure.  Pick it up if you want to try something a bit different thats cheap and a good time killer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Way too few content. Fun gameplay gets repetitive and more puzzle-like pretty quickly. The weapons provided aren't really interesting or innovative. On the other hand, it's practically bug-free, engine runs smooth, controls are great and overall the GUIand HUD are very clear. Still doesn't compensate for the lack of content, though. If you can, grab it in a sale or a bundle.			",1953,538,92,178,179,15,191

												This is actually kind of fun. You control an alien tasked with destroying cities, with limited resources. So you place an oil slick here, and explosive there, let a car skid out through this intersection causing that van to smash into that wall and rebound hitting the explosive which knocks over this building which destroys an entire city block.It's like a complicated setup of dominoes, only with more wanton destruction and physics.

												What an interesting indy game. I was hoping that this would be something like the old game Blastcorps on the N64 back in the day. It isn't really anything like it, but thats ok. This game forges its own frontier and it does it pretty damn well. Hardware enabled Physics, some fun indy humor, and funny/cute grpahics turn this indy puzzle game into a winner in my book. It isn't very expensive either! If you like puzzles, and you have a decent graphics card, this game is amusing and enjoyable.

												Do you like to destroy stuff ? Well, look no further. Demolition Inc. is your game. Your mission is to destroy all buildings using several power-ups that range from slippery goo to earthquake bombs. It looks a bit simple, but it's good fun, believe me ! And the destruction looks cool. I'd say there are about 13 missions in total. Some missions seem impossible but you just have to figure out how to use the power-ups properly. It can be a bit frustrating at times. And the game itself is a bit short; it will take most of you about 4 hours to complete it.Fun game nonetheless ![Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I bought Demolition Inc. awhile back on sale for about $2. It has its moments, but as a proper PC title, it lacks imagination and playability. You are constantly limited in regards to the timer, allocated 'weapons/tools', as well as environmental props. Essentially, you need to use the vehicles that are driving around the allocated areas to force them to destroy buildings. This sounds fun, but it fails on a technical level. The limitations set by the devlopers decreases game longevity as there's no point in returning to the game.  In addition, the game areas need to be larger and have more happening. Instead of relying mostly on the vehicles, there should be other items, tools, props, as well as other objectives to use and/or complete. I like to support independent companies, but I only recommend this game if it is on sale.I hope that with the income raised the developers can create a sequel or another title, which will perfect an already decent idea.4.5/10.

												Yay, it's a game where you make cars explode into things! Except you have a hard time gettings things to explode because the items you use to make things explode are finicky and the traps you set up sometimes go awry. And it's almost never the fun kind of awry unless you plan for it. So you have to sit there and ♥♥♥♥ing fight with the unintuitive controls and items in order to get your fun explosions.

												Tries its absolute hardest to be Blast Corps (N64), yet comes short by a terrible camera, buggy-feeling controls, and horrid driving controls. All in all lacks any sense of purpose and leaves an overall dry taste in the mouth, and gives no sign of any manner of production value, as the entire game feels like it's more than a decade late. An hour or so of fun (and some aggravation) isn't really terrible for 2,50, though the music can get really grating really fast, that, and i'd rather spend the sum on a tasty fast food or a snack than this, it'll last you longer and doesn't bring any frustration.

												Cheap, but like another reviewer said it's better suited for a phone or tablet. It's a vandalism simulator that allows you to fulfill all your misanthropic environmentalist fantasies by causing cars, cows, and other things to crash into buildings and explode.

If not well the review will get worse.UPDATE:I got an alienware 14 and this game does play on it it is fun can get tricky at times though definately a keeper.			",212,98,2,25,25,0,29

												This is a quirky and fun destruction game, featuring some nicely built cities for you to destroy. Your arsenal includes everything from pads which launch cars into the air, exploding cows, to earth-quakes. If you've got $10 and a couple of afternoons to kill, this is a great way to do it. Only two downsides; the cities start to look very similiar after a while, and it's far too short. Enjoy :)			",138,55,0,29,11,0,23

												This is a nice fairly casual little game. You are an alien and have to destroy cities with items such as oil slicks and exploding cows. Generally your resources are quite limited so it more puzzly than anarchic destruction. It is fun but quite short. The expansion pack adds more levels and weapons. The puzzles in the expansion pack are more satisfying in my opinion. You can also create your own levels and download other peoples levels which are as variable as you would expect from user generated content. This is probably one to pick up when it is on sale cheap.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												If youre looking to kill an afternoon you've found the bullets. This game is so much fun and from the trailer on the steam page i knew it was worth the few dollars. Load up and get ready to blow buildings down in the most creative manor you never knew you could do.			",123,7,4,8,4,0,6

												There's a method to the madness that is Demolition Inc.  You have to use strategy to properly orchestrate the mayhem that you are called upon to inflict upon the cities in this game, using everything from oil slicks, glue, magnets, and exploding cows - yes, exploding cows! - to bring down the house.  And user-created levels provide additional challenge and value to an already fun game.  This one is a definite must-have!			",27,16,4,4,38,3,8
